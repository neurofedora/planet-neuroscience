	<p>Background: Some clinical studies have indicated that neutral and happy music may relieve state anxiety. However, the brain mechanisms by which these effective interventions in music impact state anxiety remain unknown. Methods: In this study, we selected music with clinical effects for therapy, and 62 subjects were included using the evoked anxiety paradigm. After evoking anxiety with a visual stimulus, all subjects were randomly divided into three groups (listening to happy music, neutral music and a blank stimulus), and EEG signals were acquired. Results: We found that different emotional types of music might have different mechanisms in state anxiety interventions. Neutral music had the effect of alleviating state anxiety. The brain mechanisms supported that neutral music ameliorating state anxiety was associated with decreased power spectral density of the occipital lobe and increased brain functional connectivity between the occipital lobe and frontal lobe. Happy music also had the effect of alleviating state anxiety, and the brain mechanism was associated with enhanced brain functional connectivity between the occipital lobe and right temporal lobe. Conclusions: This study may be important for a deep understanding of the mechanisms associated with state anxiety music interventions and may further contribute to future clinical treatment using nonpharmaceutical interventions.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to understand the impact of sex on the neurocognitive function of patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Ninety-four participants with idiopathic PD and 167 age-matched healthy individuals as normal controls (NCs) were recruited and underwent comprehensive neuropsychological assessments. Sex differences were found in NCs, but not in patients with PD. Among male participants, patients with PD showed worse performance on the Digit Symbol Substitution (DSS) (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) test and Symbol Search (SS) (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) than NCs. Among female participants, patients with PD showed worse performance on the category score of the Modified Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), SS (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and pentagon copying (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) than NCs. After controlling for the effects of age and years of education, Hoehn and Yahr stage was found to predict the performance of the Color Trails Test part A (βA = 0.241, pA = 0.036), Stroop Color and Word Test (β = −0.245, p = 0.036), and DSS (β = −0.258, p = 0.035) in men with PD. These results indicate the differential effect of sex on the neurocognitive function among healthy aging and PD populations. The disappearance of sex differences, which is present in healthy aging, in patients with PD suggests a gradual loss of the neuroprotective effect of estrogen after the initiation of the neurodegenerative process. This study also found mental flexibility and visuospatial function to be the susceptible cognitive domains in women with PD, while the disease severity could predict the working memory and processing speed in men with PD.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Results from item-method directed forgetting suggest that individuals are able to intentionally forget processed information. Most research suggests that either selective rehearsal of to-be-remembered or inhibitory control of to-be-forgotten information is accountable for the effects of intentional forgetting. Some research, however, hypothesized that the time to process information mediates the underlying mechanism. To test this hypothesis, the current study investigated associations between oscillatory power in theta (3&ndash;7.5 Hz) and alpha frequencies (8&ndash;13 Hz) and intentional forgetting in human participants and explored whether or not these mechanisms depended on processing time. Previously, theta power was shown to be associated with the creation of episodic memory traces and alpha power with inhibition. We therefore expected to find associations between these neural signatures and behavioral effects. Consistent with our hypotheses, we revealed increased theta power for to-be-remembered and increased alpha power for to-be-forgotten information and that the effects of activity in both frequency bands were influenced by the time individuals were given for processing the memory cue. These results suggest that not one but two mechanisms, rehearsal and inhibitory control, are accountable for item-method directed forgetting, both with different temporal profiles.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Human infants who suffer from intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), which is a failure to attain their genetically predetermined weight, are at increased risk for postnatal learning and memory deficits. Hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) granule neurons play an important role in memory formation; however, it is unknown whether IUGR affects embryonic DG neurogenesis, which could provide a potential mechanism underlying abnormal postnatal learning and memory function. Using a mouse model of the most common cause of IUGR, induced by hypertensive disease of pregnancy, we first assessed adult learning and memory function. We quantified the percentages of embryonic hippocampal DG neural stem cells (NSCs) and progenitor cells and developing glutamatergic granule neurons, as well as hippocampal volumes and neuron cell count and morphology 18 and 40 d after delivery. We characterized the differential embryonic hippocampal transcriptomic pathways between appropriately grown and IUGR mouse offspring. We found that IUGR offspring of both sexes had short-term adult learning and memory deficits. Prenatally, we found that IUGR caused accelerated embryonic DG neurogenesis and Sox2<sup>+</sup> neural stem cell depletion. IUGR mice were marked by decreased hippocampal volumes and decreased doublecortin<sup>+</sup> neuronal progenitors with increased mean dendritic lengths at postnatal day 18. Consistent with its known molecular role in embryonic DG neurogenesis, we also found evidence for decreased Wnt pathway activity during IUGR. In conclusion, we have discovered that postnatal memory deficits are associated with accelerated NSC differentiation and maturation into glutamatergic granule neurons following IUGR, a phenotype that could be explained by decreased embryonic Wnt signaling.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Relapse is a major challenge to the treatment of substance use disorders. A progressive increase in cue-induced drug craving, termed incubation of craving, is observed after withdrawal from multiple drugs of abuse in humans and rodents. Incubation of cocaine craving involves the strengthening of excitatory synapses onto nucleus accumbens (NAc) medium spiny neurons via postsynaptic accumulation of high-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPA receptors. This enhances reactivity to drug-associated cues and is required for the expression of incubation. Additionally, incubation of cocaine craving is associated with loss of the synaptic depression normally triggered by stimulation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5), leading to endocannabinoid production, and expressed presynaptically via cannabinoid receptor 1 activation. Previous studies have found alterations in mGlu5 and Homer proteins associated with the loss of this synaptic depression. Here we conducted coimmunoprecipitation studies to investigate associations of diacylglycerol lipase-&alpha; (DGL), which catalyzes formation of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG), with mGlu5 and Homer proteins. Although these interactions were unchanged in the NAc core at incubation-relevant withdrawal times, the association of DGL with total and phosphorylated Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II&alpha; (CaMKII&alpha;) and CaMKII&beta; was increased. This would be predicted, based on other studies, to inhibit DGL activity and therefore 2-AG production. This was confirmed by measuring DGL enzymatic activity. However, the magnitude of DGL inhibition did not correlate with the magnitude of incubation of craving for individual rats. These results suggest that CaMKII contributes to the loss of mGlu5-dependent synaptic depression after incubation, but the functional significance of this loss remains unclear.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Perceptual Fading of a Stabilized Cortical Image: Replication in the Undergraduate Classroom</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Prolonged exposure to a stimulus causes desensitization of cortical neurons and results in perceptual changes. One example of this phenomenon is contrast adaptation, in which perceived differences between light and dark regions of a stimulus decrease. Blakemore, Muncey, and Ridley reported evidence for the "perceptual fading of a stabilized cortical image" in a 1971 <I>Nature</I> paper. Our goal was to replicate their second experiment, in which adaptation was measured across many contrasts, and develop an active learning exercise for undergraduate students. The experiment was coded using an open-source python package and psychophysical data were collected from two observers. On each trial, a sinusoidally modulated luminance grating appeared above fixation, and the task of the observer was to adjust the contrast of a grating below fixation until the two appeared identical. Between trials in the adaptation condition, a high contrast grating was presented in the top location; no such grating appeared between trials in the control condition. Contrast matches showed a clear reduction during the adaptation condition, thus demonstrating perceptual fading and a successful replication of <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B1">Blakemore et al. (1971)</cross-ref>. We then simplified the approach and modified the code to create a single, seamless experience for use in the classroom. With instructions and theoretical background provided in a one-page handout, students can perform the experiment on themselves and view their results in an automatically generated figure. This exercise, a primary example of active learning, will help students gain a first-hand understanding of the perceptual effects of adaptation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">High Behavioral Variability Mediated by Altered Neuronal Excitability in auts2 Mutant Zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by abnormal behavioral traits arising from neural circuit dysfunction. While a number of genes have been implicated in ASDs, in most cases, a clear understanding of how mutations in these genes lead to circuit dysfunction and behavioral abnormality is absent. The <I>autism susceptibility candidate 2</I> (<I>AUTS2</I>) gene is one such gene, associated with ASDs, intellectual disability and a range of other neurodevelopmental conditions. However, the role of AUTS2 in neural development and circuit function is not at all known. Here, we undertook functional analysis of Auts2a, the main homolog of AUTS2 in zebrafish, in the context of the escape behavior. Escape behavior in wild-type zebrafish is critical for survival and is therefore, reliable, rapid, and has well-defined kinematic properties. <I>auts2a</I> mutant zebrafish are viable, have normal gross morphology and can generate escape behavior with normal kinematics. However, the behavior is unreliable and delayed, with high trial-to-trial variability in the latency. Using calcium imaging we probed the activity of Mauthner neurons during otic vesicle (OV) stimulation and observed lower probability of activation and reduced calcium transients in the mutants. With direct activation of Mauthner by antidromic stimulation, the threshold for activation in mutants was higher than that in wild-type, even when inhibition was blocked. Taken together, these results point to reduced excitability of Mauthner neurons in <I>auts2a</I> mutant larvae leading to unreliable escape responses. Our results show a novel role for Auts2a in regulating neural excitability and reliability of behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">HFOApp: A MATLAB Graphical User Interface for High-Frequency Oscillation Marking</a></h4>

              
                <p>Epilepsy affects 3.4 million people in the United States, and, despite the availability of numerous antiepileptic drugs, 36% of patients have uncontrollable seizures, which severely impact quality of life. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a potential biomarker of epileptogenic tissue that could be useful in surgical planning. As a result, research into the efficacy of HFOs as a clinical tool has increased over the last 2 decades. However, detection and identification of these transient rhythms in intracranial electroencephalographic recordings remain time-consuming and challenging. Although automated detection algorithms have been developed, their results are widely inconsistent, reducing reliability. Thus, manual marking of HFOs remains the gold standard, and manual review of automated results is required. However, manual marking and review are time consuming and can still produce variable results because of their subjective nature and the limitations in functionality of existing open-source software. Our goal was to develop a new software with broad application that improves on existing open-source HFO detection applications in usability, speed, and accuracy. Here, we present HFOApp: a free, open-source, easy-to-use MATLAB-based graphical user interface for HFO marking. This toolbox offers a high degree of intuitive and ergonomic usability and integrates interactive automation-assist options with manual marking, significantly reducing the time needed for review and manual marking of recordings, while increasing inter-rater reliability. The toolbox also features simultaneous multichannel detection and marking. HFOApp was designed as an easy-to-use toolbox for clinicians and researchers to quickly and accurately mark, quantify, and characterize HFOs within electrophysiological datasets.</p>

During this WFH period, some employees encountered health issues related to sprains and neck or back pain owing to poor working conditions at home. As the WFH trend may continue over a prolonged period, the underlying causes and solutions to ergonomic issues must be addressed to reduce injuries. This study aims to identify the ergonomic issues encountered when working from home and suggests several solutions to minimise these issues.  Methods: A qualitative ethnographic methodology was adopted. This study used focus group discussion and the panellists were among experts from the fields of higher education, healthcare, human resources (HR), and ergonomics patient in Malaysia.  The most common ergonomic issues identified were based on diagnoses and observations in previous studies.  Results: The panellists agreed on ergonomics issues, comprising the use of unergonomic chairs, incorrect sitting postures, irregular arrangement of key objects, improper reach distances of the laptop/keyboard/mouse, poor desk designs, footrest absence, distortion/noise, poor lighting, and poor work environment. Over time, WFH ergonomics issues may lead to burnout, carpal tunnel syndrome or other cumulative trauma disorders, high blood pressure, and stress on the cervical spine and neck. The proposed solutions include a complete WFH ergonomics and wellness checklist for employees and employers, webinar sessions on WFH ergonomics, meet-up sessions with ergonomics or HR experts, workspace rentals for co-workers, implementation of the 20-20-20 rule and job-sharing practices, and the involvement of employers or the government in procuring ergonomic equipment for WFH employees.  Conclusions: This is a preliminary study and the researchers are exploring the root causes of WFH ergonomics issues and proposed solutions. While previous studies have examined workplace ergonomics, this study focuses on WFH ergonomic issues and solutions during the ongoing pandemic.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Japanese sound-symbolic words in global contexts: from translation to hybridization [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This paper explores the global reception and development of the artistic expression of onomatopoeia and mimetic words in modern and contemporary Japanese literary texts adopting the method of comparative literature. By analyzing sound-symbolic words and their translations in modern Japanese poetry and contemporary comics, the intercultural dialogues of these texts are examined and the emergence of hybrid onomatopoeia in global comic works is illuminated. The Japanese language is often noted for its richness of sound-symbolic words. In the literary world, modern poetry adopted and elaborated the use of these words from the late 19th century in its quest for a new style of poetry. In the early 20th century, poets developed the artistic expression of sound-symbolic words and succeeded in giving musicality to the “new-style poem”. However, the translation of Japanese sound-symbolic words has always been problematic. Experimental uses of these words in modern poems were often untranslatable, making the translations incomprehensible or dull. Nevertheless, graphic narratives and their worldwide distribution changed that situation. Japanese comics (manga) has particularly developed the artistic expression of sound-symbolic words. Usually placed outside speech balloons, these words are elaborately depicted and are important elements of the panel/page layout. Notably, the global popularity of the genre developed a new phase of intercultural dialogue. As not every word has an equivalent or is translatable in the target language, translators have left sound-symbolic words untouched in the translated versions, putting translation aside. Thus, the combination of Japanese and the target language seems to influence the visual comprehension of sound effects among the readers. Through the examinations of some cases, this paper brings to light the emergence of some hybrid onomatopoeia and reveals that the “Third Space” formed by the translation and hybridization of manga is a dynamic field that creates a new culture.

                Background: : Rugby league involves repeated, complex, and high intensity change-of-direction (COD) movements with no existing test protocols that specifically assesses these multiple physical fitness components simultaneously. Thus, the current study examined the convergent validity of a repeated Illinois Agility (RIA) protocol with the repeated T-agility protocol, and the repeatability of the RIA protocol in adolescent Rugby League players. Furthermore, aerobic capacity and anaerobic and COD performance were assessed to determine whether these physical qualities were important contributors to the RIA protocol. Methods: Twenty-two junior Rugby League players completed 4 sessions with each separated by 7 days. Initially, physical fitness characteristics at baseline (i.e., Beep test,, countermovement jump, 30-m sprint, single-effort COD and repeated sprint ability [RSA]) were assessed. The second session involved a familiarisation of RIA and repeated T-agility test (RTT) protocols. During the third and fourth sessions, participants completed the RIA and RTT protocols in a randomised, counterbalanced design to examine the validity and test-retest reliability of these protocols. Results: For convergent validity, significant correlations were identified between RIA and RTT performances (r= >0.80; p<0.05). For contributors to RIA performance, significant correlations were identified between all baseline fitness characteristics and RIA (r = >0.71; p < 0.05). Reliability of the RIA protocol was near perfect with excellent intra-class correlation coefficient (0.87-0.97), good ratio limits of agreement (×/÷ 1.05-1.06) and low coefficient of variations (1.8-2.0%). Conclusions: The current study has demonstrated the RIA to be a simple, valid and reliable field test for RL athletes that can provide coaches with information about their team’s ability to sustain high intensity, multi-directional running efforts.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Applying machine learning EEG signal classification to emotion‑related brain anticipatory activity [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Machine learning approaches have been fruitfully applied to several neurophysiological signal classification problems. Considering the relevance of emotion in human cognition and behaviour, an important application of machine learning has been found in the field of emotion identification based on neurophysiological activity. Nonetheless, there is high variability in results in the literature depending on the neuronal activity measurement, the signal features and the classifier type. The present work aims to provide new methodological insight into machine learning applied to emotion identification based on electrophysiological brain activity. For this reason, we analysed previously recorded EEG activity measured while emotional stimuli, high and low arousal (auditory and visual) were provided to a group of healthy participants. Our target signal to classify was the pre-stimulus onset brain activity. Classification performance of three different classifiers (LDA, SVM and kNN) was compared using both spectral and temporal features. Furthermore, we also contrasted the performance of static and dynamic (time evolving) approaches. The best static feature-classifier combination was the SVM with spectral features (51.8%), followed by LDA with spectral features (51.4%) and kNN with temporal features (51%). The best dynamic feature‑classifier combination was the SVM with temporal features (63.8%), followed by kNN with temporal features (63.70%) and LDA with temporal features (63.68%). The results show a clear increase in classification accuracy with temporal dynamic features.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Pulsed low-energy stimulation initiates electric turbulence in cardiac tissue</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rupamanjari Majumder, Sayedeh Hussaini, Vladimir S. Zykov, Stefan Luther, Eberhard Bodenschatz</p>

Interruptions in nonlinear wave propagation, commonly referred to as wave breaks, are typical of many complex excitable systems. In the heart they lead to lethal rhythm disorders, the so-called arrhythmias, which are one of the main causes of sudden death in the industrialized world. Progress in the treatment and therapy of cardiac arrhythmias requires a detailed understanding of the triggers and dynamics of these wave breaks. In particular, two very important questions are: 1) What determines the potential of a wave break to initiate re-entry? and 2) How do these breaks evolve such that the system is able to maintain spatiotemporally chaotic electrical activity? Here we approach these questions numerically using optogenetics in an <i>in silico</i> model of human atrial tissue that has undergone chronic atrial fibrillation (cAF) remodelling. In the lesser studied sub-threshold illumination régime, we discover a new mechanism of wave break initiation in cardiac tissue that occurs for gentle slopes of the restitution characteristics. This mechanism involves the creation of conduction blocks through a combination of wavefront-waveback interaction, reshaping of the wave profile and heterogeneous recovery from the excitation of the spatially extended medium, leading to the creation of re-excitable windows for sustained re-entry. This finding is an important contribution to cardiac arrhythmia research as it identifies scenarios in which low-energy perturbations to cardiac rhythm can be potentially life-threatening.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Engineering gene overlaps to sustain genetic constructs in vivo</a></h4>

Evolution is often an obstacle to the engineering of stable biological systems due to the selection of mutations inactivating costly gene circuits. Gene overlaps induce important constraints on sequences and their evolution. We show that these constraints can be harnessed to increase the stability of costly genes by purging loss-of-function mutations. We combine computational and synthetic biology approaches to rationally design an overlapping reading frame expressing an essential gene within an existing gene to protect. Our algorithm succeeded in creating overlapping reading frames in 80% of <i>E. coli</i> genes. Experimentally, scoring mutations in both genes of such overlapping construct, we found that a significant fraction of mutations impacting the gene to protect have a deleterious effect on the essential gene. Such an overlap thus protects a costly gene from removal by natural selection by associating the benefit of this removal with a larger or even lethal cost. In our synthetic constructs, the overlap converts many of the possible mutants into evolutionary dead-ends, reducing the evolutionary potential of the system and thus increasing its stability over time.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Segmentation-Less, Automated, Vascular Vectorization</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Samuel A. Mihelic, William A. Sikora, Ahmed M. Hassan, Michael R. Williamson, Theresa A. Jones, Andrew K. Dunn</p>

Recent advances in two-photon fluorescence microscopy (2PM) have allowed large scale imaging and analysis of blood vessel networks in living mice. However, extracting network graphs and vector representations for the dense capillary bed remains a bottleneck in many applications. Vascular vectorization is algorithmically difficult because blood vessels have many shapes and sizes, the samples are often unevenly illuminated, and large image volumes are required to achieve good statistical power. State-of-the-art, three-dimensional, vascular vectorization approaches often require a segmented (binary) image, relying on manual or supervised-machine annotation. Therefore, voxel-by-voxel image segmentation is biased by the human annotator or trainer. Furthermore, segmented images oftentimes require remedial morphological filtering before skeletonization or vectorization. To address these limitations, we present a vectorization method to extract vascular objects directly from unsegmented images without the need for machine learning or training. The Segmentation-Less, Automated, Vascular Vectorization (SLAVV) source code in MATLAB is openly available on GitHub. This novel method uses simple models of vascular anatomy, efficient linear filtering, and vector extraction algorithms to remove the image segmentation requirement, replacing it with manual or automated vector classification. Semi-automated SLAVV is demonstrated on three in vivo 2PM image volumes of microvascular networks (capillaries, arterioles and venules) in the mouse cortex. Vectorization performance is proven robust to the choice of plasma- or endothelial-labeled contrast, and processing costs are shown to scale with input image volume. Fully-automated SLAVV performance is evaluated on simulated 2PM images of varying quality all based on the large (1.4×0.9×0.6 mm<sup>3</sup> and 1.6×10<sup>8</sup> voxel) input image. Vascular statistics of interest (e.g. volume fraction, surface area density) calculated from automatically vectorized images show greater robustness to image quality than those calculated from intensity-thresholded images.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Tracking calcium dynamics from individual neurons in behaving animals</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Thibault Lagache, Alison Hanson, Jesús E. Pérez-Ortega, Adrienne Fairhall, Rafael Yuste</p>

Measuring the activity of neuronal populations with calcium imaging can capture emergent functional properties of neuronal circuits with single cell resolution. However, the motion of freely behaving animals, together with the intermittent detectability of calcium sensors, can hinder automatic monitoring of neuronal activity and their subsequent functional characterization. We report the development and open-source implementation of a multi-step cellular tracking algorithm (Elastic Motion Correction and Concatenation or EMC<sup>2</sup>) that compensates for the intermittent disappearance of moving neurons by integrating local deformation information from detectable neurons. We demonstrate the accuracy and versatility of our algorithm using calcium imaging data from two-photon volumetric microscopy in visual cortex of awake mice, and from confocal microscopy in behaving <i>Hydra</i>, which experiences major body deformation during its contractions. We quantify the performance of our algorithm using ground truth manual tracking of neurons, along with synthetic time-lapse sequences, covering a wide range of particle motions and detectability parameters. As a demonstration of the utility of the algorithm, we monitor for several days calcium activity of the same neurons in layer 2/3 of mouse visual cortex <i>in vivo</i>, finding significant turnover within the active neurons across days, with only few neurons that remained active across days. Also, combining automatic tracking of single neuron activity with statistical clustering, we characterize and map neuronal ensembles in behaving <i>Hydra</i>, finding three major non-overlapping ensembles of neurons (CB, RP1 and RP2) whose activity correlates with contractions and elongations. Our results show that the EMC<sup>2</sup> algorithm can be used as a robust and versatile platform for neuronal tracking in behaving animals.

                Background: Bioinformatics is becoming an essential tool for the majority of biological and biomedical researchers. Although bioinformatics data is exploited by academic and industrial researchers, limited focus is on teaching this area to undergraduates, postgraduates and senior scientists. Many scientists are developing their own expertise without formal training and often without appreciating the source of the data they are reliant upon. Some universities do provide courses on a variety of bioinformatics resources and tools, a few also provide biocuration projects, during which students submit data to annotation resources. Methods: To assess the usefulness and enjoyability of annotation projects a survey was sent to University College London (UCL) students who have undertaken Gene Ontology biocuration projects. Results: Analysis of survey responses suggest that these projects provide students with an opportunity not only to learn about bioinformatics resources but also to improve their literature analysis, presentation and writing skills. Conclusion: Biocuration student projects provide valuable annotations as well as enabling students to develop a variety of skills relevant to their future careers. It is also hoped that, as future scientists, these students will critically assess their own manuscripts and ensure that these are written with the biocurators of the future in mind.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Satb1 expression in retinal ganglion cells of marmosets, macaques and humans</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have enabled the molecular distinction of ganglion cell populations in mammalian retinas. Here we used antibodies against the transcription factor Special AT-rich binding protein 1 (Satb1, a protein which is expressed by ON-OFF direction selective ganglion cells in mouse retina) to study Satb1 expression in the retina of marmosets (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>), macaques (<i>Macaca fascicularis</i>) and humans. In all species, Satb1 was exclusively expressed in retinal ganglion cells. The Satb1 cells made up ∼2 % of the ganglion cell population in central retina of all species, rising to a maximum ∼7% in peripheral marmoset retina. Intracellular injections in marmoset and macaque retinas revealed that most Satb1 expressing ganglion cells are widefield ganglion cells. In marmoset, Satb1 cells have a densely branching dendritic tree and included broad and narrow thorny, recursive bistratified and parasol cells, all of which showed some co-stratification with the outer or inner cholinergic amacrine cells. The recursive bistratified cells showed the strongest co-stratification but did not show extensive co-fasciculation as reported for ON-OFF direction selective cells in rabbit and rodent retinas. In macaque, Satb1 was not expressed in recursive bistratified cells, but in large sparsely branching cells. Our findings further support the idea that the expression of transcription factors in retinal ganglion cells is not conserved across Old World (human and macaque) and New World (marmoset) primates and provides a further step to link a molecular marker with specific cell types.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Medicinal properties of Morus alba for the control of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The objective of this review was to evaluate the medicinal potential of Morus alba leaves on the control of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). The research question was: what is the therapeutic potential of Morus alba leaves for the control of DM2? Methods: This systematic review was based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The included studies were extracted from Scopus, Pubmed, ScienceDirect, Scielo, and Google Scholar; January 2015 to July 2021. Key search terms were MeSH and DeCS: Morus alba, mulberry, hypoglycemic agent. The inclusion criteria were: studies in rats administered Morus alba leaf extracts; studies that included the dimensions of lipidemia and glycemia; studies that included indicators such as fasting glucose, postprandial glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, triglycerides, low-density lipoproteins, total cholesterol, and insulin resistance. Exclusion criteria: studies in which Morus alba leaves were administered with other plants; studies with other parts of the Morus alba plant; proteomic studies, cancer, duplicate studies, in vitro studies, and evaluation of included studies. All included investigations were evaluated for biases. Results: Of 253 studies found, 29 were included. The extracts of Morus alba leaves at the phytochemical level improve glucose uptake. Chlorogenic acid, isoquercitrin, and quercitrin, present in the leaves of Morus alba, have hypoglycemic properties and an ameliorating effect on diabetic nephropathy. This leaf has pharmacological effects such as glucose absorption, insulin secretion production, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent, antihyperglycemic and antihyperlipidemic activities, and obesity management. Conclusions: Morus alba leaves have pharmacological effects on DM2 that include glucose absorption, production of insulin secretion, antioxidant agent, antihyperglycemic and antihyperlipidemic activities, and obesity control. Beyond these results, there is a lack of studies on the potential and synergistic effects of Morus alba leaves' components, limiting the possibility of a more effective therapy using the plant's leaves.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Intergenerational adaptations to stress are evolutionarily conserved, stress-specific, and have deleterious trade-offs</a></h4>

              
                Despite reports of parental exposure to stress promoting physiological adaptations in progeny in diverse organisms, there remains considerable debate over the significance and evolutionary conservation of such multigenerational effects. Here, we investigate four independent models of intergenerational adaptations to stress in <i>C. elegans </i>- bacterial infection, eukaryotic infection, osmotic stress and nutrient stress - across multiple species. We found that all four intergenerational physiological adaptations are conserved in at least one other species, that they are stress-specific, and that they have deleterious trade-offs in mismatched environments. By profiling the effects of parental bacterial infection and osmotic stress exposure on progeny gene expression across species we established a core set of 587 genes that exhibited a greater than 2-fold intergenerational change in expression in response to stress in <i>C. elegans</i> and at least one other species, as well as a set of 37 highly conserved genes that exhibited a greater than 2-fold intergenerational change in expression in all four species tested. Furthermore, we provide evidence suggesting that presumed adaptive and deleterious intergenerational effects are molecularly related at the gene expression level. Lastly, we found that none of the effects we detected of these stresses on <i>C. elegans</i> F1 progeny gene expression persisted transgenerationally three generations after stress exposure. We conclude that intergenerational responses to stress play a substantial and evolutionarily conserved role in regulating animal physiology and that the vast majority of the effects of parental stress on progeny gene expression are reversible and not maintained transgenerationally.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neuropsychological evidence of multi-domain network hubs in the human thalamus</a></h4>

              
                Hubs in the human brain support behaviors that arise from brain network interactions. Previous studies have identified hub regions in the human thalamus that are connected with multiple functional networks. However, the behavioral significance of thalamic hubs has yet to be established. Our framework predicts that thalamic subregions with strong hub properties are broadly involved in functions across multiple cognitive domains. To test this prediction, we studied human patients with focal thalamic lesions in conjunction with network analyses of the human thalamocortical functional connectome. In support of our prediction, lesions to thalamic subregions with stronger hub properties were associated with widespread deficits in executive, language, and memory functions, whereas lesions to thalamic subregions with weaker hub properties were associated with more limited deficits. These results highlight how a large-scale network model can broaden our understanding of thalamic function for human cognition.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An improved fluorescent noncanonical amino acid for measuring conformational distributions using time-resolved transition metal ion FRET</a></h4>

              
                With the recent explosion in high-resolution protein structures, one of the next frontiers in biology is elucidating the mechanisms by which conformational rearrangements in proteins are regulated to meet the needs of cells under changing conditions. Rigorously measuring protein energetics and dynamics requires the development of new methods that can resolve structural heterogeneity and conformational distributions. We have previously developed steady-state transition metal ion fluorescence resonance energy transfer (tmFRET) approaches using a fluorescent noncanonical amino acid donor (Anap) and transition metal ion acceptor to probe conformational rearrangements in soluble and membrane proteins. Here, we show that the fluorescent noncanonical amino acid Acd has superior photophysical properties that extend its utility as a donor for tmFRET. Using maltose-binding protein (MBP) expressed in mammalian cells as a model system, we show that Acd is comparable to Anap in steady-state tmFRET experiments and that its long, single-exponential lifetime is better suited for probing conformational distributions using time-resolved FRET. These experiments reveal differences in heterogeneity in the apo and holo conformational states of MBP and produce accurate quantification of the distributions among apo and holo conformational states at subsaturating maltose concentrations. Our new approach using Acd for time-resolved tmFRET sets the stage for measuring the energetics of conformational rearrangements in soluble and membrane proteins in near-native conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">TAZ inhibits glucocorticoid receptor and coordinates hepatic glucose homeostasis in normal physiologic states</a></h4>

              
                The elucidation of the mechanisms whereby the liver maintains glucose homeostasis is crucial for the understanding of physiologic and pathologic states. Here, we show a novel role of hepatic transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) in the inhibition of glucocorticoid receptor (GR). TAZ is abundantly expressed in pericentral hepatocytes and its expression is markedly reduced by fasting. TAZ interacts <i>via</i> its WW domain with the ligand-binding domain of GR to limit the binding of GR to the GR response element in gluconeogenic gene promoters. Therefore, liver-specific TAZ knockout mice show increases in glucose production and blood glucose concentration. Conversely, the overexpression of TAZ in mouse liver reduces the binding of GR to gluconeogenic gene promoters and glucose production. Thus, our findings demonstrate that hepatic TAZ inhibits GR-transactivation of gluconeogenic genes and coordinates gluconeogenesis in response to physiologic fasting and feeding.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Retinoic acid signaling is directly activated in cardiomyocytes and protects mouse hearts from apoptosis after myocardial infarction</a></h4>

              
                Retinoic acid (RA) is an essential signaling molecule for cardiac development and plays a protective role in the heart after myocardial infarction (MI). In both cases, the effect of RA signaling on cardiomyocytes, the principle cell type of the heart, has been reported to be indirect. Here we have developed an inducible murine transgenic RA-reporter line using CreER<sup>T2</sup> technology that permits lineage tracing of RA-responsive cells and faithfully recapitulates endogenous RA activity in multiple organs during embryonic development. Strikingly, we have observed a direct RA response in cardiomyocytes during mid-late gestation and after MI. Ablation of RA signaling through deletion of the <i>Aldh1a1/a2/a3</i> genes encoding RA-synthesizing enzymes leads to increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis in adults subjected to MI. RNA sequencing analysis reveals <i>Tgm2</i> and <i>Ace1, </i>two genes with well-established links to cardiac repair<i>, </i>as potential targets of RA signaling in primary cardiomyocytes, thereby providing novel links between the RA pathway and heart disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evolutionary transcriptomics implicates new genes and pathways in human pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes</a></h4>

              
                Evolutionary changes in the anatomy and physiology of the female reproductive system underlie the origins and diversification of pregnancy in Eutherian ('Placental') mammals. This developmental and evolutionary history constrains normal physiological functions and biases the ways in which dysfunction contributes to reproductive trait diseases and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Here, we show that gene expression changes in the human endometrium during pregnancy are associated with the evolution of human-specific traits and pathologies of pregnancy. We found that hundreds of genes gained or lost endometrial expression in the human lineage. Among these are genes that may contribute to human-specific maternal-fetal communication (<i>HTR2B</i>) and maternal-fetal immunotolerance (<i>PDCD1LG2</i>) systems, as well as vascular remodeling and deep placental invasion (<i>CORIN</i>). These data suggest that explicit evolutionary studies of anatomical systems complement traditional methods for characterizing the genetic architecture of disease. We also anticipate our results will advance the emerging synthesis of evolution and medicine ('evolutionary medicine') and be a starting point for more sophisticated studies of the maternal-fetal interface. Furthermore, the gene expression changes we identified may contribute to the development of diagnostics and interventions for adverse pregnancy outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Duox generated reactive oxygen species activate ATR/Chk1 to induce G2 arrest in Drosophila tracheoblasts</a></h4>

              
                Progenitors of the thoracic tracheal system of adult <i>Drosophila</i> (tracheoblasts) arrest in G2 during larval life and rekindle a mitotic program subsequently. G2 arrest is dependent on ATR-dependent phosphorylation of Chk1 that is actuated in the absence of detectable DNA damage. We are interested in the mechanisms that activate ATR/Chk1 (Kizhedathu et al., 2018, 2020). Here we report that levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are high in arrested tracheoblasts and decrease upon mitotic re-entry. High ROS is dependent on expression of Duox, an H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generating-Dual Oxidase. ROS quenching by overexpression of Superoxide Dismutase 1, or by knockdown of Duox, abolishes Chk1 phosphorylation and results in precocious proliferation. Tracheae deficient in Duox, or deficient in both Duox and regulators of DNA damage-dependent ATR/Chk1 activation (ATRIP/TOPBP1/ Claspin), can induce phosphorylation of Chk1 in response to micromolar concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in minutes. The findings presented reveal that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> activates ATR/Chk1 in tracheoblasts by a non-canonical, potentially direct, mechanism.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Memory recall involves a transient break in excitatory-inhibitory balance</a></h4>

              
                The brain has a remarkable capacity to acquire and store memories that can later be selectively recalled. These processes are supported by the hippocampus which is thought to index memory recall by reinstating information stored across distributed neocortical circuits. However, the mechanism that supports this interaction remains unclear. Here, in humans, we show that recall of a visual cue from a paired associate is accompanied by a transient increase in the ratio between glutamate and GABA in visual cortex. Moreover, these excitatory-inhibitory fluctuations are predicted by activity in the hippocampus. These data suggest the hippocampus gates memory recall by indexing information stored across neocortical circuits using a disinhibitory mechanism.

                Nanocolumns are trans-synaptic structures which align presynaptic vesicles release sites and postsynaptic receptors. However, how these nano structures shape synaptic signaling remains little understood. Given the difficulty to probe submicroscopic structures experimentally, computer modelling is a usefull approach to investigate the possible functional impacts of nanocolumns. In our in silico model, as has been experimentally observed, a nanocolumn is characterized by a tight distribution of postsynaptic receptors aligned with the presynaptic vesicle release site and by the presence of trans-synaptic molecules which can modulate neurotransmitter diffusion. We found that nanocolumns can play an important role in reinforcing synaptic current mostly when the presynaptic vesicle contains a small number of neurotransmitters. We also show that synapses with and without nanocolumns could have differentiated responses to spontaneous or evoked events. Our work provides a new methodology to investigate in silico the role of the submicroscopic organization of the synapse.

                For individual neurons to function appropriately within a network that is undergoing synaptic reorganization and refinement due to developmental or experience-dependent changes in circuit activity, they must homeostatically adapt their intrinsic excitability to maintain a consistent output despite the changing levels of synaptic input. This homeostatic plasticity of excitability is particularly important for the development of sensory circuits, where subtle deficits in neuronal and circuit function cause developmental disorders including autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy. Despite the critical importance of this process for normal circuit development, the molecular mechanism by which this homeostatic control of intrinsic excitability is regulated is not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that Xenopus optic tectal neurons express distinct fast, persistent and resurgent Na+ currents. Here, we demonstrate that Xenopus optic tectal neurons express distinct fast, persistent and resurgent Na+ currents. These are regulated with developmental changes in synaptic input, and homeostatically in response to changes in visual input. We show that expression of the voltage-gated Na+ channel subtype Nav1.6 is regulated with changes in intrinsic excitability, that blocking Nav1.6 channels is sufficient to decrease intrinsic excitability. Furthermore, that upregulation of Nav1.6 expression is necessary for experience-dependent increases in Na+ currents and intrinsic excitability. Finally, by examining behaviors that rely on visual and multisensory integration, we extend these findings to show that tight regulation of Na+ channel gene expression during a critical period of tectal circuit development is required for the normal functional development of the tectal circuitry.

                Vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing (VIP) interneurons, which constitute 10-15% of the cortical inhibitory neuron population, have emerged as an important cell type for regulating excitatory cell activity based on behavioral state. VIP cells in sensory cortex are potently engaged by neuromodulatory and motor inputs during active exploratory behaviors like locomotion and whisking, which in turn promote pyramidal cell firing via disinhibition. Such state-dependent modulation of activity by VIP cells in sensory cortex has been studied widely in recent years. However, the function of VIP cells during goal-directed behavior is less well understood. It is not clear how task-related events like sensory stimuli, motor actions, or reward activate VIP cells in sensory cortex since there is often temporal overlap in the occurrence of these events. We developed a Go/NoGo whisker touch detection task which incorporates a post-stimulus delay period to separate sensory-driven activity from action- or reward-related activity during behavior. We used 2-photon calcium imaging to measure task-related signals of L2/3 VIP neurons in S1 of behaving mice. We report for the first time that VIP cells in mouse whisker S1 are activated by both whisker stimuli and goal-directed licking. Whisker- and lick-related signals were spatially organized in relation to anatomical columns in S1. Sensory responses of VIP cells were tuned to specific whiskers, whether or not they also displayed lick-related activity.

                Animals are constantly bombarded with stimuli, which presents a fundamental problem of sorting among pervasive uninformative stimuli and novel, possibly meaningful stimuli. We evaluated novelty detection behaviorally in honey bees as they position their antennae differentially in an air stream carrying familiar or novel odors. We then characterized neuronal responses to familiar and novel odors in the first synaptic integration center in the brain, the antennal lobes. We found that the neurons that exhibited stronger initial responses to the odor that was to be familiarized are the same units that later distinguish familiar and novel odors, independently of chemical identities. These units, including both projection neurons and local neurons, showed a decreased response to the familiar odor but an increased response to the novel odor. Our results suggest that the antennal lobe may assign a category of familiarity or novelty to an odor stimulus in addition to its chemical identity code. Therefore, the mechanisms for novelty detection may be present in early sensory processing, either as a result of local synaptic interaction or via feedback from higher brain centers.

                In todays world, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons Disease, Huntingtons Disease as well as brain cancers such as astrocytomas, ependymomas, glioblastomas have become a great threat to us. In this study, we are trying to find a probable molecular connection associated with two very much different diseases, Glioblastoma, also known as Glioblastoma Multiforme (cancers of microglial cells of our brain) and Parkinsons disease. We at first downloaded the microarray datasets of these two diseases from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and then analyzed them by the GEO2R tool. After analysis, we found 249 common upregulated differential expressed genes and 135 common downregulated differential expressed genes of these two diseases. Therefore the common differentially expressed genes, both upregulated and downregulated, were imported into STRING online tool to find out the protein-protein interactions. Now, this whole network was subjected to Cytoscape and the top ten hub genes were found by Cyto-Hubba plug-in. The top then hub genes are EGFR, CCNB1, CDK1, CCNA2, CHEK1, RAD51, MAD2L1, KIF20A, BUB1, and CCNB2. These all genes are upregulated in both diseases. To find out the biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components, and pathways associated with these hub genes Enrichr online software was used. We used miRNet software to determine the interactions of hub genes with microRNAs. This study will be useful in the future for drug targets discovery for these diseases.

                Background: Peak individual alpha frequencies (IAF) extracted from an EEG exam can provide novel sources of information regarding brain function. This information can help measure and track changes in cognition arising from conditions such as concussion or unhealthy aging. Objective 1: To validate a method for combining eyes-closed EEG with eyes-closed audio P300 ERP in order to streamline testing times involved in IAF extraction. Objective 2: To validate age-stratified target ranges of IAF collected in clinic against published research. Objective 3: To validate the stability of IAF for data collected in routine clinical settings. Participants: Two thousand twenty-five subjects aged 13-90. Methods: EEG with audio P300 was collected as part of a health screening exam for studies through Colorado University, Children's Hospital Colorado, Boone Heart Institute, WAVi Co., and various clinics alongside other clinical evaluations. Results: (1) No differences were seen between IAF extracted during an eyes-closed resting and the P300 protocol. (2) The age-related AF trends measured in clinic match the age-related trends from previous research. (3) IAF remained stable over the course of 0-2 years in a test-retest dataset. Conclusion: In-clinic measures of peak EEG frequency corroborate the age-related trends of published research taken over the last several decades and IAF. These results also confirm that IAF is a stable trait, making it useful for within-person longitudinal tracking. By following changes in IAF over time, deviations from normal CNS functioning, such as onset or progression of disease, can be monitored.

                In a typical text, readers look much longer at some words than at others and fixate some words multiple times, while skipping others altogether. Historically, researchers explained this variation via low-level visual or oculomotor factors, but today it is primarily explained via cognitive factors, such as how well words can be predicted from context or discerned from parafoveal preview. While the existence of these effects has been well established in experiments, the relative importance of prediction, preview and low-level factors for eye movement variation in natural reading is unclear. Here, we address this question using a deep neural network and Bayesian ideal observer to model linguistic prediction and parafoveal preview from moment to moment in natural reading (n=104, 1.5 million words). Strikingly, neither prediction nor preview was important for explaining word skipping - the vast majority of skipping was explained by a simple oculomotor model. For reading times, by contrast, we found clear but independent contributions of both prediction and preview, and effect sizes matching those from controlled experiments. Together, these results challenge dominant models of eye movements in reading by showing that linguistic prediction and parafoveal preview are not important determinants of word skipping.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Somnotate: A robust automated sleep stage classifier that exceeds human performance and identifies ambiguous states in mice</a></h4>

              
                Manual sleep stage annotation is a time-consuming but often essential step in the analysis of sleep data. To address this bottleneck several algorithms have been proposed that automate this process, reporting performance levels that are on par with manual annotation according to measures of inter-rater agreement. Here we first demonstrate that inter-rater agreement can provide a biased and imprecise measure of annotation quality. We therefore develop a principled framework for assessing performance against a consensus annotation derived from multiple experienced sleep researchers. We then construct a new sleep stage classifier that combines automated feature extraction using linear discriminant analysis with inference based on vigilance state-dependent contextual information using a hidden Markov model. This produces automated annotation accuracies that exceed expert performance on rodent electrophysiological data. Furthermore, our classifier is shown to be robust to errors in the training data, robust to experimental manipulations, and compatible with different recording configurations. Finally, we demonstrate that the classifier identifies both successful and failed attempts to transition between vigilance states, which may offer new insights into the occurrence of short awake periods between REM and NREM sleep. We call our classifier 'Somnotate' and make an implementation available to the neuroscience community.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Beneficial effects of two Ayurvedic formulations, Saraswata Ghrita and Kalyanaka Ghrita on survival and on toxic aggregates in Drosophila models of Huntington's and Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                In order to understand the health promotive, rejuvenative and disease preventive approach of the Ayurvedic system of medicine in the light of current principles, we examined two Rasayana formulations, viz., Kalayanaka Ghrita (KG) and Saraswata Ghrita (SG) for their effects in Alzheimer's (AD) and Huntington's (HD) neurodegenerative disease models of Drosophila. Initial experiments involving feeding of wild type flies on food supplemented with 0.05%, 0.25% and 0.5% (w/v) KG or SG revealed 0.05% to be without any adverse effect while higher concentrations caused dose-dependent reduction in pupation frequency and adult life span in wild type flies. Rearing GMR-GAL4>127Q (HD model) and ey-GAL4>A{beta}42 (AD model) larvae and adults on 0.05% or 0.25% SG or KG supplemented food enhanced the otherwise significantly reduced larval lethality and enhanced their median life span, with the 0.25% SG or KG concentrations being less effective than the 0.05%. In parallel with the better larval survival and enhanced adult life span, feeding the HD and AD model larvae on either of the Ghrita supplemented food (0.05% and 0.25%) substantially reduced the polyQ aggregates or amyloid plaques, respectively, in the larval eye discs. The present first in vivo organismic model study results have clinical implications for the increasing burden of age-associated dementia and neurodegenerative diseases like AD and HD in human populations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Harmoni: a Method for Eliminating Spurious Interactions due to the Harmonic Components in Neuronal Data</a></h4>

              
                Cross-frequency synchronization (CFS) has been proposed as a mechanism for integrating spatially and spectrally distributed information in the brain. However, investigating CFS in Magneto- and Electroencephalography (MEG/EEG) is hampered by the presence of spurious neuronal interactions due to the non-sinusoidal waveshape of brain oscillations. Such waveshape gives rise to the presence of oscillatory harmonics mimicking genuine neuronal oscillations. Until recently, however, there has been no methodology for removing these harmonics from neuronal data. In order to address this long-standing challenge, we introduce a novel method (called HARMOnic miNImization - Harmoni) that removes the signal components which can be harmonics of a non-sinusoidal signal. Harmoni's working principle is based on the presence of CFS between harmonic components and the fundamental component of a non-sinusoidal signal. We extensively tested Harmoni in realistic EEG simulations. The simulated couplings between the source signals represented genuine and spurious CFS and within-frequency phase synchronization. Using diverse evaluation criteria, including ROC analyses, we showed that the within- and cross-frequency spurious interactions are suppressed significantly, while the genuine activities are not affected. Additionally, we applied Harmoni to real resting-state EEG data revealing intricate remote connectivity patterns which are usually masked by the spurious connections. Given the ubiquity of non-sinusoidal neuronal oscillations in electrophysiological recordings, Harmoni is expected to facilitate novel insights into genuine neuronal interactions in various research fields, and can also serve as a steppingstone towards the development of further signal processing methods aiming at refining within- and cross-frequency synchronization in electrophysiological recordings.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Aberrant Functional Connectivity between Reward and Inhibitory Control Networks in Pre-Adolescent Binge Eating Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Background: Behavioral features of binge eating disorder (BED) suggest abnormalities in reward and inhibitory control. Studies of adult populations suggest functional abnormalities in reward and inhibitory control networks. Despite behavioral markers often developing in children, the neurobiology of pediatric BED remains unstudied. Methods: 58 pre-adolescent children (aged 9-10-years) with BED and 66 age, BMI and developmentally-matched control children were extracted from the 3.0 baseline (Year 0) release of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. We investigated group differences in resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) functional connectivity (FC) within and between reward and inhibitory control networks. A seed-based approach was employed to assess nodes in the reward (orbitofrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, amygdala) and inhibitory control (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex) networks via hypothesis-driven seed-to-seed analyses, and secondary seed-to-voxel analyses. Results: Our findings revealed reduced FC between the dlPFC and amygdala, and between the anterior cingulate cortex and orbitofrontal cortex in pre-adolescent children with BED, relative to age, gender, BMI and developmentally matched controls. These findings indicating aberrant connectivity between nodes of inhibitory control and reward networks were corroborated by the whole-brain FC analyses. Conclusions: Early-onset BED may be characterized by diffuse abnormalities in the functional synergy between reward and cognitive control networks, without perturbations within reward and inhibitory control networks, respectively. The decreased capacity to regulate a reward-driven pursuit of hedonic foods, which is characteristic of BED, may in part, rest on this dysconnectivity between reward and inhibitory control networks.

                Background: Anosmia/hyposmia affects 13.3 million people in the U.S. alone according to the recent U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Hundreds of thousands more people with persistent olfactory dysfunction will be added to this number due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients with loss-of-function mutations in SCN9A, the gene encoding NaV1.7, experience anosmia in addition to congenital insensitivity to pain. Tsp1a is a recently discovered peptide that inhibits NaV1.7 with high potency and selectivity. In this study, we examined whether a fluorescently tagged version of Tsp1a could be used to visualize normal and damaged mouse olfactory nerves. Methods: Athymic nude mice were intravenously injected with Tsp1a-IR800. As a control, mice were injected with PBS only, and as a blocking control were injected with combination of Tsp1a and Tsp1a-IR800. All mice were imaged in-vivo and epifluorescence images were acquired using an IVIS Spectrum animal imaging system. Semiquantitative analysis of the Tsp1a-IR800 signal was conducted by measuring the average radiant efficiency in the region of the olfactory epithelium/bulb (ROEB). Methimazole was used to chemically ablate the olfactory epithelium. We performed a food buried test to correlate the level of anosmia with the level of radiance efficiency. Results: The area of olfactory epithelium/bulb was clearly visible in epifluorescence in-vivo images of mice receiving the imaging agent. The radiant efficiency was significantly less in both mice injected with PBS and in mice injected with the blocking formulation. The mice after olfactory ablation had a significantly reduced radiant efficiency compared with normal mice. Moreover, there was a statistically significant and inverse correlation between the time required for the mouse to find buried food and the radiant efficiency. We also performed immunohistochemistry using NaV1.7 antibody. Mice after olfactory ablation as well as COVID-19-infected mice had significantly lower expression of NaV1.7 on the level of olfactory epithelium/bulb. Conclusion: We show that the fluorescent imaging of mouse olfactory epithelium/bulb is possible, suggesting that labeled Tsp1a tracers may serve as the first objective diagnostic tool of smell disorders, including those caused by COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Simultaneous Mnemonic and Predictive Representations in the Auditory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies have shown that stimulus history can be decoded via the use of broadband sensory impulses to reactivate mnemonic representations. It has also been shown that predictive mechanisms in the auditory system demonstrate similar tonotopic organization of neural activity as that elicited by the perceived stimuli. However, it remains unclear if the mnemonic and predictive information can be decoded from cortical activity simultaneously and from overlapping neural populations. Here, we recorded neural activity using electrocorticography (ECoG) in the auditory cortex of anesthetized rats while exposed to repeated stimulus sequences, where events within the sequence were occasionally replaced with a broadband noise burst or omitted entirely. We show that both stimulus history and predicted stimuli can be decoded from neural responses to broadband impulse at overlapping latencies but linked to largely independent neural populations. We also demonstrate that predictive representations are learned over the course of stimulation at two distinct time scales, reflected in two dissociable time windows of neural activity. These results establish a valuable tool for investigating the neural mechanisms of passive sequence learning, memory encoding, and prediction mechanisms within a single paradigm, and provide novel evidence for learning predictive representations even under anaesthesia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dysfunction of cAMP-PKA-calcium signaling axis in striatal medium spiny neurons: a role in schizophrenia and Huntington's disease pathogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Background: Striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) are preferentially lost in Huntington's disease. Genomic studies also implicate a direct role for MSNs in schizophrenia, a psychiatric disorder known to involve cortical neuron dysfunction. It remains unknown whether the two diseases share similar MSN pathogenesis or if neuronal deficits can be attributed to cell type-dependent biological pathways. Transcription factor BCL11B, which is expressed by all MSNs and deep layer cortical neurons, was recently proposed to drive selective neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease and identified as a candidate risk gene in schizophrenia. Methods: Using human stem cell-derived neurons lacking BCL11B as a model, we investigated cellular pathology in MSNs and cortical neurons in the context of these disorders. Integrative analyses between differentially expressed transcripts and published GWAS datasets identified cell type-specific disease-related phenotypes. Results: We uncover a role for BCL11B in calcium homeostasis in both neuronal types, while deficits in mitochondrial function and protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent calcium transients are detected only in MSNs. Moreover, BCL11B-deficient MSNs display abnormal responses to glutamate and fail to integrate dopaminergic and glutamatergic stimulation, a key feature of striatal neurons in vivo. Gene enrichment analysis reveals overrepresentation of disorder risk genes among BCL11B-regulated pathways, primarily relating to cAMP-PKA-calcium signaling axis and synaptic signaling. Conclusions: Our study indicates that Huntington's disease and schizophrenia are likely to share neuronal pathogenesis where dysregulation of intracellular calcium levels is found in both striatal and cortical neurons. In contrast, reduction in PKA signaling and abnormal dopamine/glutamate receptor signaling is largely specific to MSNs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Quantitative study of alpha-synuclein prion-like spreading in fully oriented reconstructed neural networks reveals non-synaptic dissemination of seeding aggregates</a></h4>

              
                The trans-neuronal spread of protein aggregates in a prion-like manner underlies the progression of neuronal lesions in the brain of patients with synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease. Despite being studied actively, the mechanisms of alpha-synuclein (aSyn) aggregates propagation remain poorly understood. This hinders the development of therapeutic approaches aiming at preventing the spatial progression of intracellular inclusions in neural networks. To assess the role of synaptic structures and neuron characteristics in the transfer efficiency of aggregates with seeding propensity, we developed a novel microfluidic culture system which allows for the first time to reconstruct in vitro fully oriented and synaptically connected neural networks. This is achieved by filtering axonal growth with unidirectional "axon valves" microchannels. We exposed the presynaptic compartment of reconstructed networks to well characterized human aSyn aggregates differing in size: Fibrils and Oligomers. Both aggregates were transferred to postsynaptic neurons through active axonal transport, albeit with poor efficiency. By manipulating network maturity, we compared the transfer rate of aggregates in networks with distinct levels of synaptic connectivity. Surprisingly, we found that transfer efficiency was lower in mature networks with higher synaptic connectivity. We then investigated the seeding efficiency of endogenous aSyn in the postsynaptic population. We found that exposure to Fibrils, and not Oligomers, resulted in low efficiency trans-neuronal seeding which was restricted to postsynaptic axons. Finally, we assessed the impact of neuron characteristics and aSyn expression on the propagation of aSyn aggregates. By reconstructing chimeric networks, we found that neuron characteristics, such as the brain region from which they originate or aSyn expression levels, did not significantly impact aggregates transfer, and observed no trans-neuronal seeding where the presynaptic population did not express aSyn. Overall, we demonstrate that this novel platform uniquely allows the quantitative interrogation of original aspects of the trans-neuronal propagation of seeding pathogenic entities.

                Background: Anorexia nervosa (AN) is characterised by disturbances in cognition and behaviour surrounding eating and weight, which may relate to the structural connectivity of the brain that supports effective information processing and transfer. Methods: Diffusion-weighted MRI data acquired from female patients with AN (n = 148) and female healthy controls (HC; n = 119), aged 12-40 years, were combined across five cross-sectional studies. Probabilistic tractography was completed, and full cortex connectomes describing streamline counts between 84 brain regions generated and harmonised. The network-based statistic tested between-group differences in connectivity strength of brain subnetworks. Whole-brain connectivity of brain regions was indexed using graph theory tools, and compared between groups using multiple linear regression. Associations between structural connectivity variables that differed between groups, and illness severity markers, were explored amongst AN patients using multiple linear regression. Statistical models included age, motion, and study as covariates. Outcomes: The network-based statistic indicated AN patients, relative to HC, had reduced connectivity in a network comprising subcortical regions and greater connectivity between frontal cortical regions (p < 0.05, FWE corrected). Graph theory analyses supported reduced connectivity of subcortical regions, and greater connectivity of left occipital cortex, in patients relative to HC (p < 0.05, permutation corrected). Reduced subcortical network connectivity was associated with lower BMI among the AN group. Interpretation: Structural differences in subcortical and cortical networks are present in AN, and may reflect illness mechanisms.

	<p>Presenilin-1 (PSEN1) is one of the causative genes for early onset Alzheimer’s disease (EOAD). Recently, emerging studies have reported several novel PSEN1 mutations among Asians. In this study, a PSEN1 Val96Phe mutation was discovered in two siblings from Malaysia with a strong family history of disease. This is the second report of PSEN1 Val96Phe mutation among EOAD patients in Asia and in the world. Patients presented symptomatic changes in their behaviors and personality, such as apathy and withdrawal in their 40s. Previous cellular studies with COS1 cell lines revealed the mutation increased the amyloid-β42 (Aβ42) productions. In the present study, whole-exome sequencing was performed on the two siblings with EOAD, and they were analyzed against the virtual panel of 100 genes from various neurodegenerative diseases. In silico modeling was also performed on PSEN1 Val96Phe mutation. This mutation was located on the first transmembrane helix of PSEN1 protein, resulting significant intramolecular stresses in the helices. This helical domain would play a significant role in γ-secretase cleavage for the increased Aβ42 productions. Several other adjacent mutations were reported in this helical domain, including Ile83Thr or Val89Leu. Our study suggested that perturbations in TMI-HLI-TMII regions could also be associated with C-terminal fragment accumulation of APP and enhanced amyloid productions.</p>

	<p>Changes in brain connectivity during language therapy were examined among participants with aphasia (PWA), aiming to shed light on neural reorganization in the language network. Four PWA with anomia following left hemisphere stroke and eight healthy controls (HC) participated in the study. Two fMRI scans were administered to all participants with a 3.5-month interval. The fMRI scans included phonological and semantic tasks, each consisting of linguistic and perceptual matching conditions. Between the two fMRI scans, PWA underwent Phonological Components Analysis treatment. Changes in effective connectivity during the treatment were examined within right hemisphere (RH) architecture. The results illustrate that following the treatment, the averaged connectivity of PWA across all perceptual and linguistic conditions in both tasks increased resemblance to HC, reflecting the normalization of neural processes associated with silent object name retrieval. In contrast, connections that were specifically enhanced by the phonological condition in PWA decreased in their resemblance to HC, reflecting emerging compensatory reorganization in RH connectivity to support phonological processing. These findings suggest that both normalization and compensation play a role in neural language reorganization at the chronic stage, occurring simultaneously in the same brain.</p>

	<p>Mind-wandering (MW) is a common phenomenon, defined as task-unrelated thoughts. This study is based on event-related potentials (ERPs), using modified sustained attention to response task (modified SART, mSART) to discuss the neural patterns of different types of MW. In the current study, we defined the MW realized by participants as self-caught MW, and the MW measurement acquired by probes as probe-caught MW. The behavioral results showed that the reaction times (RTs) during self-caught MW were greater than those during non-self-caught MW. The ERP results showed that during self-caught MW, the mean amplitudes of N1 decreased significantly, indicating that the participants’ attention had deviated from the current task. The increase in the mean amplitudes of P2 during self-caught MW indicated lower vigilance. We also found that the mean amplitudes of N300 reduced during self-caught MW, which indicated that cognitive control or monitoring might be affected by self-caught MW. The average amplitudes of P300 were significantly lower during probe-caught MW than during on-task, indicating the impact on high-level cognitive processing. In addition, the amplitudes of N1, P2, and N300 in anterior regions were greater than those in posterior regions. P300 amplitudes during probe-caught MW in the right hemisphere were greater than those of the left hemisphere. In summary, our research results demonstrated that alertness and cognitive processing decreased during both self-caught MW and probe-caught MW. ERPs were statistically different under the conditions of self-caught MW and probe-caught MW. The current study provided new insights into the relationship between MW and neural markers. It was the first study exploring the ERP correlates between self-caught MW and probe-caught MW based on mSART.</p>

                Background: Postoperative hypotension associated with postoperative morbidity and early mortality has been studied previously. Hypertension and other hemodynamic, respiratory, and temperature abnormalities have comparatively understudied during the first postoperative days. Methods: This bi-centre observational cohort study will include 114 adult patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery hospitalized on an unmonitored general care floor and wearing a multi-signal wearable sensor, allowing remote monitoring (Biobeat Technologies Ltd, Petah Tikva, Israel). The study will cover the first 72 hours after discharge of the patient from the post-anaesthesia care unit. Several thresholds will be used for each variable (arterial pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and skin temperature). Data obtained using the sensor will be compared to data obtained during the routine nurse follow-up. The primary outcome is hemodynamic abnormality. The secondary outcomes are postoperative respiratory and temperature abnormalities, artefacts and blank/null outputs from the wearable device, postoperative complications, and finally, the ease of use of the device. We hypothesize that remote monitoring will detect abnormalities in vital signs more often or more quickly than the detection by nurses’ routine surveillance. Discussion: A demonstration of the ability of wireless sensors to outperform standard monitoring techniques paves the way for the creation of a loop which includes this monitoring mode, the automated creation of alerts, and the sending of these alerts to caregivers.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Paranoia, self-deception and overconfidence</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rosa A. Rossi-Goldthorpe, Yuan Chang Leong, Pantelis Leptourgos, Philip R. Corlett</p>

Self-deception, paranoia, and overconfidence involve misbeliefs about the self, others, and world. They are often considered mistaken. Here we explore whether they might be adaptive, and further, whether they might be explicable in Bayesian terms. We administered a difficult perceptual judgment task with and without social influence (suggestions from a cooperating or competing partner). Crucially, the social influence was uninformative. We found that participants heeded the suggestions most under the most uncertain conditions and that they did so with high confidence, particularly if they were more paranoid. Model fitting to participant behavior revealed that their prior beliefs changed depending on whether the partner was a collaborator or competitor, however, those beliefs did not differ as a function of paranoia. Instead, paranoia, self-deception, and overconfidence were associated with participants’ perceived instability of their own performance. These data are consistent with the idea that self-deception, paranoia, and overconfidence flourish under uncertainty, and have their roots in low self-esteem, rather than excessive social concern. The model suggests that spurious beliefs can have value–self-deception is irrational yet can facilitate optimal behavior. This occurs even at the expense of monetary rewards, perhaps explaining why self-deception and paranoia contribute to costly decisions which can spark financial crashes and devastating wars.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Narrative event segmentation in the cortical reservoir</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Peter Ford Dominey</p>

Recent research has revealed that during continuous perception of movies or stories, humans display cortical activity patterns that reveal hierarchical segmentation of event structure. Thus, sensory areas like auditory cortex display high frequency segmentation related to the stimulus, while semantic areas like posterior middle cortex display a lower frequency segmentation related to transitions between events. These hierarchical levels of segmentation are associated with different time constants for processing. Likewise, when two groups of participants heard the same sentence in a narrative, preceded by different contexts, neural responses for the groups were initially different and then gradually aligned. The time constant for alignment followed the segmentation hierarchy: sensory cortices aligned most quickly, followed by mid-level regions, while some higher-order cortical regions took more than 10 seconds to align. These hierarchical segmentation phenomena can be considered in the context of processing related to comprehension. In a recently described model of discourse comprehension word meanings are modeled by a language model pre-trained on a billion word corpus. During discourse comprehension, word meanings are continuously integrated in a recurrent cortical network. The model demonstrates novel discourse and inference processing, in part because of two fundamental characteristics: real-world event semantics are represented in the word embeddings, and these are integrated in a reservoir network which has an inherent gradient of functional time constants due to the recurrent connections. Here we demonstrate how this model displays hierarchical narrative event segmentation properties beyond the embeddings alone, or their linear integration. The reservoir produces activation patterns that are segmented by a hidden Markov model (HMM) in a manner that is comparable to that of humans. Context construction displays a continuum of time constants across reservoir neuron subsets, while context forgetting has a fixed time constant across these subsets. Importantly, virtual areas formed by subgroups of reservoir neurons with faster time constants segmented with shorter events, while those with longer time constants preferred longer events. This neurocomputational recurrent neural network simulates narrative event processing as revealed by the fMRI event segmentation algorithm provides a novel explanation of the asymmetry in narrative forgetting and construction. The model extends the characterization of online integration processes in discourse to more extended narrative, and demonstrates how reservoir computing provides a useful model of cortical processing of narrative structure.

COVID-19 most likely had its origins in wildlife, and hundreds of thousands of new viruses could spill over from wildlife to humans. We are struggling to combat climate change, and we are staring down the loss of a million species. It’s time to change course.

This Perspective article argues that as we struggle to combat climate change, with the potential loss of a million species and increasing exposure to thousands of new viruses that could spill over from wildlife to humans (as SARS-CoV-2 likely did), it is time to change course.

Evolving in sync with the computation revolution over the past 30 years, computational biology has emerged as a mature scientific field. While the field has made major contributions toward improving scientific knowledge and human health, individual computational biology practitioners at various institutions often languish in career development. As optimistic biologists passionate about the future of our field, we propose solutions for both eager and reluctant individual scientists, institutions, publishers, funding agencies, and educators to fully embrace computational biology. We believe that in order to pave the way for the next generation of discoveries, we need to improve recognition for computational biologists and better align pathways of career success with pathways of scientific progress. With 10 outlined steps, we call on all adjacent fields to move away from the traditional individual, single-discipline investigator research model and embrace multidisciplinary, data-driven, team science.

The widely held assumption that any important scientific information would be available in English underlies the underuse of non-English-language science across disciplines. However, non-English-language science is expected to bring unique and valuable scientific information, especially in disciplines where the evidence is patchy, and for emergent issues where synthesising available evidence is an urgent challenge. Yet such contribution of non-English-language science to scientific communities and the application of science is rarely quantified. Here, we show that non-English-language studies provide crucial evidence for informing global biodiversity conservation. By screening 419,679 peer-reviewed papers in 16 languages, we identified 1,234 non-English-language studies providing evidence on the effectiveness of biodiversity conservation interventions, compared to 4,412 English-language studies identified with the same criteria. Relevant non-English-language studies are being published at an increasing rate in 6 out of the 12 languages where there were a sufficient number of relevant studies. Incorporating non-English-language studies can expand the geographical coverage (i.e., the number of 2° × 2° grid cells with relevant studies) of English-language evidence by 12% to 25%, especially in biodiverse regions, and taxonomic coverage (i.e., the number of species covered by the relevant studies) by 5% to 32%, although they do tend to be based on less robust study designs. Our results show that synthesising non-English-language studies is key to overcoming the widespread lack of local, context-dependent evidence and facilitating evidence-based conservation globally. We urge wider disciplines to rigorously reassess the untapped potential of non-English-language science in informing decisions to address other global challenges.

                Background: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex developmental condition that involves persistent challenges in social interaction, speech, and nonverbal communication, in addition to repetitive or restrictive behaviours. For decades, children with ASD have been familiarising themselves with information and communication technologies (ICT) in their training and diagnosis. One of the ICT areas, namely non-immersive virtual reality (NIVR), has become a noticeable tool to help ASD children in their social training. It provides extensive virtual interaction, a safe environment, and is affordable. An NIVR application is developed to assist the intervention on ASD children. However, the whole experiences of the training need to be validated to conclude its effectiveness.   Methods: A case study was employed as the research method. An evaluation of NIVR application using multiple sources of evidence was guided by Kirkpatrick Model of Evaluation (KME) which was executed via questionnaires, pre- and post-test. The main objectives of this research were to evaluate level 1 and 2 of KME. The target for Level 1 is to assess the reactions to the NIVR application. Level 2 is to gauge the knowledge, confidence, or mindset of participants. Level 2 covers the evaluation prior to the training (pre-test) and after the training (post-test).   Results: On average the ASD children had good experiences and were able to improve their social skills with the NIVR application. Therefore, the combination of serious game, analytics and specific VR type provides good data assessment, facilitate comfortable training, and can be an effective intervention for children with ASD.  Conclusion: The positive trend on both levels shows that the application has a good potential to be used in ASD training. The results could be improved in a higher number of participants. Currently, only a limited number of research participants could be obtained due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cortico-thalamic interactions between associative cortices and higher-order thalamic nuclei are involved in high-cognitive functions, such as decision-making and working memory. Corticothalamic neurons (CTn) in the prefrontal cortex and other associative areas have been much less studied than their counterparts in the primary sensory areas. The availability of characterized transgenic tools to study CTn in associative areas will facilitate their study and contribute to overcome the scarcity of data about their properties, network dynamics, and contribution to cognitive functions.</p>
<p>Here, we characterized the Syt6-Cre (KI148Gsat/Mmud) transgenic mouse line, by tracking expression of a Cre-mediated reporter. In this line, Cre-reporter is strongly expressed in the prefrontal, motor, cingulate, and retrosplenial cortices, as well as in other brain areas including the Cerebellum and the Olfactory tubercle. Cortical expression starts embryonically and reaches the adult expression pattern by postnatal day 15. In the cortex, Cre-reporter is expressed by layer 6-CTn, and by layer 5-CTn to a lesser extent. We quantified Syt6-Cre<sup>+</sup> CTn axon varicosities to estimate the distribution and density of putative corticothalamic driver and modulator inputs to thalamic nuclei in the medial, midline, intralaminar, anterior, and motor groups. Also, we characterized the effect of optogenetic stimulation of Syt6-Cre<sup>+</sup> neurons in the activity of the prefrontal cortex. CTn stimulation in the prefrontal cortex induces an oscillatory activity in the local field potential that resembles the cortical down-states typically observed during slow-wave sleep or quiet wake.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Methods to measure calcitonin receptor activity, up-regulated in cell stress, apoptosis and autophagy [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The expression of the calcitonin receptor (CT Receptor) is widespread throughout the life cycle of mammals and in many diseases, and in these contexts the functions of the common isoforms is largely unknown. The relatively recent development of anti-CT Receptor antibodies that bind separate epitopes on the CTa Receptor and CTb Receptor isoforms has advanced our knowledge and understanding of these events. CT Receptor at the protein level is upregulated in programmed cell death including apoptosis (as described in a previous publication) and autophagy, which is discussed in our upcoming, unpublished review. Incomplete data sets are cited in this review on the upregulation of CACLR (encoding CT Receptor) mRNA, in particular the insert-positive isoform (CTb Receptor), in response to cell stress. Cell stress is induced by growth in depleted foetal bovine serum (dFBS) or without FBS, both of which induce degrees of starvation and autophagy, or dFBS plus staurosporine, which induces apoptosis. Details of the methods deployed to generate these data are described here including measurement of the upregulation of CTb Receptor mRNA with qPCR and nanopore long range sequencing. An anti-CT Receptor antibody also known as CalRexinTM, which binds an epitope in the N-terminal domain, was conjugated to either fluorophore 568, which is accumulated into apoptotic cells as previously reported, or pHrodo Red, a pH dependent fluorescent dye, which is accumulated into autophagic and apoptotic cells.  These conjugates are under development to image programmed cell death. The methods for conjugation and high content imaging on the Operetta platform are described. The high fluorescence intensity at low pH of CalRexin:pHrodo Red in both autophagic and apoptotic cells suggests localisation in autophago-lysosomes and lysosomes respectively. Overall, these observations and the methods that underpin them have contributed to our understanding of the widespread expression of CT Receptor isoforms.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Tau‐atrophy variability reveals phenotypic heterogeneity in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Tau neurofibrillary tangles (T) are the primary driver of downstream neurodegeneration (N) and subsequent cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, there is substantial variability in the T-N relationship – manifested in higher or lower atrophy than expected for level of tau in a given brain region. The goal of this study was to determine if region-based quantitation of this variability allows for identification of underlying modulatory factors, including polypathology.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cortical thickness (N) and <sup>18</sup>F-Flortaucipir SUVR (T) were computed in 104 gray matter regions from a cohort of cognitively-impaired, amyloid-positive (A+) individuals. Region-specific residuals from a robust linear fit between SUVR and cortical thickness were computed as a surrogate for T-N mismatch. A summary T-N mismatch metric defined using residuals were correlated with demographic and imaging-based modulatory factors, and to partition the cohort into data-driven subgroups.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The summary T-N mismatch metric correlated with underlying factors such as age and burden of white matter hyperintensity lesions. Data-driven subgroups based on clustering of residuals appear to represent different biologically relevant phenotypes, with groups showing distinct spatial patterns of higher or lower atrophy than expected.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These data support the notion that a measure of deviation from a normative relationship between tau burden and neurodegeneration across brain regions in individuals on the AD continuum captures variability due to multiple underlying factors, and can reveal phenotypes, which if validated, may help identify possible contributors to neurodegeneration in addition to tau, which may ultimately be useful for cohort selection in clinical trials.</p>

                Remdesivir (RDV), a drug effective in COVID-19 treatment, induces a characteristic delayed intervention once incorporated by the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase. Wu et al. reveal that RDV incorporated by SARS-CoV-2 polymerase elongation complex can pass the intervention site, while similar mechanism is also found in enterovirus 71 polymerase.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 polymerase by nucleotide analogs from a single-molecule perspective</a></h4>

              
                The absence of ‘shovel-ready’ anti-coronavirus drugs during vaccine development has exceedingly worsened the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Furthermore, new vaccine-resistant variants and coronavirus outbreaks may occur in the near future, and we must be ready to face this possibility. However, efficient antiviral drugs are still lacking to this day, due to our poor understanding of the mode of incorporation and mechanism of action of nucleotides analogs that target the coronavirus polymerase to impair its essential activity. Here, we characterize the impact of remdesivir (RDV, the only FDA-approved anti-coronavirus drug) and other nucleotide analogs (NAs) on RNA synthesis by the coronavirus polymerase using a high-throughput, single-molecule, magnetic-tweezers platform. We reveal that the location of the modification in the ribose or in the base dictates the catalytic pathway(s) used for its incorporation. We show that RDV incorporation does not terminate viral RNA synthesis, but leads the polymerase into backtrack as far as 30 nt, which may appear as termination in traditional ensemble assays. SARS-CoV-2 is able to evade the endogenously synthesized product of the viperin antiviral protein, ddhCTP, though the polymerase incorporates this NA well. This experimental paradigm is essential to the discovery and development of therapeutics targeting viral polymerases.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Experience-dependent weakening of callosal synaptic connections in the absence of postsynaptic FMRP</a></h4>

              
                Reduced structural and functional interhemispheric connectivity correlates with the severity of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) behaviors in humans. Little is known of how ASD-risk genes regulate callosal connectivity. Here we show that <i>Fmr1</i>, whose loss-of-function leads to Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), cell autonomously promotes maturation of callosal excitatory synapses between somatosensory barrel cortices in mice. Postnatal, cell-autonomous deletion of <i>Fmr1</i> in postsynaptic Layer (L) 2/3 or L5 neurons results in a selective weakening of AMPA receptor- (R), but not NMDA receptor-, mediated callosal synaptic function, indicative of immature synapses. Sensory deprivation by contralateral whisker trimming normalizes callosal input strength, suggesting that experience-driven activity of postsynaptic <i>Fmr1</i> KO L2/3 neurons weakens callosal synapses. In contrast to callosal inputs, synapses originating from local L4 and L2/3 circuits are normal, revealing an input-specific role for postsynaptic <i>Fmr1</i> in regulation of synaptic connectivity within local and callosal neocortical circuits. These results suggest direct cell autonomous and postnatal roles for FMRP in development of specific cortical circuits and suggest a synaptic basis for long-range functional underconnectivity observed in FXS patients.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The mammalian rod synaptic ribbon is essential for Cav channel facilitation and ultrafast synaptic vesicle fusion</a></h4>

              
                Rod photoreceptors (PRs) use ribbon synapses to transmit visual information. To signal 'no light detected' they release glutamate continually to activate post-synaptic receptors. When light is detected glutamate release pauses. How a rod's individual ribbon enables this process was studied here by recording evoked changes in whole-cell membrane capacitance from wild type and ribbonless (<i>Ribeye</i>-ko) mice. Wild type rods filled with high (10 mM) or low (0.5 mM) concentrations of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-buffer EGTA created a readily releasable pool (RRP) of 87 synaptic vesicles (SVs) that emptied as a single kinetic phase with a τ &lt; 0.4 msec. The lower concentration of EGTA accelerated Ca<sub>v</sub> channel opening and facilitated release kinetics. In contrast, ribbonless rods created a much smaller RRP of 22 SVs, and they lacked Ca<sub>v</sub> channel facilitation; however, Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel-release coupling remained tight. These release deficits caused a sharp attenuation of rod-driven light responses. We conclude that the synaptic ribbon facilitates Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx and establishes a large RRP of SVs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The East Asian gut microbiome is distinct from colocalized white subjects and connected to metabolic health</a></h4>

              
                East Asians experience worse metabolic health outcomes compared to other ethnic groups at lower body mass indices; however, the potential role of the gut microbiota in contributing to these health disparities remains unknown. We conducted a multi-omic study of 46 lean and obese East Asian and White participants living in the San Francisco Bay Area, revealing marked differences between ethnic groups in bacterial richness and community structure. White individuals were enriched for the mucin-degrading <i>Akkermansia muciniphila.</i> East Asian subjects had increased levels of multiple bacterial phyla, fermentative pathways detected by metagenomics, and the short-chain fatty acid end-products acetate, propionate, and isobutyrate. Differences in the gut microbiota between the East Asian and White subjects could not be explained by dietary intake, were more pronounced in lean individuals, and were associated with current geographical location. Microbiome transplantations into germ-free mice demonstrated stable diet- and host genotype-independent differences between the gut microbiotas of East Asian and White individuals that differentially impact host body composition. Taken together, our findings add to the growing body of literature describing variation between ethnicities and provide a starting point for defining the mechanisms through which the microbiome may shape disparate health outcomes in East Asians.

The isoelectric point of ApoE4 matches the pH of the early endosome (EE), causing its delayed dissociation from ApoE receptors and hence impaired endolysosomal trafficking, disruption of synaptic homeostasis and reduced amyloid clearance. We have shown that enhancing endosomal acidification by inhibiting the EE-specific sodium-hydrogen exchanger 6 (NHE6) restores vesicular trafficking and normalizes synaptic homeostasis. Remarkably and unexpectedly, loss of NHE6 (encoded by the gene <i>Slc9a6</i>) in mice effectively suppressed amyloid deposition even in the absence of ApoE4, suggesting that accelerated acidification of early endosomes caused by the absence of NHE6 occludes the effect of ApoE on amyloid plaque formation. NHE6 suppression or inhibition may thus be a universal, ApoE-independent approach to prevent amyloid buildup in the brain. These findings suggest a novel therapeutic approach for the prevention of AD by which partial NHE6 inhibition reverses the ApoE4 induced endolysosomal trafficking defect and reduces plaque load.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Modulation of fracture healing by the transient accumulation of senescent cells</a></h4>

              
                Senescent cells have detrimental effects across tissues with aging but may have beneficial effects on tissue repair, specifically on skin wound healing. However, the potential role of senescent cells in fracture healing has not been defined. Here, we performed an <i>in silico</i> analysis of public mRNAseq data and found that senescence and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) markers increased during fracture healing. We next directly established that the expression of senescence biomarkers increased markedly during murine fracture healing. We also identified cells in the fracture callus that displayed hallmarks of senescence, including distension of satellite heterochromatin and telomeric DNA damage; the specific identity of these cells, however, requires further characterization. Then, using a genetic mouse model (<i>Cdkn2a<sup>LUC</sup></i>) containing a <i>Cdkn2a<sup>Ink4a</sup></i>-driven luciferase reporter, we demonstrated transient <i>in vivo</i> senescent cell accumulation during callus formation. Finally, we intermittently treated young adult mice following fracture with drugs that selectively eliminate senescent cells ('senolytics', Dasatinib plus Quercetin), and showed that this regimen both decreased senescence and SASP markers in the fracture callus and significantly accelerated the time course of fracture healing. Our findings thus demonstrate that senescent cells accumulate transiently in the murine fracture callus and, in contrast to the skin, their clearance does not impair but rather improves fracture healing.

                Although peripheral deafferentation studies have demonstrated a critical role for trigeminal afference in modulating the orosensorimotor control of eating and drinking, the central trigeminal pathways mediating that control, as well as the timescale of control, remain to be elucidated. In rodents, three ascending somatosensory pathways process and relay orofacial mechanosensory input: the lemniscal, paralemniscal, and extralemniscal. Two of these pathways (the lemniscal and extralemniscal) exhibit highly structured topographic representations of the orofacial sensory surface, as exemplified by the one-to-one somatotopic mapping between vibrissae on the animals face and barrelettes in brainstem, barreloids in thalamus, and barrels in cortex. Here we use the Prrxl1 knockout mouse model to investigate ingestive behavior deficits associated with disruption of the lemniscal pathway. The Prrxl1 deletion disrupts somatotopic patterning and axonal projections throughout the lemniscal pathway but spares patterning in the extralemniscal nucleus. Our data reveal an imprecise and inefficient ingestive phenotype with deficits that span timescales from milliseconds to months, tightly linking trigeminal input with ingestion, from moment-to-moment consummatory to long term appetitive control. We suggest that ordered assembly of trigeminal sensory information along the lemniscal pathway is critical for the rapid and precise modulation of motor circuits driving eating and drinking action sequences.

                The human visual system is capable of detecting extremely small light signals, as little as one single photon. But what is the visual system's minimal exposure threshold to detect meaningful stimuli? Due to hardware limitations, studies examining fast visual processing typically present stimuli for suprathreshold durations and disrupt processing with a mask. Here, we employed a newly developed tachistoscope that enables sub-millisecond presentations. Combining measures of perceptual sensitivity and recordings of neural activity, we find that both the holistic configuration and the emotional expression of a human face have the same minimal required exposure as the minimal required exposure for faces to reach awareness. These findings indicate that conscious awareness is required for processing meaningful visual information.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Key Factors in the Cortical Response to Transcranial Electrical Stimulations--A Multi-Scale Modeling Study</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial electrode stimulation (tES), one of the techniques used to apply non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS), modulates cortical activities by delivering weak electric currents through scalp-attached electrodes. This emerging technique has gained increasing attention recently; however, the results of tES vary greatly depending upon subjects and the stimulation paradigm, and its cellular mechanism remains uncertain. In particular, there is a controversy over the factors that determine the cortical response to tES. Some studies have reported that the electric field's (EF) orientation is the determining factor, while others have demonstrated that the EF magnitude itself is the crucial factor. In this work, we conducted an in-depth investigation of cortical activity in two types of electrode montages used widely-the conventional (C)-tES and high-definition (HD)-tES-as well as two stimulation waveforms-direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC). To do so, we constructed a multi-scale model by coupling an anatomically realistic human head model and morphologically realistic multi-compartmental models of three types of cortical neurons (layer 2/3 pyramidal neuron, layer 4 basket cell, layer 5 pyramidal neuron). Then, we quantified the neuronal response to the C-/HD-tDCS/tACS and explored the relation between the electric field (EF) and the radial field's (RF: radial component of EF) magnitude and the cortical neurons' threshold. The EF tES induced depended upon the electrode montage, and the neuronal responses were correlated with the EF rather than the RF's magnitude. The electrode montages and stimulation waveforms caused a small difference in threshold, but the higher correlation between the EF's magnitude and the threshold was consistent. Further, we observed that the neurons' morphological features affected the degree of the correlation highly. Thus, the EF magnitude was a key factor in the responses of neurons with arborized axons. Our results demonstrate that the crucial factor in neuronal excitability depends upon the neuron models' morphological and biophysical properties. Hence, to predict the cellular targets of NIBS precisely, it is necessary to adopt more advanced neuron models that mimic realistic morphological and biophysical features of actual human cells.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inflammation modulates regeneration in the acute or chronically damaged zebrafish retina</a></h4>

              
                Unlike mammals, zebrafish regenerate in response to retinal damage. Because microglia are activated by retinal damage, we investigated their role during regeneration following acute or chronic damage. At three weeks-post-fertilization (wpf), fish exhibiting NMDA-induced acute damage or cone photoreceptor-specific chronic degeneration, the gold rush (gosh) mutant, displayed reactive microglia and Muller glia proliferation. Retinas treated to inhibit the immune response lacked reactive microglia and possessed fewer PCNA-positive cells, while LPS treatment increased microglia and PCNA-labeled cells. NMDA-injured retinas upregulated the expression of il-1{beta} and tnf- pro-inflammatory cytokine genes, followed by increased expression of il-10 and arg1 anti-inflammatory/remodeling cytokine genes. An early and transiently TNF- pro-inflammatory microglia population was identified in the NMDA-damaged retina. In contrast, gosh mutant retinas exhibited a mild increase of pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression concurrently with a greater increased in anti-inflammatory/remodeling cytokine gene expression. Few TNF- pro-inflammatory microglia were observed in the gosh retina. How inflammation regulates regeneration in zebrafish would provide important clues towards improving the therapeutic strategies for repairing injured mammalian tissues.

                Sexual assault and rape are crimes that impact victims worldwide. Although the psychosocial and eco-evolutionary factors associated with this antisocial behavior have repeatedly been studied, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms are still unknown mainly due to the lack of an appropriate animal model of sexual aggression (SxA). Here, we established a novel paradigm to provoke and subsequently assess SxA in adult male Wistar rats: the sexual aggression test (SxAT). Briefly, male Wistar rats are sexually aroused by a receptive female, which is exchanged by a non-receptive female immediately after the first intromission. This protocol elicits forced mounting (FM) and aggressive behavior (AB) towards the non-receptive female to different degrees, which can be scored. In a series of experiments we can show that SxA behavior is a relatively stable trait in rats and correlates positively with sexual motivation. Rats with innate abnormal anxiety and aggressive behavior also show abnormal SxA behavior. In addition, central infusion of oxytocin moderately inhibits AB, but increases FM. Finally, we identified the agranular insular cortex to be specifically activated by SxA, and inhibition of this region mildly decreased AB during the SxAT. Altogether, the SxAT is a paradigm that can be readily implemented in behavioral laboratories as a valuable tool to find answers regarding the biological mechanisms underlying SxA in humans, as well as social decision-making in general.

                Sex-specific differences in the aging cerebellum may be related to hormone changes with menopause. We evaluated the influence of reproductive stage on lobular cerebellar network connectivity using data from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience repository. We used raw structural and resting state neuroimaging data and information regarding age, sex, and menopause-related variables. Crus I and II and Lobules V and VI were our cerebellar seeds of interest. We characterized reproductive stage using the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop criteria. Results show that postmenopausal females have lower cerebello-striatal and cerebello-cortical connectivity, particularly in frontal regions, along with lower connectivity within the cerebellum, compared to reproductive females. Postmenopausal females also exhibit greater connectivity in some brain areas as well. Differences begin to emerge across transitional stages of menopause. Further, results reveal sex-specific differences in connectivity between female reproductive groups and age-matched male control groups. This suggests that menopause may influence cerebellar network connectivity in aging females, and sex differences in the aging brain may be related to this biological process.

                Gastrointestinal complaints in autism are common and impact the quality of life of affected individuals, yet the underlying mechanisms are understudied. We have found that individuals with mutations in CHD8 present with gastrointestinal disturbances. We have shown that loss of chd8, the sole ortholog of CHD8 in zebrafish, leads to reduced number of enteric neurons and decreased intestinal mobility. However, it remains unclear how chd8 acts during the development of the enteric nervous system and whether CHD8-associated gastrointestinal complaints are solely due to impaired neuronal function in the intestine. Here, utilizing a stable chd8 mutant zebrafish model, we found that the loss of chd8 leads to reduced number of vagal neural crest cells (NCCs), enteric neural progenitors, emigrating from the neural tube and their early migration capability was altered. At later stages, although the intestinal colonization by the NCCs was complete, we found decreased numbers of both NCC-derived serotonergic neurons and serotonin-producing enterochromaffin cells, suggesting an intestinal hyposerotonemia in absence of chd8. Moreover, transcriptomic analyses revealed altered expression of key receptors and enzymes in serotonin and acetylcholine signaling pathways. Next, tissue examination of chd8 mutants revealed thinner intestinal epithelium accompanied by accumulation of neutrophils and decreased numbers of goblet cells and eosinophils. Last, single-cell sequencing of whole mid- and posterior intestines showed a global disruption of the immune balance with perturbed expression of inflammatory interleukins and changes in immune cell clusters. Our findings propose a causal developmental link between chd8, serotonergic pathway, intestinal homeostasis, and autism-associated gastrointestinal complaints.

                Developmental neuron death plays a pivotal role in refining organization and wiring during neocortex formation. Aberrant regulation of this process results in neurodevelopmental disorders including impaired learning and memory. Underlying molecular pathways are incompletely determined. Loss of Bcl11a in cortical projection neurons induces pronounced cell death in upper-layer cortical projection neurons during postnatal corticogenesis. We used this genetic model to explore genetic mechanisms by which developmental neuron death is controlled. Unexpectedly, we found Bcl6, previously shown to be involved in transition of cortical neurons from progenitor to postmitotic differentiation state to provide a major check point regulating neuron survival during late cortical development. We show that Bcl11a is a direct transcriptional regulator of Bcl6. Deletion of Bcl6 exerts death of cortical projection neurons. In turn, reintroduction of Bcl6 into Bcl11a mutants prevents induction of cell death in these neurons. Together, our data identify a novel Bcl11a/Bcl6-dependent molecular pathway in regulation of developmental cell death during corticogenesis.

                Muller glia (MG) in mammalian retinas are incapable of regenerating neurons after damage, whereas the MG in lower vertebrates regenerate functional neurons. Identification networks that regulate MG-mediated regeneration is key to harnessing the regenerative potential of MG. Here we study how NFkB-signaling influences glial responses to damage and reprogramming of MG into neurons in the rodent retina. We find activation of NFkB and dynamic expression of NFkB-associated genes in MG after damage, however NFkB activity is inhibited by microglia ablation. Knockout of NFkB in MG suppressed the accumulation of immune cells after damage. Inhibition of NFkB following NMDA-damage significantly enhanced the reprogramming of Ascl1-overexpressing MG into neuron-like cells. scRNA-seq of retinal glia following inhibition of NFkB reveals coordination with signaling via TGFb2 and suppression of NFI and Id transcription factors. Inhibition of Smad3 or Id transcription factors increased numbers of neuron-like cells produced by Ascl1-overexpressing MG. We conclude that NFkB is a key signaling hub that is activated in MG after damage, mediates the accumulation of immune cells, and suppresses the neurogenic potential of MG.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Geosmin suppresses defensive behaviour and elicits unusual neural responses in honey bees.</a></h4>

              
                Geosmin is an odorant produced by bacteria in moist soil. It has been found to be extraordinarily relevant to some insects, but the reasons for this are not yet fully understood. Here we report the first tests of the effect of geosmin on honey bees. A stinging assay showed that the defensive behaviour elicited by the bee's alarm pheromone is strongly suppressed by geosmin. Surprisingly, the suppression is, however, only present at very low geosmin concentrations, and completely disappears at higher concentrations. We investigated the underlying mechanisms of the behavioural change at the level of the olfactory receptor neurons by means of electroantennography and at the level of the antennal lobe output via calcium imaging. Unusual effects were observed at both levels. The responses of the olfactory receptor neurons to mixtures of geosmin and the alarm pheromone component isoamyl acetate (IAA) were lower than to pure IAA, suggesting an interaction of both compounds at the olfactory receptor level. In the antennal lobe, the neuronal representation of geosmin showed a glomerular activation that decreased with increasing concentration, correlating well with the concentration dependence of the behaviour. Computational modelling of odour transduction and odour coding in the antennal lobe suggests that a broader than usual activation of different olfactory receptor types by geosmin in combination with lateral inhibition in the antennal lobe could lead to the observed non-monotonic increasing-decreasing responses to geosmin and thus underlie the specificity of the behavioural response to low geosmin concentrations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential geometry methods for constructing manifold-targeted recurrent neural networks.</a></h4>

              
                Neural computations can be framed as dynamical processes, whereby the structure of the dynamics within a neural network are a direct reflection of the computations that the network performs. A key step in generating mechanistic interpretations within this computation through dynamics framework is to establish the link between network connectivity, dynamics and computation. This link is only partly understood. Recent work has focused on producing algorithms for engineering artificial recurrent neural networks (RNN) with dynamics targeted to a specific goal manifold. Some of these algorithms only require a set of vectors tangent to the target manifold to be computed, and thus provide a general method that can be applied to a diverse set of problems. Nevertheless, computing such vectors for an arbitrary manifold in a high dimensional state space remains highly challenging, which in practice limits the applicability of this approach. Here we demonstrate how topology and differential geometry can be leveraged to simplify this task, by first computing tangent vectors on a low-dimensional topological manifold and then embedding these in state space. The simplicity of this procedure greatly facilitates the creation of manifold-targeted RNNs, as well as the process of designing task-solving on-manifold dynamics. This new method should enable the application of network engineering-based approaches to a wide set of problems in neuroscience and machine learning. Furthermore, our description of how fundamental concepts from differential geometry can be mapped onto different aspects of neural dynamics is a further demonstration of how the language of differential geometry can enrich the conceptual framework for describing neural dynamics and computation.

                Hierarchical temporal dynamics are a fundamental computational property of the brain; however, there are no whole-brain, noninvasive investigations into timescales of neural processing in animal models. To that end, we used the spatial resolution and sensitivity of ultra-high field fMRI to probe timescales across the whole macaque brain. We uncovered within-species consistency between timescales estimated from fMRI and electrophysiology. Crucially, we were not only able to demonstrate that we can replicate existing electrophysiological hierarchies, but we extended these to whole brain topographies. Our results validate the complementary use of hemodynamic and electrophysiological intrinsic timescales, establishing a basis for future translational work. Second, with those results in hand, we were able to show that one facet of the high-dimensional FC topography of any region in the brain is closely related to hierarchical temporal dynamics. We demonstrated that intrinsic timescales are organized along spatial gradients that closely match functional connectivity gradient topographies across the whole brain. We conclude that intrinsic timescales are an unifying organizational principle of neural processing across the whole brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Novel and Functionally Diverse Class of Acetylcholine-gated Ion Channels</a></h4>

              
                Fast cholinergic neurotransmission is mediated by pentameric acetylcholine-gated ion channels; in particular, cationic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors play well-established roles in virtually all nervous systems. Acetylcholine-gated anion channels have also been identified in some invertebrate phyla, yet their roles in the nervous system are less well-understood. Here we describe the functional properties of five previously-uncharacterized acetylcholine-gated anion channels from C. elegans, including four from a novel nematode specific subfamily known as the diverse group. In addition to their activation by acetylcholine, these diverse group channels are activated at physiological concentrations by other ligands; three, encoded by the lgc-40, lgc-57 and lgc-58 genes, are activated by choline, while lgc-39 encoded channels are activated by octopamine and tyramine. Intriguingly, these and other acetylcholine-gated anion channels show extensive co-expression with cation-selective nicotinic receptors, implying that many cholinergic synapses may have both excitatory and inhibitory potential. Thus, the evolutionary expansion of cholinergic ligand-gated ion channels may enable complex synaptic signalling in an anatomically compact nervous system.

                Predatory animals first detect, then pursue, and ultimately capture prey. Sensory cues, including scent emitted by prey, are detected by the predator and used to guide pursuit. Because the pursuit phase can last for extended periods of time, it is critical for predators to persist in the chase even when prey is difficult to detect in a noisy sensory land-scape. It is equally important for predators to abandon pursuit if enough time has elapsed that prey capture is unlikely to occur. We studied prey detection and sustained pursuit in the mosquito Aedes aegypti, a micropredator of humans. These animals first detect hu-mans through sensory cues that are emitted at a distance such as carbon dioxide in breath and odor from skin. As the mosquito approaches a human, additional cues such as body heat and visual contrast signal the promise of a blood meal, which females need to produce eggs. To study how initial prey detection influences the duration of pursuit, we developed optogenetic tools to induce a brief fictive sensation of carbon dioxide and used machine learning-based classification of behavior to investigate how mosquitoes respond to subsequent human cues. We found that a 5-second optogenetic pulse of fictive carbon dioxide induced a persistent behavioral state in female mosquitoes that lasted for more than 10 minutes. This state is highly specific to females searching for a blood meal and was not induced in recently blood-fed females or in males, who do not feed on blood. In males that lack the gene fruitless, which controls persistent social behaviors in other insects, fictive carbon dioxide induced a long-lasting behavior response resembling the predatory state of females. Finally, we show that the persistent state triggered by detection of fictive carbon dioxide enabled females to engorge on a blood meal mimic offered up to 14 minutes after the initial stimulus. Our results demonstrate that a persistent internal state allows female mosquitoes to integrate multiple human sensory cues over long timescales, an ability that is key to their success as an apex micropredator of humans

                Theta oscillations (4-12 Hz) are dynamically modulated by speed and direction in freely moving animals. However, due to the paucity of electrophysiological recordings of freely moving humans, this mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we combined mobile-EEG with fully immersive virtual-reality to investigate theta dynamics in twenty-two healthy adults (aged 18-29 years old) freely navigating a T-maze to find rewards. Our results revealed three dynamic periods of theta modulation: 1) theta power increases coincided with the participants' decision-making period; 2) theta power increased for fast and leftward trials as subjects approached the goal location; and 3) feedback onset evoked two phase-locked theta bursts over the right temporal and frontal-midline channels. These results suggest that recording scalp EEG in freely moving humans navigating a simple virtual T-maze can be utilized as a powerful translational model by which to map theta dynamics during "real-life" goal-directed behavior in both health and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Minimum Perturbation Theory of Deep Perceptual Learning</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual learning (PL) involves long-lasting improvement in perceptual tasks following extensive training. Such improvement has been found to correlate with modifications in neuronal response properties in early as well as late sensory cortical areas. A major challenge is to dissect the causal relation between modification of the neural circuits and the behavioral changes. Previous theoretical and computational studies of PL have largely focused on single-layer model networks, and thus did not address salient characteristics of PL arising from the multiple-staged "deep" structure of the perceptual system. Here we develop a theory of PL in a deep neuronal network architecture, addressing the questions of how changes induced by PL are distributed across the multiple stages of cortex, and how do the respective changes determine the performance in fine discrimination tasks. We prove that in such tasks, modifications of synaptic weights of early sensory areas are both sufficient and necessary for PL. In addition, optimal synaptic weights in the deep network are not unique but span a large space of solutions. We postulate that, in the brain, plasticity throughout the deep network is distributed such that the resultant perturbation on prior circuit structures is minimized. In contrast to most previous models of PL, the minimum perturbation (MP) learning does not change the network readout weights. Our results provide mechanistic and normative explanations for several important physiological features of PL and reconcile apparently contradictory psychophysical findings.

                Training of autobiographical memory has been proposed as intervention to improve cognitive functions. The neural substrates for such improvements are poorly understood. Several brain networks have been previously linked to autobiographical recollections, including the default mode network (DMN) and the sensorimotor network. Here we tested the hypothesis that different neural networks support distinct aspects of memory improvement in response to training on a group of 59 subjects. We found that memory training increases DMN connectivity, and this associates with improved recollection of cue-specific memories. On the contrary, training decreased connectivity in the sensorimotor network, a decrease that correlated with improved ability for voluntary recall. Moreover, only decreased sensorimotor connectivity associated with training-induced decrease in the TNFalpha; immunological factor, which has been previously linked to improved cognitive performance. We identified functional and biochemical factors that associate with distinct memory processes improved by autobiographical training. Pathways which connect autobiographical memory to both high level cognition and somatic physiology are discussed.

                The understanding of brain network interactions in cognitively healthy older adults informs how brain characteristics vary as individuals age and how these variations affect cognitive functioning. A functional connectivity analysis can reveal important insight into the brain's organization, which is crucial to examining cognitive aging. We investigated functional network properties in 146 cognitively healthy participants aged 85+ in the McKnight Brain Aging Registry. We found that the segregation of the cortical association system and the segregation of the fronto-parietal network (FPN) were stronger predictors of cognition and executive function. Compared to other network metrics, the segregation of networks may be more closely linked with cognitive performance and age-related dedifferentiation. We also provide a healthy oldest-old (85+) cortical parcellation that can be used in future work in this age group. This study shows that network segregation of the oldest-old brain supports cognition. Specifically, the FPN plays an important role in supporting overall cognition and executive function in an aging population. By studying network dynamics and cognitive abilities of healthy brain aging, we advance the literature on dedifferentiation in the oldest-old.

                Causally relating the detailed structure and function of neural circuits to behavior requires the ability to precisely and simultaneously write-in and read-out neural activity. All optical systems that combine two photon (2p) calcium imaging and targeted photostimulation provide such an approach, but require co-expression of an activity indicator, such as GCaMP, and an optogenetic actuator, ideally a potent soma-targeted opsin. In the mammalian brain, such co-expression has so far been achieved by viral transduction, which is invasive and can produce variable, focal, and sometimes toxic overexpression. To overcome this challenge, we developed and validated a Cre-reporter mouse ("Ai203") that conditionally expresses a soma-targeted opsin, ChroME, fused to GCaMP7s. 1p or 2p illumination of expressing neurons in vitro and in vivo produces powerful, precise activation comparable to viral expression of ChroME. The soma-targeted GCaMP7s provides sensitive activity measurements for tracking physiological activity, and the soma-targeted ChroME provides powerful control over neural ensemble activity with holographic optogenetics. We further demonstrate the use of the Ai203 reporter line in 1p optogenetic manipulation of performance on a cortex-dependent visual task and in 2p synaptic connectivity mapping. This new transgenic line could thus greatly facilitate the study of neural circuits by providing a flexible, convenient, and stable tool for all-optical access to large, cell-type specific neural populations throughout the nervous system.

                Background Smokers vary in their motives for tobacco seeking, suggesting that they could benefit from personalized treatments. However, these variations have received little attention in animal models for the study of tobacco dependence. In the most classically used model, ie. intravenous self-administration of nicotine in the rat, seeking behaviour is reinforced by the combination of intravenous nicotine with a discrete stimulus (eg. discrete cue light). In both human and animals, two types of psychopharmacological interactions between nicotine and environmental stimuli have been evidenced. Whether these two types of interactions contribute equally to nicotine seeking in all individuals is unknown. Methods We combined behavioural pharmacology and clustering analysis. In an outbred male rat population, we tested whether nicotine and the discrete nicotine-associated cue light contributed equally to self-administration in all individuals. Two clusters of rats were identified, in which we further studied the nature of the psychopharmacological interaction between nicotine and the cue, as well as the response to the cessation aid varenicline when nicotine was withdrawn. Results Notably, withdrawing nicotine produced drastic opposed effects on seeking behavior in the two identified clusters of rats; a 50% increase vs a 18% decrease, respectively. The first cluster of rats sought for the primary reinforcing effects of nicotine and the discrete cue light that has gained nicotine-like secondary reinforcing properties. The second cluster sought nicotine for its ability to enhance the primary reinforcing effects of the discrete cue light. Critically, the approved cessation aid Varenicline counteracted the absence of nicotine in both, but eventually decreasing seeking in the former but increasing it in the latter. Conclusions Classical rodent models for the study of the reinforcing and addictive effects of nicotine hide individual variations in the psychopharmacological motives supporting seeking behavior. These variations may be a decisive asset for improving their predictive validity in the perspective of precision medicine for smoking cessation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Attractor Decision Network with Selective Inhibition</a></h4>

              
                The ability to decide swiftly and accurately in an urgent scenario is crucial for an organism's survival. The neural mechanisms underlying the perceptual decision and trade-off between speed and accuracy have been extensively studied in the past few decades. Among several theoretical models, the attractor neural network model has successfully captured both behavioral and neuronal data observed in many decision experiments. However, a recent experimental study revealed additional details that were not considered in the original attractor model. In particular, the study shows that the inhibitory neurons in the posterior parietal cortex of mice are as selective to decision making results as the excitatory neurons, whereas the original attractor model assumes the inhibitory neurons to be unselective. In this study, we investigate a more general attractor model with selective inhibition, and analyze in detail how the computational ability of the network changes with selectivity. We proposed a reduced model for the selective model, and showed that selectivity adds a time-varying component to the energy landscape. This time dependence of the energy landscape allows the selective model to integrate information carefully in initial stages, then quickly converge to an attractor once the choice is clear. This results in the selective model having a more efficient speed-accuracy trade-off that is unreachable by unselective models.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Oxytocin‐like receptor expression in evolutionarily conserved nodes of a vocal network associated with male courtship in a teleost fish</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuropeptides, including oxytocin-like peptides, are a conserved group of hormones that regulate a wide range of social behaviors, including vocal communication. In the current study, we evaluate whether putative brain sites for the actions of isotocin (IT), the oxytocin (OT) homolog of teleost fishes, are associated with vocal courtship and circuitry in the plainfin midshipman fish (<i>Porichthys notatus</i>). During the breeding season, nesting males produce advertisement calls known as ‘hums’ to acoustically court females at night and attract them to nests. We first identify IT receptor (ITR) mRNA in evolutionarily conserved regions of the forebrain preoptic area (POA), anterior hypothalamus (AH), and midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG), and in two topographically separate populations within the hindbrain vocal pattern generator– duration-coding vocal prepacemaker (VPP) and amplitude-coding vocal motor (VMN) nuclei that also innervate vocal muscles. We also verify that ITR expression overlaps known distribution sites of OT-like immunoreactive fibers. Next, using phosphorylated ribosomal subunit 6 (pS6) as a marker for activated neurons, we demonstrate that ITR-containing neurons in the anterior parvocellular POA, AH, PAG, VPP, and VMN are activated in humming males. Posterior parvocellular and magno/gigantocellular divisions of the POA remain constitutively active in non-humming males that are also in a reproductive state. Together with prior studies of midshipman fish and other vertebrates, our findings suggest that IT-signaling influences male courtship behavior, in part, by acting on brain regions that broadly influence behavioral state (POA) as well as the initiation (POA, PAG) and temporal structure (VPP, VMN) of advertisement hums.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) proteins (GSK3&alpha; and GSK3&beta;) are key mediators of signaling pathways, with crucial roles in coordinating fundamental biological processes during neural development. Here we show that the complete loss of GSK3 signaling in mouse retinal progenitors leads to microphthalmia with broad morphologic defects. A single wild-type allele of either <I>Gsk3&alpha;</I> or <I>Gsk3&beta;</I> is able to rescue this phenotype. In this genetic context, all cell types are present in a functional retina. However, we unexpectedly detected a large number of cells in the inner nuclear layer expressing retinal ganglion cell (RGC)-specific markers (called displaced RGCs, dRGCs) when at least one allele of <I>Gsk3&alpha;</I> is expressed. The excess of dRGCs leads to an increased number of axons projecting into the ipsilateral medial terminal nucleus, an area of the brain belonging to the non-image-forming visual circuit and poorly targeted by RGCs in wild-type retina. Transcriptome analysis and optomotor response assay suggest that at least a subset of dRGCs in <I>Gsk3</I> mutant mice are direction-selective RGCs. Our study thus uncovers a unique role of GSK3 in controlling the production of ganglion cells in the inner nuclear layer, which correspond to dRGCs, a rare and poorly characterized retinal cell type.</p>

To determine the key type 2 diabetes-related factor that produces AIS shortening we modified levels of insulin, glucose, or the reactive glucose metabolite methylglyoxal in cultures of dissociated cortices from male and female mice and quantified AIS geometry using immunofluorescent imaging of the AIS proteins AnkyrinG and &beta;IV spectrin. Neither insulin nor glucose modification altered AIS length. Exposure to 100 but not 1 or 10 &mu;<scp>m</scp> methylglyoxal for 24 h resulted in accumulation of the methylglyoxal-derived advanced glycation end-product hydroimidazolone and produced reversible AIS shortening without cell death. Methylglyoxal-evoked AIS shortening occurred in both excitatory and putative inhibitory neuron populations and in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX). In single-cell recordings resting membrane potential was depolarized at 0.5&ndash;3 h and returned to normal at 24 h. In multielectrode array (MEA) recordings methylglyoxal produced an immediate ~300% increase in spiking and bursting rates that returned to normal within 2 min, followed by a ~20% reduction of network activity at 0.5&ndash;3 h and restoration of activity to baseline levels at 24 h. AIS length was unchanged at 0.5&ndash;3 h despite the presence of depolarization and network activity reduction. Nevertheless, these results suggest that methylglyoxal could be a key mediator of AIS shortening and disruptor of neuronal function during type 2 diabetes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">3D-Printed Pacifier-Shaped Mouthpiece for fMRI-Compatible Gustometers</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Gustometers have made it possible to deliver liquids in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) settings for decades, and mouthpieces are a critical part of these taste delivery systems. Here, we propose an innovative 3D-printed fMRI mouthpiece inspired by children&rsquo;s pacifiers, allowing human participants to swallow while lying down in an MRI scanner. We used a large sample to validate the effectiveness of our method. The results suggest that the mouthpiece can be used to deliver taste stimuli by showing significant clusters of activation in the insular and piriform cortex, which are regions that have been consistently identified in taste processing. This mouthpiece fulfills several criteria guaranteeing a gustatory stimulus of quality, making the delivery precise and reliable. Moreover, this new pacifier-shaped design is simple and cheap to manufacture, hygienic, comfortable to keep in the mouth, and flexible to use in diverse cases. We hope that this new method will promote and facilitate the study of taste and flavor perception in the context of reward processing in affective neuroscience, and thus, help provide an integrative approach to the study of the emotional nature of rewards.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Photoreceptor cKO of OTX2 Enhances OTX2 Intercellular Transfer in the Retina and Causes Photophobia</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>In the mature mouse retina, <I>Otx2</I> is expressed in both retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptor (PR) cells, and <I>Otx2</I> knock-out (KO) in the RPE alone results in PR degeneration. To study the cell-autonomous function of OTX2 in PRs, we performed PR-specific <I>Otx2</I> KO (cKO) in adults. As expected, the protein disappears completely from PR nuclei but is still observed in PR inner and outer segments while its level concomitantly decreases in the RPE, suggesting a transfer of OTX2 from RPE to PRs in response to <I>Otx2</I> ablation in PRs. The ability of OTX2 to transfer from RPE to PRs was verified by viral expression of tagged-OTX2 in the RPE. Transferred OTX2 distributed across the PR cytoplasm, suggesting functions distinct from nuclear transcription regulation. PR-specific <I>Otx2</I> cKO did not alter the structure of the retina but impaired the translocation of PR arrestin-1 on illumination changes, making mice photophobic. RNA-seq analyses following <I>Otx2</I> KO revealed downregulation of genes involved in the cytoskeleton that might account for the arrestin-1 translocation defect, and of genes involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) and signaling factors that may participate in the enhanced transfer of OTX2. Interestingly, several RPE-specific OTX2 target genes involved in melanogenesis were downregulated, lending weight to a decrease of OTX2 levels in the RPE following PR-specific <I>Otx2</I> cKO. Our study reveals a new role of endogenous OTX2 in PR light adaptation and demonstrates the existence of OTX2 transfer from RPE to PR cells, which is increased on PR-specific <I>Otx2</I> ablation and might participate in PR neuroprotection.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Axonal CB1 Receptors Mediate Inhibitory Bouton Formation via cAMP Increase and PKA</a></h4>

              
                <p>Experience-dependent formation and removal of inhibitory synapses are essential throughout life. For instance, GABAergic synapses are removed to facilitate learning, and strong excitatory activity is accompanied by the formation of inhibitory synapses to maintain coordination between excitation and inhibition. We recently discovered that active dendrites trigger the growth of inhibitory synapses via CB1 receptor-mediated endocannabinoid signaling, but the underlying mechanism remained unclear. Using two-photon microscopy to monitor the formation of individual inhibitory boutons in hippocampal organotypic slices from mice (both sexes), we found that CB1 receptor activation mediated the formation of inhibitory boutons and promoted their subsequent stabilization. Inhibitory bouton formation did not require neuronal activity and was independent of G<SUB>i/o</SUB>-protein signaling, but was directly induced by elevating cAMP levels using forskolin and by activating G<SUB>s</SUB>-proteins using DREADDs. Blocking PKA activity prevented CB1 receptor-mediated inhibitory bouton formation. Our findings reveal that axonal CB1 receptors signal via unconventional downstream pathways and that inhibitory bouton formation is triggered by an increase in axonal cAMP levels. Our results demonstrate an unexpected role for axonal CB1 receptors in axon-specific, and context-dependent, inhibitory synapse formation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Coordination between excitation and inhibition is required for proper brain function throughout life. It was previously shown that new inhibitory synapses can be formed in response to strong excitation to maintain this coordination, and this was mediated by endocannabinoid signaling via CB1 receptors. As activation of CB1 receptors generally results in the suppression of synaptic transmission, it remained unclear how CB1 receptors can mediate the formation of inhibitory synapses. Here we show that CB1 receptors on inhibitory axons signal via unconventional intracellular pathways and that inhibitory bouton formation is triggered by an increase in axonal cAMP levels and requires PKA activity. Our findings point to a central role for axonal cAMP signaling in activity-dependent inhibitory synapse formation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">MicroRNA-Dependent Control of Sensory Neuron Function Regulates Posture Behavior in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                <p>All what we see, touch, hear, taste, or smell must first be detected by the sensory elements of our nervous system. Sensory neurons, therefore, represent a critical component in all neural circuits and their correct function is essential for the generation of behavior and adaptation to the environment. Here, we report that the evolutionarily-conserved microRNA (miRNA) <I>miR-263b</I> plays a key behavioral role in <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I> through effects on the function of larval sensory neurons. Several independent experiments (in 50:50 male:female populations) support this finding: first, miRNA expression analysis, via reporter expression and fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS)-quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis, demonstrate <I>miR-263b</I> expression in larval sensory neurons. Second, behavioral tests in <I>miR-263b</I> null mutants show defects in self-righting, an innate and evolutionarily conserved posture-control behavior that allows larvae to rectify their position if turned upside-down. Third, competitive inhibition of <I>miR-263b</I> in sensory neurons using a <I>miR-263b</I> "sponge" leads to self-righting defects. Fourth, systematic analysis of sensory neurons in <I>miR-263b</I> mutants shows no detectable morphologic defects in their stereotypic pattern, while genetically-encoded calcium sensors expressed in the sensory domain reveal a reduction in neural activity in <I>miR-263b</I> mutants. Fifth, <I>miR-263b</I> null mutants show reduced "touch-response" behavior and a compromised response to sound, both characteristic of larval sensory deficits. Furthermore, bioinformatic miRNA target analysis, gene expression assays, and behavioral phenocopy experiments suggest that <I>miR-263b</I> might exert its effects, at least in part, through repression of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor <I>Atonal</I>. Altogether, our study suggests a model in which miRNA-dependent control of transcription factor expression affects sensory function and behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Sensory neurons are key to neural circuit function, but how these neurons acquire their specific properties is not well understood. Here, we examine this problem, focusing on the roles played by microRNAs (miRNAs). Using <I>Drosophila</I>, we demonstrate that the evolutionarily-conserved miRNA <I>miR-263b</I> controls sensory neuron function allowing the animal to perform an adaptive, elaborate three-dimensional movement. Our work thus shows that microRNAs can control complex motor behaviors by modulating sensory neuron physiology, and suggests that similar miRNA-dependent mechanisms may operate in other species. The work contributes to advance the understanding of the molecular basis of behavior and the biological roles of microRNAs within the nervous system.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">CDK14 Promotes Axon Regeneration by Regulating the Noncanonical Wnt Signaling Pathway in a Kinase-Independent Manner</a></h4>

              
                <p>The postinjury regenerative capacity of neurons is known to be mediated by a complex interaction of intrinsic regenerative pathways and external cues. In <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I>, the initiation of axon regeneration is regulated by the nonmuscle myosin light chain-4 (MLC-4) phosphorylation signaling pathway. In this study, we have identified <I>svh-16</I>/<I>cdk-14</I>, a mammalian CDK14 homolog, as a positive regulator of axon regeneration in motor neurons. We then isolated the CDK-14-binding protein MIG-5/Disheveled (Dsh) and found that EGL-20/Wnt and the MIG-1/Frizzled receptor (Fz) are required for efficient axon regeneration. Further, we demonstrate that CDK-14 activates EPHX-1, the <I>C. elegans</I> homolog of the mammalian ephexin Rho-type GTPase guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), in a kinase-independent manner. EPHX-1 functions as a GEF for the CDC-42 GTPase, inhibiting myosin phosphatase, which maintains MLC-4 phosphorylation. These results suggest that CDK14 activates the RhoGEF&ndash;CDC42&ndash;MLC phosphorylation axis in a noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway that promotes axon regeneration.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Noncanonical Wnt signaling is mediated by Frizzled receptor (Fz), Disheveled (Dsh), Rho-type GTPase, and nonmuscle myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation. This study identified <I>svh-16</I>/<I>cdk-14</I>, which encodes a mammalian CDK14 homolog, as a regulator of axon regeneration in <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I> motor neurons. We show that CDK-14 binds to MIG-5/Dsh, and that EGL-20/Wnt, MIG-1/Fz, and EPHX-1/RhoGEF are required for axon regeneration. The phosphorylation-mimetic MLC-4 suppressed axon regeneration defects in <I>mig-1</I>, <I>cdk-14</I>, and <I>ephx-1</I> mutants. CDK-14 mediates kinase-independent activation of EPHX-1, which functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for CDC-42 GTPase. Activated CDC-42 inactivates myosin phosphatase and thereby maintains MLC phosphorylation. Thus, the noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway controls axon regeneration via the CDK-14&ndash;EPHX-1&ndash;CDC-42&ndash;MLC phosphorylation axis.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">mTOR Signaling Regulates Metabolic Function in Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells and Promotes Efficient Brain Remyelination in the Cuprizone Model</a></h4>

              
                <p>In demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, primary loss of myelin and subsequent neuronal degeneration throughout the CNS impair patient functionality. While the importance of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling during developmental myelination is known, no studies have yet directly examined the function of mTOR signaling specifically in the oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage during remyelination. Here, we conditionally deleted <I>Mtor</I> from adult oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) using <I>Ng2-Cre<sup>ERT</sup></I> in male adult mice to test its function in new OLs responsible for remyelination. During early remyelination after cuprizone-induced demyelination, mice lacking mTOR in adult OPCs had unchanged OL numbers but thinner myelin. Myelin thickness recovered by late-stage repair, suggesting a delay in myelin production when <I>Mtor</I> is deleted from adult OPCs. Surprisingly, loss of mTOR in OPCs had no effect on efficiency of remyelination after lysophosphatidylcholine lesions in either the spinal cord or corpus callosum, suggesting that mTOR signaling functions specifically in a pathway dysregulated by cuprizone to promote remyelination efficiency. We further determined that cuprizone and inhibition of mTOR cooperatively compromise metabolic function in primary rat OLs undergoing differentiation. Together, our results support the conclusion that mTOR signaling in OPCs is required to overcome the metabolic dysfunction in the cuprizone-demyelinated adult brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Impaired remyelination by oligodendrocytes contributes to the progressive pathology in multiple sclerosis, so it is critical to identify mechanisms of improving remyelination. The goal of this study was to examine mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in remyelination. Here, we provide evidence that mTOR signaling promotes efficient remyelination of the brain after cuprizone-mediated demyelination but has no effect on remyelination after lysophosphatidylcholine demyelination in the spinal cord or brain. We also present novel data revealing that mTOR inhibition and cuprizone treatment additively affect the metabolic profile of differentiating oligodendrocytes, supporting a mechanism for the observed remyelination delay. These data suggest that altered metabolic function may underlie failure of remyelination in multiple sclerosis lesions and that mTOR signaling may be of therapeutic potential for promoting remyelination.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Decapentaplegic Acutely Defines the Connectivity of Central Pacemaker Neurons in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                <p>Rhythmic rest-activity cycles are controlled by an endogenous clock. In <I>Drosophila</I>, this clock resides in ~150 neurons organized in clusters whose hierarchy changes in response to environmental conditions. The concerted activity of the circadian network is necessary for the adaptive responses to synchronizing environmental stimuli. Thus far, work was devoted to unravel the logic of the coordination of different clusters focusing on neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. We further explored communication in the adult male brain through ligands belonging to the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway. Herein we show that the lateral ventral neurons (LNvs) express the small morphogen decapentaplegic (DPP). DPP expression in the large LNvs triggered a period lengthening phenotype, the downregulation of which caused reduced rhythmicity and affected anticipation at dawn and dusk, underscoring DPP per se conveys time-of-day relevant information. Surprisingly, DPP expression in the large LNvs impaired circadian remodeling of the small LNv axonal terminals, likely through local modulation of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Trio. These findings open the provocative possibility that the BMP pathway is recruited to strengthen/reduce the connectivity among specific clusters along the day and thus modulate the contribution of the clusters to the circadian network.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The circadian clock relies on the communication between groups of so-called clock neurons to coordinate physiology and behavior to the optimal times across the day, predicting and adapting to a changing environment. The circadian network relies on neurotransmitters and neuropeptides to fine-tune connectivity among clock neurons and thus give rise to a coherent output. Herein we show that decapentaplegic, a ligand belonging to the BMP retrograde signaling pathway required for coordinated growth during development, is recruited by a group of circadian neurons in the adult brain to trigger structural remodeling of terminals on a daily basis.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Inner Hemispheric and Interhemispheric Connectivity Balance in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>The connectome of the brain has a great impact on the function of the brain as the structure of the connectome affects the speed and efficiency of information transfer. As a highly energy-consuming organ, an efficient network structure is essential. A previous study has shown consistent overall brain connectivity across a large variety of species. This connectivity conservation was explained by a balance between interhemispheric and intrahemispheric connections; that is, spices with highly connected hemispheres appear to have weaker interhemisphere connections. This study examines this connectivity trade-off in the human brain using diffusion-based tractography and network analysis in the Human Connectome Project (970 subjects, 527 female). We explore the biological origins of this phenomenon, heritability, and the effect on cognitive measures.</p>
<p>The proportion of commissural fibers in the brain had a negative correlation to hemispheric efficiency, pointing to a trade-off between inner hemispheric and interhemispheric connectivity. Network hubs including anterior and middle cingulate cortex, superior frontal areas, medial occipital areas, the parahippocampal gyrus, post- and precentral gyri, and the precuneus had the strongest contribution to this phenomenon. Other results show a high heritability as well as a strong connection to crystalized intelligence. This work presents cohort-based network analysis research, spanning a large variety of samples and exploring the overall architecture of the human connectome. Our results show a connectivity conservation phenomenon at the base of the overall brain network architecture. This network structure may explain much of the functional, behavioral, and cognitive variability among different brains.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The network structure of the brain is at the basis of every brain function as it dictates the characteristics of information transfer. Understanding the patterns and mechanisms that guide the connectome structure is crucial to understanding the brain itself. Here we unravel the mechanism at the base of the connectivity conservation phenomenon by exploring the interaction between hemispheric and commissural connectivity in a large-scale cohort-based connectivity study. We describe the trade-off between the two components and examine the origins of the trade-off and observe the effect on cognitive abilities and behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Ultra-High-Field Neuroimaging Reveals Fine-Scale Processing for 3D Perception</a></h4>

              
                <p>Binocular disparity provides critical information about three-dimensional (3D) structures to support perception and action. In the past decade significant progress has been made in uncovering human brain areas engaged in the processing of binocular disparity signals. Yet, the fine-scale brain processing underlying 3D perception remains unknown. Here, we use ultra-high-field (7T) functional imaging at submillimeter resolution to examine fine-scale BOLD fMRI signals involved in 3D perception. In particular, we sought to interrogate the local circuitry involved in disparity processing by sampling fMRI responses at different positions relative to the cortical surface (i.e., across cortical depths corresponding to layers). We tested for representations related to 3D perception by presenting participants (male and female, <I>N</I> = 8) with stimuli that enable stable stereoscopic perception [i.e., correlated random dot stereograms (RDS)] versus those that do not (i.e., anticorrelated RDS). Using multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA), we demonstrate cortical depth-specific representations in areas V3A and V7 as indicated by stronger pattern responses for correlated than for anticorrelated stimuli in upper rather than deeper layers. Examining informational connectivity, we find higher feedforward layer-to-layer connectivity for correlated than anticorrelated stimuli between V3A and V7. Further, we observe disparity-specific feedback from V3A to V1 and from V7 to V3A. Our findings provide evidence for the role of V3A as a key nexus for disparity processing, which is implicated in feedforward and feedback signals related to the perceptual estimation of 3D structures.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Binocular vision plays a significant role in supporting our interactions with the surrounding environment. The fine-scale neural mechanisms that underlie the brain's skill in extracting 3D structures from binocular signals are poorly understood. Here, we capitalize on recent advances in ultra-high-field functional imaging to interrogate human brain circuits involved in 3D perception at submillimeter resolution. We provide evidence for the role of area V3A as a key nexus for disparity processing, which is implicated in feedforward and feedback signals related to the perceptual estimation of 3D structures from binocular signals. These fine-scale measurements help bridge the gap between animal neurophysiology and human fMRI studies investigating cross-scale circuits, from micro circuits to global brain networks for 3D perception.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Perceptual and Semantic Representations at Encoding Contribute to True and False Recognition of Objects</a></h4>

              
                <p>When encoding new episodic memories, visual and semantic processing is proposed to make distinct contributions to accurate memory and memory distortions. Here, we used fMRI and preregistered representational similarity analysis to uncover the representations that predict true and false recognition of unfamiliar objects. Two semantic models captured coarse-grained taxonomic categories and specific object features, respectively, while two perceptual models embodied low-level visual properties. Twenty-eight female and male participants encoded images of objects during fMRI scanning, and later had to discriminate studied objects from similar lures and novel objects in a recognition memory test. Both perceptual and semantic models predicted true memory. When studied objects were later identified correctly, neural patterns corresponded to low-level visual representations of these object images in the early visual cortex, lingual, and fusiform gyri. In a similar fashion, alignment of neural patterns with fine-grained semantic feature representations in the fusiform gyrus also predicted true recognition. However, emphasis on coarser taxonomic representations predicted forgetting more anteriorly in the anterior ventral temporal cortex, left inferior frontal gyrus and, in an exploratory analysis, left perirhinal cortex. In contrast, false recognition of similar lure objects was associated with weaker visual analysis posteriorly in early visual and left occipitotemporal cortex. The results implicate multiple perceptual and semantic representations in successful memory encoding and suggest that fine-grained semantic as well as visual analysis contributes to accurate later recognition, while processing visual image detail is critical for avoiding false recognition errors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> People are able to store detailed memories of many similar objects. We offer new insights into the encoding of these specific memories by combining fMRI with explicit models of how image properties and object knowledge are represented in the brain. When people processed fine-grained visual properties in occipital and posterior temporal cortex, they were more likely to recognize the objects later and less likely to falsely recognize similar objects. In contrast, while object-specific feature representations in fusiform gyrus predicted accurate memory, coarse-grained categorical representations in frontal and temporal regions predicted forgetting. The data provide the first direct tests of theoretical assumptions about encoding true and false memories, suggesting that semantic representations contribute to specific memories as well as errors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Gait-Phase Modulates Alpha and Beta Oscillations in the Pedunculopontine Nucleus</a></h4>

              
                <p>The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) is a reticular collection of neurons at the junction of the midbrain and pons, playing an important role in modulating posture and locomotion. Deep brain stimulation of the PPN has been proposed as an emerging treatment for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) or multiple system atrophy (MSA) who have gait-related atypical parkinsonian syndromes. In this study, we investigated PPN activities during gait to better understand its functional role in locomotion. Specifically, we investigated whether PPN activity is rhythmically modulated by gait cycles during locomotion. PPN local field potential (LFP) activities were recorded from PD or MSA patients with gait difficulties during stepping in place or free walking. Simultaneous measurements from force plates or accelerometers were used to determine the phase within each gait cycle at each time point. Our results showed that activities in the alpha and beta frequency bands in the PPN LFPs were rhythmically modulated by the gait phase within gait cycles, with a higher modulation index when the stepping rhythm was more regular. Meanwhile, the PPN&ndash;cortical coherence was most prominent in the alpha band. Both gait phase-related modulation in the alpha/beta power and the PPN&ndash;cortical coherence in the alpha frequency band were spatially specific to the PPN and did not extend to surrounding regions. These results suggest that alternating PPN modulation may support gait control. Whether enhancing alternating PPN modulation by stimulating in an alternating fashion could positively affect gait control remains to be tested.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The therapeutic efficacy of pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) and the extent to which it can improve quality of life are still inconclusive. Understanding how PPN activity is modulated by stepping or walking may offer insight into how to improve the efficacy of PPN DBS in ameliorating gait difficulties. Our study shows that PPN alpha and beta activity was modulated by the gait phase, and that this was most pronounced when the stepping rhythm was regular. It remains to be tested whether enhancing alternating PPN modulation by stimulating in an alternating fashion could positively affect gait control.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Medial Frontal Cortex Activity Predicts Information Sampling in Economic Choice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Decision-making not only requires agents to decide what to choose but also how much information to sample before committing to a choice. Previously established frameworks for economic choice argue for a deliberative process of evidence accumulation across time. These tacitly acknowledge a role of information sampling in that decisions are only made once sufficient evidence is acquired, yet few experiments have explicitly placed information sampling under the participant's control. Here, we use fMRI to investigate the neural basis of information sampling in economic choice by allowing participants (<I>n</I> = 30, sex not recorded) to actively sample information in a multistep decision task. We show that medial frontal cortex (MFC) activity is predictive of further information sampling before choice. Choice difficulty (inverse value difference, keeping sensory difficulty constant) was also encoded in MFC, but this effect was explained away by the inclusion of information sampling as a coregressor in the general linear model. A distributed network of regions across the prefrontal cortex encoded key features of the sampled information at the time it was presented. We propose that MFC is an important controller of the extent to which information is gathered before committing to an economic choice. This role may explain why MFC activity has been associated with evidence accumulation in previous studies in which information sampling was an implicit rather than explicit feature of the decision.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The decisions we make are determined by the information we have sampled before committing to a choice. Accumulator frameworks of decision-making tacitly acknowledge the need to sample further information during the evidence accumulation process until a decision boundary is reached. However, relatively few studies explicitly place this decision to sample further information under the participant's control. In this fMRI study, we find that MFC activity is related to information sampling decisions in a multistep economic choice task. This suggests that an important role of evidence representations within MFC may be to guide adaptive sequential decisions to sample further information before committing to a final decision.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">PI3K{gamma}/AKT Signaling in High Molecular Weight Hyaluronan (HMWH)-Induced Anti-Hyperalgesia and Reversal of Nociceptor Sensitization</a></h4>

              
                <p>High molecular weight hyaluronan (HMWH), a well-established treatment for osteoarthritis pain, is anti-hyperalgesic in preclinical models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. HMWH-induced anti-hyperalgesia is mediated by its action at cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44), the cognate hyaluronan receptor, which can signal via phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), a large family of kinases involved in diverse cell functions. We demonstrate that intrathecal administration of an oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) antisense to mRNA for PI3K (a Class I PI3K isoform) expressed in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs), and intradermal administration of a PI3K-selective inhibitor (AS605240), markedly attenuates HMWH-induced anti-prostaglandin E<SUB>2</SUB> (PGE<SUB>2</SUB>) hyperalgesia, in male and female rats. Intradermal administration of inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR; rapamycin) and protein kinase B (AKT; AKT Inhibitor IV), signaling molecules downstream of PI3K, also attenuates HMWH-induced anti-hyperalgesia. <I>In vitro</I> patch-clamp electrophysiology experiments on cultured nociceptors from male rats demonstrate that some HMWH-induced changes in generation of action potentials (APs) in nociceptors sensitized by PGE<SUB>2</SUB> are PI3K dependent (reduction in AP firing rate, increase in latency to first AP and increase in slope of current ramp required to induce AP) and some are PI3K independent [reduction in recovery rate of AP afterhyperpolarization (AHP)]. Our demonstration of a role of PI3K in HMWH-induced anti-hyperalgesia and reversal of nociceptor sensitization opens a novel line of research into molecular targets for the treatment of diverse pain syndromes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We have previously demonstrated that high molecular weight hyaluronan (HMWH) attenuates inflammatory hyperalgesia, an effect mediated by its action at cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44), the cognate hyaluronan receptor, and activation of its downstream signaling pathway, in nociceptors. In the present study, we demonstrate that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and downstream signaling pathway, protein kinase B (AKT) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), are crucial for HMWH to induce anti-hyperalgesia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Asymmetric Frequency-Specific Feedforward and Feedback Information Flow between Hippocampus and Prefrontal Cortex during Verbal Memory Encoding and Recall</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) circuits are thought to play a prominent role in human episodic memory, but the precise nature, and electrophysiological basis, of directed information flow between these regions and their role in verbal memory formation has remained elusive. Here we investigate nonlinear causal interactions between hippocampus and lateral PFC using intracranial EEG recordings (26 participants, 16 females) during verbal memory encoding and recall tasks. Direction-specific information theoretic analysis revealed higher causal information flow from the hippocampus to PFC than in the reverse direction. Crucially, this pattern was observed during both memory encoding and recall, and the strength of causal interactions was significantly greater during memory task performance than resting baseline. Further analyses revealed frequency specificity of interactions with greater causal information flow from hippocampus to the PFC in the delta-theta frequency band (0.5-8 Hz); in contrast, PFC to hippocampus causal information flow were stronger in the beta band (12-30 Hz). Across all hippocampus-PFC electrode pairs, propagation delay between the source and target signals was estimated to be 17.7 ms, which is physiologically meaningful and corresponds to directional signal interactions on a timescale consistent with monosynaptic influence. Our findings identify distinct asymmetric feedforward and feedback signaling mechanisms between the hippocampus and PFC and their dissociable roles in memory recall, demonstrate that these regions preferentially use different frequency channels, and provide novel insights into the electrophysiological basis of directed information flow during episodic memory formation in the human brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hippocampal-PFC circuits play a critical role in episodic memory in rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans. Investigations using noninvasive fMRI techniques have provided insights into coactivation of the hippocampus and PFC during memory formation; however, the electrophysiological basis of dynamic causal hippocampal-PFC interactions in the human brain is poorly understood. Here, we use data from a large cohort of intracranial EEG recordings to investigate the neurophysiological underpinnings of asymmetric feedforward and feedback hippocampal-PFC interactions and their nonlinear causal dynamics during both episodic memory encoding and recall. Our findings provide novel insights into the electrophysiological basis of directed bottom-up and top-down information flow during episodic memory formation in the human brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Spinal Cord Injury Induces Permanent Reprogramming of Microglia into a Disease-Associated State Which Contributes to Functional Recovery</a></h4>

              
                <p>Microglia are resident myeloid cells of the CNS. Recently, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) has enabled description of a disease-associated microglia (DAM) with a role in neurodegeneration and demyelination. In this study, we use scRNAseq to investigate the temporal dynamics of immune cells harvested from the epicenter of traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) induced in female mice. We find that as a consequence of SCI, baseline microglia undergo permanent transcriptional reprogramming into a previously uncharacterized subtype of microglia with striking similarities to previously reported DAM as well as a distinct microglial state found during development. Using a microglia depletion model we showed that DAM in SCI are derived from baseline microglia and strongly enhance recovery of hindlimb locomotor function following injury.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Although disease-associated microglia (DAM) have been the subject of strong research interest during recent years (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B14">Keren-Shaul, 2017</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B13">Jord&atilde;o, 2019</cross-ref>), their cellular origin and their role in "normal" acute injury processes is not well understood. Our work directly addresses the origin and the role of DAM in traumatic injury response. Further, we use a microglia depletion model to prove that DAM in spinal cord injury (SCI) are indeed derived from homeostatic microglia, and that they strongly enhance recovery. Thus, in this work we significantly expand the knowledge of immune response to traumatic injury, demonstrate the applicability to human injury via our unique access to injured human spinal cord tissue, and provide the community with a comprehensive dataset for further exploration.</p>

                Background: Linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) applies to sharp cracks, although crack sites such as holes and slots are often blunt cracks with nonzero widths. The advancement in finite element method (FEM) has enabled the calculation of stress intensity factor (SIF) for unstable crack growth prediction, regardless of crack shape and size, but the calculations often differ from contour to contour. Hence, the purpose of this work is to determine if SIFs computed using commercial FEM have experimentally verifiable advantages over the traditional stress-based modelling approaches in predicting Mode I brittle failure at blunt crack tip. Methods: Experiments and simulations were conducted on brittle Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) plastic to compare the actual and predicted strain fields and SIFs at crack tip, and the critical force at which unstable crack growth initiates. A centrally straight cracked Brazilian disc made of PMMA was subjected to purely Mode I fracture. Its strain fields were measured from deformed speckle patterns using digital image correlation software. The same disc was modelled using plane stress model in FEM. By applying the critical force, SIFs were then computed using ANSYS pre-meshed crack method at different contours away from the crack tip. The effects of element type, mesh size and crack width on the simulated SIFs were investigated. Results: It was found that the experimental critical load agreed well with LEFM prediction based on PMMA fracture toughness in published literature. Disc failure happened at the first sign of tensile yield at the crack tip in the finite element model with a triangle mesh. Digital image correlation clearly shows the occurrence of unstable crack growth at critical force. It also shows comparable far field strain responses to the FEM model. Conclusions: The computed SIFs were inconsistent, and their usefulness in predicting unstable crack growth requires further investigation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Comprehensive analysis of lectin-glycan interactions reveals determinants of lectin specificity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniel E. Mattox, Chris Bailey-Kellogg</p>

Lectin-glycan interactions facilitate inter- and intracellular communication in many processes including protein trafficking, host-pathogen recognition, and tumorigenesis promotion. Specific recognition of glycans by lectins is also the basis for a wide range of applications in areas including glycobiology research, cancer screening, and antiviral therapeutics. To provide a better understanding of the determinants of lectin-glycan interaction specificity and support such applications, this study comprehensively investigates specificity-conferring features of all available lectin-glycan complex structures. Systematic characterization, comparison, and predictive modeling of a set of 221 complementary physicochemical and geometric features representing these interactions highlighted specificity-conferring features with potential mechanistic insight. Univariable comparative analyses with weighted Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests revealed strong statistical associations between binding site features and specificity that are conserved across unrelated lectin binding sites. Multivariable modeling with random forests demonstrated the utility of these features for predicting the identity of bound glycans based on generalized patterns learned from non-homologous lectins. These analyses revealed <i>global</i> determinants of lectin specificity, such as sialic acid glycan recognition in deep, concave binding sites enriched for positively charged residues, in contrast to high mannose glycan recognition in fairly shallow but well-defined pockets enriched for non-polar residues. Focused <i>fine specificity</i> analysis of hemagglutinin interactions with human-like and avian-like glycans uncovered features representing both known and novel mutations related to shifts in influenza tropism from avian to human tissues. As the approach presented here relies on co-crystallized lectin-glycan pairs for studying specificity, it is limited in its inferences by the quantity, quality, and diversity of the structural data available. Regardless, the systematic characterization of lectin binding sites presented here provides a novel approach to studying lectin specificity and is a step towards confidently predicting new lectin-glycan interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A metric for evaluating biological information in gene sets and its application to identify co-expressed gene clusters in PBMC</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jason Bennett, Mikhail Pomaznoy, Akul Singhania, Bjoern Peters</p>

Recent technological advances have made the gathering of comprehensive gene expression datasets a commodity. This has shifted the limiting step of transcriptomic studies from the accumulation of data to their analyses and interpretation. The main problem in analyzing transcriptomics data is that the number of independent samples is typically much lower (<100) than the number of genes whose expression is quantified (typically >14,000). To address this, it would be desirable to reduce the gathered data’s dimensionality without losing information. Clustering genes into discrete modules is one of the most commonly used tools to accomplish this task. While there are multiple clustering approaches, there is a lack of informative metrics available to evaluate the resultant clusters’ biological quality. Here we present a metric that incorporates known ground truth gene sets to quantify gene clusters’ biological quality derived from standard clustering techniques. The GECO (Ground truth Evaluation of Clustering Outcomes) metric demonstrates that quantitative and repeatable scoring of gene clusters is not only possible but computationally lightweight and robust. Unlike current methods, it allows direct comparison between gene clusters generated by different clustering techniques. It also reveals that current cluster analysis techniques often underestimate the number of clusters that should be formed from a dataset, which leads to fewer clusters of lower quality. As a test case, we applied GECO combined with k-means clustering to derive an optimal set of co-expressed gene modules derived from PBMC, which we show to be superior to previously generated modules generated on whole-blood. Overall, GECO provides a rational metric to test and compare different clustering approaches to analyze high-dimensional transcriptomic data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Molecular mechanism of proton-coupled ligand translocation by the bacterial efflux pump EmrE</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jakub Jurasz, Maciej Bagiński, Jacek Czub, Miłosz Wieczór</p>

The current surge in bacterial multi-drug resistance (MDR) is one of the largest challenges to public health, threatening to render ineffective many therapies we rely on for treatment of serious infections. Understanding different factors that contribute to MDR is hence crucial from the global “one health” perspective. In this contribution, we focus on the prototypical broad-selectivity proton-coupled antiporter EmrE, one of the smallest known ligand transporters that confers resistance to aromatic cations in a number of clinically relevant species. As an asymmetric homodimer undergoing an “alternating access” protomer-swap conformational change, it serves as a model for the mechanistic understanding of more complex drug transporters. Here, we present a free energy and solvent accessibility analysis that indicates the presence of two complementary ligand translocation pathways that remain operative in a broad range of conditions. Our simulations show a previously undescribed desolvated apo state and anticorrelated accessibility in the ligand-bound state, explaining on a structural level why EmrE does not disrupt the pH gradient through futile proton transfer. By comparing the behavior of a number of model charged and/or aromatic ligands, we also explain the origin of selectivity of EmrE towards a broad class of aromatic cations. Finally, we explore unbiased pathways of ligand entry and exit to identify correlated structural changes implicated in ligand binding and release, as well as characterize key intermediates of occupancy changes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Sarc-Graph: Automated segmentation, tracking, and analysis of sarcomeres in hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Bill Zhao, Kehan Zhang, Christopher S. Chen, Emma Lejeune</p>

A better fundamental understanding of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) has the potential to advance applications ranging from drug discovery to cardiac repair. Automated quantitative analysis of beating hiPSC-CMs is an important and fast developing component of the hiPSC-CM research pipeline. Here we introduce “Sarc-Graph,” a computational framework to segment, track, and analyze sarcomeres in fluorescently tagged hiPSC-CMs. Our framework includes functions to segment z-discs and sarcomeres, track z-discs and sarcomeres in beating cells, and perform automated spatiotemporal analysis and data visualization. In addition to reporting good performance for sarcomere segmentation and tracking with little to no parameter tuning and a short runtime, we introduce two novel analysis approaches. First, we construct spatial graphs where z-discs correspond to nodes and sarcomeres correspond to edges. This makes measuring the network distance between each sarcomere (i.e., the number of connecting sarcomeres separating each sarcomere pair) straightforward. Second, we treat tracked and segmented components as fiducial markers and use them to compute the approximate deformation gradient of the entire tracked population. This represents a new quantitative descriptor of hiPSC-CM function. We showcase and validate our approach with both synthetic and experimental movies of beating hiPSC-CMs. By publishing Sarc-Graph, we aim to make automated quantitative analysis of hiPSC-CM behavior more accessible to the broader research community.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Grey-box modeling and hypothesis testing of functional near-infrared spectroscopy-based cerebrovascular reactivity to anodal high-definition tDCS in healthy humans</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yashika Arora, Pushpinder Walia, Mitsuhiro Hayashibe, Makii Muthalib, Shubhajit Roy Chowdhury, Stephane Perrey, Anirban Dutta</p>

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to evoke hemodynamics response; however, the mechanisms have not been investigated systematically using systems biology approaches. Our study presents a grey-box linear model that was developed from a physiologically detailed multi-compartmental neurovascular unit model consisting of the vascular smooth muscle, perivascular space, synaptic space, and astrocyte glial cell. Then, model linearization was performed on the physiologically detailed nonlinear model to find appropriate complexity (Akaike information criterion) to fit functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) based measure of blood volume changes, called cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), to high-definition (HD) tDCS. The grey-box linear model was applied on the fNIRS-based CVR during the first 150 seconds of anodal HD-tDCS in eleven healthy humans. The grey-box linear models for each of the four nested pathways starting from tDCS scalp current density that perturbed synaptic potassium released from active neurons for Pathway 1, astrocytic transmembrane current for Pathway 2, perivascular potassium concentration for Pathway 3, and voltage-gated ion channel current on the smooth muscle cell for Pathway 4 were fitted to the total hemoglobin concentration (tHb) changes from optodes in the vicinity of 4x1 HD-tDCS electrodes as well as on the contralateral sensorimotor cortex. We found that the tDCS perturbation Pathway 3 presented the least mean square error (MSE, median <2.5%) and the lowest Akaike information criterion (AIC, median -1.726) from the individual grey-box linear model fitting at the targeted-region. Then, minimal realization transfer function with reduced-order approximations of the grey-box model pathways was fitted to the ensemble average tHb time series. Again, Pathway 3 with nine poles and two zeros (all free parameters), provided the best Goodness of Fit of 0.0078 for Chi-Square difference test of nested pathways. Therefore, our study provided a systems biology approach to investigate the initial transient hemodynamic response to tDCS based on fNIRS tHb data. Future studies need to investigate the steady-state responses, including steady-state oscillations found to be driven by calcium dynamics, where transcranial alternating current stimulation may provide frequency-dependent physiological entrainment for system identification. We postulate that such a mechanistic understanding from system identification of the hemodynamics response to transcranial electrical stimulation can facilitate adequate delivery of the current density to the neurovascular tissue under simultaneous portable imaging in various cerebrovascular diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Recursive MAGUS: Scalable and accurate multiple sequence alignment</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vladimir Smirnov</p>

Multiple sequence alignment tools struggle to keep pace with rapidly growing sequence data, as few methods can handle large datasets while maintaining alignment accuracy. We recently introduced MAGUS, a new state-of-the-art method for aligning large numbers of sequences. In this paper, we present a comprehensive set of enhancements that allow MAGUS to align vastly larger datasets with greater speed. We compare MAGUS to other leading alignment methods on datasets of up to one million sequences. Our results demonstrate the advantages of MAGUS over other alignment software in both accuracy and speed. MAGUS is freely available in open-source form at https://github.com/vlasmirnov/MAGUS.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Dopamine, sleep, and neuronal excitability modulate amyloid-β–mediated forgetting in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jenifer C. Kaldun, Shahnaz R. Lone, Ana M. Humbert Camps, Cornelia Fritsch, Yves F. Widmer, Jens V. Stein, Seth M. Tomchik, Simon G. Sprecher</p>

Alzheimer disease (AD) is one of the main causes of age-related dementia and neurodegeneration. However, the onset of the disease and the mechanisms causing cognitive defects are not well understood. Aggregation of amyloidogenic peptides is a pathological hallmark of AD and is assumed to be a central component of the molecular disease pathways. Pan-neuronal expression of <i>Aβ</i><sub>42</sub><sup>Arctic</sup> peptides in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> results in learning and memory defects. Surprisingly, targeted expression to the mushroom bodies, a center for olfactory memories in the fly brain, does not interfere with learning but accelerates forgetting. We show here that reducing neuronal excitability either by feeding Levetiracetam or silencing of neurons in the involved circuitry ameliorates the phenotype. Furthermore, inhibition of the Rac-regulated forgetting pathway could rescue the <i>Aβ</i><sub>42</sub><sup>Arctic</sup>-mediated accelerated forgetting phenotype. Similar effects are achieved by increasing sleep, a critical regulator of neuronal homeostasis. Our results provide a functional framework connecting forgetting signaling and sleep, which are critical for regulating neuronal excitability and homeostasis and are therefore a promising mechanism to modulate forgetting caused by toxic <i>Aβ</i> peptides.

                Background: COVID19 vaccine rejection is a global issue that most developing countries face. A study of COVID-19 vaccine preference among Al-Zahraa University female students will pave the way to resolving the issue of vaccine rejection among students. Students' preferences and refusals of the COVID19 vaccine were evaluated to determine the reasons for their decisions.  Methods: This study involved 198 students from Al-Zahraa University for women. An observational cross-sectional study was conducted at Al-Zahraa University in Karbala, Iraq, to find out which Health and Medical Technology students preferred the COVID19 vaccine. Tests based on statistics made use of frequency and rate data.  Results: Most students (95%) were over the age of 19. The COVID-19 vaccine was rejected by 138 people (70.4%).  A total of 43 students (28.5%) believed that the COVID19 vaccine may not be completely safe. 49.3% of students were not aware of the differences between the various types of vaccines.  Pfizer was the most preferred by 64 (34.8%), AstraZeneca by 17 (9.2%), and Chinse-Sinovac by only 11 (6%). 20 students (16.4%) believed that with the vaccine they could return to life as it was before the COVID-19 pandemic. Covid-19 vaccine acceptance among Al-Zahara University students may be low in part because of myths, and partly because of the fear of side-effects associated with the vaccine.  Conclusion:  Information about COVID-19 vaccines should be transparently communicated to the media by health authorities to help the public make informed decisions.

                The United Nations estimates that the global population will total 9.7 billion in 2050. Rapid population growth pose a significant obstacle to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly eradicating hunger and poverty. In view of the expanding population growth, food production ideally should triple to prevent massive food shortages. Sustainable food and nutrition security is the focal point of the dairy industry. Dairy production plays a pivotal role in addressing and advancing global food and nutrition security. It serves as a major source of protein, calcium, and phosphorus in many families in developing countries with a fast-growing population. Consequently, the dairy industry is expected to grow by approximately 26% in the next 10 years and produce an estimated 1077 million tonnes of milk by 2050. However, the growth and distribution of the dairy industry is limited by many factors such as culling and mortality of dairy cows. Several studies highlight reproduction failures, old age, poor milk yield, diseases (mastitis, lameness, and dystocia), and heat stress as some reasons for culling of dairy cows. Hence, this review highlights the factors influencing culling and mortality in dairy production farms, and discusses mitigating measures to limit culling.

                Background: Metabolic syndrome is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Green tea and green coffee extracts, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents may participate in metabolic syndrome-induced cardiac fibrosis alleviation. However, the effect of combination of those extracts still needs exploration. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of green tea and decaffeinated light roasted green coffee extracts and their combination in metabolic syndrome-induced cardiac fibrosis rats. Methods: Metabolic syndrome rat model was i1nduced through high-fat high sucrose diets feeding for 8 weeks and injection of low dose streptozotocin at the 2nd week. The metabolic syndrome rats were divided into 4 experimental groups metabolic syndrome rats (MS); metabolic syndrome rats treated with 300 mg/ kg b.w green tea extract (GT); metabolic syndrome rats treated with 200 mg/ kg b.w decaffeinated light roasted green coffee extract (GC); metabolic syndrome rats treated with the combination of the two extracts (CE); and a normal control (NC) group was added. Angiotensin 2 level was analyzed by ELISA method. Gene expression of NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-6, Tgf-β1, Rac-1, and α-sma were analyzed by touchdown polymerase chain reaction methods. Results: Metabolic syndrome rats treated with green tea and decaffeinated light roasted green coffee significantly decreased angiotensin-2 serum level and cardiac inflammation and fibrosis gene expression level (NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-6, Tgf-β1, Rac-1, and α-sma). More significant alleviation was observed in the combination group. Conclusion: This study suggested that combination of green tea and decaffeinated light roasted green coffee extracts showed better improvement in metabolic syndrome-induced cardiac fibrosis rat model compared to that of single extract administration through inflammation inhibition
