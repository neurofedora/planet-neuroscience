	<p>When listening to music, people are excited by the musical cues immediately before rewarding passages. More generally, listeners attend to the antecedent cues of a salient musical event irrespective of its emotional valence. The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the behavioral and cognitive mechanisms underlying the cued anticipation of the main theme&amp;amp;rsquo;s recurrence in sonata form. Half of the main themes in the musical stimuli were of a joyful character, half a tragic character. Activity in the premotor cortex suggests that around the main theme&amp;amp;rsquo;s recurrence, the participants tended to covertly hum along with music. The anterior thalamus, pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA), posterior cerebellum, inferior frontal junction (IFJ), and auditory cortex showed increased activity for the antecedent cues of the themes, relative to the middle-last part of the themes. Increased activity in the anterior thalamus may reflect its role in guiding attention towards stimuli that reliably predict important outcomes. The preSMA and posterior cerebellum may support sequence processing, fine-grained auditory imagery, and fine adjustments to humming according to auditory inputs. The IFJ might orchestrate the attention allocation to motor simulation and goal-driven attention. These findings highlight the attention control and audiomotor components of musical anticipation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Probabilistic mapping reveals optimal stimulation site in essential tremor</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To obtain individual clinical and neuroimaging data of patients undergoing Deep Brain Stimulation for essential tremor from five different European centers to identify predictors of outcome and to identify an optimal stimulation site.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analysed retrospectively baseline covariates, pre- and postoperative clinical tremor scores (12-month) as well as individual imaging data from 119 patients to obtain individual electrode positions and stimulation volumes. Individual imaging and clinical data was used to calculate a probabilistic stimulation map in normalized space using voxel-wise statistical analysis. Finally, we used this map to train a classifier to predict tremor improvement.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Probabilistic mapping of stimulation effects yielded a statistically significant cluster that was associated with a tremor improvement greater than 50%. This cluster of optimal stimulation extended from the posterior subthalamic area to the ventralis intermedius nucleus and coincided with a normative structural-connectivity-based cerebello-thalamic tract (CTT). The combined features “distance between the stimulation volume and the significant cluster” and “CTT activation” were used as a predictor of tremor improvement. This correctly classified a greater than 50% tremor improvement with a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 57%.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our multicentre ET probabilistic stimulation map identified an area of optimal stimulation along the course of the CTT. The results of this study are mainly descriptive until confirmed in independent datasets, ideally through prospective testing. This target will be made openly available and may be used to guide surgical planning and for computer-assisted programming of deep brain stimulation in the future.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">The association of retromer deficiency and tau pathology in Down syndrome</a></h4>

              
                <p>Retromer deficiency is reported in Down syndrome and correlates with amyloidosis, however, its association with tau neuropathology remains unclear. Down syndrome and control brain tissues were evaluated for phosphorylated tau, tau modulators, and cathepsin-D activity. Several kinases and phosphatase PP2A were unchanged, but tau phosphorylation was elevated, and cathepsin-D activity decreased in aged Down syndrome subjects. Retromer proteins positively associated with soluble tau, whereas pathogenic tau negatively correlated with retromer proteins and cathepsin-D activity. Retromer deficiency and consequent reduction of cathepsin-D activity may contribute to pathogenic tau accumulation, thus, retromer represents a viable therapeutic target against tau pathology in Down syndrome.</p>

                <p>The antigen specificity of Anti-Neuronal Nuclear Antibody-type 3 (ANNA3)-IgG is unknown. We identified Dachshund-homolog 1 (DACH1) as the ANNA3 autoantigen and confirmed it by antigen-specific assays, immunohistochemical colocalization and immune absorption experiments. Patients' median age was 63.5 years (range, 49–88); 67% were female. Neurological manifestations (information available for 30 patients) included one or more of neuropathy, 12; cognitive difficulties, 11; ataxia, 8; dysautonomia, 7. Evidence of a neoplasm was present in 27/30 (90%), most of neuroendocrine lineage. DACH1-IgG is rare and represents a novel proposed biomarker of neurological autoimmunity and cancer.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Comparing natural history of early and late onset pediatric multiple sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>To describe and compare disease course and prognosis of early (i.e., disease onset before age 11 years) and late (i.e., disease onset after age 11 years) onset pediatric multiple sclerosis.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Prospectively-collected clinical information from Italian Multiple Sclerosis Register of 1993 pediatric multiple sclerosis patients, of whom 172 with early onset, was analyzed. Cox models adjusted for sex, baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale score and disease-modifying treatments and stratified for diagnostic criteria adopted (Poser <i>vs</i> McDonald) were used to assess the risk of reaching irreversible Expanded Disability Status Scale scores of 3, 4, and 6, and conversion to secondary progressive phenotype in early <i>vs</i> late onset pediatric patients. Prognostic factors were also evaluated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A greater proportion of males, isolated brainstem involvement, and longer time interval between first and second clinical episode was observed in early <i>vs</i> late onset pediatric patients. Compared to late onset, early onset pediatric patients took longer time from disease onset to convert to secondary progressive phenotype and to reach all disability milestones. Recovery from first demyelinating event, time to first relapse, annualized relapse rate during the first 3 years of disease and disease-modifying treatments exposure were independent predictors for long-term disability in early onset pediatric patients. In late onset pediatric patients, isolated optic neuritis, multifocal symptoms or progressive course at disease onset were additional predictors for long-term disability.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings point towards the existence of a different natural history in early <i>vs</i> late onset pediatric multiple sclerosis patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Axonal excitability does not differ between painful and painless diabetic or chemotherapy‐induced distal symmetrical polyneuropathy in a multi‐centre observational study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Axonal excitability reflects ion channel function and it is proposed that this may be a biomarker in painful (versus painless) polyneuropathy. Our objective was to investigate the relationship between axonal excitability parameters and chronic neuropathic pain in deeply phenotyped cohorts with diabetic or chemotherapy induced distal symmetrical polyneuropathy.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>239 participants with diabetic polyneuropathy were recruited from sites in the UK and Denmark, and 39 participants that developed chemotherapy-induced polyneuropathy were recruited from Denmark. Participants were separated into those with probable or definite neuropathic pain and those without neuropathic pain. Axonal excitability of large myelinated fibres was measured with the threshold tracking technique. The stimulus site was the median nerve and the recording sites were the index finger (sensory studies) and abductor pollicis brevis muscle (motor studies).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Participants with painless and painful polyneuropathy were well matched across clinical variables. Sensory and motor axonal excitability measures, including recovery cycle, threshold electrotonus, strength duration time constant, and current-threshold relationship, did not show differences between participants with painful and painless diabetic polyneuropathy, while there were only minor changes for chemotherapy-induced polyneuropathy.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Axonal excitability did not significantly differ between painful and painless diabetic or chemotherapy induced polyneuropathy in a multi-centre observational study. Threshold tracking assesses the excitability of myelinated axons; the majority of nociceptors are unmyelinated and although there is some overlap of the ‘channelome’ between these axonal populations, our results suggest that alternative measures such as microneurography are required to understand the relationship between sensory neuron excitability and neuropathic pain.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess the feasibility, acceptability, and benefits of a teleneurology clinic serving adults usually attending a neurology outpatient clinic in Lusaka, Zambia during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Televisits were offered to patients scheduled for neurology appointments between March and July 2020 using phone, WhatsApp video, or Zoom calls based on patient accessibility. Visit outcomes were documented, and patient and neurologist satisfaction surveys completed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 323 patients, 195 (60%) were reachable by telephone, 179 of these were alive, and 74% (133/179) of those alive agreed to a televisit. Stroke (30%), seizures (20%), and headache (16%) were the commonest diagnoses seen via televisit. Most televisits (80%) were by telephone call, 14% by WhatsApp video call, and 6% by Zoom. Nearly one-third (30%) of patients were stable and discharged from clinic, 32% only required medication refills, and 19% required an in-person visit. Sixty patients (out of 85 reachable, 71% response rate) and seven of nine neurologists (78% response rate) completed satisfaction surveys. Neurologists reported greater assessment confidence with Zoom, but confidence was high for all modalities. Patients preferring televisits (75%, 45/60) noted reduced expense and time requirements, while those preferring in-person visits (22%, 13/60) cited desire for physical examinations. Overall, 98% of patients and 100% of neurologists were satisfied with televisits.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Teleneurology visits were acceptable and feasible for adults attending an outpatient neurology clinic in Zambia and their neurologists. They offer a promising supplement to in-person visits in resource-limited settings, even when video-conference capabilities and electronic medical records are absent.</p>

                Obesity is recognized as a significant risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies have supported the notion that obesity accelerates AD-related pathophysiology in mouse models of AD. The majority of studies to date have focused on the use of early-onset AD models. Here we evaluate the impact of genetic risk factors on late-onset AD (LOAD) in mice fed a high fat/high sugar diet. We focused on three mouse models created through the IU/JAX/Pitt MODEL-AD Center, LOAD1, LOAD1. Plcg2 M28L and LOAD1. Mthfr 677C>T. At 2 months of age, animals were placed on a high fat/high sugar diet (HFD) that induces obesity, or a control diet (CD) that does not, until 12 months of age. Throughout the study, blood was collected to assess cholesterol and glucose. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) was completed prior to sacrifice to image for glucose utilization and brain perfusion. At the completion of the study, blood and brains were collected for analysis. As expected, animals fed the HFD, regardless of genotype or sex, showed a significant increase in body weight compared to those fed the CD. Glucose and cholesterol increased as a function of HFD as well. Interestingly, LOAD1. Plcg2 M28L demonstrated an increase in microglia density as well as alterations in regional brain glucose and perfusion when on a HFD.These changes were not observed in LOAD1 or LOAD1. Mthfr 677C>T animals when fed a HFD . Furthermore, LOAD1. Plcg2 M28L but not LOAD1. Mthfr 677C>T or LOAD1 animals showed transcriptomics correlations to human AD modules.Our results show HFD affects brain health in a genotype-specific manner. Further insight into this process may have significant implications in the development of lifestyle interventions for treatment of AD.

	<p>Accurately extracting brain tissue is a critical and primary step in brain neuroimaging research. Due to the differences in brain size and structure between humans and nonhuman primates, the performance of the existing tools for brain tissue extraction, working on macaque brain MRI, is constrained. A new transfer learning training strategy was utilized to address the limitations, such as insufficient training data and unsatisfactory model generalization ability, when deep neural networks processing the limited samples of macaque magnetic resonance imaging(MRI). First, the project combines two human brain MRI data modes to pre-train the neural network, in order to achieve faster training and more accurate brain extraction. Then, a residual network structure in the U-Net model was added, in order to propose a ResTLU-Net model that aims to improve the generalization ability of multiple research sites data. The results demonstrated that the ResTLU-Net, combined with the proposed transfer learning strategy, achieved comparable accuracy for the macaque brain MRI extraction tasks on different macaque brain MRI volumes that were produced by various medical centers. The mean Dice of the ResTLU-Net was 95.81% (no need for denoise and recorrect), and the method required only approximately 30&amp;amp;ndash;60 s for one extraction task on an NVIDIA 1660S GPU.</p>

	<p>Atypical antipsychotics (AAP) are used in the treatment of severe mental illness. They are associated with several metabolic side effects including insulin resistance. The skeletal muscle is the primary tissue responsible for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Dysfunction of protein regulation within the skeletal muscle following treatment with AAPs may play a role in the associated metabolic side effects. The objective of this study was to measure protein abundance in the skeletal muscle of patients on long-term AAP or mood stabilizer treatment. Cross-sectional muscle biopsies were obtained from patients with bipolar disorder and global protein abundance was measured using stable isotope labeling by amino acid (SILAC) combined with high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS). Sixteen patients completed muscle biopsies and were included in the proteomic analyses. A total of 40 proteins were significantly different between the AAP group and the mood stabilizer group. In-silico pathway analysis identified significant enrichment in several pathways including glucose metabolism, cell cycle, apoptosis, and folate metabolism. Proteome abundance changes also differed based on protein biological processes and function. In summary, significant differences in proteomic profiles were identified in the skeletal muscle between patients on AAPs and mood stabilizers. Future work is needed to validate these findings in prospectively sampled populations.</p>

	<p>Background: Gait deficit is a hallmark of multiple sclerosis and the walking capacity can be improved with neurorehabilitation. Technological advances in biomechanics offer opportunities to assess the effects of rehabilitation objectively. Objective: Combining wireless surface electromyography and wearable inertial sensors to assess and monitor the gait pattern before and after an intensive multidisciplinary neurorehabilitation program (44 h/4weeks) to evaluate rehabilitation efficiency. Methods: Forty people with progressive multiple sclerosis were enrolled. Wireless wearable devices were used to evaluate the gait. Instrumental gait analysis, clinical assessment, and patient report outcome measures were acquired before and after the neurorehabilitation. Spatiotemporal gait parameters, the co-activation index of lower limb muscles, and clinical assessments were compared pre- and post-treatment. Results: Significant improvements after intensive neurorehabilitation were found in most of the clinical assessments, cadence, and velocity of the instrumental gait analysis, paralleled by amelioration of thigh co-activation on the less-affected side. Subjects with better balance performance and higher independence at baseline benefit more from the neurorehabilitation course. Conclusions: Significant improvements in gait performance were found in our cohort after an intensive neurorehabilitation course, for both quantitative and qualitative measures. Integrating kinematic and muscle activity measurements offers opportunities to objectively evaluate and interpret treatment effects.</p>

	<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous condition characterized by deficits in social communication and a repetitive pattern of behavior, with recent Italian prevalence estimates of 1 in 77. Although the core behavioral features of ASD appear to emerge within the first two years of life, clinical diagnosis is often not received before the third birthday. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has recommended that primary care physicians routinely screen for ASD at the 18- and 24-month visits. In Italy, the Guidelines of the Italian National Institute for Health (ISS) recommend the Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (CHAT) as a screening tool for ASD, which compares parent responses with a semistructured observation by a healthcare provider. In the Italian National Health System, pediatricians have regular visits with all children; however, there is wide variability in following screening guidelines, and some barriers have been detected. For these reasons, other studies have highlighted the advantages of using telemedicine with the potential for enhancing ASD screening practices. The current study is an examination of the implementation of the first Italian online web-based screening tool (Web Italian Network for Autism Spectrum DisorderWIN4ASD), an innovative web app for pediatricians. We present the data obtained from the screening activity through the platform by a small group of pediatricians. The results of this study show that the implemented web-based platform appears to be an effective, efficient, and sustainable way to integrate screening services into primary care.</p>

	<p>Autoimmune-mediated ataxia has been associated with paraneoplastic disease, gluten enteropathy, Hashimoto thyroiditis as well as autoimmune disorders without a known associated disease. There have been relatively few reports describing the neuropathology of these conditions. This review is an attempt to consolidate those reports and determine the ways in which autoimmune ataxias can be neuropathologically differentiated from hereditary or other sporadic ataxias. In most instances, particularly in paraneoplastic forms, the presence of inflammatory infiltrates is a strong indicator of autoimmune disease, but it was not a consistent finding in all reported cases. Therefore, clinical and laboratory findings are important for assessing an autoimmune mechanism. Such factors as rapid rate of clinical progression, presence of known autoantibodies or the presence of a malignant neoplasm or other autoimmune disease processes need to be considered, particularly in cases where inflammatory changes are minimal or absent and the pathology is largely confined to the cerebellum and its connections, where the disease can mimic hereditary or other sporadic ataxias.</p>

	<p>Metabolic syndrome (MetS) or otherwise insulin resistance (IR) is described as a cluster of several commonly occurring disorders, including abdominal obesity; lipids disorders, such as hypertriglyceridemia; and low levels of high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), hypertension (&amp;amp;ge;130/85 mmHg), and carbohydrates disorders, such as impaired fasting glucose or diabetes mellitus type 2. Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) constitutes insulin resistance, which is a strong risk factor for strokes. Patients with MetS are often prone to cognitive decline. Metabolic risk factors, hypertension, and diabetes, amongst them, have been hypothesized to play a great role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) and the development of vascular dementia. For neuropsychological diagnostic and theoretical purposes verbal fluency is defined as a cognitive function that facilitates information retrieval from memory. It engages executive control and other cognitive processes, such as selective attention, selective inhibition, mental set shifting, internal response generation, and self-monitoring, as well as imagination and psychomotor skills. A total of 90 subjects, divided into 2 groups, patients with MetS (45) and healthy controls (45), were assessed. A significant difference in performance was found between the patients and controls, both in the phonetic (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) and semantic fluency trials (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). The MetS patients produced less words in the letter K and animal categories. The analysis of descriptive statistics shows that the group of patients with metabolic syndrome generated fewer words in both the phonetic and semantic categories. Our study shows that there is an association between metabolic factors and the verbal fluency performance of MetS patients. This is true, especially for phonetic verbal fluency, which is traditionally connected with the frontal cortex. Lower switching signifies possible executive dysfunctions amongst people with MetS. Subjects with this condition generated more diverse words and created less standard associations. This further implies the existence of dysexecutive syndrome and the need for diagnosing patients in this direction and involving this group of people in therapy. The proper correction of MetS components may improve cognitive function.</p>

                Immune evasion is a significant contributor to tumor evolution, and the immunoinhibitory axis PD-1/PD-L1 is a frequent mechanism employed to escape tumor immune surveillance. To identify cancer drivers involved in immune evasion, we performed a CRISPR-Cas9 screen of tumor suppressor genes regulating the basal and interferon (IFN)-inducible cell surface levels...

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Electrophysiological Responses to Rapidly-Presented Affective Stimuli Predict Individual Differences in Subsequent Attention</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>We are constantly surrounded by a dynamically changing perceptual landscape that can influence our behavior even without our full conscious awareness. Emotional processing can have effects on subsequent attention, but there are mixed findings on whether it induces attentional enhancement or interference. The present study used a new multimodal approach to explain and predict such attentional effects based on individual differences in response to emotional stimuli. We briefly presented affective pictures (neutral, positive, erotic, mutilation, and horror categories) for 80 ms, immediately followed by a cued flanker task that was unrelated to the pictures. Event-related potentials (ERPs), skin conductance response (SCR), and reaction time (RT) were measured for each participant. We found that, in general, affective pictures induced higher electrophysiological responses compared with neutral pictures [P300 and late positive potential (LPP) in the erotic condition; P300, LPP, and SCR in the horror condition]. In particular, individuals who showed a strong ERP response to the pictures were impeded in the erotic condition (only P300) and facilitated in the horror condition (both P300 and LPP). Those who did not show a significant ERP or SCR response to the pictures were facilitated in the erotic condition and impeded in the horror condition. Furthermore, it was possible to classify the direction of the attentional effect from the participants&rsquo; P300, LPP, and SCR responses. These results demonstrate that underlying individual differences in emotional processing must be considered in understanding and predicting the effects of emotions on attention and cognition.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A randomised trial of the effects on recruitment and retention of including a wet-ink signature and photograph in the patient invitation letter for a clinical trial: results from a Study Within a Trial (SWAT 3 and SWAT 53) [version 1; peer review: awaitin</a></h4>

              
                Background: There is uncertainty about the effects of modifications to trial patient invitation letters on recruitment and retention. However, such documents are important. Methods: A 2x2 factorial design embedded a pair of randomised Studies Within a Trial (SWAT) within a large host trial (CLEAR), to evaluate the effects of including wet-ink signatures and photographs in the patient invitation letter. Patients were randomised to receive one of four invitation letters: with a wet-ink or generic signature, and with or without a photograph. The primary outcome was the proportion of invited patients who joined the CLEAR trial. The secondary outcome was the proportion of patients retained in the trial. Results: 368 letters were given to potential participants in the CLEAR trial and 121 (33%) joined. Proportions for each randomised group were generic signature and no photograph: 38% (33/88); generic signature and photograph: 32% (28/88); wet-ink personal signature and no photograph: 29% (26/91); wet-ink personal signature and photograph: 34% (34/101). There was no evidence of a significant difference in recruitment between those receiving the patient invitation letter containing a wet-ink versus generic signature (odds ratio (OR): 0.86, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.55 to 1.32, p=0.49) or photograph versus no photograph (OR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.64 to 1.53, p=0.97). Retention was similar for the wet-ink and generic signature groups (OR: 1.20, 95% CI: 0.35 to 4.16, p=0.77) but significantly better when a photograph was used (OR: 5.40, 95% CI: 1.12 to 26.15, p=0.04, based on 2 withdrawals in the photograph group versus 9 in the no photograph group). Conclusions: These SWAT add to the evidence base for the effects of modifications to clinical trial documentation on recruitment and retention. We found including a photograph may improve retention. Although these analyses are underpowered, they will contribute to meta-analysis of similar comparisons. ISRCTN registration: 89040295 (06/07/2018)

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">PressPurt: network sensitivity to press perturbations under interaction uncertainty [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                While the use of networks to understand how complex systems respond to perturbations is pervasive across scientific disciplines, the uncertainty associated with estimates of pairwise interaction strengths (edge weights) remains rarely considered. Mischaracterizations of interaction strength can lead to qualitatively incorrect predictions regarding system responses as perturbations propagate through often counteracting direct and indirect effects. Here, we introduce PressPurt, a computational package for identifying the interactions whose strengths must be estimated most accurately in order to produce robust predictions of a network's response to press perturbations. The package provides methods for calculating and visualizing these edge-specific sensitivities (tolerances) when uncertainty is associated to one or more edges according to a variety of different error distributions. The software requires the network to be represented as a numerical (quantitative or qualitative) Jacobian matrix evaluated at stable equilibrium. PressPurt is open source under the MIT license and is available as both a Python package and an R package hosted at https://github.com/dkoslicki/PressPurt and on the CRAN repository https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=PressPurt.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Japanese sound-symbolic words in global contexts: from translation to hybridization [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                This paper explores the global reception and development of the artistic expression of onomatopoeia and mimetic words in modern and contemporary Japanese literary texts adopting the method of comparative literature. By analyzing sound-symbolic words and their translations in modern Japanese poetry and contemporary comics, the intercultural dialogues of these texts are examined and the emergence of hybrid onomatopoeia in global comic works is illuminated. The Japanese language is often noted for its richness of sound-symbolic words. In the literary world, modern poetry adopted and elaborated the use of these words from the late 19th century in its quest for a new style of poetry. In the early 20th century, poets developed the artistic expression of sound-symbolic words and succeeded in giving musicality to the “new-style poem”. However, the translation of Japanese sound-symbolic words has always been problematic. Experimental uses of these words in modern poems were often untranslatable, making the translations incomprehensible or dull. Nevertheless, graphic narratives and their worldwide distribution changed that situation. Japanese comics (manga) has particularly developed the artistic expression of sound-symbolic words. Usually placed outside speech balloons, these words are elaborately depicted and are important elements of the panel/page layout. Notably, the global popularity of the genre developed a new phase of intercultural dialogue. As not every word has an equivalent or is translatable in the target language, translators have left sound-symbolic words untouched in the translated versions, putting translation aside. Thus, the combination of Japanese and the target language seems to influence the visual comprehension of sound effects among the readers. Through the examinations of some cases, this paper brings to light the emergence of some hybrid onomatopoeia and reveals that the “Third Space” formed by the translation and hybridization of manga is a dynamic field that creates a new culture.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study aimed to elucidate the molecular features of inclusion body myositis (IBM).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed RNA sequencing analysis of muscle biopsy samples from 67 participants, consisting of 58 myositis patients with the pathological finding of CD8-positive T cells invading non-necrotic muscle fibers expressing major histocompatibility complex class I (43 IBM, 6 polymyositis, and 9 unclassifiable myositis), and 9 controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Cluster analysis, principal component analysis, and pathway analysis showed that differentially expressed genes and pathways identified in IBM and polymyositis were mostly comparable. However, pathways related to cell adhesion molecules were upregulated in IBM as compared with polymyositis and controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Notably, <i>CDH1</i>, which encodes the epidermal cell junction protein cadherin 1, was overexpressed in the muscles of IBM, which was validated by another RNA sequencing dataset from previous publications. Western blotting confirmed the presence of mature cadherin 1 protein in the muscles of IBM. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the positivity for anti-cadherin 1 antibody in the muscles of IBM, whereas there was no muscle fiber positive for anti-cadherin 1 antibody in immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy, antisynthetase syndrome, and controls. The fibers stained with anti-cadherin 1 antibody did not have rimmed vacuoles or abnormal protein accumulation. Experimental skeletal muscle regeneration and differentiation systems showed that <i>CDH1</i> is expressed during skeletal muscle regeneration and differentiation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p><i>CDH1</i> was detected as a differentially expressed gene, and immunohistochemistry showed that cadherin 1 exists in the muscles of IBM, whereas it was rarely seen in those of other idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. Cadherin 1 upregulation in muscle could provide a valuable clue to the pathological mechanisms of IBM. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <p>COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 infection) can lead to intensive care unit (ICU) admission and critical illness myopathy (CIM). We examined three ICU patients with COVID-19, who required mechanical ventilation for pneumonia and developed CIM. Pathological examination of skeletal muscle biopsies revealed myopathic changes consistent with CIM, variable inflammation with autophagic vacuoles, SARS-CoV immunostaining+ fibers/granules, and electron microscopy findings of mitochondrial abnormalities and coronavirus-like particles. While mitochondrial dysfunction with compromised energy production is a critical pathogenic mechanism of non-COVID-19-associated CIM, in our series of COVID-19-associated CIM, myopathic changes including prominent mitochondrial damage suggest a similar mechanism and association with direct SARS-CoV-2 muscle infection.</p>

                Background: Microfluidic cell manipulation techniques have been continually developed and integrated into miniature chips as a so-called lab-on-a-chip (LOC) platform for high-throughput bioassays. Among the various mechanisms of bioparticles manipulation by electrically induced forces, dielectrophoresis (DEP) has been regarded as the most promising technique utilized in microfluidic systems. Into the micro- to nano-scale level of DEP configuration, the common challenges of undesirable side effects such as electrohydrodynamic effects, joule heating, and electrolysis that may occur in the microfluidic system has always been a hurdle which would severely limit the DEP performance. Methods: A numerical simulation study was performed on a versatile capability of a rectangular type of dielectrophoresis microelectrode with different parametric design configuration variables (channel height: 20-50 µm; electrode width 20-100 µm; electrode spacing 5-50 µm). Results: Numerical study results have shown that the ideal dimension range of design configuration for optimum DEP performance have been identified to be 40µm in channel height, 20-40 µm in electrode width and 5-15µm in electrode spacing, further increasing of the dimensions have shown a decrease in DEP performance consequently abridged the bioparticle manipulation. Conclusion: This investigation of the parametric design of the rectangular geometry microelectrode has provided necessary insight to the microelectrode design information and parametric considerations for optimum DEP device fabrication and enhancement.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Deep brain stimulation for arm tremor: A randomized trial comparing two targets</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) effectively suppresses arm tremor. Uncontrolled studies suggest the posterior subthalamic area (PSA) may be superior. We compared the intra-individual efficacy of VIM- versus PSA-DBS on tremor suppression and arm function.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial at Oslo University Hospital in patients (18–80 years) with isolated or combined action tremor affecting at least one arm. Four-contact DBS leads were implanted (bi- or unilaterally) with a trajectory to cover the VIM (upper two contacts) and PSA (lower two contacts). Patients were randomized (1:1 ratio) post-surgery to: Group 1, VIM-stimulation months 0–3 (period 1), then PSA-stimulation months 4–6 (period 2); Group 2, PSA-stimulation first, then VIM-stimulation. Primary endpoint was the difference in improvement from baseline to the end of the VIM- versus PSA-period in the sum of the dominant arm tremor scores of the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale (FTMTRS), items 5/6 + 10–14.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Forty-five patients were randomized to Group 1 (n = 23) or 2 (n = 22). In the primary endpoint per-protocol analysis (mixed model, n = 40), mean difference in the sum FTMTRS score improvement for the dominant arm was −2.65 points (95% CI -4.33 to −0.97; p = 0.002). The difference in favour of PSA stimulation was highly significant in period 2, but not period 1.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our randomized trial demonstrated that PSA stimulation provided superior tremor suppression compared with VIM stimulation. A period effect reducing tremor for up to three months in both groups was most likely attributed to a post-surgery stun effect.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A mechanistic modeling framework reveals the key principles underlying tumor metabolism</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shubham Tripathi, Jun Hyoung Park, Shivanand Pudakalakatti, Pratip K. Bhattacharya, Benny Abraham Kaipparettu, Herbert Levine</p>

While aerobic glycolysis, or the Warburg effect, has for a long time been considered a hallmark of tumor metabolism, recent studies have revealed a far more complex picture. Tumor cells exhibit widespread metabolic heterogeneity, not only in their presentation of the Warburg effect but also in the nutrients and the metabolic pathways they are dependent on. Moreover, tumor cells can switch between different metabolic phenotypes in response to environmental cues and therapeutic interventions. A framework to analyze the observed metabolic heterogeneity and plasticity is, however, lacking. Using a mechanistic model that includes the key metabolic pathways active in tumor cells, we show that the inhibition of phosphofructokinase by excess ATP in the cytoplasm can drive a preference for aerobic glycolysis in fast-proliferating tumor cells. The differing rates of ATP utilization by tumor cells can therefore drive heterogeneity with respect to the presentation of the Warburg effect. Building upon this idea, we couple the metabolic phenotype of tumor cells to their migratory phenotype, and show that our model predictions are in agreement with previous experiments. Next, we report that the reliance of proliferating cells on different anaplerotic pathways depends on the relative availability of glucose and glutamine, and can further drive metabolic heterogeneity. Finally, using treatment of melanoma cells with a BRAF inhibitor as an example, we show that our model can be used to predict the metabolic and gene expression changes in cancer cells in response to drug treatment. By making predictions that are far more generalizable and interpretable as compared to previous tumor metabolism modeling approaches, our framework identifies key principles that govern tumor cell metabolism, and the reported heterogeneity and plasticity. These principles could be key to targeting the metabolic vulnerabilities of cancer.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Bias-free estimation of information content in temporally sparse neuronal activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Liron Sheintuch, Alon Rubin, Yaniv Ziv</p>

Applying information theoretic measures to neuronal activity data enables the quantification of neuronal encoding quality. However, when the sample size is limited, a naïve estimation of the information content typically contains a systematic overestimation (upward bias), which may lead to misinterpretation of coding characteristics. This bias is exacerbated in Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging because of the temporal sparsity of elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Here, we introduce methods to correct for the bias in the naïve estimation of information content from limited sample sizes and temporally sparse neuronal activity. We demonstrate the higher accuracy of our methods over previous ones, when applied to Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data recorded from the mouse hippocampus and primary visual cortex, as well as to simulated data with matching tuning properties and firing statistics. Our bias-correction methods allowed an accurate estimation of the information place cells carry about the animal’s position (<i>spatial information</i>) and uncovered the spatial resolution of hippocampal coding. Furthermore, using our methods, we found that cells with higher peak firing rates carry higher spatial information per spike and exposed differences between distinct hippocampal subfields in the long-term evolution of the spatial code. These results could be masked by the bias when applying the commonly used naïve calculation of information content. Thus, a bias-free estimation of information content can uncover otherwise overlooked properties of the neural code.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A computationally tractable birth-death model that combines phylogenetic and epidemiological data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alexander Eugene Zarebski, Louis du Plessis, Kris Varun Parag, Oliver George Pybus</p>

Inferring the dynamics of pathogen transmission during an outbreak is an important problem in infectious disease epidemiology. In mathematical epidemiology, estimates are often informed by time series of confirmed cases, while in phylodynamics genetic sequences of the pathogen, sampled through time, are the primary data source. Each type of data provides different, and potentially complementary, insight. Recent studies have recognised that combining data sources can improve estimates of the transmission rate and the number of infected individuals. However, inference methods are typically highly specialised and field-specific and are either computationally prohibitive or require intensive simulation, limiting their real-time utility. We present a novel birth-death phylogenetic model and derive a tractable analytic approximation of its likelihood, the computational complexity of which is linear in the size of the dataset. This approach combines epidemiological and phylodynamic data to produce estimates of key parameters of transmission dynamics and the unobserved prevalence. Using simulated data, we show (a) that the approximation agrees well with existing methods, (b) validate the claim of linear complexity and (c) explore robustness to model misspecification. This approximation facilitates inference on large datasets, which is increasingly important as large genomic sequence datasets become commonplace.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Maternal Epilepsy and Long‐term Offspring Mortality – a Nationwide Cohort Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We examined how maternal epilepsy and use of antiseizure medications in pregnancy was associated with offspring mortality.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This population-based cohort study included all live- and stillborn singletons in Denmark between 1981 and 2016. We used nation-wide registers to retrieve information on pregnancy characteristics, epilepsy diagnoses, use of antiseizure medications, and mortality. Adjusted Mortality rate ratios (MRR) were estimated using log-linear Poisson regression.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The cohort consisted of 1,862,474 children. In total, 12,026 live-born children died during follow-up, of whom 170 (1.4%) were offspring of mothers with epilepsy. Overall mortality was increased in offspring of mothers with epilepsy compared to offspring of mothers without epilepsy (MRR=1.46, 95% CI: 1.23-1.71), driven by an excess mortality only in the first year of life. Mortality was increased for natural deaths (MRR=1.50, 95% CI: 1.25-1.78) but not from unnatural deaths (MRR=1.38, 95% CI: 0.84-2.14), and only in offspring of women with epilepsy who used antiseizure medications during pregnancy (MRR=1.51, 95% CI: 1.00-2.17), but not in offspring of women with epilepsy who did not use antiseizure medications while pregnant (MRR=0.97, 95% CI: 0.69-1.31). When analyses were restricted to children born from 2000 and onwards, the excess mortality that was observed in the first year of life among children of mothers with epilepsy, was no longer evident.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>During the 1981-1999 epoch, offspring of women with epilepsy were at increased risk of dying in the first year of life. However, this risk did not extend to children born after 2000. Future retrospective studies of the effects of maternal epilepsy on the health of the offspring should take this difference into account.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Bayes factor benefits for clinical psychology: review of child and adolescent evidence base [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Statistical methods are a cornerstone of research in clinical psychology and are used in clinical trials and reviews to determine the best available evidence. The most widespread statistical framework, frequentist statistics, is often misunderstood and misused. Even when properly applied, this framework can lead to erroneous conclusions and unnecessarily prolonged trials. The implications for clinical psychology are difficulties in interpreting best available evidence and unnecessarily costly and burdensome research. An alternative framework, Bayesian statistics, is proposed as a solution to several issues with current practice. Methods: Statistical tests of primary outcome measures were extracted from 272 studies, which were cited in 11 recent reviews in the Evidence-based updates series in the Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology. The extracted tests were examined regarding relevant features and re-analyzed using Bayes Factors. Results: When statistical tests were significant, the majority (98%) of re-analyzed tests agreed with such claims. When statistical tests were nonsignificant almost half (43%) of re-analyzed tests disagreed with such claims. Equally important for clinical research, an average of 13% fewer participants per study would have been required if the studies had used Bayes Factors. Conclusions: Bayes Factors offer benefits for research in clinical psychology through intuitive interpretations, and less costly trials.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Awareness and intention to register halal certification of micro and small-scale food enterprises [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This paper discusses halal awareness of food micro and small-scale enterprises (food MSEs) in West Java Province, Indonesia. Halal awareness is the first step toward obtaining halal certificates, which confirm that the product is lawful according to Islamic Sharia. Unfortunately, most of the food sold on the market do not have halal certificates due to a lack of halal awareness and intention on the part of the entrepreneurs. Methods: This study aims at measuring the level of halal awareness and the intention of food MSE entrepreneurs to register halal certification. Halal awareness is assumed to be influenced by knowledge of halal and MSEs' entrepreneurial perceptions of the benefits of halal certificates. Furthermore, halal awareness, attitudes, and perceptions of ease of procedures will encourage the intention to register halal certification. An electronic Google Form with a cover letter and a set of questionnaires was distributed to collect data. Structural Equation Modelling – Partial Least Square (SEM-PLS) was chosen to evaluate the adopted theoretical models in the exploratory research. Results: The results show that halal awareness is influenced by knowledge of halal and perceptions of benefits. Moreover, halal awareness influences positively the intention to obtain a halal certificate, but the intention is not significantly affected by attitudes and perceptions of procedures for obtaining halal certification. This shows that halal awareness will increase the intention to register halal certification. However, it does not impact attitudes/actions to register for halal certification due to the misconceptions about the procedures for obtaining halal certificates. Conclusions: Micro and small entrepreneurs in West Java Province, Indonesia have a good level of awareness about halal food. However, their products are not halal-certified due to the perceptions of the procedures for obtaining halal certificates, which are relatively complicated and costly for micro and small-scale businesses.

                Background: The standardization and mechanism of action of Caesalpinia sappan as an anticancer agent are still lacking. This study aimed to understand the mechanism of action of  C,sappan extract as an anticancer agent. Methods: This study was conducted using the A549 lung cancer cell line to understand the mechanism of action of C. sappan extract as an anticancer agent. The cytotoxicity activity, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, protein-related apoptosis (i.e., BCL-2and BAX protein) assays, and RNA sequencing were performed level were measured. Moreover, the antioxidant activity, total flavonoids, and phenolics of C.sappan were also assessed. Results: C.sappan has strong antioxidant activity (22.14 ± 0.93 ppm) total flavonoid content of (529.3 ± 4.56 mgQE/g), and phenolics content of (923.37 ± 5 mgGAE/g). The C.sappan ethanol extract inhibited cancer cell growth and arrested at G0/G1 phase of cell cycle, inducing apoptosis by increasing BAX/BCL-2 protein ratio in A549 lung cancer cell line. Furthermore, results from RNA sequencing analysis showed that C.sappan ethanol extract caused downregulation of genes acting on mitochondrial function including adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and respiration. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that C.sappan has the ability to inhibit cancer cell growth by inducing apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction in A549 cells.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effect of Aloe vera extract in post-burn skin repair in rats [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Burn injury is a global health problem that is most often caused by heat. Burn injury can cause high morbidity and mortality and requires high cost. Therefore, the use of plants as herbal medicine has the potential to be developed in Indonesia. Aloe vera contains various active ingredients that help the wound healing process, such as glucomannan and acemannan which have the effects on the proliferation of macrophages, and fibroblasts, and re-epithelialization. This study aimed to determine the effect of Aloe vera extract in repairing post-burn skin in rats that was analyzed from the number of macrophages and fibroblasts, and epidermal thickness. Methods: This is an experimental study with a posttest-only control group design using 54 Rattus norvegicus Wistar strain rats. The sampling method was simple random sampling consisting of 3 groups, i.e., I. standard group, which were normal rats; II. negative control group, which were given second-degree burns and treated with gel base (without Aloe vera extract); III. treatment groups, which were given second-degree burns and treated with Aloe vera extract gel. Each group was subdivided into three smaller groups (n = 6) according to the time the lesions were evaluated. Skin tissue samplings were carried out on day 3, 14, and 21 after injury to observe the number of macrophages and fibroblasts, and epidermal thickness. Results: There were significant differences in the mean number of macrophages, number of fibroblasts, and epidermal thickness in all groups (p<0.05). Conclusion: Aloe vera extract gel could accelerate the healing process of burns in rats.

                Energy conservation in microorganisms is classically categorized into respiration and fermentation; however, recent work shows some species can use mixed or alternative bioenergetic strategies. We explored the use of extracellular electron transfer for energy conservation in diverse lactic acid bacteria (LAB), microorganisms that mainly rely on fermentative metabolism and are important in food fermentations. The LAB <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i> uses extracellular electron transfer to increase its NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio, generate more ATP through substrate-level phosphorylation, and accumulate biomass more rapidly. This novel, hybrid metabolism is dependent on a type-II NADH dehydrogenase (Ndh2) and conditionally requires a flavin-binding extracellular lipoprotein (PplA) under laboratory conditions. It confers increased fermentation product yield, metabolic flux, and environmental acidification in laboratory media and during kale juice fermentation. The discovery of a single pathway that simultaneously blends features of fermentation and respiration in a primarily fermentative microorganism expands our knowledge of energy conservation and provides immediate biotechnology applications.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Coding of chromatic spatial contrast by macaque V1 neurons</a></h4>

              
                Color perception relies on comparisons between adjacent lights, but how the brain performs these comparisons is poorly understood. To elucidate the underlying neural mechanisms, we recorded spiking responses of individual V1 neurons in macaque monkeys to pairs of stimuli within the classical receptive field (RF). We estimated the spatial-chromatic RF of each neuron and then presented customized colored edges using a novel closed-loop technique. We found that many double-opponent (DO) cells, which have spatially and chromatically opponent RFs, responded to chromatic contrast as a weighted sum, akin to how other V1 cells responded to luminance contrast. Yet other neurons integrated chromatic signals non-linearly, confirming that linear signal integration is not an obligate property of V1 neurons. The functional similarity of cone-opponent DO cells and cone non-opponent simple cells suggests that these two groups may share a common underlying neural circuitry, promotes the construction of image-computable models for full-color image representation, and sheds new light on V1 complex cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Barcoded Bulk QTL mapping reveals highly polygenic and epistatic architecture of complex traits in yeast</a></h4>

              
                Mapping the genetic basis of complex traits is critical to uncovering the biological mechanisms that underlie disease and other phenotypes. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in humans and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in model organisms can now explain much of the observed heritability in many traits, allowing us to predict phenotype from genotype. However, constraints on power due to statistical confounders in large GWAS and smaller sample sizes in QTL studies still limit our ability to resolve numerous small-effect variants, map them to causal genes, identify pleiotropic effects across multiple traits, and infer non-additive interactions between loci (epistasis). Here, we introduce barcoded bulk quantitative trait locus (BB-QTL) mapping, which allows us to construct, genotype, and phenotype 100,000 offspring of a budding yeast cross, two orders of magnitude larger than the previous state of the art. We use this panel to map the genetic basis of eighteen complex traits, finding that the genetic architecture of these traits involves hundreds of small-effect loci densely spaced throughout the genome, many with widespread pleiotropic effects across multiple traits. Epistasis plays a central role, with thousands of interactions that provide insight into genetic networks. By dramatically increasing sample size, BB-QTL mapping demonstrates the potential of natural variants in high-powered QTL studies to reveal the highly polygenic, pleiotropic, and epistatic architecture of complex traits.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The MIDAS domain of AAA mechanoenzyme Mdn1 forms catch bonds with two different substrates</a></h4>

              
                Catch bonds are a form of mechanoregulation wherein protein-ligand interactions are strengthened by the application of dissociative tension. Currently, the best-characterized examples of catch bonds are between single protein-ligand pairs. The essential AAA (ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities) mechanoenzyme Mdn1 drives at least two separate steps in ribosome biogenesis, using its MIDAS domain to extract the ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain-containing proteins Rsa4 and Ytm1 from ribosomal precursors. However, it must subsequently release these assembly factors to reinitiate the enzymatic cycle. The mechanism underlying the switching of the MIDAS-UBL interaction between strongly and weakly bound states is unknown. Here, we use optical tweezers to investigate the force dependence of MIDAS-UBL binding. Parallel experiments with Rsa4 and Ytm1 show that forces up to ~4 pN, matching the magnitude of force produced by AAA proteins similar to Mdn1, enhance the MIDAS domain binding lifetime up to 10-fold, and higher forces accelerate dissociation. Together, our studies indicate that Mdn1’s MIDAS domain can form catch bonds with more than one UBL substrate, and provide insights into how mechanoregulation may contribute to the Mdn1 enzymatic cycle during ribosome biogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Genetic integration of behavioural and endocrine components of the stress response</a></h4>

              
                The vertebrate stress response comprises a suite of behavioural and physiological traits that must be functionally integrated to ensure organisms cope adaptively with acute stressors. Natural selection should favour functional integration, leading to a prediction of genetic integration of these traits. Despite the implications of such genetic integration for our understanding of human and animal health, as well as evolutionary responses to natural and anthropogenic stressors, formal quantitative genetic tests of this prediction are lacking. Here, we demonstrate that acute stress response components in Trinidadian guppies are both heritable and integrated on the major axis of genetic covariation. This integration could either facilitate or constrain evolutionary responses to selection, depending upon the alignment of selection with this axis. Such integration also suggests artificial selection on the genetically correlated behavioural responses to stress could offer a viable non-invasive route to the improvement of health and welfare in captive animal populations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Multiple motors cooperate to establish and maintain acentrosomal spindle bipolarity in elegans oocyte meiosis</a></h4>

              
                While centrosomes organize spindle poles during mitosis, oocyte meiosis can occur in their absence. Spindles in human oocytes frequently fail to maintain bipolarity and consequently undergo chromosome segregation errors, making it important to understand mechanisms that promote acentrosomal spindle stability. To this end, we have optimized the auxin-inducible degron system in <i>C. elegans </i>to remove factors from pre-formed oocyte spindles within minutes and assess effects on spindle structure. This approach revealed that dynein is required to maintain the integrity of acentrosomal poles; removal of dynein from bipolar spindles caused pole splaying, and when coupled with a monopolar spindle induced by depletion of the kinesin-12 motor KLP-18, dynein depletion led to a complete dissolution of the monopole. Surprisingly, we went on to discover that following monopole disruption, individual chromosomes were able to reorganize local microtubules and re-establish a miniature bipolar spindle that mediated chromosome segregation. This revealed the existence of redundant microtubule sorting forces that are undetectable when KLP-18 and dynein are active. We found that the kinesin-5 family motor BMK-1 provides this force, uncovering the first evidence that kinesin-5 contributes to <i>C. elegans</i> meiotic spindle organization. Altogether, our studies have revealed how multiple motors are working synchronously to establish and maintain bipolarity in the absence of centrosomes.

                Naturally occurring point mutations in the <i>HBG</i> promoter switch hemoglobin synthesis from defective adult beta-globin to fetal gamma-globin in sickle-cell patients with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) and ameliorate the clinical severity. Inspired by this natural phenomenon, we tiled the highly homologous<i> HBG </i>proximal promoters using adenine and cytosine base editors that avoid the generation of large deletions and identified novel regulatory regions including a cluster at the -123 region. Base editing at -123 and -124bp of <i>HBG</i> promoter induced HbF to a higher level than disruption of well-known BCL11A binding site in erythroblasts derived from human CD34+ HSPC. We further demonstrated <i>in vitro</i> that the introduction of -123T&gt;C and -124T&gt;C HPFH-like mutations drives gamma-globin expression by creating a <i>de novo</i> binding site for KLF1. Overall, our findings shed light on so far unknown regulatory elements within the <i>HBG</i> promoter and identified additional targets for therapeutic upregulation of fetal hemoglobin.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Serum RNAs can predict lung cancer up to 10 years prior to diagnosis</a></h4>

              
                Lung cancer (LC) prognosis is closely linked to the stage of disease when diagnosed. We investigated the biomarker potential of serum RNAs for the early detection of LC in smokers at different prediagnostic time intervals and histological subtypes. In total, 1061 samples from 925 individuals were analyzed. RNA sequencing with an average of 18 million reads per sample was performed. We generated machine learning models using normalized serum RNA levels and found that smokers later diagnosed with LC in 10 years can be robustly separated from healthy controls regardless of histology with an average area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.68-0.83). Furthermore, the strongest models that took both time to diagnosis and histology into account successfully predicted non-small cell LC (NSCLC) between 6 to 8 years, with an AUC of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.76-0.88), and SCLC between 2 to 5 years, with an AUC of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.77-1.0), before diagnosis. The most important separators were microRNAs, miscellaneous RNAs, isomiRs and tRNA-derived fragments. We have shown that LC can be detected years before diagnosis and manifestation of disease symptoms independently of histological subtype. However, the highest AUCs were achieved for specific subtypes and time intervals before diagnosis. The collection of models may therefore also predict the severity of cancer development and its histology. Our study demonstrates that serum RNAs can be promising prediagnostic biomarkers in a LC screening setting, from early detection to risk assessment.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evolution of sexual conflict in scorpionflies</a></h4>

              
                Sexual conflict - opposite reproductive/genetic interests between sexes - can be a significant driver of insect evolution. Scorpionflies (Insecta: Mecoptera) are models in sexual conflict research due to their large variety of mating practices, including coercive behaviour and nuptial gift provisioning. However, the role of palaeontology in sexual conflict studies remains negligible, namely due to the paucity of well-preserved fossils. Here we describe three male scorpionflies from Cretaceous and Eocene ambers. The structure of notal and postnotal organs is analysed in extant and extinct forms; a depression below the base of the notal organ in different panorpid species spatially matches the anterior fold of the female's wing. Based on disparate abdominal configurations and correlations in extant relatives, we posit that each new fossil taxon had a different mating approach along a nuptial gifting-coercive spectrum. The Eocene specimen possesses extreme female clamping abdominal armature, suggesting a degree of sexual coercion greater than in any other known scorpionfly, extinct or extant. The fossil record of abdominal modifications in male scorpionflies documents a relatively late evolution (Eocene) of long notal organs indicating oppressive behaviour toward a female during mating. Our findings reveal a wider array of mating-related morphological specialisations among extinct Panorpoidea, likely reflecting more diversified past mating strategies and behaviours in this group, and represent first steps towards gaining a deep-time perspective on the evolution of sexual conflict over mating among insects.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">STIM1-dependent peripheral coupling governs the contractility of vascular smooth muscle cells</a></h4>

              
                Peripheral coupling between the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and plasma membrane (PM) forms signaling complexes that regulate the membrane potential and contractility of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs).  The mechanisms responsible for these membrane interactions are poorly understood. In many cells, STIM1 (stromal-interaction molecule 1), a single transmembrane-domain protein that resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), transiently moves to ER-PM junctions in response to depletion of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores and initiates store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE). Fully differentiated VSMCs express STIM1 but exhibit only marginal SOCE activity. We hypothesized that STIM1 is constitutively active in contractile VSMCs and maintains peripheral coupling. In support of this concept, we found that the number and size of SR-PM interacting sites were decreased, and SR-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling processes were disrupted in freshly isolated cerebral artery SMCs from tamoxifen-inducible, SMC-specific STIM1-knockout (<i>Stim1-</i>smKO) mice. VSMCs from <i>Stim1-</i>smKO mice also exhibited a reduction in nanoscale colocalization between Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release sites on the SR and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated ion channels on the PM, accompanied by diminished channel activity. <i>Stim1-</i>smKO mice were hypotensive, and resistance arteries isolated from them displayed blunted contractility. These data suggest that STIM1 - independent of SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion - is critically important for stable peripheral coupling in contractile VSMCs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A single-cell resolution gene expression atlas of the larval zebrafish brain</a></h4>

              
                The advent of multimodal brain atlases promises to accelerate discoveries in neuroscience by offering in silico queries of cell types, connectivity and gene expression in regions of interest. We employed multiplexed fluorescent in situ RNA hybridization chain reaction (HCR) to generate expression maps for an initial set of 200 marker genes across the larval zebrafish brain. The data were registered to the Max Planck Zebrafish Brain (mapzebrain) atlas, thus allowing co-visualization of gene expression patterns, single-neuron tracings, transgenic lines and anatomical segmentations. Additionally, brain activity maps of freely swimming larvae were generated at single-cell resolution using HCR labeling of the immediate-early gene cfos and integrated into the atlas. As a proof of concept, we identified a novel class of cerebellar eurydendroid cells that express calb2a, project to the hypothalamus and are activated in animals that have recently ingested food. Thus, a cellular-resolution gene expression atlas will not only help with rapid identification of marker genes for neuronal populations of interest, but also bridge the molecular and circuit levels by anchoring genetic information to functional activity maps and synaptic connectivity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rearing environment persistently modulates the phenotype of mice</a></h4>

              
                The phenotype of an organism results from its genotype and the influence of the environment throughout development. Even when using animals of the same genotype, independent studies may test animals of different phenotypes, resulting in poor replicability due to genotype-by-environment interactions. Thus, genetically defined strains of mice may respond differently to experimental treatments depending on their rearing environment. However, the extent of such phenotypic plasticity and its implications for the replicability of research findings have remained unknown. Here, we examined the extent to which common environmental differences between rearing facilities modulate the phenotype of genetically homogeneous (inbred) mice. We conducted a comprehensive multi-center study, where inbred mice from the same breeding stock were reared in five different facilities throughout early life and adolescence, before being transported to a single test laboratory. We found persistent effects of rearing facility on the composition and heterogeneity of the gut microbial community. These effects were paralleled by persistent differences in body weight and in the behavioural phenotype of the mice. Furthermore, we show that common variation among rearing facilities is strong enough to influence epigenetic patterns in neurons at the level of chromatin organization. We detected changes in chromatin organization in the regulatory regions of genes involved in nucleosome assembly, neuronal differentiation, synaptic plasticity and regulation of behavior. Our findings demonstrate that common environmental differences between rearing facilities may produce facility-specific phenotypes, from the molecular to the behavioural level. We expect our findings to stimulate further research into the mechanisms and drivers of these epigenetic changes mediated by the laboratory environment. Furthermore, they highlight an important limitation of inferences from single-laboratory studies and a need to account for the animals' environmental background in study design to produce robust and replicable findings.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Autophagy regulates neuronal excitability by controlling cAMP/Protein Kinase A signaling</a></h4>

              
                Autophagy provides nutrients during starvation and eliminates detrimental cellular components. However, accumulating evidence indicates that autophagy is not merely a housekeeping process. Here, we show that the protein AuTophaGy 5 (ATG5) functions in neurons to regulate the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of a synapse-confined proteome. This function of ATG5 is independent of bulk turnover of synaptic proteins and requires the targeting of PKA inhibitory R1 subunits to autophagosomes. Neuronal loss of ATG5 causes synaptic accumulation of PKA R1, which sequesters the PKA catalytic subunit and diminishes the cAMP/PKA-dependent phosphorylation of postsynaptic cytoskeletal proteins mediating AMPAR trafficking. Glutamatergic neurons-confined ATG5 deletion augments AMPAR-dependent excitatory neurotransmission and causes the appearance of spontaneous recurrent seizures in mice. Our findings identify a novel role of autophagy in regulating PKA signaling at glutamatergic synapses and suggest the PKA as a target for restoration of synaptic function in neurodegenerative conditions with autophagy dysfunction.

                It has been reported that intramuscular injection of an Adeno-associated viral vector serotype 1 (AAV1) encoding Neurotrophin-3 (NT3) into hindlimb muscles 24 hours after a severe T9 contusion in rats induced lumbar spinal neuroplasticity, partially restored locomotive function and reduced spasms during swimming. Here we investigated whether a targeted delivery of NT3 to lumbar and thoracic motor neurons 48 hours following a severe contusive injury aids locomotive recovery in rats. AAV1-NT3 was injected into the tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius and rectus abdominus muscles 48-hours following trauma, persistently elevating serum levels of the neurotrophin. NT3 improved trunk stability, accuracy of stepping during skilled locomotive tasks, and alternation of the hindlimbs during swimming, but it had no effect on gross locomotion function in the open field. The number of vGlut1+ (likely proprioceptive afferent) boutons on gastrocnemius -motor neurons was increased after injury but normalised following NT3 treatment suggestive of a mechanism in which the functional effects may be mediated through proprioceptive feedback. Ex vivo MRI revealed substantial loss of grey and white matter at the lesion epicentre but no effect of delayed NT3 treatment to induce neuroprotection or prevent secondary damage. Spasms and hyperreflexia were not reliably induced in this severe injury model suggesting a more complex anatomical or physiological cause to their induction. We have shown that delayed intramuscular AAV-NT3 treatment can promote recovery in skilled stepping and coordinated swimming supporting a role for NT3 as a therapeutic strategy for spinal injuries potentially through modulation of somatosensory feedback.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Optimal routing to cerebellum-like structures</a></h4>

              
                The vast expansion from mossy fibers to cerebellar granule cells produces a neural representation that supports functions including associative and internal model learning. This motif is shared by other cerebellum-like structures, including the insect mushroom body, electrosensory lobe of electric fish, and mammalian dorsal cochlear nucleus, and has inspired numerous theoretical models of its functional role. Less attention has been paid to structures immediately presynaptic to granule cell layers, whose architecture can be described as a "bottleneck" and whose functional role is not understood. We therefore develop a general theory of cerebellum-like structures in conjunction with their afferent pathways. This theory predicts the role of the pontine relay to cerebellar cortex and the glomerular organization of the insect antennal lobe. It also reconciles theories of nonlinear mixing with recent observations of correlated granule cell activity. More generally, it shows that structured compression followed by random expansion is an efficient architecture for flexible computation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Compartmental Neuropeptide Release Measured Using a New Oxytocin Sensor</a></h4>

              
                As a peptide hormone and neuromodulator, oxytocin (OT) plays a critical role in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes in both the central nervous system and the periphery. However, the processes that regulate spatial OT release in the brain remain enigmatic. Here, we developed a genetically encoded GPCR activation-based (GRAB) OT sensor called GRABOT1.0. Using this sensor, we directly visualized stimulation-induced OT release from specific compartments of OT neurons in acute brain slices, and discovered that N-type calcium channels predominantly mediate axonal OT release, while L-type calcium channels mediate somatodendritic OT release. In addition, we found that components in the fusion machinery of OT release differ between axon terminals versus somata and dendrites. Finally, we demonstrated the sensor responses to the activation of OT neurons in various brain regions in vivo and revealed region specific OT release during male courtship behavior. Taken together, these results provide key insights regarding the role of compartmental OT release in the control of physiological and behavioral functions.

                Low-protein diets can impact food intake and appetite, but it is not known if motivation for food is changed. In the present study, we used an operant behavioral task, the progressive ratio test, to assess whether motivation for different foods was affected when rats were maintained on a protein-restricted diet (PR, 5% protein diet) compared to non-restricted control rats (NR, 18% protein). Rats were tested either with nutritionally-balanced pellets (18.7% protein, Experiment 1) or protein-rich pellets (35% protein, Experiment 2) as reinforcers. Protein restriction increased breakpoint for protein-rich pellets, relative to non-restricted rats, whereas no difference in breakpoint for nutritionally-balanced pellets was observed between groups. When given free access to either nutritionally-balanced pellets or protein-rich pellets, PR and NR rats did not differ in their intake. We also tested whether a previous history of protein restriction might affect present motivation for different types of food, by assessing breakpoint of previously PR animals that were subsequently put on standard maintenance chow (protein-repleted rats, PRep, Experiment 2). PRep rats did not show increased breakpoint relative to their initial encounter with protein-rich pellets while they were protein-restricted. This study demonstrates that restriction of dietary protein induces a selective increased motivation for protein-rich food, a behavior that rapidly disappears once rats are not in need of protein.

                The cerebral cortex contains billions of neurons, and their disorganization or misspecification leads to neurodevelopmental disorders. Understanding how the plethora of projection neuron subtypes are generated by cortical neural stem cells (NSCs) is a major challenge. Here, we focused on elucidating the transcriptional landscape of murine embryonic NSCs, basal progenitors (BPs) and newborn neurons (NBNs) throughout cortical development. We uncover dynamic shifts in transcriptional space over time, and heterogeneity within each progenitor population. We identified signature hallmarks of NSC, BP and NBN clusters, and predict active transcriptional nodes and networks that contribute to neural fate specification. We find that the expression of receptors, ligands and downstream pathway components is highly dynamic over time and throughout the lineage implying differential responsiveness to signals. Thus, we provide an expansive compendium of gene expression during cortical development that will be an invaluable resource for studying neural developmental processes and neurodevelopmental disorders.

                Quantifying the microstructural and macrostructural geometrical features of the human brain's connections is necessary for understanding normal aging and disease. Here, we examine brain white matter diffusion magnetic resonance imaging data from one cross-sectional and two longitudinal datasets totaling in 1184 subjects and 2236 sessions of people aged 50-97 years. Data was drawn from well-established cohorts, including the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging dataset, Cambridge Centre for Ageing Neuroscience dataset, and the Vanderbilt Memory & Aging Project. Quantifying 4 microstructural features and, for the first time, 11 macrostructure-based features of volume, area, and length across 120 white matter pathways, we apply linear mixed effect modeling to investigate changes in pathway-specific features over time, and document large age associations within white matter. Conventional diffusion tensor microstructure indices are the most age-sensitive measures, with positive age associations for diffusivities and negative age associations with anisotropies, with similar patterns observed across all pathways. Similarly, pathway shape measures also change with age, with negative age associations for most length, surface area, and volume-based features. A particularly novel finding of this study is that while trends were homogeneous throughout the brain for microstructure features, macrostructural features demonstrated heterogeneity across pathways, whereby several projection, thalamic, and commissural tracts exhibited more decline with age compared to association and limbic tracts. The findings from this large-scale study provide a comprehensive overview of the age-related decline in white matter and demonstrate that macrostructural features may be more sensitive to heterogeneous white matter decline. Therefore, leveraging macrostructural features may be useful for studying aging and could have widespread implications for a variety of neurodegenerative disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Non-invasive stimulation with Temporal Interference: Optimization of the electric field deep in the brain with the use of a genetic algorithm</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Since the introduction of transcranial temporal interference stimulation (tTIS), there has been an ever-growing interest in this novel method, as it theoretically allows non-invasive stimulation of deep brain target regions. To date, attempts have been made to optimize the electrode montages and injected current to achieve personalized area targeting using two electrode pairs. Most of these methods use exhaustive search to find the best match, but faster and,at the same time, reliable solutions are required. In this study, the aforementioned stimulation settings were optimized using a genetic algorithm. Methods: Simulations were performed on head models from the Population Head Model (PHM) repository. First, each model was fitted with an electrode array based on the 10-10 international EEG electrode placement system. Following electrode placement, the models were meshed and solved for all single-pair electrode combinations using an electrode on the left mastoid as a reference (ground). At the optimization stage, different electrode pairs and injection currents were tested using a genetic algorithm to obtain the optimal combination for each model. Results: Greater focality was achieved with optimization, specifically for the right hippocampus (region of interest), with a significant decrease in the surrounding electric field intensity. In the non-optimized case, the brain volumes stimulated above 0.2 V/m were 99.9% in the region of interest (ROI), and 76.4% in the rest of the gray matter. In contrast, the stimulated volumes were 91.4% and 29.6% for the best optimization case. Additionally, the maximum electric field intensity inside the region of interest was consistently higher than that outside the ROI for all optimized cases. Significance: Given that the accomplishment of a globally optimal solution requires a brute-force approach, the use of a genetic algorithm can significantly decrease the optimization time and provide usable results. Although the method is promising and the indications are becoming more robust, such that optimal solutions can be achieved at the individual level, there are limitations on what can be achieved using only two electrode pairs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Duration reproduction under memory pressure: Modeling the roles of visual memory load in duration encoding and reproduction</a></h4>

              
                Duration estimates are often biased by the sampled statistical context, yielding the classical central- tendency effect, i.e., short durations are over- and long duration underestimated. Most studies of the central-tendency bias have primarily focused on the integration of the sensory measure and the prior information, without considering any cognitive limits. Here, we investigated the impact of cognitive (visual working-memory) load on duration estimation in the duration encoding and reproduction stages. In four experiments, observers had to perform a dual, attention-sharing task: reproducing a given duration (primary) and memorizing a variable set of color patches (secondary). We found an increase in memory load (i.e., set size) during the duration-encoding stage to increase the central-tendency bias, while shortening the reproduced duration in general; in contrast, increasing the load during the reproduction stage prolonged the reproduced duration, without influencing the central tendency. By integrating an attentional-sharing account into a hierarchical Bayesian model, we were able to predict both the general over- and underestimation and the central- tendency effects observed in all four experiments. The model suggests that memory pressure during the encoding stage increases the sensory noise, which elevates the central-tendency effect. In contrast, memory pressure during the reproduction stage only influences the monitoring of elapsed time, leading to a general duration over-reproduction without impacting the central tendency.

                Inhibitor-2 (I-2) is a prototypic inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1 (PP1), a major serine-threonine phosphatase that regulates synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. Although I-2 is a potent inhibitor of PP1 in vitro, our previous work has elucidated that, in vivo, I-2 may act as a positive regulator of PP1. Here we show that I-2 and PP1{gamma}, but not PP1, positively regulate synaptic transmission in hippocampal neurons. Moreover, we demonstrated that I-2 enhances PP1{gamma} interaction with its major synaptic scaffold, neurabin, by Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET)/Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) studies, while having a limited effect on PP1 autoinhibitory phosphorylation. Furthermore, our study indicates that the effect of I-2 on PP1 activity in vivo is dictated by I-2 threonine-72 phosphorylation. Our work thus demonstrates a molecular mechanism by which I-2 positively regulates PP1 function in synaptic transmission.

                Previous work has shown relations between domain-general processes, domain-specific processes, and mathematical ability. However, the underlying neurophysiological effects of mathematical ability are less clear. Recent evidence highlighted the potential role of beta oscillations in mathematical ability. Here we investigate whether domain-general (working memory) and domain-specific (number sense) mediate the relation between resting-state beta oscillations and mathematical ability, and how this may differ as a function of development (children vs. adults). We compared a traditional analysis method normally used in EEG studies with a more recently developed parameterization method that separates periodic from aperiodic activity. Regardless of methods chosen, we found no support for mediation of working memory and number sense, neither for children nor for adults. However, we found subtle differences between the methods. Additionally, we showed that the traditional EEG analysis method conflates periodic activity with aperiodic activity, and the latter is strongly related to mathematical ability and this relation differs between children and adults. At the cognitive level, our findings do not support previous suggestions of a mediation of working memory and number sense. At the neurophysiological level our findings suggest that aperiodic, rather than periodic, activity is linked to mathematical ability as a function of development.

                Strokes cause lesions that damage brain tissue, disrupt normal brain activity patterns, and can lead to impairments in cognition and motor function. Although modulation of cortical activity is central to stimulation-based rehabilitative therapies, aberrant and adaptive patterns of brain activity after stroke have not yet been fully characterized. Here, we apply a brain dynamics analysis approach to study longitudinal brain activity patterns in individuals with ischemic pontine stroke. We first found 4 commonly occurring brain states largely characterized by high amplitude activations in the visual, frontoparietal, default mode, and motor networks. Stroke subjects spent less time in the frontoparietal state compared to controls, and, consistently, the default mode state had fewer transitions to the frontoparietal state in stroke subjects relative to controls. For individuals with dominant-hand CST damage, increased time spent in the frontoparietal state from 1 week to 3-6 months post-stroke was associated with better motor recovery over the same time period, an association which was independent of baseline impairment. Furthermore, the amount of time spent in brain states was linked theoretically and empirically to functional connectivity. This work suggests that when the dominant-hand CST is compromised in stroke, resting state configurations may shift to include increased activation of the frontoparietal network, which may facilitate compensatory neural pathways that support recovery of motor function when traditional motor circuits of the dominant-hemisphere CST are compromised. Determining subject- and stroke lesion-specific patterns of brain activity highly associated with recovery may help improve the design of clinical rehabilitation strategies, including non-invasive brain stimulation.

                Animals vary widely in body size across and within species. This has consequences in large and small individuals for the function of organs and body parts. How these scale in relation to body size reveals evolutionary investment strategies, often resulting in trade-offs between functions. Eyes exemplify these trade-offs, as they are limited by their absolute size in two key performance features: sensitivity and spatial acuity. Previous studies of the 3D structure of apposition compound eyes, which are ideal models for allometric studies due to their size polymorphism, revealed that allometric scaling improves both local resolution and visual sensitivity in larger bumblebees (Taylor et al., 2019). Here, we build on the established methods and results to investigate allometric scaling in superposition compound eyes - the second prominent eye type in insects - for the first time. Our research highlights a surprising strategy to cope with the challenge to sensitivity and spatial resolution in small eyes, as we show that the eyes of the hummingbird hawkmoth retain an optimal balance of these performance measures across all body sizes.

Accumulation of alpha synuclein is involved in cancer. SNCA140 increases oxidative stress, and this leads to elevated amyloidogenic APP processing. There is currently no effective / disease-modifying treatment of AD and PDD. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are promising therapeutic candidates for the repair and regeneration of neural cells, but their viable clinical application in AD and PDD treatment requires consideration of epistatic influence of the lineage substitution of SNCA . Objective s - Here, we hypothesised that SNCAPAN exhibit lineage substitution in hMSCs-derived neurons, and it is epistatic to SNCA140 expression. Methodology - we examined phenotypic characteristic of AD and PDD biomarkers in hMSCs-derived neurons at p+6 in four biological replicates (n = 4) with non-template controls (NTCs, n = 2) for each target gene using a Q-PCR. Amplification reactions in NTC S NCA98 and NTC S NCA115 were validated by gel electrophoresis. SNCA98 S NCA126 molecular interaction observed was determined using spearmans rank correlation regression, and this was validated by gel electrophoresis of generic PCR (50{degrees}C, 52{degrees}C, 54{degrees}C, 56{degrees}C, 58{degrees}C, and 60{degrees}C) with NTC using Universal human reference RNA (UHRR) and astrocytoma stem cells. Expression of each gene was normalised to 18S, the endogenous control. Data are presented as mean 2 (-??Ct) {+/-} SEM. Results - SNCAPAN exhibits lineage substitution in hMSC-derived neurons, and it is epistatic to SNCA140 expression, a first time viable novel structural remodelling functional innovation in the treatment of AD, PDD, and Brain Cancer. In SNCA98 and SNCA115 , there were NTC amplification reactions. SNCA98 and SNCA115 expressions are significantly higher compared to APP (P = 0.002947735; P = 1.3411E-07), MAPT (P = 0.00184993; P = 5.15474E-05), SNCAPAN (P = 0.003579771; P = 3.69932E-06), SNCA112 (P = 0.006057562; P = 9.06788E-05), and SNCA126 (P = 0.001054018; P = 2.36E-05) respectively. SNCA98 expression extremely and significantly correlates with SNCA126 expression ({rho} = 0.9827; P = 3.71669E-05). Conclusion - The UHRR of gel electrophoresis of generic PCR containing SNCA126 in astrocytoma stem cells at 50{degrees}C and 52{degrees}C confirms the significant SNCA98 -S NCA126 relationship as sign epistasis (deleterious SNCA98 enhances beneficial SNCA126 ) due to synergistic epistatic background created by SNCAPAN , and this validates the epistasis of SNCAPAN to SNCA140.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Omission responses in field potentials but not spikes in rat auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Non-invasive recordings of gross neural activity in humans often show responses to omitted stimuli in steady trains of identical stimuli. This has been taken as evidence for the neural coding of prediction or prediction error. However, evidence for such omission responses from invasive recordings of cellular-scale responses in animal models is scarce. Here, we sought to characterise omission responses using extracellular recordings in the auditory cortex of anaesthetised rats. We profiled omission responses across local field potentials (LFP), analogue multiunit activity (AMUA), and single/multi-unit spiking activity, using stimuli that were fixed-rate trains of acoustic noise bursts where 5% of bursts were randomly omitted. Significant omission responses were observed in LFP and AMUA signals, but not in spiking activity. These omission responses had a lower amplitude and longer latency than burst-evoked sensory responses, and omission response amplitude increased as a function of the number of preceding bursts. Contrary to theories of neural entrainment, rhythmic stimulus presentation did not increase low-frequency phase-locking of neural activity specific to the stimulus presentation rate. Together, our findings show that omission responses are observed in LFP and AMUA signals, with laminar specificity, but are not observed in spiking activity, and do not show evidence for low-frequency phase locking. This has implications for models of cortical processing that require many neurons to encode prediction error in their spike output, and is consistent with models involving representation of prediction error in apical dendrites electrotonically distant from the soma.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity mechanisms are segregated in sub-types of layer 5 neuron in the visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Cortical layer 5 contains two major types of projection neuron known as IB (intrinsic bursting) cells that project sub-cortically and RS (regular spiking) cells that project between cortical areas. We studied the plasticity properties of RS and IB cells in the visual cortex during the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity in mice. RS neurons exhibited synaptic depression in response to both dark exposure (DE) and monocular deprivation (MD), and their homeostatic recovery from depression was dependent on TNFalpha. In contrast, IB cells demonstrated opposite responses to DE and MD, potentiating to DE and depressing to MD. Potentiation in IB cells depended on CaMKII- autophosphorylation and not TNFalpha. IB cells showed mature synaptic properties at the start of the critical period while RS cells matured during the critical period. Together with observations in somatosensory cortex, these results suggest that differences in RS and IB plasticity mechanisms are a general cortical property.

	<p>(1) Background: West syndrome is a severe, refractory, epileptic syndrome that usually appears in infancy or early childhood. ACTH is one of the more effective drugs for treating this condition. (2)Aim of the study and methods: The objective of our study was to examine short-term efficacy (during treatment schedule) and long-term outcome of intramuscular 0.02 mg/kg/day ACTH (tetracosactide) depot, used concomitantly with other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in patients with infantile spasms who did not achieve seizure cessation or relapse when taking only the AEDs. The drug efficacy was evaluated in retrospective and prospective analyses of 50 patients diagnosed with infantile spasms. (3) Results: Complete cessation of spasms was achieved in 42 cases (84%). EEG improvement was seen in 41 (82%) patients who responded to ACTH therapy. Information on the clinical course of 28 patients was obtained duringlong-term follow-up. In 17 (60.7%) cases, seizures were still present. Normal or near-normal development was observed in 11 out of 28 children (39%). ACTH used concomitantly with other AEDis a highly effective treatment with acceptable side effects. (4) Conclusion: Randomized controlled clinical trialswith long-term follow-up are needed to compare the effectiveness of ACTH in polytherapy and monotherapy.Dyskinesias as a potential side effect observed in our study group should be investigated in the following studies.</p>

	<p>In this explorative mixed-method pilot study, we set out to have a closer look at the largely under-recognized and under-investigated symptom of thick mucus in patients with ALS and its impact on patients and relatives. Thick mucus is a highly distressing symptom for both patients and caregivers. It complicates the use of non-invasive ventilation and is therefore an important prognostic factor of survival. Methods: In our preliminary study, we used a cross-sectional design, including ten ALS patients with thick mucus who were matched to ten ALS patients without thick mucus. Lung function tests and laboratory and sputum analysis were performed and questionnaires administered in order to determine associated factors of thick mucus accumulation. In a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews, we analysed the impact of thick mucus on patients and caregivers. Results: Reduced respiratory parameters as well as a higher degree of bulbar impairment were associated with the presence of thick mucus. Quality of life of patients and caregivers was strongly impaired by thick mucus accumulation. Conclusions: Thick mucus in patients with ALS has a strong impact on quality of life. Reduced cough flow and severely impaired bulbar function appear to be indicative parameters. We suggest that healthcare providers actively explore the presence of thick mucus in their patients and that it becomes included in commonly used screening tools.</p>

	<p>Optimizing hearing in patients with a unilateral cochlear implant (CI) and contralateral acoustic hearing is a challenge. Evolutionary algorithms (EA) can explore a large set of potential solutions in a stochastic manner to approach the optimum of a minimization problem. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate an EA-based protocol to modify the default frequency settings of a MAP (fMAP) of the CI in patients with bimodal hearing. Methods: This monocentric prospective study included 27 adult CI users (with post-lingual deafness and contralateral functional hearing). A fitting program based on EA was developed to approach the best fMAP. Generated fMAPs were tested by speech recognition (word recognition score, WRS) in noise and free-field-like conditions. By combining these first fMAPs and adding some random changes, a total of 13 fMAPs over 3 generations were produced. Participants were evaluated before and 45 to 60 days after the fitting by WRS in noise and questionnaires on global sound quality and music perception in bimodal binaural conditions. Results: WRS in noise improved with the EA-based fitting in comparison to the default fMAP (41.67 &amp;amp;plusmn; 9.70% versus 64.63 &amp;amp;plusmn; 16.34%, respectively, p = 0.0001, signed-rank test). The global sound quality and music perception were also improved, as judged by ratings on questionnaires and scales. Finally, most patients chose to keep the new fitting definitively. Conclusions: By modifying the default fMAPs, the EA improved the speech discrimination in noise and the sound quality in bimodal binaural conditions.</p>

	<p>Emotion recognition ability is the basis of interpersonal communication and detection of brain alterations. Existing tools for assessing emotion recognition ability are mostly single modality, paper-and-pencil test format, and using only Western stimuli. However, various modalities and cultural factors greatly influence emotion recognition ability. We aimed to develop a multi-modality emotion recognition mobile application (MMER app). A total of 169 healthy adults were recruited as participants. The MMER app&amp;amp;rsquo;s materials were extracted from a published database, and tablets were used as the interface. The Rasch, factor analysis, and related psychometric analyses were performed. The Cronbach alpha was 0.94, and the test&amp;amp;ndash;retest reliability was 0.85. Factor analyses identified three factors. In addition, an adjusted score formula was provided for clinical use. The MMER app has good psychometric properties, and its further possible applications and investigations are discussed.</p>

	<p>The first step for a harmonious bio-psycho-social framework in approaching autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is overcoming the conflict between the biological and the psychosocial perspective. Biological research can provide clues for a correct approach to clinical practice, assuming that it would lead to the conceptualization of a pathogenetic paradigm able to account for epidemiologic and clinical findings. The upward trajectory in ASD prevalence and the systemic involvement of other organs besides the brain suggest that the epigenetic paradigm is the most plausible one. The embryo-fetal period is the crucial window of opportunity for keeping neurodevelopment on the right tracks, suggesting that women&amp;amp;rsquo;s health in pregnancy should be a priority. Maladaptive molecular pathways beginning in utero, in particular, a vicious circle between the immune response, oxidative stress/mitochondrial dysfunction, and dysbiosis-impact neurodevelopment and brain functioning across the lifespan and are the basis for progressive multisystemic disorders that account for the substantial health loss and the increased mortality in ASD. Therefore, the biological complexity of ASD and its implications for health requires the enhancement of clinical skills on these topics, to achieve an effective multi-disciplinary healthcare model. Well-balanced training courses could be a promising starting point to make a change.</p>

	<p>Airway obstruction activates mechanoreceptors that project to the cerebral cortices in humans, as evidenced by scalp encephalography recordings of cortical neuronal activation, i.e., respiratory-related evoked potential (RREP). However, neural evidence of both high spatial and temporal resolution of occlusion-elicited cortical activation in healthy individuals is lacking. In the present study, we tested our hypothesis that inspiratory mechanical stimuli elicit neural activation in cortical structures that can be recorded using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We further examined the relationship between depression and respiratory symptoms and hemispheric dominance in terms of emotional states. A total of 14 healthy nonsmoking participants completed a respiratory symptom questionnaire and a depression symptom questionnaire, followed by MEG and RREP recordings of inspiratory occlusion. Transient inspiratory occlusion of 300 ms was provided randomly every 2 to 4 breaths, and approximately 80 occlusions were collected in every study participant. Participants were required to press a button for detection when they sensed occlusion. Respiratory-related evoked fields (RREFs) and RREP peaks were identified in terms of latencies and amplitudes in the right and left hemispheres. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was further used to examine differences in peak amplitudes between the right and left hemispheres. Our results showed that inspiratory occlusion elicited RREF M1 peaks between 80 and 100 ms after triggering. Corresponding neuromagnetic responses peaked in the sensorimotor cortex, insular cortex, lateral frontal cortex, and middle frontal cortex. Overall, the RREF M1 peak amplitude in the right insula was significantly higher than that in the left insula (p = 0.038). The RREP data also showed a trend of higher N1 peak amplitudes in the right hemisphere compared to the left (p = 0.064, one-tailed). Subgroup analysis revealed that the laterality index of sensorimotor cortex activation was significantly different between higher- and lower-depressed individuals (&amp;amp;minus;0.33 vs. &amp;amp;minus;0.02, respectively; p = 0.028). For subjective ratings, a significant relationship was found between an individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s depression level and their respiratory symptoms (Spearman&amp;amp;rsquo;s rho = 0.54, p = 0.028, one-tailed). In summary, our results demonstrated that the inspiratory occlusion paradigm is feasible to elicit an RREF M1 peak with MEG. Our imaging results showed that cortical neurons were activated in the sensorimotor, frontal, middle temporal, and insular cortices for the M1 peak. Respiratory occlusion elicited higher cortical neuronal activation in the right insula compared to the left, with a higher tendency for right laterality in the sensorimotor cortex for higher-depressed rather than lower-depressed individuals. Higher levels of depression were associated with higher levels of respiratory symptoms. Future research with a larger sample size is recommended to investigate the role of emotion and laterality in cerebral neural processing of respiratory sensation.</p>

	<p>The treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI) is currently a major challenge, with a severe lack of effective therapies for yielding meaningful improvements in function. Therefore, there is a great opportunity for the development of novel treatment strategies for SCI. The modulation of autophagy, a process by which a cell degrades and recycles unnecessary or harmful components (protein aggregates, organelles, etc.) to maintain cellular homeostasis and respond to a changing microenvironment, is thought to have potential for treating many neurodegenerative conditions, including SCI. The discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs), which are short ribonucleotide transcripts for targeting of specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for silencing, shows prevention of the translation of mRNAs to the corresponding proteins affecting various cellular processes, including autophagy. The number of known miRNAs and their targets continues to grow rapidly. This review article aims to explore the relationship between autophagy and SCI, specifically with the intent of identifying specific miRNAs that can be useful to modulate autophagy for neuroprotection and the improvement of functional recovery in SCI.</p>

	<p>This short review presents the hypothesis that stress-dependent dopamine (DA) transmission contributes to developing and maintaining the brain network supporting a cognitive reserve. Research has shown that people with a greater cognitive reserve are better able to avoid symptoms of degenerative brain changes. The paper will review evidence that: (1) successful adaptation to stressors involves development and stabilization of effective but flexible coping strategies; (2) this process requires dynamic reorganization of functional networks in the adult brain; (3) DA transmission is amongst the principal mediators of this process; (4) age- and disease-dependent cognitive impairment is associated with dysfunctional connectivity both between and within these same networks as well as with reduced DA transmission.</p>

                <p>Operant chambers are widely used in animal research to study cognition, motivation, and learning processes. Paired with the rapidly developing technologies for brain imaging and manipulations of brain activity, operant conditioning chambers are a powerful tool for neuroscience research. The behavioral testing and imaging setups that are commercially available are often quite costly. Here, we present a custom-built operant chamber that can be constructed in a few days by an unexperienced user with relatively inexpensive, widely available materials. The advantages of our operant setup compared with other open-source and closed-source solutions are its relatively low cost, its support of complex behavioral tasks, its user-friendly setup, and its validated functionality with video imaging of behavior and calcium imaging using the UCLA Miniscope. Using this setup, we replicate our previously published findings showing that mice exposed to social defeat stress in adolescence have inhibitory control impairments in the Go/No-Go task when they reach adulthood. We also present calcium imaging data of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) neuronal activity acquired during Go/No-Go testing in freely moving mice and show that neuronal population activity increases from day 1 to day 14 of the task. We propose that our operant chamber is a cheaper alternative to its commercially available counterparts and offers a better balance between versatility and user-friendly setup than other open-source alternatives.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Beta-klotho (KLB) is a co-receptor required for endocrine fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 15/19 and FGF21 signaling in the brain. <i>Klb</i> is prominent within the hypothalamus, which is consistent with its metabolic functions, but diverse roles for <i>Klb</i> are now emerging. Central <i>Klb</i> expression is low but discrete and may govern FGF-targeted sites. However, given its low expression, it is unclear if <i>Klb</i> mRNA is more widespread. We performed in situ hybridization to label <i>Klb</i> mRNA to generate spatial maps capturing the distribution and level of <i>Klb</i> within the mouse hypothalamus, hippocampal region, subiculum, and amygdala. Semi-quantitative analysis revealed that <i>Klb</i>-labeled cells may express low, medium, or high levels of <i>Klb</i> mRNA. Hypothalamic <i>Klb</i> hybridization was heterogeneous and varied rostrocaudally within the same region. Most <i>Klb</i>-labeled cells were found in the lateral hypothalamic zone, but the periventricular hypothalamic region, including the suprachiasmatic nucleus, contained the greatest proportion of cells expressing medium or high <i>Klb</i> levels. We also found heterogeneous <i>Klb</i> hybridization in the amygdala and subiculum, where <i>Klb</i> was especially distinct within the central amygdalar nucleus and ventral subiculum, respectively. By contrast, <i>Klb</i>-labeled cells in the hippocampal region only expressed low levels of <i>Klb</i> and were typically found in the pyramidal layer of Ammon's horn or dentate gyrus. The <i>Klb</i>-labeled regions identified in this study are consistent with reported roles of <i>Klb</i> in metabolism, taste preference, and neuroprotection. However, additional identified sites, including within the hypothalamus and amygdala, may suggest novel roles for FGF15/19 or FGF21 signaling.</p>
<p>The central expression of beta-klotho (<i>Klb</i>) is essential for the physiological actions of endocrine fibroblast growth factors. <i>Klb</i> mRNA was widely expressed throughout the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala. However, the level of <i>Klb</i> expression varied between cells and contributed to a distinctive pattern of distribution within each brain structure.</p>

<p>Using the unbiased stereological methods, we found that long-term, regular and moderate running exercise could delay the loss of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the mPFC of APP/PS1 mice.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is thought to be closely associated with emotional processes, decision making, and memory. Previous studies have identified the prefrontal cortex as one of the most vulnerable brain regions in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Running exercise has widely been recognized as a simple and effective method of physical activity that enhances brain function and slows the progression of AD. However, the effect of exercise on the mPFC of AD is unclear. To address these issues, we investigated the effects of 4 months of exercise on the numbers of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the mPFC of 12-month-old APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic AD model mice using stereological methods. The spatial learning and memory abilities of mice were tested using the Morris water maze. Four months of running exercise delayed declines in spatial learning and memory abilities. The stereological results showed significantly lower numbers of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the mPFC of APP/PS1 mice than in the wild-type control group. The numbers of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the mPFC of running APP/PS1 mice were significantly greater than those in the APP/PS1 control mice. In addition, running-induced improvements in spatial learning and memory were significantly associated with running-induced increases in spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons numbers in the mPFC. Running exercise could delay the loss of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the mPFC of APP/PS1 mice. This finding might provide an important structural basis for exercise-induced improvements in the spatial learning and memory abilities of individuals with AD.</p>

<p>Characterization of early myelin ensheathment during Xenopus mid-larval development was performed by immunostaining for myelin basic protein and by third harmonic generation microscopy. Temporally patterned visual stimuli regulated the extent of myelination.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Myelination allows for the regulation of conduction velocity, affecting the precise timing of neuronal inputs important for the development and function of brain circuits. In turn, myelination may be altered by changes in experience, neuronal activity, and vesicular release, but the links between sensory experience, corresponding neuronal activity, and resulting alterations in myelination require further investigation. We thus studied the development of myelination in the <i>Xenopus laevis</i> tadpole, a classic model for studies of visual system development and function because it is translucent and visually responsive throughout the formation of its retinotectal system. We begin with a systematic characterization of the timecourse of early myelin ensheathment in the <i>Xenopus</i> retinotectal system using immunohistochemistry of myelin basic protein (MBP) along with third harmonic generation (THG) microscopy, a label-free structural imaging technique. Based on the mid-larval developmental progression of MBP expression in <i>Xenopus</i>, we identified an appropriate developmental window in which to assess the effects of early temporally patterned visual experience on myelin ensheathment. We used calcium imaging of axon terminals in vivo to characterize the responses of retinal ganglion cells over a range of stroboscopic stimulation frequencies. Strobe frequencies that reliably elicited robust versus dampened calcium responses were then presented to animals for 7 d, and differences in the amount of early myelin ensheathment at the optic chiasm were subsequently quantified. This study provides evidence that it is not just the presence but also to the specific temporal properties of sensory stimuli that are important for myelin plasticity.</p>

     alt="Morphological principles of neuronal mitochondria"/>
<p>High quality 3D reconstructions of mitochondria were generated using serial TEM tomography images of axonal and presynaptic mitochondria, producing minimal distortion from the original images. The resulting in-silico representations were subsequently quantified by differential geometry methods in terms of curvatures, surface areas, volumes, and membrane motifs, all of which can alter the metabolic output of the organelle. These methods enable structural motifs to be identified across the sampled population, presenting useful information for future physiological modeling of neuronal mitochondria.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In the highly dynamic metabolic landscape of a neuron, mitochondrial membrane architectures can provide critical insight into the unique energy balance of the cell. Current theoretical calculations of functional outputs like adenosine triphosphate and heat often represent mitochondria as idealized geometries, and therefore, can miscalculate the metabolic fluxes. To analyze mitochondrial morphology in neurons of mouse cerebellum neuropil, 3D tracings of complete synaptic and axonal mitochondria were constructed using a database of serial transmission electron microscopy (TEM) tomography images and converted to watertight meshes with minimal distortion of the original microscopy volumes with a granularity of 1.64 nanometer isotropic voxels. The resulting in-silico representations were subsequently quantified by differential geometry methods in terms of the mean and Gaussian curvatures, surface areas, volumes, and membrane motifs, all of which can alter the metabolic output of the organelle. Finally, we identify structural motifs present across this population of mitochondria, which may contribute to future modeling studies of mitochondrial physiology and metabolism in neurons.</p>

<p>We examined sites of isotocin (IT) action throughout an evolutionarily conserved vocal motor network that is shared by nearly all vocal vertebrates. Using the highly vocal plainfin midshipman (<i>Porichthys notatus</i>) fish, we find that IT receptor (R) mRNA and IT-like fibers are widespread throughout the vocal motor network. Next, using a neural activity marker, we show that ITR dense nuclei within forebrain and midbrain nodes are differentially activated during vocal courtship. Midshipman photo credit: Margaret Marchaterre

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuropeptides, including oxytocin-like peptides, are a conserved group of hormones that regulate a wide range of social behaviors, including vocal communication. In the current study, we evaluate whether putative brain sites for the actions of isotocin (IT), the oxytocin (OT) homolog of teleost fishes are associated with vocal courtship and circuitry in the plainfin midshipman fish (<i>Porichthys notatus</i>). During the breeding season, nesting males produce advertisement calls known as “hums” to acoustically court females at night and attract them to nests. We first identify IT receptor (ITR) mRNA in evolutionarily conserved regions of the forebrain preoptic area (POA), anterior hypothalamus (AH), and midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG), and in two topographically separate populations within the hindbrain vocal pattern generator– duration-coding vocal prepacemaker (VPP) and amplitude-coding vocal motor nuclei (VMN) that also innervate vocal muscles. We also verify that ITR expression overlaps known distribution sites of OT-like immunoreactive fibers. Next, using phosphorylated ribosomal subunit 6 (pS6) as a marker for activated neurons, we demonstrate that ITR-containing neurons in the anterior parvocellular POA, AH, PAG, VPP, and VMN are activated in humming males. Posterior parvocellular and magno/gigantocellular divisions of the POA remain constitutively active in nonhumming males that are also in a reproductive state. Together with prior studies of midshipman fish and other vertebrates, our findings suggest that IT-signaling influences male courtship behavior, in part, by acting on brain regions that broadly influence behavioral state (POA) as well as the initiation (POA and PAG) and temporal structure (VPP and VMN) of advertisement hums.</p>

<p>Satb1 expressing cells make up a subpopulation of ganglion cells in the retinas of marmosets, macaques, and humans. They comprise different morphological cell types and in marmoset include the recursive bistratified cell, which is a candidate for the on-off direction-selective ganglion cell.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have enabled the molecular distinction of ganglion cell populations in mammalian retinas. Here we used antibodies against the transcription factor special AT-rich binding protein 1 (Satb1, a protein which is expressed by on-off direction-selective ganglion cells in mouse retina) to study Satb1 expression in the retina of marmosets (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>), macaques (<i>Macaca fascicularis</i>), and humans. In all species, Satb1 was exclusively expressed in retinal ganglion cells. The Satb1 cells made up ∼2% of the ganglion cell population in the central retina of all species, rising to a maximum ∼7% in peripheral marmoset retina. Intracellular injections in marmoset and macaque retinas revealed that most Satb1 expressing ganglion cells are widefield ganglion cells. In marmoset, Satb1 cells have a densely branching dendritic tree and include broad and narrow thorny, recursive bistratified, and parasol cells, all of which show some costratification with the outer or inner cholinergic amacrine cells. The recursive bistratified cells showed the strongest costratification but did not show extensive cofasciculation as reported for on-off direction-selective ganglion cells in rabbit and rodent retinas. In macaque, Satb1 was not expressed in recursive bistratified cells, but in large sparsely branching cells. Our findings further support the idea that the expression of transcription factors in retinal ganglion cells is not conserved across Old World (human and macaque) and New World (marmoset) primates and provides a further step to link a molecular marker with specific cell types.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Chiral evasion and stereospecific antifolate resistance in Staphylococcus aureus</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Siyu Wang, Stephanie M. Reeve, Graham T. Holt, Adegoke A. Ojewole, Marcel S. Frenkel, Pablo Gainza, Santosh Keshipeddy, Vance G. Fowler, Dennis L. Wright, Bruce R. Donald</p>

Antimicrobial resistance presents a significant health care crisis. The mutation F98Y in Staphylococcus aureus dihydrofolate reductase (SaDHFR) confers resistance to the clinically important antifolate trimethoprim (TMP). Propargyl-linked antifolates (PLAs), next generation DHFR inhibitors, are much more resilient than TMP against this F98Y variant, yet this F98Y substitution still reduces efficacy of these agents. Surprisingly, differences in the enantiomeric configuration at the stereogenic center of PLAs influence the isomeric state of the NADPH cofactor. To understand the molecular basis of F98Y-mediated resistance and how PLAs’ inhibition drives NADPH isomeric states, we used protein design algorithms in the osprey protein design software suite to analyze a comprehensive suite of structural, biophysical, biochemical, and computational data. Here, we present a model showing how F98Y SaDHFR exploits a different anomeric configuration of NADPH to evade certain PLAs’ inhibition, while other PLAs remain unaffected by this resistance mechanism.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Machine learning modeling of family wide enzyme-substrate specificity screens</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Samuel Goldman, Ria Das, Kevin K. Yang, Connor W. Coley</p>

Biocatalysis is a promising approach to sustainably synthesize pharmaceuticals, complex natural products, and commodity chemicals at scale. However, the adoption of biocatalysis is limited by our ability to select enzymes that will catalyze their natural chemical transformation on non-natural substrates. While machine learning and <i>in silico</i> directed evolution are well-posed for this predictive modeling challenge, efforts to date have primarily aimed to increase activity against a single known substrate, rather than to identify enzymes capable of acting on new substrates of interest. To address this need, we curate 6 different high-quality enzyme family screens from the literature that each measure multiple enzymes against multiple substrates. We compare machine learning-based compound-protein interaction (CPI) modeling approaches from the literature used for predicting drug-target interactions. Surprisingly, comparing these interaction-based models against collections of independent (single task) enzyme-only or substrate-only models reveals that current CPI approaches are incapable of learning interactions between compounds and proteins in the current family level data regime. We further validate this observation by demonstrating that our no-interaction baseline can outperform CPI-based models from the literature used to guide the discovery of kinase inhibitors. Given the high performance of non-interaction based models, we introduce a new structure-based strategy for pooling residue representations across a protein sequence. Altogether, this work motivates a principled path forward in order to build and evaluate meaningful predictive models for biocatalysis and other drug discovery applications.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Homeostatic control of synaptic rewiring in recurrent networks induces the formation of stable memory engrams</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Júlia V. Gallinaro, Nebojša Gašparović, Stefan Rotter</p>

Brain networks store new memories using functional and structural synaptic plasticity. Memory formation is generally attributed to Hebbian plasticity, while homeostatic plasticity is thought to have an ancillary role in stabilizing network dynamics. Here we report that homeostatic plasticity alone can also lead to the formation of stable memories. We analyze this phenomenon using a new theory of network remodeling, combined with numerical simulations of recurrent spiking neural networks that exhibit structural plasticity based on firing rate homeostasis. These networks are able to store repeatedly presented patterns and recall them upon the presentation of incomplete cues. Storage is fast, governed by the homeostatic drift. In contrast, forgetting is slow, driven by a diffusion process. Joint stimulation of neurons induces the growth of associative connections between them, leading to the formation of memory engrams. These memories are stored in a distributed fashion throughout connectivity matrix, and individual synaptic connections have only a small influence. Although memory-specific connections are increased in number, the total number of inputs and outputs of neurons undergo only small changes during stimulation. We find that homeostatic structural plasticity induces a specific type of “silent memories”, different from conventional attractor states.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Slow nucleosome dynamics set the transcriptional speed limit and induce RNA polymerase II traffic jams and bursts</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Robert C. Mines, Tomasz Lipniacki, Xiling Shen</p>

Nucleosomes are recognized as key regulators of transcription. However, the relationship between slow nucleosome unwrapping dynamics and bulk transcriptional properties has not been thoroughly explored. Here, an agent-based model that we call the dynamic defect Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (ddTASEP) was constructed to investigate the effects of nucleosome-induced pausing on transcriptional dynamics. Pausing due to slow nucleosome dynamics induced RNAPII convoy formation, which would cooperatively prevent nucleosome rebinding leading to bursts of transcription. The mean first passage time (MFPT) and the variance of first passage time (VFPT) were analytically expressed in terms of the nucleosome rate constants, allowing for the direct quantification of the effects of nucleosome-induced pausing on pioneering polymerase dynamics. The mean first passage elongation rate <i>γ</i>(<i>h</i><sub>c</sub>, <i>h</i><sub>o</sub>) is inversely proportional to the MFPT and can be considered to be a new axis of the ddTASEP phase diagram, orthogonal to the classical <i>αβ</i>-plane (where <i>α</i> and <i>β</i> are the initiation and termination rates). Subsequently, we showed that, for <i>β</i> = 1, there is a novel jamming transition in the <i>αγ</i>-plane that separates the ddTASEP dynamics into initiation-limited and nucleosome pausing-limited regions. We propose analytical estimates for the RNAPII density <i>ρ</i>, average elongation rate <i>v</i>, and transcription flux <i>J</i> and verified them numerically. We demonstrate that the intra-burst RNAPII waiting times <i>t</i><sub>in</sub> follow the time-headway distribution of a max flux TASEP and that the average inter-burst interval tIBI¯ correlates with the index of dispersion <i>D</i><sub>e</sub>. In the limit <i>γ</i>→0, the average burst size reaches a maximum set by the closing rate <i>h</i><sub>c</sub>. When <i>α</i>≪1, the burst sizes are geometrically distributed, allowing large bursts even while the average burst size NB¯ is small. Last, preliminary results on the relative effects of static and dynamic defects are presented to show that dynamic defects can induce equal or greater pausing than static bottle necks.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Predicted impact of the viral mutational landscape on the cytotoxic response against SARS-CoV-2</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Anna Foix, Daniel López, Francisco Díez-Fuertes, Michael J. McConnell, Antonio J. Martín-Galiano</p>

The massive assessment of immune evasion due to viral mutations that increase COVID-19 susceptibility can be computationally facilitated. The adaptive cytotoxic T response is critical during primary infection and the generation of long-term protection. Here, potential HLA class I epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome were predicted for 2,915 human alleles of 71 families using the netMHCIpan EL algorithm. Allele families showed extreme epitopic differences, underscoring genetic variability of protective capacity between humans. Up to 1,222 epitopes were associated with any of the twelve supertypes, that is, allele clusters covering 90% population. Next, from all mutations identified in ~118,000 viral NCBI isolates, those causing significant epitope score reduction were considered epitope escape mutations. These mutations mainly involved non-conservative substitutions at the second and C-terminal position of the ligand core, or total ligand removal by large recurrent deletions. Escape mutations affected 47% of supertype epitopes, which in 21% of cases concerned isolates from two or more sub-continental areas. Some of these changes were coupled, but never surpassed 15% of evaded epitopes for the same supertype in the same isolate, except for B27. In contrast to most supertypes, eight allele families mostly contained alleles with few SARS-CoV-2 ligands. Isolates harboring cytotoxic escape mutations for these families co-existed geographically within sub-Saharan and Asian populations enriched in these alleles according to the Allele Frequency Net Database. Collectively, our findings indicate that escape mutation events have already occurred for half of HLA class I supertype epitopes. However, it is presently unlikely that, overall, it poses a threat to the global population. In contrast, single and double mutations for susceptible alleles may be associated with viral selective pressure and alarming local outbreaks. The integration of genomic, geographical and immunoinformatic information eases the surveillance of variants potentially affecting the global population, as well as minority subpopulations.

                <p>by Camilo Fuentes-Beals, Alejandro Valdés-Jiménez, Gonzalo Riadi</p>

Is it possible to learn and create a first Hidden Markov Model (HMM) without programming skills or understanding the algorithms in detail? In this concise tutorial, we present the HMM through the 2 general questions it was initially developed to answer and describe its elements. The HMM elements include variables, hidden and observed parameters, the vector of initial probabilities, and the transition and emission probability matrices. Then, we suggest a set of ordered steps, for modeling the variables and illustrate them with a simple exercise of modeling and predicting transmembrane segments in a protein sequence. Finally, we show how to interpret the results of the algorithms for this particular problem. To guide the process of information input and explicit solution of the basic HMM algorithms that answer the HMM questions posed, we developed an educational webserver called HMMTeacher. Additional solved HMM modeling exercises can be found in the user’s manual and answers to frequently asked questions. HMMTeacher is available at https://hmmteacher.mobilomics.org, mirrored at https://hmmteacher1.mobilomics.org. A repository with the code of the tool and the webpage is available at https://gitlab.com/kmilo.f/hmmteacher.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Combination and competition between path integration and landmark navigation in the estimation of heading direction</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sevan K. Harootonian, Arne D. Ekstrom, Robert C. Wilson</p>

Successful navigation requires the ability to compute one’s location and heading from incoming multisensory information. Previous work has shown that this multisensory input comes in two forms: body-based idiothetic cues, from one’s own rotations and translations, and visual allothetic cues, from the environment (usually visual landmarks). However, exactly how these two streams of information are integrated is unclear, with some models suggesting the body-based idiothetic and visual allothetic cues are combined, while others suggest they compete. In this paper we investigated the integration of body-based idiothetic and visual allothetic cues in the computation of heading using virtual reality. In our experiment, participants performed a series of body turns of up to 360 degrees in the dark with only a brief flash (300ms) of visual feedback <i>en route</i>. Because the environment was virtual, we had full control over the visual feedback and were able to vary the offset between this feedback and the true heading angle. By measuring the effect of the feedback offset on the angle participants turned, we were able to determine the extent to which they incorporated visual feedback as a function of the offset error. By further modeling this behavior we were able to quantify the computations people used. While there were considerable individual differences in <i>performance</i> on our task, with some participants mostly ignoring the visual feedback and others relying on it almost entirely, our modeling results suggest that almost all participants used the same <i>strategy</i> in which idiothetic and allothetic cues are combined when the mismatch between them is small, but compete when the mismatch is large. These findings suggest that participants update their estimate of heading using a hybrid strategy that mixes the combination and competition of cues.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">RFX transcription factors control a miR-150/PDAP1 axis that restrains the proliferation of human T cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michele Chirichella, Niccolò Bianchi, Emina Džafo, Elena Foli, Francesco Gualdrini, Amy Kenyon, Gioacchino Natoli, Silvia Monticelli</p>

Within the immune system, microRNAs (miRNAs) exert key regulatory functions. However, what are the mRNA targets regulated by miRNAs and how miRNAs are transcriptionally regulated themselves remain for the most part unknown. We found that in primary human memory T helper lymphocytes, miR-150 was the most abundantly expressed miRNA, and its expression decreased drastically upon activation, suggesting regulatory roles. Constitutive <i>MIR150</i> gene expression required the RFX family of transcription factors, and its activation-induced down-regulation was linked to their reduced expression. By performing miRNA pull-down and sequencing experiments, we identified PDGFA-associated protein 1 (PDAP1) as one main target of miR-150 in human T lymphocytes. PDAP1 acted as an RNA-binding protein (RBP), and its CRISPR/Cas-9–mediated deletion revealed that it prominently contributed to the regulation of T-cell proliferation. Overall, using an integrated approach involving quantitative analysis, unbiased genomics, and genome editing, we identified RFX factors, miR-150, and the PDAP1 RBP as the components of a regulatory axis that restrains proliferation of primary human T lymphocytes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Dynamic assembly of the mRNA m6A methyltransferase complex is regulated by METTL3 phase separation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Dasol Han, Andrew P. Longhini, Xuemei Zhang, Vivian Hoang, Maxwell Z. Wilson, Kenneth S. Kosik</p>

m<sup>6</sup>A methylation is the most abundant and reversible chemical modification on mRNA with approximately one-fourth of eukaryotic mRNAs harboring at least one m<sup>6</sup>A-modified base. The recruitment of the mRNA m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase writer complex to phase-separated nuclear speckles is likely to be crucial in its regulation; however, control over the activity of the complex remains unclear. Supported by our observation that a core catalytic subunit of the methyltransferase complex, METTL3, is endogenously colocalized within nuclear speckles as well as in noncolocalized puncta, we tracked the components of the complex with a Cry2-METTL3 fusion construct to disentangle key domains and interactions necessary for the phase separation of METTL3. METTL3 is capable of self-interaction and likely provides the multivalency to drive condensation. Condensates in cells necessarily contain myriad components, each with partition coefficients that establish an entropic barrier that can regulate entry into the condensate. In this regard, we found that, in contrast to the constitutive binding of METTL14 to METTL3 in both the diffuse and the dense phase, WTAP only interacts with METTL3 in dense phase and thereby distinguishes METTL3/METTL14 single complexes in the dilute phase from METTL3/METTL14 multicomponent condensates. Finally, control over METTL3/METTL14 condensation is determined by its small molecule cofactor, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which regulates conformations of 2 gate loops, and some cancer-associated mutations near gate loops can impair METTL3 condensation. Therefore, the link between SAM binding and the control of writer complex phase state suggests that the regulation of its phase state is a potentially critical facet of its functional regulation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Four concurrent feedforward and feedback networks with different roles in the visual cortical hierarchy</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Elham Barzegaran, Gijs Plomp</p>

Visual stimuli evoke fast-evolving activity patterns that are distributed across multiple cortical areas. These areas are hierarchically structured, as indicated by their anatomical projections, but how large-scale feedforward and feedback streams are functionally organized in this system remains an important missing clue to understanding cortical processing. By analyzing visual evoked responses in laminar recordings from 6 cortical areas in awake mice, we uncovered a dominant feedforward network with scale-free interactions in the time domain. In addition, we established the simultaneous presence of a gamma band feedforward and 2 low frequency feedback networks, each with a distinct laminar functional connectivity profile, frequency spectrum, temporal dynamics, and functional hierarchy. We could identify distinct roles for each of these 4 processing streams, by leveraging stimulus contrast effects, analyzing receptive field (RF) convergency along functional interactions, and determining relationships to spiking activity. Our results support a dynamic dual counterstream view of hierarchical processing and provide new insight into how separate functional streams can simultaneously and dynamically support visual processes.

Kucharski, on behalf of the CMMID COVID-19 working group and the SpaceX COVID-19 Cohort Collaborative </p>

Identifying the potential for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reinfection is crucial for understanding possible long-term epidemic dynamics. We analysed longitudinal PCR and serological testing data from a prospective cohort of 4,411 United States employees in 4 states between April 2020 and February 2021. We conducted a multivariable logistic regression investigating the association between baseline serological status and subsequent PCR test result in order to calculate an odds ratio for reinfection. We estimated an odds ratio for reinfection ranging from 0.14 (95% CI: 0.019 to 0.63) to 0.28 (95% CI: 0.05 to 1.1), implying that the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at baseline is associated with around 72% to 86% reduced odds of a subsequent PCR positive test based on our point estimates. This suggests that primary infection with SARS-CoV-2 provides protection against reinfection in the majority of individuals, at least over a 6-month time period. We also highlight 2 major sources of bias and uncertainty to be considered when estimating the relative risk of reinfection, confounders, and the choice of baseline time point and show how to account for both in reinfection analysis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Perceived stress, sources of stress and coping strategies among undergraduate medical students of Nepal: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Medical students are subjected to various stressors throughout their training, which has a considerable impact on their physical and mental health. Some students have positive ways of coping, while others take to maladaptive coping measures. This study aims to assess severity, sources of stress, and coping strategies among medical students of a non-Western low-income country from South Asia. Methods: A self-administered questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was carried out. Demographic variables were collected and stress level was assessed using PSS 14 (Perceived Stress Scale 14). The sources of stress were assessed using MSSQ (Medical Student Stressor Questionnaire) and coping strategies were evaluated using the Brief-Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced 28. Results: The response rate was 95%. The mean PSS score was 27.85. Overall, 55% of students were stressed (male 52%, female 60%), the difference among gender was not significant. Basic science students perceived higher levels of stress than clinical clerkship students. Academic related stressors caused higher stress, whereas other variables caused moderate stress. The major stressors were examinations, inadequate time to study, poor marks, extensive amount of learning content, and the need to performing well in the exam. The five most common coping strategies used were active coping, acceptance, planning, self-distraction, and instrumental support. The least common coping mechanism was substance use. All MSSQ domains positively correlated with the total PSS score. Students with higher PSS scores were likely to use behavioral disengagement, venting, and self-blame as the primary coping strategies. Conclusions: Stress level among the medical students is high and mainly in relation to academia. Inadequate guidance from teachers contributed significantly. Stressed students were likely to use maladaptive coping strategies. Strategies to enhance teacher-student communication and adaptive coping measures should be implemented. Further studies should be done to evaluate the effects of stress on the academic outcomes of students.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A novel genotyping method to determine copy number in a mouse line commonly used for inducible transgene expression in brain and spinal cord [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The NEFH-tTA mouse has the human neurofilament heavy polypeptide promoter directing tetracycline-controlled transactivator protein (tTa) expression to the brain and spinal cord, allowing tissue-specific and doxycycline-suppressible expression of a target gene. Current genotyping protocols can only differentiate between wild-type and transgenic animals. Being able to differentiate between hemizygous and homozygous animals would be beneficial in experiment planning and reducing animal numbers. Methods: We have identified the insertion site of the NEFH-tTA transgene via targeted locus amplification and next-generation sequencing. This was then used to design a multiplex PCR assay to distinguish between hemizygous and homozygous mice. Results: The NEFH-tTA transgene is located on chromosome 12. Our genotyping method can identify hemizygous and homozygous mice. Conclusions: The NEFH-tTA transgenic mouse line is a useful tool for studying a wide range of diseases including frontotemporal dementia and motor neuron disease, as well as other neurodevelopmental, neuromuscular or neurodegenerative disorders. We have designed and utilised a novel genotyping assay to distinguish between hemizygous and homozygous mice, involving a simple PCR assay. This is easily adaptable to a laboratory-specific protocol or machine, and will allow refinement of breeding strategies and a reduction in the number of animals that cannot be used in experiments.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effectiveness of Clinical Presentation (CP) Curriculum in teaching clinical medicine to undergraduate medical students: A cross-sectional study. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: The Clinical Presentation (CP) curriculum was first formulated in 1990 at the University of Calgary, Canada. Since then, it has been adopted at various medical schools, including Patan Academy of Health Sciences (PAHS), a state-funded medical school in a low-income country (LIC), Nepal. This study aims to evaluate the perceived effectiveness of the CP curriculum by students and faculty at PAHS, and test knowledge retention through a surprise non-routine exam administered to students.  Method: This is a cross-sectional study to evaluate the efficacy of the CP curriculum in teaching clinical medicine to the first batch of MBBS students of PAHS School of Medicine. Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Committee (IRC)-PAHS (Ref no std1505911069). Perceived effectiveness was evaluated using a set of questionnaires for faculty and students. A total of 33 students and 34 faculty filled the perception questionnaires. Subsequently, a questionnaire consisting of 50 Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) from different clinical medicine disciplines was administered to test students’ knowledge retention. Out of 49 students, 38 participated in the surprise non-routine exam.   Result: A significantly higher number of faculty preferred the CP curriculum compared to the traditional system of teaching clinical medicine (16 vs 11, Kruskal Wallis: 0.023, ie. P-value < 0.05). A significantly higher number of the students liked and recommended CP curriculum in the clinical year of medical education (20 vs. 13 with p-value < 0.05). In the non-routine surprise exam, two thirds of the students scored 60% or above.  Conclusion: Both faculty and students perceive that the CP curriculum system is an effective teaching and learning method in medical education, irrespective of their different demographic and positional characteristics. The students’ overall performance was good in surprise, non-routine exams taken without scheduling or reminders.

                Cholesterol is an essential component of all cell membranes and particularly enriched in myelin membranes. Myelin membranes are a major target of immune attacks in the chronic neurological disorder multiple sclerosis (MS). During demyelinating insults, cholesterol is released from damaged myelin, increasing local levels of this unique lipid and impeding tissue regeneration. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of cholesterol-dependent processes during demyelination and remyelination, emphasizing cell type-specific responses.

                Hereditary gingival fibromatosis (HGF) is the most common genetic form of gingival fibromatosis which is featured as a localized or generalized overgrowth of gingivae. Currently two genes (<i>SOS1</i> and <i>REST</i>), as well as four loci (2p22.1, 2p23.3-p22.3, 5q13-q22, and 11p15), have been identified as associated with HGF in a dominant inheritance pattern. Here we report thirteen individuals with autosomal-dominant HGF from a four-generation Chinese family. Whole-exome sequencing followed by further genetic co-segregation analysis was performed for the family members across three generations. A novel heterozygous missense mutation (c.2812G&gt;A) in zinc finger protein 862 gene (<i>ZNF862</i>) was identified, and it is absent among the population as per the Genome Aggregation Database. The functional study supports a biological role of <i>ZNF862</i> for increasing the profibrotic factors particularly COL1A1 synthesis and hence resulting in HGF. Here for the first time we identify the physiological role of <i>ZNF862</i> for the association with the HGF.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A unifying mechanism governing inter-brain neural relationship during social interactions</a></h4>

              
                A key goal of social neuroscience is to understand the inter-brain neural relationship - the relationship between the neural activity of socially interacting individuals. Decades of research investigating this relationship have focused on the similarity in neural activity across brains. Here we instead asked how neural activity differs between brains, and how that difference evolves alongside activity patterns shared between brains. Applying this framework to bats engaged in spontaneous social interactions revealed two complementary phenomena characterizing the inter-brain neural relationship: fast fluctuations of activity difference across brains unfolding in parallel with slow activity covariation across brains. A model reproduced these observations and generated multiple predictions that we confirmed using experimental data involving pairs of bats and a larger social group of bats. The model suggests that a simple computational mechanism involving positive and negative feedback could explain diverse experimental observations regarding the inter-brain neural relationship.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A vibrissa pathway that activates the limbic system</a></h4>

              
                Vibrissa sensory inputs play a central role in driving rodent behavior. These inputs transit through the sensory trigeminal nuclei, which give rise to the ascending lemniscal and paralemniscal pathways. While lemniscal projections are somatotopically mapped from brainstem to cortex, those of the paralemniscal pathway are more widely distributed. Yet the extent and topography of paralemniscal projections are unknown, along with the potential role of these projections in controlling behavior. Here, we used viral tracers to map paralemniscal projections. We find that this pathway broadcasts vibrissa-based sensory signals to brainstem regions that are involved in the regulation of autonomic functions and to forebrain regions that are involved in the expression of emotional reactions. We further provide evidence that GABAergic cells of the Kölliker-Fuse nucleus gate trigeminal sensory input in the paralemniscal pathway via a mechanism of presynaptic or extrasynaptic inhibition.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cdc6 is sequentially regulated by PP2A-Cdc55, Cdc14, and Sic1 for origin licensing in S. cerevisiae</a></h4>

              
                Cdc6, a subunit of the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC), contains multiple regulatory cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk1) consensus sites, SP or TP motifs. In <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, Cdk1 phosphorylates Cdc6-T7 to recruit Cks1, the Cdk1 phospho-adaptor in S phase, for subsequent multisite phosphorylation and protein degradation. Cdc6 accumulates in mitosis and is tightly bound by Clb2 through N-terminal phosphorylation in order to prevent premature origin licensing and degradation. It has been extensively studied how Cdc6 phosphorylation is regulated by the cyclin–Cdk1 complex. However, a detailed mechanism on how Cdc6 phosphorylation is reversed by phosphatases has not been elucidated. Here, we show that PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> dephosphorylates Cdc6 N-terminal sites to release Clb2. Cdc14 dephosphorylates the C-terminal phospho-degron, leading to Cdc6 stabilization in mitosis. In addition, Cdk1 inhibitor Sic1 releases Clb2·Cdk1·Cks1 from Cdc6 to load Mcm2–7 on the chromatin upon mitotic exit. Thus, pre-RC assembly and origin licensing are promoted by phosphatases through the attenuation of distinct Cdk1-dependent Cdc6 inhibitory mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A neural network model of when to retrieve and encode episodic memories</a></h4>

              
                Recent human behavioral and neuroimaging results suggest that people are selective in when they encode and retrieve episodic memories. To explain these findings, we trained a memory-augmented neural network to use its episodic memory to support prediction of upcoming states in an environment where past situations sometimes reoccur. We found that the network learned to retrieve selectively as a function of several factors, including its uncertainty about the upcoming state. Additionally, we found that selectively encoding episodic memories at the end of an event (but not mid-event) led to better subsequent prediction performance. In all of these cases, the benefits of selective retrieval and encoding can be explained in terms of reducing the risk of retrieving irrelevant memories. Overall, these modeling results provide a resource-rational account of why episodic retrieval and encoding should be selective and lead to several testable predictions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Human embryoid bodies as a novel system for genomic studies of functionally diverse cell types</a></h4>

              
                Practically all studies of gene expression in humans to date have been performed in a relatively small number of adult tissues. Gene regulation is highly dynamic and context-dependent. In order to better understand the connection between gene regulation and complex phenotypes, including disease, we need to be able to study gene expression in more cell types, tissues, and states that are relevant to human phenotypes. In particular, we need to characterize gene expression in early development cell types, as mutations that affect developmental processes may be of particular relevance to complex traits. To address this challenge, we propose to use embryoid bodies (EBs), which are organoids that contain a multitude of cell types in dynamic states. EBs provide a system in which one can study dynamic regulatory processes at an unprecedentedly high resolution. To explore the utility of EBs, we systematically explored cellular and gene expression heterogeneity in EBs from multiple individuals. We characterized the various cell types that arise from EBs, the extent to which they recapitulate gene expression in vivo, and the relative contribution of technical and biological factors to variability in gene expression, cell composition, and differentiation efficiency. Our results highlight the utility of EBs as a new model system for mapping dynamic inter-individual regulatory differences in a large variety of cell types.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Mindbomb1 controls planar cell polarity-dependent convergent extension movements during zebrafish gastrulation</a></h4>

              
                Vertebrate Delta/Notch signaling involves multiple ligands, receptors and transcription factors. Delta endocytosis - a critical event for Notch activation - is however essentially controlled by the E3 Ubiquitin ligase Mindbomb1 (Mib1). Mib1 inactivation is therefore often used to inhibit Notch signaling. However, recent findings indicate that Mib1 function extends beyond the Notch pathway. We report a novel Notch-independent role of Mib1 in zebrafish gastrulation. <i>mib1</i> null mutants and morphants display impaired Convergence Extension (CE) movements. Comparison of different <i>mib1</i> mutants and functional rescue experiments indicate that Mib1 controls CE independently of Notch. Mib1-dependent CE defects can be rescued using the Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) downstream mediator RhoA, or enhanced through knock-down of the PCP ligand Wnt5b. Mib1 regulates CE through its RING Finger domains that have been implicated in substrate ubiquitination, suggesting that Mib1 may control PCP protein trafficking. Accordingly, we show that Mib1 controls the endocytosis of the PCP component Ryk and that Ryk internalization is required for CE. Numerous morphogenetic processes involve both Notch and PCP signaling. Our observation that during zebrafish gastrulation Mib1 exerts a Notch-independent control of PCP-dependent CE movements suggest that Mib1 loss of function phenotypes should be cautiously interpreted depending on the biological context.

                Sensory information is critical for motor coordination. However, understanding sensorimotor integration is complicated, especially in individuals with nervous system impairment. This research presents a novel functional biomarker, based on a nonlinear network graph of muscle connectivity, called InfoMuNet, to quantify the role of sensory information in motor performance. Thirty-two individuals with post-stroke hemiparesis performed a grasp-and-lift task while muscle activities were measured using eight surface electromyography (sEMG) sensors. Subjects performed the task with their affected hand before and after exposure to the sensory stimulation elicited by performing the task with the less-affected hand. For the first time, this work shows that InfoMuNet robustly quantifies functional muscle connectivity improvements in the affected hand after exposure of the less-affected side to sensory information. >90% of the subjects conformed with the improvement resulting from this sensory exposure. InfoMuNet also shows high sensitivity to tactile, kinesthetic, and visual input alterations at the subject level, highlighting the potential use in precision rehabilitation interventions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Digital twin reveals combinatorial code of non-linear computations in the mouse primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                More than a dozen excitatory cell types have been identified in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1) based on transcriptomic, morphological and in vitro electrophysiological features. However, the functional landscape of excitatory neurons with respect to their responses to visual stimuli is currently unknown. Here, we combined large-scale two-photon imaging and deep learning neural predictive models to study the functional organization of mouse V1 using digital twins. Digital twins enable exhaustive in silico functional characterization providing a bar code summarizing the input-output function of each neuron. Clustering the bar codes revealed a continuum of function with around 30 modes. Each mode represented a group of neurons that exhibited a specific combination of stimulus selectivity and nonlinear response properties such as cross-orientation inhibition, size-contrast tuning and surround suppression. These non-linear properties were expressed independently spanning all possible combinations across the population. This combinatorial code provides the first large-scale, data-driven characterization of the functional organization of V1. This powerful approach based on digital twins is applicable to other brain areas and to complex non-linear systems beyond the brain.

                We have developed new imaging and computational workflows to produce accurately aligned multimodal 3D images of the mouse brain that exploit high resolution magnetic resonance histology (MRH) and light sheet microscopy (LSM) with fully rendered 3D reference delineations of brain structures. The suite of methods starts with the acquisition of geometrically accurate (in-skull) brain MRIs using multi-gradient echo (MGRE) and new diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) at an isotropic spatial resolution of 15 m. Whole brain connectomes are generated using over 100 diffusion weighted images acquired with gradients at uniformly spaced angles. Track density images are generated at a super-resolution of 5 m. Brains are dissected from the cranium, cleared with SHIELD, stained by immunohistochemistry, and imaged by LSM at 1.8 m/pixel. LSM channels are registered into the reference MRH space along with the Allen Brain Atlas (ABA) Common Coordinate Framework version 3 (CCFv3). The result is a high-dimensional integrated volume with registration (HiDiver) that has a global alignment accuracy of 10-50 m. HiDiver enables 3D quantitative and global analyses of cells, circuits, connectomes, and CNS regions of interest (ROIs). Throughput is sufficiently high that HiDiver is now being used in comprehensive quantitative studies of the impact of gene variants and aging on rodent brain cytoarchitecture.

                Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are a highly proliferative class of non-neuronal progenitors that largely give rise to myelinating oligodendrocytes. Although OPCs persist across the lifespan, their functions beyond oligodendrogenesis remain to be fully characterized. Here, we show that OPCs contribute to neural circuit remodeling by internalizing presynaptic thalamocortical inputs in both the developing and adult mouse visual cortex. Inputs internalized by OPCs localize to lysosomal compartments, consistent with OPC engulfment of synapses occurring through phagocytosis. We further show that engulfment by OPCs is heightened during experience-dependent plasticity, and that this experience-dependent increase in engulfment requires microglia. These data identify a new function for OPCs beyond the generation of oligodendrocytes and reveal that distinct non-neuronal populations collaborate to modulate synaptic connectivity.

                It has become increasingly evident that immune cells play a role in modulating brain function. Neutrophils are the most abundant innate immune cell in mammals. Until recently, our understanding of the physiological role of these cells was limited to infection and cancer. Recently, it has emerged that neutrophils play critical roles in modulating tissue health and physiology. There has been evidence that neutrophils populate the rodent meninges. As such, we hypothesized that like other meningeal immune cells, neutrophils play a neuromodulatory role. Using a depletion paradigm, anti-Ly6G antibody injection, we demonstrate that the loss of neutrophils leads to changes in cognitive flexibility and social interactions in mice. Furthermore, the depletion paradigm led to a 50% decrease in the number of neutrophils in the meninges, which in turn led to the proliferation of resident immature neutrophils within the meninges. Finally, our data show that this immature population reenters the cell cycle only in response to specific physiological stimuli (neutrophil depletion, and stress). In conclusion, this study demonstrates that there are resident neutrophils within the meninges and that elucidating their function in the nervous system will deepen our understanding of immune regulation of brain function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Exploring the frame effect</a></h4>

              
                Probes flashed within a moving frame are dramatically displaced (Ozkan et al, 2021; Wong & Mack, 1981). The effect is much larger than that seen on static or moving probes (induced motion, Duncker, 1929; Wallach et al, 1978). These flashed probes are often perceived with the separation they have in frame coordinates -- a 100% effect. Here we explore this frame effect on flashed tests with several versions of the standard stimulus. We find that the frame effect holds for smoothly or abruptly displacing frames, even when the frame changed shape or orientation between the endpoints of its travel. The path could be non-linear, even circular. The effect was driven by perceived not physical motion. When there were competing overlapping frames, the effect was determined by which frame was attended. There were a number of constraints that limited the effect. A static anchor near the flashes suppressed the effect but an extended static texture did not. If the probes were continuous rather than flashed, the effect was abolished. The results suggest that the frame effect is robust to many variations in its shape and path and leads to a perception of flashed tests in their locations relative to the frame as if the frame were stationary.

                The study of brain change in neuroscience studies is commonly conducted using macroscopic morphological measures of the brain such as regional volume or cortical thickness, providing little insight into the microscopic mechanisms underlying brain disease. In contrast, quantitative MRI allows the monitoring of microscopic brain change non-invasively in-vivo, and provides normative values for comparisons between tissues, regions, and individuals. To support the development and common use of qMRI for cognitive neuroscience, we analysed a set of qMRI metrics (R1, R2*, Magnetization Transfer saturation, Proton Density saturation, Fractional Anisotropy, Mean Diffusivity) in 101 healthy young adults. Here we provide a comprehensive descriptive analysis of these metrics and their linear relationships to each other in grey and white matter to develop a more complete understanding of the relationship to tissue microstructure. Furthermore, we provide evidence that combinations of metrics may uncover informative microstructural cortical gradients across the brain by showing that dimensionality reduction through PCA provides cortical gradients that were hidden in individual metrics. We discuss these results and their links to microstructural and physiological neuroscience research.

                Perception and cognition are modulated by the phase of the cardiac signal in which the stimuli are presented. This has been shown by locking the presentation of stimuli to distinct cardiac phases. However, in everyday life sensory information is not presented in this phase-locked and passive manner, instead we actively sample the world. Whether active sensing is coupled and modulated with the cardiac cycle remains largely unknown. Here we recorded the ECGs of human participants while they actively performed a tactile grating orientation task. Here we show that the duration of subjects' touch varied as a function of the cardiac phase in which they initiated it. Touches initiated in the systolic phase of the cardiac cycle were held for longer periods of time than touches initiated in the diastolic phase. This effect was driven by the elongation of their holds to sample the most difficult gratings. Conversely, while touches in the control condition were coupled to the cardiac cycle, their length was not modulated as a function of when in the cycle these were initiated. In line with interoceptive inference accounts, these results are consistent with the hypotheses that we actively adjust our sensory sampling so that we spend more time in the diastole period of the cardiac cycle in which perceptual sensory sensitivity is greatest.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Subcortical and cortical tracking of communication sound envelopes in challenging listening conditions</a></h4>

              
                Humans and animals constantly face challenging acoustic environments such as various background noises restricting the detection, discrimination and identification of behaviorally salient sounds. Here, we disentangled the role of temporal envelope tracking on the decrease in neuronal and behavioral discrimination between communication sounds in situations of acoustic degradations. We simulated responses of auditory nerve fibers and recorded neuronal activity in cochlear nucleus, inferior colliculus, thalamus and auditory cortex in anesthetized guinea-pigs. Furthermore, a Go/No-Go sound discrimination task involving two of the guinea-pig whistles was performed on mice in silence and noise. For all conditions, we found that auditory neurons better track the slow amplitude modulations (<20 Hz) of the stimulus envelopes than the faster ones. In addition, the decrease in neuronal and behavioral discrimination performance in noise can be explained by an increased similarity of the vocalization envelopes in the low frequency range (<20 Hz). Together, these results suggest that slow envelope tracking is a general property of auditory neurons, and any difference between the slow envelopes of natural stimuli allows coping with degraded conditions.

                Charting human brain maturation between childhood and adulthood is a fundamental prerequisite for understanding the rapid psychological changes during adolescence. Two barriers have precluded the quantification of maturational trajectories: demands on data and demands on estimation. Using high-temporal resolution neuroimaging data of up to 12-waves in the HUBU cohort (N = 90, aged 7-21 years) we investigate changes in apparent cortical thickness across childhood and adolescence. Fitting a four-parameter logistic nonlinear random effects mixed model, we quantified the characteristic, s-shaped, trajectory of cortical thinning in adolescence. This approach yields biologically meaningful parameters, including the midpoint of cortical thinning (MCT), which corresponds to the age at which the cortex shows most rapid thinning - in our sample occurring, on average, at 15 years of age. These results show that, given suitable data and models, cortical maturation can be quantified with precision for each individual and brain region.

                The eyes of nymphalid butterflies, investigated with incident illumination, show colourful facet reflection patterns, the eye shine, which is uniform or heterogeneous, dependent on the species. Facet colours suggest that the ommatidia contain different sets of photoreceptors and screening pigments, but how the colours and the cell characteristics are associated has not been clearly established. Here we analyse the retinae of two nymphalids, Apatura ilia, which has a uniform eyeshine, and Charaxes jasius, a species with a heterogeneous eye shine, using single-cell recordings, spectroscopy and optical pupillometry. Apatura has UV, blue and green-sensitive photoreceptors, allocated into three ommatidial types. The UV and blue-sensitive cells are long visual fibres (LVFs), receiving opponent input from the green-sensitive short visual fibres (SVFs). Charaxes has an expanded set of photoreceptors, allocated into three additional, red-reflecting ommatidial types. All red ommatidia contain green-sensitive LVFs, receiving opponent input from red receptors. In both species, the SVFs do not receive any opponent input. The simple retina of Apatura with three ommatidial types and two colour-opponent channels can support trichromatic vision. Charaxes has six ommatidial types and three colour-opponent channels. Its expanded receptor set can support tetrachromatic vision.

                Supplementation with the catecholamine precursor L-Tyrosine might enhance cognitive performance, but overall findings are mixed. Here, we investigate the effect of a single dose of tyrosine (2g) vs. placebo on two key aspects of catecholamine-dependent decision-making: model-based reinforcement learning (2-step task) and temporal discounting, using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject design (n=28 healthy male participants). We leveraged drift diffusion models in a hierarchical Bayesian framework to jointly model participants' choices and response times in both tasks. Furthermore, comprehensive autonomic monitoring (heart rate, heart rate variability, pupillometry, spontaneous eye-blink rate) was performed both pre- and post-supplementation, to explore potential physiological effects of supplementation. Across tasks, tyrosine consistently reduced participants' RTs without deteriorating task-performance. Diffusion modeling linked this effect to attenuated decision-thresholds in both tasks and further revealed increased model-based control (2-step task) and (if anything) attenuated temporal discounting. On the physiological level, participants pupil dilation was predictive of the individual degree of temporal discounting. Tyrosine supplementation reduced physiological arousal as revealed by increases in pupil dilation variability and reductions in hear rate. Supplementation-related changes in physiological arousal predicted individual changes in temporal discounting. Our findings provide first evidence that tyrosine supplementation might impact psychophysiological parameters, and suggest that modeling approaches based on sequential sampling models can yield novel insights into latent cognitive processes modulated by amino-acid supplementation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An automated pipeline for extracting quantitative histological metrics for voxelwise MRI-histology comparisons</a></h4>

              
                The acquisition of MRI and histology in the same post-mortem tissue sample enables direct correlation between MRI and histologically-derived parameters. However, there still lacks a standardised automated pipeline to process histology data, with most studies relying on heavy manual intervention. Here, we introduce an automated pipeline to extract quantitative histology metrics (stained area fraction) from multiple immunohistochemical (IHC) stains. The pipeline is designed to directly address key IHC artefacts related to tissue staining and slide digitisation. This pipeline was applied to post-mortem human brain data from multiple subjects, relating MRI parameters (FA, MD, R2*, R1) to IHC slides stained for myelin, neurofilaments, microglia, and activated microglia. Utilising high-quality MRI-IHC coregistration, we then performed whole-slide voxelwise comparisons (simple correlation, partial correlation, and multiple regression analyses) between multimodal MRI- and IHC-derived parameters. The pipeline was found to be reproducible, robust to some artefacts, and generalisable across multiple IHC stains. Our partial correlation results suggest that some simple MRI-IHC correlations should be interpreted with caution, due to the colocalisation of certain tissue features (e.g. myelin and neurofilaments). Further, we find activated microglia to consistently be the strongest predictor of DTI FA, which may suggest the sensitivity of diffusion MRI to neuroinflammation. Taken together, these results show the utility of this approach in carefully curating IHC data and performing multimodal analyses to better understand microstructural relationships with MRI.

                The neurological disease Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by neuroinflammation and demyelination orchestrated by the activated glial cells, the CNS infiltrating leukocytes, and their reciprocal interaction through inflammatory signals. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), an enzyme that catalyzes sustained nitric oxide production in response to an inflammatory stimulus, is a pro-inflammatory marker expressed particularly by the microglia/macrophages (MG/M{phi}) during neuroinflammation. In MS, iNOS has been reportedly associated with the disease pathology; however, studies dissecting its role in the underlying mechanisms, specifically demyelination, are limited. Therefore, we studied the role of iNOS in a recombinant beta-coronavirus- MHV-RSA59- induced neuroinflammation, which is a prototypic animal model used to investigate the pathological hallmarks of MS, neuroinflammatory demyelination, and axonal degeneration. During the acute phase of infection with RSA59, wildtype C57BL/6 (WT) mice had significantly upregulated iNOS expression in macrophages, natural killer cells, and natural killer T cells suggesting a role for iNOS in RSA59-induced neuroinflammation. Studies comparing RSA59-infected WT and iNOS-deficient mice revealed that iNOS deficiency aggravated the disease with increased CNS infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils and enhanced mortality. As early as 9-10 days after the infection, the CNS of iNOS-deficient mice had substantially higher demyelination marked with morphologically defined MG/M{phi} in the demyelinating regions. Transcript analysis confirmed the significant upregulation of type2 macrophage (M2) markers- Arginase 1, CD206, and TREM2- in the CNS of iNOS-deficient mice. Corroborating to the phenotype, the iNOS-deficient mice showed a significantly higher expression of TGF{beta}- an anti-inflammatory cytokine- and increased T regulatory (Treg) cell infiltration, indicating an anti-inflammatory milieu established early after the infection. These observations highlight a protective role of iNOS in virus-induced neuroinflammation whereas its absence leads to MG/M{phi} polarization towards a phenotype that may be involved in the exacerbated demyelination pathology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inhibitory NPY neurons provide a large and heterotopic commissural projection in the inferior colliculus</a></h4>

              
                Located in the midbrain, the inferior colliculus (IC) plays an essential role in many auditory computations, including speech processing and sound localization. The right and left side of the IC are interconnected by a dense fiber tract, the commissure of the IC (CoIC), that provides each IC with one its largest sources of input (i.e., the contralateral IC). Despite its prominence, the CoIC remains poorly understood. Previous studies using anterograde and retrograde tract-tracing showed that IC commissural projections are predominately homotopic and tonotopic, targeting mirror-image locations in the same frequency region in the contralateral IC. However, it is unknown whether specific classes of neurons, particularly inhibitory neurons which constitute ~10-40% of the commissural projection, follow this pattern. We therefore examined the commissural projections of Neuropeptide Y (NPY) neurons, the first molecularly identifiable class of GABAergic neurons in the IC. Using retrograde tracing with Retrobeads in NPY-hrGFP mice of both sexes, we found that NPY neurons comprise ~11% of the commissural projection. Moreover, focal injections of Retrobeads showed that NPY neurons in the central nucleus of the IC exhibit a more divergent and heterotopic commissural projection pattern than non-NPY neurons. Thus, commissural NPY neurons are positioned to provide cross-frequency, lateral inhibition to the contralateral IC. Through this circuit, sounds that drive activity in limited frequency bands on one side of the IC might suppress activity across a larger number of frequency bands in the contralateral IC.

                To better understand the computational steps that the brain performs during reading, we used a convolutional neural network as a computational model of visual word recognition, the first stage of reading. In contrast to traditional models of reading, our model directly operates on the pixel values of an image containing text, and has a large vocabulary of 10k Finnish words. The same stimuli can thus be presented unmodified to both the model and human volunteers in a magnetoencephalography (MEG) scanner. In a direct comparison between model and brain activity, we show that the model accurately predicts the amplitude of three evoked MEG response components commonly observed during reading. We conclude that the deep learning techniques that revolutionized models of object recognition can also create models of reading that can be straightforwardly compared to neuroimaging data, which will greatly facilitate testing and refining theories on language processing in the brain.

                Online research platforms have enabled mass data collection enabling representative samples for cognitive behavioural studies. However, the benefits of online data collection have not been available for cognitive neuroscience fields such as electroencephalography (EEG). In this study, we introduce an approach for remote EEG data collection. We demonstrate how an experiment can be built via the EmotivPRO Builder and deployed to the EmotivLABS website where it can be completed by participants who own EMOTIV EEG headsets. To demonstrate the data collection technique, we collected EEG while participants engaged in a resting state task where participants sat with their eyes open and then eyes closed for two minutes each. We observed a significant difference in alpha power between the two conditions thereby demonstrating the well-known alpha suppression effect. Thus, we demonstrate that EEG data collection, particularly for frequency domain analysis, can be successfully conducted online with remote users.

                Higher general cognitive ability (GCA) is associated with lower risk of neurodegenerative disorders, but neural mechanisms are unknown. GCA could be associated with more cortical tissue, from young age, i.e. brain reserve, or less cortical atrophy in adulthood, i.e. brain maintenance. Controlling for education, we investigated the relative association of GCA with reserve and maintenance of cortical volume, -area and -thickness through the adult lifespan, using multiple longitudinal brain imaging cohorts (n = 3327, 7002 MRI scans, baseline age 20-88 years, followed-up up to 11 years). There were widespread positive relationships between GCA and cortical characteristics (level-level associations). In select regions, higher baseline GCA was associated with less atrophy over time (level-change associations). Relationships remained when controlling for polygenic scores for both GCA and education. Our findings suggest that higher GCA is associated with cortical volumes by both brain reserve and -maintenance mechanisms through the adult lifespan.

Here, we introduce a novel measure termed the direct modulation index (dMI). Based on the classical modulation index, dMI provides an estimate of PAC that is bound to an absolute interval between 0 and +1, resistant against noise, and reliable even for small amounts of data. To highlight the properties of this newly-proposed measure, we evaluated dMI by comparing it to the classical modulation index, mean vector length, and phase-locking value using simulated data. We ascertained that dMI provides a more accurate estimate of PAC than the existing methods and that is resilient to varying noise levels and signal lengths. As such, dMI permits a reliable investigation of PAC, which may reveal insights crucial to our understanding of functional brain architecture in key contexts such as behaviour and cognition. A Python toolbox that implements dMI and other measures of PAC is freely available at https://github.com/neurophysiological-analysis/FiNN.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Task-dependent and automatic tracking of hierarchical linguistic structure</a></h4>

              
                Linguistic phrases are tracked in sentences even though there is no clear acoustic phrasal marker in the physical signal. This phenomenon suggests an automatic tracking of abstract linguistic structure that is endogenously generated by the brain. However, all studies investigating linguistic tracking compare conditions where either relevant information at linguistic timescales is available, or where this information is absent altogether (e.g. sentences versus word lists during passive listening). It is therefore unclear whether tracking at these phrasal timescales is related to the content of language, or rather, is a consequence of attending to the timescales that happen to match behaviourally-relevant information. To investigate this question, we presented participants with sentences and word lists while recording their brain activity with MEG. Participants performed passive, syllable, word, and word-combination tasks corresponding to attending to rates they would naturally attend to, syllable-rates, word-rates, and phrasal-rates, respectively. We replicated overall findings of stronger phrasal-rate tracking measured with mutual information (MI) for sentences compared to word lists across the classical language network. However, in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) we found a task-effect suggesting stronger phrasal-rate tracking during the word-combination task independent of the presence of linguistic structure, as well as stronger delta-band connectivity during this task. These results suggest that extracting linguistic information at phrasal-rates occurs automatically with or without the presence of an additional task, but also that that IFG might be important for temporal integration across various perceptual domains.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Single-cell multi-region dissection of brain vasculature in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Cerebrovascular breakdown occurs early in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), but its cell-type-specific molecular basis remains uncharacterized. Here, we characterize single-cell transcriptomic differences in human cerebrovasculature across 220 AD and 208 control individuals and across 6 brain regions. We annotate 22,514 cerebrovascular cells in 11 subtypes of endothelial, pericyte, smooth muscle, perivascular fibroblast, and ependymal cells, and how they differ between brain regions. We identify 2,676 AD-differential genes, including lower expression of PDGFRB in pericytes, and ABCB1 and ATP10A in endothelial cells. These AD-differential genes reveal common upstream regulators, including MECOM, EP300, and KLF4, whose targeting may help restore vasculature function. We find coordinated vasculature-glial-neuronal co-expressed gene modules supported by ligand-receptor pairs, involved in axon growth/degeneration and neurogenesis, suggesting mechanistic mediators of neurovascular unit dysregulation in AD. Integration with AD genetics reveals 125 AD-differential genes directly linked to AD-associated genetic variants (through vasculature-specific eQTLs, Hi-C, and correlation-based evidence), 559 targeted by AD-associated regulators, and 661 targeted by AD-associated ligand-receptor signaling. Lastly, we show that APOE4-genotype associated differences are significantly enriched among AD-associated genes in capillary and venule endothelial cells, and subsets of pericytes and fibroblasts, which underlie the vascular dysregulation in APOE4-associated cognitive decline. Overall, our multi-region molecular atlas of differential human cerebrovasculature genes and pathways in AD can help guide early-stage AD therapeutics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Express detection and discrimination of visual objects by primate superior colliculus neurons</a></h4>

              
                Primate superior colliculus (SC) neurons exhibit rich visual feature tuning properties and are implicated in a subcortical network hypothesized to mediate fast threat and/or conspecific detection. However, the mechanisms through which generalized object detection may be mediated by SC neurons remain unclear. Here we explored whether, and how quickly, SC neurons detect and discriminate real-life object stimuli. We presented experimentally-controlled gray-scale images of seven different object categories within the response fields (RFs) of SC neurons, and we also presented a variety of luminance- and spectral-matched image controls. We found that all of our functionally-identified SC neuron types preferentially detected real-life objects even in their very first stimulus-evoked visual bursts (starting within approximately 50 ms from image onset). Intriguingly, even visually-responsive motor-related neurons exhibited such robust early object detection, and they also preferentially discriminated between object categories in their initial visual bursts. We further identified spatial frequency information in visual images as a critical source for early object detection and discrimination by SC neurons. Our results demonstrate rapid and robust SC processing of visual objects, and they underline how the visual processing capabilities of the primate SC support perception and action.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Not all noise-reduction methods for fMRI preprocessing are created equal</a></h4>

              
                Preprocessing fMRI data requires striking a fine balance between conserving signals of interest and removing noise. Typical steps of preprocessing include motion correction, slice timing correction, spatial smoothing, and high-pass filtering. However, these standard steps do not remove many sources of noise. Thus, noise-reduction techniques such as CompCor and FIX have been developed to further improve the ability to draw meaningful conclusions from the data. The ability of these techniques to minimize noise while conserving signals of interest has been tested almost exclusively in resting-state fMRI datasets and, only rarely, in task-related fMRI datasets. Application of noise-reduction techniques to task-related fMRI is particularly important given that such procedures have been shown to reduce false positive rates. However, little remains known about the impact of different noise reduction techniques on the retention of signal, particularly during tasks that may be associated with systemic physiological changes. In this paper, we compared two noise-reduction techniques, i.e. FIX and CompCor, in an fMRI dataset including noxious heat stimulation and non-noxious auditory stimulation. Results show that preprocessing including FIX noise-reduction technique conserves significantly more signal than a preprocessing protocol including CompCor noise-reduction technique in both noxious heat and non-noxious auditory stimulations, while removing only slightly less noise. These results suggest that FIX might be the most appropriate technique to achieve the balance between conserving signals of interest and removing noise.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Impacts of Spaceflight Experience on Human Brain Structure</a></h4>

              
                Spaceflight induces widespread changes in human brain morphology. It is unclear if these brain changes differ with varying mission durations or one's history of spaceflight experience (e.g., number of prior missions, time between missions). Here we addressed this issue by quantifying voxelwise post-flight changes in gray matter volume, white matter microstructure, extracellular free water (FW), and ventricular volume in a sample of 28 astronauts. We found that longer missions induced greater ventricular expansion and larger FW displacement at the top of the brain. A greater number of prior missions was associated with white matter microstructure declines in a tract supporting voluntary leg movement. Longer inter-mission intervals were associated with greater ventricle expansion, with compensatory ventricular expansion observed only in those crewmembers with inter-missions intervals of 3 years or longer. Longer missions therefore induce more extensive brain fluid shifts, and the ventricles may require at least 3 years to recover post-flight.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Selective integration of diverse taste inputs within a single taste modality</a></h4>

              
                Each sensory system contains a diverse repertoire of sensory cells. In the gustatory system, individual taste modalities contain sensory cells that reside in different locations or express different combinations of taste receptors. These different input channels may converge onto common downstream circuits and drive the same behaviors, or they may activate separate pathways to regulate distinct behaviors. To distinguish between these models in Drosophila, we first characterized a repertoire of behaviors induced by optogenetic activation of sugar- or bitter-sensing neurons. We then activated subsets of bitter-sensing neurons within specific organs. Different subsets elicited a broad and highly overlapping set of behaviors, suggesting that they converge onto common downstream pathways, but we also observed behavioral differences that argue for selective convergence. Transsynaptic tracing experiments provided a neuronal substrate for these results, revealing that bitter neuron subsets connect to overlapping downstream regions with biased connectivity. We characterized one type of second-order bitter neuron that integrates multiple types of bitter input and regulates a subset of bitter-induced behaviors. These results suggest that different bitter inputs are selectively integrated early in the circuit, enabling the pooling of sensory information, and the circuit then diverges into multiple pathways that may have different behavioral roles.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Unbiased stereologic estimates of dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons in the A10, A9, and A8 subpopulations in the young male Macaque</a></h4>

              
                The ventral midbrain is the primary source of dopamine- (DA) expressing neurons in most species. GABA-ergic and glutamatergic cell populations are intermixed among DA-expressing cells and purported to regulate both local and long-range dopamine neuron activity. Most work has been conducted in rodent models, however due to evolutionary expansion of the ventral midbrain in primates, the increased size and complexity of DA subpopulations warrants further investigation. Here, we quantified the number of DA neurons, and their GABA-ergic complement in classic DA cell groups A10 (midline ventral tegmental area nuclei [VTA] and parabrachial pigmented nucleus [PBP]), A9 (substantia nigra, pars compacta [SNc]) and A8 (retrorubral field [RRF]) in the macaque. Because the PBP is a disproportionately expanded feature of the A10 group, and has unique connectional features in monkeys, we analyzed A10 data by dividing it into 'classic 'midline nuclei and the PBP. Unbiased stereology revealed total putative DA neuron counts to be 210,238 +/- 17,127 (A10 = 110,319 +/- 9,649, A9= 87,399 +/-7,751 and A8=12,520 +/- 827). Putative GABAergic neurons were fewer overall, and evenly dispersed across the DA subpopulations (GAD67= 71,215 +/- 5,663; A10=16,836 +/- 2,743; A9=24,855 +/- 3,144 and A8=12,633 +/- 3,557). Calculating the GAD67/TH ratio for each subpopulation revealed differential balances of these two cell types across the DA subpopulations. The A8 subpopulation had the highest complement of GAD67-positive neurons compared to TH-positive neurons (1:1), suggesting a potentially high capacity for GABAergic inhibition of DA output in this region.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct features of the cortical N1 response to balance perturbation are associated with balance and cognitive impairments in Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Mechanisms underlying associations between balance and cognitive impairments in older adults with and without Parkinson's disease (PD) are poorly understood. Balance disturbances evoke a cortical N1 response that is associated with both balance and cognitive abilities in unimpaired populations. We hypothesized that the N1 response reflects a neural mechanism that is shared between balance and cognitive function, and would therefore be associated with both balance and cognitive impairments in PD. Although N1 responses did not differ at the group level they showed distinct associations with balance and cognitive function in the PD vs. control (noPD) groups. In noPD, higher N1 amplitudes were correlated with lower cognitive set shifting ability and lower balance confidence. However, in PD, higher N1 amplitudes were correlated with lower overall cognitive function, while earlier and narrower N1 peaks were correlated with more severe PD and balance impairments. Our results show that balance and cognitive impairments are dissociable and associated with distinct features of the N1 response, suggesting that the N1 response reflects coordination of distinct mechanisms for balance and cognitive function. Identifying coordinated but dissociable mechanisms underlying balance and cognitive processes may reveal potential targets for rehabilitation of comorbid balance and cognitive impairments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Principled clustering of functional signals reveals gradients in processing both within the anterior hippocampus and across its long axis</a></h4>

              
                A particularly elusive puzzle concerning the hippocampus is how the structural differences along its long, anteroposterior axis might beget meaningful functional differences, particularly in terms of the granularity of information processing. One measure posits to quantify this granularity by calculating the average statistical independence of the BOLD signal across neighboring voxels, or inter-voxel similarity (IVS), and has shown the anterior hippocampus to process coarser-grained information than that in the posterior hippocampus. This model of the hippocampus, however, conflicts with a number of task-oriented findings, many of which have varied in their fMRI acquisition parameters and hippocampal parcellation methods. In order to reconcile these findings, we measured IVS across two separate resting-state fMRI acquisitions and compared the results across many of the most widely used parcellation methods in a large young-adult sample (Acquisition 1, N = 253; Acquisition 2, N = 183). Finding conflicting results across acquisitions and parcellations, we reasoned that a principled, data-driven approach to hippocampal parcellation is necessary. To this end, we implemented a group masked independent components analysis (mICA) to identify functional subunits of the hippocampus, most notably separating the anterior hippocampus into separate anterior-medial, anterior-lateral, and posteroanterior-lateral components. Measuring IVS across these components revealed a decrease in IVS along the medial-lateral axis of the anterior hippocampus but an increase from anterior to posterior. We conclude that representational granularity may not change linearly or unidirectionally across the hippocampus, and that moving the study of the hippocampus towards reproducibility requires grounding it in a functionally informed approach.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Behavioral decomposition reveals rich encoding structure employed across neocortex</a></h4>

              
                The cortical population code is pervaded by activity patterns evoked by movement, but how such signals relate to the natural actions of unrestrained animals remains largely unknown, particularly in sensory areas. To address this we compared high-density neural recordings across four cortical regions (visual, auditory, somatosensory, motor) in relation to sensory modulation, posture, movement, and ethograms of freely foraging rats. Momentary actions, such as rearing or turning, were represented ubiquitously and could be decoded from all sampled structures. However, more elementary and continuous features, such as pose and movement, followed region-specific organization, with neurons in visual and auditory cortices preferentially encoding mutually distinct head-orienting features in world-referenced coordinates, and somatosensory and motor cortices principally encoding the trunk and head in egocentric coordinates. The tuning properties of synaptically coupled cells also exhibited connection patterns suggestive of different uses of behavioral information within and between regions. Together, our results speak for detailed, multi-level encoding of animal behavior subserving its dynamic employment in local cortical computations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">State-dependent activity dynamics of hypothalamic stress effector neurons</a></h4>

              
                The stress response necessitates an immediate boost in vital physiological functions from their homeostatic operation to elevated emergency response. However, neural mechanisms underlying this state-dependent change remain largely unknown. Using a combination of in vivo and ex vivo electrophysiology with computational modeling, we report that corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), the effector neurons of hormonal stress response, rapidly transition between distinct activity states through recurrent inhibition. Specifically, in vivo optrode recording shows that under non-stress conditions, CRHPVN neurons often fire with rhythmic brief bursts (RB), which, somewhat counterintuitively, constrains firing rate due to long (~2 s) inter-burst intervals. Stressful stimuli rapidly switch RB to continuous single spiking (SS), permitting a large increase in firing rate. A spiking network model shows that recurrent inhibition can control this activity-state switch, and consequently the gain of spiking responses to excitatory inputs. In biological CRHPVN neurons ex vivo, the injection of whole-cell currents derived from our computational model recreates the in vivo-like switch between RB and SS, providing a direct evidence that physiologically relevant network inputs enable state-dependent computation in single neurons. Together, we present a novel mechanism for state-dependent activity dynamics in CRHPVN neurons.

	<p>The imbalance between the speed and accuracy of cognitive-motor operations can lead to the formation of abnormal behavioral programs fraught with serious negative consequences for the individual. For successful correction and prevention of social disadaptation in adolescents with nervous and mental diseases and functional disorders in mental sphere in general education schools, the peculiarities of their psychomotor activity should be taken into account. We measured some parameters of visual-motor coordination and sensorimotor reaction in adolescents with mental disorders with (n = 36) or without (n = 27) organic brain damage. Adolescents from both groups showed higher speed, but poorer accuracy and smoothness, of movements than typically developing students (n = 70). The visual and acoustic reaction times were longer in adolescents with mental disorders without organic brain damage than in reference groups.</p>

	<p>Despite evidence that stress relates negatively to cognitive functioning in older adults, little is known how appraisal of stress and socioeconomic meso-level factors influence different types of cognitive functions in older adults. Here, we assess the relationship between perceived stress (PSS scale) and a battery of cognitive functions, including prospective memory in 1054 older adults (65+). A moderator analysis assessed whether this relationship varies with neighborhood socioeconomic status using an area-based measure of Socioeconomic Position (SEP). Perceived stress was associated with worse processing speed, verbal fluency, and inductive reasoning. The perceived self-efficacy subscale of the PSS is related to better performance in these measures. Higher self-efficacy was also associated with better prospective memory; this relationship was more pronounced for people with high neighborhood SEP. These findings indicate that not only do perceived stress and perceived self-efficacy relate to cognitive functioning in older age but also that neighborhood SEP is a moderator of this relationship.</p>

	<p>Aim. Handwriting abilities in children with dyslexia (DYS) are not well documented in the current literature, and the presence of graphomotor impairment in addition to spelling impairment in dyslexia is controversial. Using resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC), the present study aims to answer the following question: are there markers of graphomotor impairment at rest in DYS children? Method. The participants were children with DYS and typically developing (TD) children (n = 32) from French-speaking primary schools (Mage = 9.3 years). The behavioural evaluation consisted of spelling and handwriting measures. Participants underwent a resting-state fMRI scan. Results. Analyses of RSFC focused on a brain region responsible for graphomotor processes&amp;amp;mdash;the graphemic/motor frontal area (GMFA). The RSFC between the GMFA and all other voxels of the brain was measured. Whole-brain ANOVAs were run to compare RSFC in DYS and TD children. The results demonstrated reduced RSFC in DYS compared to TD between the GMFA and brain areas involved in both spelling processes and motor-related processes. Conclusions. For the first time, this study highlighted a disruption of the writing network in DYS. By identifying functional markers of both spelling and handwriting deficits at rest in young DYS participants, this study supports the presence of graphomotor impairment in dyslexia.</p>

	<p>Tics can be associated with neurological disorders and are thought to be the result of dysfunctional basal ganglia pathways. In Tourette Syndrome (TS), excess dopamine in the striatum is thought to excite the thalamo-cortical circuits, producing tics. When external stressors activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, more dopamine is produced, furthering the excitation of tic-producing pathways. Emotional processing structures in the limbic are also activated during tics, providing further evidence of a possible emotional component in motor ticking behaviors. The purpose of this review is to better understand the relationship between emotional states and ticking behavior. We found support for the notion that premonitory sensory phenomena (PSP), sensory stimulation, and other environmental stressors that impact the HPA axis can influence tics through dopaminergic neurotransmission. Dopamine plays a vital role in cognition and motor control and is an important neurotransmitter in the pathophysiology of other disorders such as obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive disorder (OCD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which tend to be comorbid with ticking disorders and are thought to use similar pathways. It is concluded that there is an emotional component to ticking behaviors. Emotions primarily involving anxiety, tension, stress, and frustration have been associated with exacerbated tics, with PSP contributing to these feelings.</p>

	<p>The suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins play important roles in cytokine and growth factor signaling, where they act principally as negative feedback regulators, particularly of the downstream signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) transcription factors. This critical mode of regulation impacts on both development and homeostasis. However, understanding of the function of SOCS4 remains limited. To address this, we investigated one of the zebrafish SOCS4 paralogues, socs4a, analyzing its expression and the consequences of its ablation. The socs4a gene had a dynamic expression profile during zebrafish embryogenesis, with initial ubiquitous expression becoming restricted to sensory ganglion within the developing nervous system. The knockdown of zebrafish socs4a revealed novel roles in notochord development, as well as the formation of a functional sensory system.</p>

	<p>Background: Developmental dyslexia (DD) is a specific learning disorder concerning reading acquisition that may has a lifelong negative impact on individuals. A reliable estimate of the prevalence of DD serves as the basis for diagnosis, intervention, and evidence-based health resource allocation and policy-making. Hence, the present meta-analysis aims to generate a reliable prevalence estimate of DD worldwide in primary school children and explore the potential variables related to that prevalence. Methods: Studies from the 1950s to June 2021 were collated using a combination of search terms related to DD and prevalence. Study quality was assessed using the STROBE guidelines according to the study design, with study heterogeneity assessed using the I2 statistic, and random-effects meta-analyses were conducted. Variations in the prevalence of DD in different subgroups were assessed via subgroup meta-analysis and meta-regression. Results: The pooled prevalence of DD was 7.10% (95% CI: 6.27&amp;amp;ndash;7.97%). The prevalence in boys was significantly higher than that in girls (boys: 9.22%, 95%CI, 8.07&amp;amp;ndash;10.44%; girls: 4.66%, 95% CI, 3.84&amp;amp;ndash;5.54%; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), but no significant difference was found in the prevalence across different writing systems (alphabetic scripts: 7.26%, 95%CI, 5.94&amp;amp;ndash;8.71%; logographic scripts: 6.97%, 95%CI, 5.86&amp;amp;ndash;8.16%; p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05) or across different orthographic depths (shallow: 7.13%, 95% CI, 5.23&amp;amp;ndash;9.30%; deep: 7.55%, 95% CI, 4.66&amp;amp;ndash;11.04%; p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). It is worth noting that most articles had small sample sizes with diverse operational definitions, making comparisons challenging. Conclusions: This study provides an estimation of worldwide DD prevalence in primary school children. The prevalence was higher in boys than in girls but was not significantly different across different writing systems.</p>
