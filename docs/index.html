              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The COVID-19 pandemic and mental health outcomes – A cross-sectional study among health care workers in Coastal South India [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Frontline health care workers (HCWs) are at increased risk of developing unfavourable mental health outcomes and burnout, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recognizing the early warning signs of mental distress is very important to ensure the provision of quality patient care. Methods: In this facility-based cross-sectional study, HCWs of the teaching hospitals affiliated to Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore were assessed regarding their mental health status using a semi-structured questionnaire. All doctors and nurses who were willing to participate from these teaching hospitals were included in the study. Data was collected over a period of four months (1st March -30th June 2021) till the required sample size was reached and analysed using IBM SPSS and expressed using mean (standard deviation), median (interquartile range), and proportions. Univariate analysis was done to identify the factors associated with mental health outcomes among the HCWs and the corresponding unadjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval were reported. Results: A total of 245 HCWs [52.2% (n=128) doctors and 47.8% (n=117) nurses] were included in our study. The proportion of participants with depressive symptoms, anxiety, and insomnia assessed using PHQ-9, GAD-7, and ISI-7 scales were 49% (n=119), 38% (n=93), and 42% (n=102) respectively. Depression, anxiety, and insomnia were more likely to be experienced by HCWs aged > 27 years, females, and involved in COVID-19 patient care. (p>0.05) Conclusions:  Our findings that 38% of the examined HCWs had clinically relevant anxiety symptoms and 49% had clinically relevant depression symptoms draws attention to the importance of systematically tracking the mental health of HCWs during this ongoing pandemic. HCWs should monitor their stress reactions and seek appropriate help both on a personal and professional level. Appropriate workplace interventions including psychological support should be provided to HCWs, to ensure provision of uncompromised quality patient care.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis in Al-Najaf governate, Iraq [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is one of the most global dangerous infectious diseases worldwide, particularly in developing countries. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the most infectious agent that caused PTB transferred by air droplets from one person to other. In the present epidemiological study, we aimed to record the total numbers and percentages of patients infected with PTB caused by Mtb during 12 months in AL-Najaf Governorate, Iraq.    Methods: This study has been done in 2019 from January to the end of December in the north and south region of AL-Najaf Governorate, Iraq. Sputum of PTB-patients has been stained by Ziehl–Neelsen to Mtb diagnosis according to World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation. Results: We recorded 174 PTB-patients in AL-Najaf Governorate 2019; 89 male and 85 female; 101 and 73 in the north and south sections respectively. The age group 16-24 was the highest infected. Quarter two recorded the highest numbers of PTB-patients; 33 (60%) in the north section and 22 (40%) in the south section. Conclusion: There was low PTB incidence in AL-Najaf Governorate 2019 but the Youngers were the most susceptible to infection. Infection in the north section was higher than in the south section and there were no high differences between genders. Seasons have no high effect on the number of infections.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Investigating the effect of e-cigarette use on quitting smoking in adults aged 25 years or more using the PATH study [version 3; peer review: 3 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The evidence on harms and benefits of e-cigarettes partly concerns whether their use encourages smokers to quit.  We addressed this using data from the nationally representative PATH study, with detailed accounting for potential confounding variables. Methods: We considered adults aged 25+.  Our original analyses, reported in version 1 of this paper, used data for Waves 1 to 3, separate analyses considering Waves 1 to 2, 2 to 3 and 1 to 3.  These related baseline ever e-cigarette use (or e-product use at Wave 2) to quitting at follow-up, adjusting for confounders derived from 55 candidates.  Sensitivity analyses omitted ever other product users, linked quitting to current e-cigarette use, and used values of some predictors modified using follow-up data.  Additional analyses used data for Waves 1 to 4, separately considering sustained, delayed and temporary quitting during Waves 1 to 3, 2 to 4 and 1 to 4.  Sensitivity analyses considered 30-day quitting, restricted attention to smokers attempting to quit, and considered ever smokeless tobacco or snus use. Results: In the original analyses, unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) of quitting smoking for ever e-cigarette use were 1.29 (95% CI 1.01-1.66), 1.52 (1.26-1.83) and 1.47 (1.19-1.82) for the Wave 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 1 to 3 analyses.  These reduced after adjustment, to 1.23 (0.94-1.61), 1.51 (1.24-1.85) and 1.39 (1.11-1.74).  Quitting rates remained elevated in users in all sensitivity analyses.  The additional analyses found associations of e-cigarette use with sustained, delayed and temporary quitting, associations little affected by considering 30-day quitting, and only slightly reduced restricting attention to quit attempters.  Ever use of smokeless tobacco or snus also predicted increased quitting.   Conclusions: As does most evidence from clinical trials, other analyses of PATH, and other epidemiological studies, our results suggest using e-cigarettes helps adult smokers to quit.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence of diabetes mellitus among newly detected sputum positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients and associated risk factors: A cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Tuberculosis (TB) and diabetes mellitus (DM) co-morbidity is one of the rising public health problems. There is growing evidence that DM is an important risk factor for TB. This study was carried out to know the prevalence of DM among newly detected sputum positive pulmonary TB patients registered in District Tuberculosis Centre and to assess the risk factors of DM among TB patients. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, newly detected sputum positive pulmonary TB patients were screened for DM (those having symptoms of DM). Furthermore, they were diagnosed by detecting blood glucose levels (≥200 mg/dL). Mean, standard deviation (SD), Chi-squared and Fisher-Freeman-Halton exact tests were used to determine the significant associations. P-values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Results: A total of 215 TB patients were included in this study. The prevalence of DM among TB patients was found to be 23.7% (2.8% known and 97.8% new cases). Significant associations were found between age (>46 years old), educational status, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, physical activity, presence of DM symptoms and family history of DM. Conclusions: Routine screening for DM is mandatory due to its increasing prevalence, which may help in early diagnosis and to reduce complications by proper management that in turn helps in the successful outcome of TB treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Consumption of food supplements: is there a risk of muscle dysmorphia? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background.  Bigorexia is an eating disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder where the subject has an incorrect perception of their body image with exercise addiction. This study aims to determine whether there is a relationship between body mass index (BMI), food supplement consumption, dietary adherence, gender and risk of muscle dysmorphia in the individual and to provide information to build recommendation systems to monitor the health and mental state of the population. Methods. A cross-sectional descriptive observational study was conducted in Barranquilla (Colombia) between February – May 2020. A face-to-face survey of 200 individuals of both sexes was used in which users evaluated different variables that helped to identify their risk of muscle dysmorphia.   Results. Of the 200 participants, 105 men: N=48, 45.7% vs. women: N=57, 54.3%) consume nutritional supplements. There is no relationship in the total population with the risk of muscle dysmorphia with the consumption of nutritional supplements nor with the feeling of guilt for non-adherence to the diet, nor with age, gender, or BMI (p<0.05). In contrast, gender, age and BMI are related to nutritional supplement consumption, and gender is related to feelings of guilt for non-adherence to the diet. In the population that consumes nutritional supplements the risk of muscle dysmorphia is increased and the frequency varies by risk group: low risk: N=16, 15.2%; medium risk: N=46, 43.8%; high risk: N=28, 26.7%; and very high risk: N=15, 14.3%. The consumption of food supplements is higher in the female gender (57, 54.3% vs. 48, 45.7%), and moderate the feeling of guilt for not completing the diet, BMI and the risk of muscle dysmorphia. Conclusions.  Women consume more food supplements, but gender does not determine the risk of muscle dysmorphia. Food supplement consumption influences the feeling of guilt for not completing the diet, BMI and the risk of muscle dysmorphia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Brain death debates: from bioethics to philosophy of science [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                50 years after its introduction, brain death remains controversial among scholars. The debates focus on one question: is brain death a good criterion for determining death? This question has been answered from various perspectives: medical, metaphysical, ethical, and legal or political. Most authors either defend the criterion as it is, propose some minor or major revisions, or advocate abandoning it and finding better solutions to the problems that brain death was intended to solve when it was introduced. Here I plead for a different approach that has been overlooked in the literature: the philosophy of science approach. Some scholars claim that human death is a matter of fact, a biological phenomenon whose occurrence can be determined empirically, based on science. We should take this claim seriously, whether we agree with it or not. The question is: how do we know that human death is a scientific matter of fact? Taking the philosophy of science approach means, among other things, examining how the determination of human death became an object of scientific inquiry, exploring the nature of the brain death criterion itself, and analysing the meaning of its core concepts such as “irreversibility” and “functions”.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Presynaptic FMRP and local protein synthesis support structural and functional plasticity of glutamatergic axon terminals</a></h4>

              
                Monday, Kharod et al. report that neuronal activity regulates presynaptic FMRP function and the local synthesis of β-actin. In vitro activity and in vivo experience engage the FMRP-dependent spatiotemporal regulation of protein synthesis that is required for presynaptic remodeling and long-term changes in neurotransmitter release.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A native chemical chaperone in the human eye lens</a></h4>

              
                Cataract is one of the most prevalent protein aggregation disorders and still the most common cause of vision loss worldwide. The metabolically quiescent core region of the human lens lacks cellular or protein turnover; it has therefore evolved remarkable mechanisms to resist light-scattering protein aggregation for a lifetime. We now report that one such mechanism involves an unusually abundant lens metabolite, <i>myo-</i>inositol, suppressing aggregation of lens crystallins. We quantified aggregation suppression using our previously well-characterized <i>in vitro</i> aggregation assays of oxidation-mimicking human γD-crystallin variants and investigated <i>myo-</i>inositol's molecular mechanism of action using solution NMR, negative-stain TEM, differential scanning fluorometry, thermal scanning Raman spectroscopy, turbidimetry in redox buffers, and free thiol quantitation. Unlike many known chemical chaperones, myo-inositol's primary target was not the native, unfolded, or final aggregated states of the protein; rather, we propose that it was the rate-limiting bimolecular step on the aggregation pathway. Given recent metabolomic evidence that it is severely depleted in human cataractous lenses compared to age-matched controls, we suggest that maintaining or restoring healthy levels of <i>myo-</i>inositol in the lens may be a simple, safe, and globally accessible strategy to prevent or delay lens opacification due to age-onset cataract.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Comprehensive fitness landscape of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro reveals insights into viral resistance mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                With the continual evolution of new strains of SARS-CoV-2 that are more virulent, transmissible, and able to evade current vaccines, there is an urgent need for effective anti-viral drugs SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) is a leading target for drug design due to its conserved and indispensable role in the viral life cycle. Drugs targeting M<sup>pro</sup> appear promising but will elicit selection pressure for resistance. To understand resistance potential in M<sup>pro</sup>, we performed a comprehensive mutational scan of the protease that analyzed the function of all possible single amino acid changes. We developed three separate high-throughput assays of M<sup>pro</sup> function in yeast, based on either the ability of M<sup>pro</sup> variants to cleave at a defined cut-site or on the toxicity of their expression to yeast. We used deep sequencing to quantify the functional effects of each variant in each screen. The protein fitness landscapes from all three screens were strongly correlated, indicating that they captured the biophysical properties critical to M<sup>pro</sup> function. The fitness landscapes revealed a non-active site location on the surface that is extremely sensitive to mutation making it a favorable location to target with inhibitors. In addition, we found a network of critical amino acids that physically bridge the two active sites of the M<sup>pro</sup> dimer. The clinical variants of M<sup>pro</sup> were predominantly functional in our screens, indicating that M<sup>pro</sup> is under strong selection pressure in the human population. Our results provide predictions of mutations that will be readily accessible to M<sup>pro</sup> evolution and that are likely to contribute to drug resistance. This complete mutational guide of M<sup>pro</sup> can be used in the design of inhibitors with reduced potential of evolving viral resistance.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Sequential addition of neuronal stem cell temporal cohorts generates a feed-forward circuit in the Drosophila larval nerve cord</a></h4>

              
                How circuits self-assemble starting from neuronal stem cells is a fundamental question in developmental neurobiology. Here, we addressed how neurons from different stem cell lineages wire with each other to form a specific circuit motif. In Drosophila larvae, we combined developmental genetics (Twin spot MARCM, Multi-color Flip Out, permanent labeling) with circuit analysis (calcium imaging, connectomics, network science). For many lineages, neuronal progeny are organized into subunits called temporal cohorts. Temporal cohorts are subsets of neurons born within a tight time window that have shared circuit level function. We find sharp transitions in patterns of input connectivity at temporal cohort boundaries. In addition, we identify a feed-forward circuit that encodes the onset of vibration stimuli. This feed-forward circuit is assembled by preferential connectivity between temporal cohorts from different lineages. Connectivity does not follow the often-cited early-to-early, late-to-late model. Instead, the circuit is formed by sequential addition of temporal cohorts from different lineages, with circuit output neurons born before circuit input neurons. Further, we generate new tools for the fly community. Our data raise the possibility that sequential addition of neurons (with outputs oldest and inputs youngest) could be one fundamental strategy for assembling feed-forward circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">NAD kinase promotes Staphylococcus aureus pathogenesis by supporting production of virulence factors and protective enzymes</a></h4>

              
                Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) is the primary electron donor for reductive reactions that are essential for the biosynthesis of major cell components in all organisms. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide kinase (NADK) is the only enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of NADP(H) from NAD(H). While the enzymatic properties and physiological functions of NADK have been thoroughly studied, the role of NADK in bacterial pathogenesis remains unknown. Here, we used CRISPR interference to knock down NADK gene expression to address the role of this enzyme in <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> pathogenic potential. We find that NADK inhibition drastically decreases mortality of zebrafish infected with <i>S. aureus</i>. Furthermore, we show that NADK promotes <i>S. aureus</i> survival in infected macrophages by protecting bacteria from antimicrobial defense mechanisms. Proteome-wide data analysis revealed that production of major virulence-associated factors is sustained by NADK. We demonstrate that NADK is required for expression of the quorum-sensing response regulator AgrA, which controls critical <i>S. aureus</i> virulence determinants. These findings support a key role for NADK in bacteria survival within innate immune cells and the host during infection.

                Herbicides with novel modes of action are urgently needed to safeguard global agricultural industries against the damaging effects of herbicide-resistant weeds. We recently developed the first herbicidal inhibitors of lysine biosynthesis, which provided proof-of-concept for a promising novel herbicide target. In this study, we expanded upon our understanding of the mode of action of herbicidal lysine biosynthesis inhibitors. We previously postulated that these inhibitors may act as proherbicides. Here, we show this is not the case. We report an additional mode of action of these inhibitors, through their inhibition of a second lysine biosynthesis enzyme, and investigate the molecular determinants of inhibition. Furthermore, we extend our herbicidal activity analyses to include a weed species of global significance.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Learning accurate path integration in ring attractor models of the head direction system</a></h4>

              
                Ring attractor models for angular path integration have received strong experimental support. To function as integrators, head direction circuits require precisely tuned connectivity, but it is currently unknown how such tuning could be achieved. Here, we propose a network model in which a local, biologically plausible learning rule adjusts synaptic efficacies during development, guided by supervisory allothetic cues. Applied to the Drosophila head direction system, the model learns to path-integrate accurately and develops a connectivity strikingly similar to the one reported in experiments. The mature network is a quasi-continuous attractor and reproduces key experiments in which optogenetic stimulation controls the internal representation of heading, and where the network remaps to integrate with different gains in rodents. Our model predicts that path integration requires self-supervised learning during a developmental phase, and proposes a general framework to learn to path-integrate with gain-1 even in architectures that lack the physical topography of a ring.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Homotopic contralesional excitation suppresses spontaneous circuit repair and global network reconnections following ischemic stroke</a></h4>

              
                Understanding circuit-level manipulations that affect the brain's capacity for plasticity will inform the design of targeted interventions that enhance recovery after stroke. Following stroke, increased contralesional activity (e.g. use of the unaffected limb) can negatively influence recovery, but it is unknown which specific neural connections exert this influence, and to what extent increased contralesional activity affects systems- and molecular-level biomarkers of recovery. Here, we combine optogenetic photostimulation with optical intrinsic signal imaging (OISI) to examine how contralesional excitatory activity affects cortical remodeling after stroke in mice. Following photothrombosis of left primary somatosensory forepaw (S1FP) cortex, mice either recovered spontaneously or received chronic optogenetic excitation of right S1FP over the course of 4 weeks. Contralesional excitation suppressed perilesional S1FP remapping and was associated with abnormal patterns of stimulus-evoked activity in the unaffected limb. This maneuver also prevented the restoration of resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) within the S1FP network, RSFC in several networks functionally-distinct from somatomotor regions, and resulted in persistent limb-use asymmetry. In stimulated mice, perilesional tissue exhibited transcriptional changes in several genes relevant for recovery. Our results suggest that contralesional excitation impedes local and global circuit reconnection through suppression of cortical activity and several neuroplasticity-related genes after stroke, and highlight the importance of site selection for therapeutic intervention after focal ischemia.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The role of surface adhesion on the macroscopic wrinkling of biofilms</a></h4>

              
                Biofilms, bacterial communities of cells encased by a self-produced matrix, exhibit a variety of three-dimensional structures. Specifically, channel networks formed within the bulk of the biofilm have been identified to play an important role in the colonies' viability by promoting the transport of nutrients and chemicals. Here, we study channel formation and focus on the role of the adhesion of the biofilm matrix to the substrate in <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> biofilms grown under constant flow in microfluidic channels. We perform phase contrast and confocal laser scanning microscopy to examine the development of the biofilm structure as a function of the substrates' surface energy. The formation of the wrinkles and folds is triggered by a mechanical buckling instability, controlled by biofilm growth rate and the film’s adhesion to the substrate. The three-dimensional folding gives rise to hollow channels that rapidly increase the effective volume occupied by the biofilm and facilitate bacterial movement inside them. The experiments and analysis on mechanical instabilities for the relevant case of a bacterial biofilm grown during flow enable us to predict and control the biofilm morphology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An expanded toolkit for Drosophila gene tagging using synthesized homology donor constructs for CRISPR mediated homologous recombination</a></h4>

              
                Previously, we described a large collection of Drosophila strains that each carry an artificial exon containing a <i>T2AGAL4</i> cassette inserted in an intron of a target gene based on CRISPR-mediated homologous recombination (Lee <i>et al</i>., 2018). These alleles permit numerous applications and have proven to be very useful. Initially, the homologous recombination-based donor constructs had long homology arms (&gt;500 bps) to promote precise integration of large constructs (&gt;5kb). Recently, we showed that <i>in vivo</i> linearization of the donor constructs enables insertion of large artificial exons in introns using short homology arms (100-200 bps) (Kanca <i>et al</i>., 2019a). Shorter homology arms make it feasible to commercially synthesize homology donors and minimize the cloning steps for donor construct generation. Unfortunately, about 58% of Drosophila genes lack a suitable coding intron for integration of artificial exons in all of the annotated isoforms. Here, we report the development of new set of constructs that allow the replacement of the coding region of genes that lack suitable introns with a <i>KozakGAL4</i> cassette, generating a knock-out/knock-in allele that expresses GAL4 similarly as the targeted gene. We also developed custom vector backbones to further facilitate and improve transgenesis. Synthesis of homology donor constructs in custom plasmid backbones that contain the target gene sgRNA obviates the need to inject a separate sgRNA plasmid and significantly increases the transgenesis efficiency. These upgrades will enable the targeting of nearly every fly gene, regardless of exon-intron structure, with a 70-80% success rate.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pregabalin silences oxaliplatin-activated sensory neurons to relieve cold allodynia</a></h4>

              
                Oxaliplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapeutic agent that causes cold and mechanical allodynia in up to 90% of patients. Silent NaV1.8-positive nociceptive cold sensors have been shown to be unmasked by oxaliplatin and other neuropathic insults. This event has been causally linked to the development of cold and mechanical allodynia. Pregabalin is an anti-epileptic and analgesic drug that acts through a calcium channel 2{delta}-1 subunit to lower neurotransmitter release. Recent data also suggest pregabalin can act on NMDA receptors and other proteins, but the site of analgesic action has been considered to be the central nervous system. We examined the effects of pregabalin on oxaliplatin-evoked unmasking of cold sensitive neurons using mice expressing GCaMP-3 driven by a Pirt promoter in all sensory neurons. We found that in mice treated with oxaliplatin, intravenous injection of pregabalin significantly decreased cold allodynia. Interestingly, pregabalin also decreased the number of sensory neurons responding to cold nociceptive stimuli by altering their excitability and their temperature thresholds. These silenced neurons are medium/large cells responding to both painful mechanical and cold stimuli, corresponding to the 'silent' cold sensors that become active in numerous neuropathic pain models. Deletion of 2{delta}-1 subunits abolished the effects of pregabalin on both cold allodynia and the silencing of sensory neuron unmasked by oxaliplatin. Taken together, these results define a novel, peripheral inhibitory effect of pregabalin on the excitability of silent cold-sensing neurons in a model of oxaliplatin-dependent cold allodynia.

                Spinal Muscular Atrophy and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis share both phenotypic and molecular commonalities, including the fact that they can be caused by mutations in proteins involved in RNA metabolism, namely Smn, TDP-43 and Fus. Although this suggests the existence of common disease mechanisms, there is currently no model to explain the converging motoneuron dysfunction caused by changes in the expression of these ubiquitous genes. In this work we generated a parallel set of Drosophila models for adult-onset RNAi and tagged neuronal expression of the orthologues of SMN1, TARDBP and FUS (Smn, TBPH and Caz, respectively). We profiled nuclear and cytoplasmic bound mRNAs using a RIP-seq approach and characterized the transcriptome of the RNAi models by RNA-seq. To unravel the mechanisms underlying the common functional impact of these proteins on neuronal cells, we devised a computational approach based on the construction of a tissue-specific library of protein functional modules, selected by an overall impact score measuring the estimated extent of perturbation caused by each gene knockdown. Our integrative approach revealed that although each disease-associated gene regulates a poorly overlapping set of transcripts, they have a concerted effect on a specific subset of protein functional modules, acting through distinct targets. Most strikingly, functional annotation reveals these modules to be involved in critical cellular pathways for neurons and in particular, in neuromuscular junction function. Furthermore, selected modules were found to be significantly enriched in orthologues of human genes linked to neuronal disease. This work provides a new model explaining how mutations in SMA and ALS-associated disease genes linked to RNA metabolism functionally converge to cause motoneuron dysfunction. The critical functional modules identified represent interesting biomarkers and therapeutic targets given their identification in asymptomatic disease models.

                Attention depends on cholinergic excitation of prefrontal neurons. Knockout/knockdown studies indicate nicotinic alpha5 subunits encoded by Chrna5 are required for this response, but their native cellular roles and molecular interactions are unknown. Here, we probe endogenous cholinergic regulation of prefrontal Chrna5-expressing neurons (Chrna5+) using compound transgenic mice. Chrna5+ neurons show high sensitivity to acetylcholine, with a subpopulation clearly different from nearby, well-examined Syt6+ cells. Transcriptomic analysis reveals this distinct Chrna5+ population as subplate neurons, a diverse group of firstborn cells that have eluded previous transgenic characterization. Intriguingly, Chrna5+ subplate neurons express a distinct profile of GPI-anchored lynx prototoxins, suggesting specialized regulation of their cholinergic responses. In brain slices, endogenous nicotinic responses can be bidirectionally altered by perturbing GPI-anchored lynxes with phospholipase C activation or exogenous application of recombinant Ly6g6e prototoxin. Our work reveals cell-type specific Chrna5 and Lynx modulation leading to exquisite cholinergic sensitivity of prefrontal subplate neurons in adulthood.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Alterations of auditory sensory gating in mice with noise-induced tinnitus treated with nicotine and cannabis extract</a></h4>

              
                Aims/Hypothesis: Tinnitus is a phantom sound perception affecting both auditory and limbic structures. The mechanisms of tinnitus remain unclear and it is debatable whether tinnitus alters attention to sound and the ability to inhibit repetitive sounds, a phenomenon also known as auditory gating. Methods: 22 male C57BL/6J mice were used in this study. Anesthetized mice were exposed to a 9-11 kHz narrow band noise (90 dBSPL for 1 hr) and sham exposed mice were used as controls. Hearing thresholds were measured using auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and tinnitus was assessed using Gap prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle (GPIAS). After the induction of tinnitus, mice were implanted multi-electrodes to assess auditory event-related potentials (aERPs) in the dorsal hippocampus in response to paired clicks. Alterations of aERPs under nicotine (1.0 mg/kg, intraperitoneal (i.p.) or cannabis extract (100 mg/Kg, i.p.) were evaluated (in isolation or in combination), the latter containing 47.25 mg/kg of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC); 0.43 mg/kg of cannabidiol (CBD) and 1.17 mg/kg of cannabinol (CBN), as analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Saline-treated animals were used as controls. Results: Our results show that mice with behavioral evidence of tinnitus display auditory gating of repetitive click, but with larger amplitudes and longer latencies of the N40 component. In contrast, no difference was observed in the P80 amplitude and latency between groups or treatments. The combination of cannabis extract and nicotine also improved auditory gating ratio in mice with noise-induced tinnitus without permanent hearing threshold shifts by strongly increasing the first N40 click amplitude but without altering the second click response amplitude. Furthermore, the increased latency of the N40 component suggests altered temporal processing of triggered attention in mice with tinnitus due to an increased sensitivity to the exposure to cannabis extract. Conclusion/Interpretation: In summary, we show that nicotine and cannabis extract alter sensory gating in mice with behavioral evidence of tinnitus and propose that the altered central plasticity in tinnitus is more sensitive to the combined actions on the cholinergic and the endocannabinoid systems. We conclude that the limbic system may play a role in the altered sensory gating responses on tinnitus since the hippocampus responses to auditory inputs are altered. These findings could enable a new understanding of which neuronal pathways could be involved in sensory gating in tinnitus.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Human concurrent intracranial EEG and fMRI reveals multiple temporally independent but spatially similar connectome trajectories across timescales</a></h4>

              
                The large-scale organization of functional connectivity (FC) - the functional connectome - traverses distinct spatial patterns in a dynamic trajectory as demonstrated independently in fMRI and electrophysiological studies. These patterns are thought to satisfy ever-changing processing demands. FMRI and electrophysiology capture partly non-overlapping neural populations at different timescales, and it remains unknown to what degree the dynamic connectome trajectories across the two modalities are associated. We sought to clarify this relationship by studying resting wakefulness in a rare concurrent intracranial EEG and functional MRI dataset (iEEG-fMRI; 9 human neurosurgical patients) and in whole-brain connectomes obtained from source-localized EEG-fMRI (26 healthy humans). We measured ''spatial convergence'' as cross-modal spatial similarity of connectome configurations at a given time, and ''temporal convergence'' as synchronous occurrence of spatial convergence. We investigated three possible scenarios characterizing the cross-modal association of connectome trajectories: I) spatially and temporally convergent, II) spatially convergent but temporally divergent, and III) spatially and temporally divergent. We found that the behavior of fMRI and iEEG/EEG is consistent with scenario II: connectome trajectories spatially converge at intermittent times. Importantly, such asynchronous spatial convergence of connectome configurations was driven by cross-modally matched recurrent connectome states, independently across electrophysiological timescales. This connectome-level multi-frequency spatial convergence and temporal divergence suggests that hemodynamic and electrophysiological signals capture distinct aspects of FC, rather than serving as intermodal measurements of the same phenomenon. The multitude of flexible trajectories across timescales may concurrently enable FC across multiple independent sets of distributed brain regions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">BOSS: Beta-mixture Unsupervised Oligodendrocytes Segmentation System</a></h4>

              
                To develop reparative therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS), we need to better understand the physiology of loss and replacement of oligodendrocytes, the cells that make myelin and the target of damage in MS. In vivo two-photon fluorescence microscopy allows direct visualization of oligodendrocytes in transgenic mouse models, and promises a deeper understanding of the longitudinal dynamics of replacing oligodendrocytes after damage. However, the task of tracking oligodendrocytes requires extensive human effort and is especially challenging in three-dimensional images. While several models exist for automatically annotating cells in two-dimensional images, few models exist to annotate cells in three-dimensional images and even fewer are designed for tracking cells in longitudinal imaging. Furthermore, the complexity of processes and myelin formed by individual oligodendrocytes can result in the failure of algorithms that are specifically designed for tracking cell bodies alone. Here, we propose a novel beta-mixture unsupervised oligodendrocyte segmentation system (BOSS) that can segment and track oligodendrocytes in three-dimensional images over time that requires minimal human input. We evaluated the performance of the BOSS model on a set of eight images obtained longitudinally. We showed that the BOSS model can segment and track oligodendrocytes similarly to a blinded human observer.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Normalization of MRI T1w between-scan effects for improved longitudinal volumetric estimates</a></h4>

              
                Variations in image intensities and contrasts between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions affect the subsequent image processing and its derived outcomes. Therefore, comparability between acquisitions is improved if we reduce these variations. This is especially relevant for longitudinal studies where a change of scanner or acquisition protocol often happens between subsequent examinations. In this study, we use a robust intensity distribution alignment (RIDA) method to reduce between-scan effects and improve longitudinal volume change estimates between two MRI scanners - Siemens 1.5T Avanto and 3T Skyra. The method is based on MRI T1w images acquired in close succession and robustly aligns two cumulative distribution functions of voxel intensities to harmonize image intensities and improve image-derived outcomes of a range of subcortical brain. We compare RIDA with volume-based correction - a simple linear regression model. In both cases, we derive intensity and volume transformations from a training dataset of 20 participants scanned on both scanners on the same day and apply to an independent longitudinal test dataset of 243 participants. All participants in the test set were scanned at the Avanto scanner at the baseline and then at the Avanto and Skyra scanners on the same day at the follow-up, on average 4.4 years (sd = 0.5 years) later. This allowed us to directly assess the effect of scanner and protocol change on the longitudinal change estimates. Eight subcortical brain regions were segmented using SAMSEG, and annualized symmetrized percent change in volume between time points was calculated. We find that RIDA significantly reduces between-scan effects and improves longitudinal volume estimates for the amygdala and lateral ventricles. It also reduces between-scan effects for caudate, putamen, and thalamus, but not as much as linear regression models. Whether the method will be useful for a particular study will depend on the image intensity profiles of the scans. Therefore, a pilot study of double-scanned participants is recommended to assess the advantages of the method for the analysis in question.

                As prevalence rates of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, are projected to more than double by 2050, emphasis has been placed on early intervention strategies that target resilience mechanisms to delay or prevent the onset of clinical symptoms. Several neural mechanisms underlying brain resilience to AD have been proposed, including redundant neural connections between the posterior hippocampi (HC) and all other brain regions, and global functional connectivity of the left frontal cortex (LFC). It remains unknown, however, if regional redundancy of the HC and LFC underscores neural resilience in the presence of AD pathologies. From the ADNI database, 363 cognitively normal older adults (CN) (N = 220; 36% A{beta}) and patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) (N = 143; 51% A{beta}) were utilized. Regional redundancy was calculated from resting state fMRI data using a graph theoretical approach by summing the direct and indirect paths (path lengths=1-4) between each ROI and its 262 functional connections. The results showed that A{beta}-status significantly disrupted posterior HC, but not anterior HC or LFC, redundancy. A{beta} groups showed higher redundancy of the bilateral posterior HC than A{beta}. In regard to redundancy-cognition relationships, higher posterior HC redundancy was related to better episodic memory performance, an effect which was primarily driven by the A{beta} group. Despite the positive relationship between posterior HC redundancy and cognition, we did not find compelling evidence that redundancy of the posterior HC serves in a resilience manner, as posterior HC redundancy did not moderate the potentially deleterious relationship between A{beta} deposition and cognition. No relationships were found between anterior HC or LFC redundancy and cognitive performance. Together, these findings suggest that redundancy of the LFC does not underpin its role in resilience and that posterior HC redundancy may capture disruptions to network connectivity that occur as a result of A{beta} deposition.

                Neurofeedback is a technique that directs self-regulated modulation of neural activity. This is achieved by delivering real-time feedback derived from brain signals. In our previous work, we introduced a novel method, state-based neurofeedback (sb-NFB) that targets patterns of MEG signals related to shifts in spatial attention. In this pilot study, we used sb-NFB to train participants to decrease the time required to covertly shift spatial attention from one visual hemifield to the other. We characterized the changes to cortical connectivity during each training session. In addition, we run a separate, Posner-like validation task before the training sessions and after the training was complete. We found a significant main effect of training on the reaction time linked to switching spatial attention in both the training task and the validation task. This indicates the achieved improvement in shifting spatial attention generalized to another situation requiring this capability.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Location-Specific Facilitation in Marmoset Auditory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Responses of auditory cortex neurons are modulated by spectral or temporal context, but much less is known about modulation by spatial context. Here, we investigated single neuron responses to sequences of sounds either repeatedly delivered from a single spatial location or randomly delivered from multiple spatial locations in the auditory cortex of awake marmosets. Instead of inducing adaptation as expected from well-documented stimulus-specific adaptation studies, repetitive stimulation from a target speaker evoked long-lasting, location-specific facilitation (LSF) in many neurons, irrespective of the visibility of the target speaker. The extent of LSF decreased with decreasing presentation probability of the target speaker. Intracellular recordings showed that repetitive sound stimulation evoked sustained membrane potential depolarization which gave rise to firing rate facilitation. Computational models suggest two distinct neural mechanisms underlying LSF. Our findings revealed a novel form of contextual modulation in the auditory cortex that may play a role in auditory stream segregation.

                Human cognition is characterized by a wide range of capabilities including goal-oriented selective attention, distractor suppression, decision making, response inhibition, and working memory. Much research has focused on studying these individual components of cognition in isolation, whereas in several translational applications for cognitive impairment, multiple cognitive functions are altered in a given individual. Hence it is important to study multiple cognitive abilities in the same subject or, in computational terms, model them using a single model. To this end, we propose a unified, reinforcement learning-based agent model comprising of systems for representation, memory, value computation and exploration. We successfully modelled the aforementioned cognitive tasks and show how individual performance can be mapped to model meta-parameters. This model has the potential to serve as a proxy for cognitively impaired conditions, and can be used as a clinical testbench on which therapeutic interventions can be simulated first before delivering to human subjects.

                Alterations in internal states, such as elevated arousal level and increased anxiety or fear, triggered by alerting environmental cues are required for behavioral state transitions promoting survival. However, the specific brain region that plays an interfacing role between alerting stimuli and internal states remains to be identified. Here, we report that the medial sector of the auditory thalamus (ATm), which consists of a group of non-lemniscal thalamic nuclei, can fulfill this function. VGluT2-expressing ATm (ATmVGluT2+) neurons receive direct and strong inputs from both visual and auditory midbrain regions, and project to multiple downstream structures critically involved in brain state regulation. Their activity was correlated with, and indispensable for, both blue light- and sound-induced NREM sleep-to-Wake transition, and their arousing effects were mainly mediated by, but not limited to, the temporal association cortices. ATmVGluT2+ neuron activation in awake behaving mice induced pupil dilation and behavioral responses suggestive of anxiety. Blocking the neurotransmitter release of ATmVGluT2+ neurons receiving auditory inputs selectively abolished loud noise-triggered escape behavior but not locomotion. Thus, the ATm is an interface in mouse brain that can transform alerting environmental cues into internal arousal and emotional state alterations that promote survival.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The domain-separation low-dimensional language network dynamics in the resting-state support the flexible functional segregation and integration during language and speech processing</a></h4>

              
                Modern linguistic theories and network science propose that the language and speech processing is organized into hierarchical, segregated large-scale subnetworks, with a core of dorsal (phonological) stream and ventral (semantic) stream. The two streams are asymmetrically recruited in receptive and expressive language or speech tasks, which showed flexible functional segregation and integration. We hypothesized that the functional segregation of the two streams was supported by the underlying network segregation. A dynamic conditional correlation approach was employed to construct frame-wise time-varying language networks and investigate the temporal reoccurring patterns. We found that the time-varying language networks in the resting-state robustly clustered into four low-dimensional states, which dynamically reconfigured following a domain-separation manner. Spatially, the hub distributions of the first three states highly resembled the neurobiology of primary auditory processing and lexical-phonological processing, motor and speech production processing, and semantic processing, respectively. The fourth state was characterized by the weakest functional connectivity and subserved as a baseline state. Temporally, the first three states appeared exclusively in limited time bins (~15%), and most of the time (> 55%), the language network kept inactive in state 4. Machine learning-based dFC-linguistics prediction analyses showed that dFCs of the four states significantly predicted individual linguistic performance. These findings suggest a domain-separation manner of language network dynamics in the resting-state, which forms a dynamic meta-networking (network of networks) framework.

                The basal ganglia are known to control actions and modulate movements. Neuronal activity in the two efferent pathways of the dorsal striatum, a major input to the basal ganglia, is critical for appropriate behavioral control. Previous evidence has led to divergent conclusions on the respective engagement of both pathways during actions. We used calcium imaging to evaluate how neurons in the direct and indirect pathways in the dorsal striatum encode behaviors during self-paced spontaneous explorations in an open field. We observed that the two striatal pathways exhibit distinct tuning properties during spontaneous behaviors. We applied supervised learning algorithms and found that direct pathway neurons encode behaviors through their activation, whereas indirect pathway neurons exhibit behavior-specific silencing. These properties remain stable for weeks. Our findings highlight a complementary encoding of behaviors in the two striatal pathways that supports an updated model, reconciling previous conflicting conclusions on motor encoding in the striatum.

	<p>Cognitive function is affected by low pressure and hypoxia in high-altitude environments, and is regulated by altitude and exposure time. With the economic development in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the increase in work and study activities, as well as the development of plateau tourism, mountaineering, and other activities, the number of plateau immigrants is increasing daily. Long-term hypoxia challenges human physical and mental health, restricts work efficiency, and thus affects plateau economic development and human wellbeing. Therefore, it is of scientific and social significance to study how long-term exposure to the hypoxic plateau environment affects the physical and mental health of lowlanders as part of the ongoing development of the current plateau region. In this paper, we reviewed the research progress and mechanism of the effects of long-term (&amp;amp;ge;1 year) high-altitude (&amp;amp;gt;2500 m) hypoxia exposure on the cognitive function of lowlanders, and suggested that the scope and sample size of the research should be expanded in the future, and that follow-up studies should be carried out to explore the time threshold of cognitive impairment and its compensatory or repair mechanism.</p>

	<p>Purpose: This systematic review aims to summarize the evidence investigating the effectiveness and safety of the Surpass Evolve-Flow Diverter (SE-FD) to treat brain aneurysms. Method: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library from January 2019 to 29 March 2022. Terms related to the &amp;amp;ldquo;intracranial aneurysm&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;surpass evolve flow diverter&amp;amp;rdquo; concepts were used to search the databases; Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and reference hand search were also utilized. Results: The searches primarily identified 1586 documents. A total of five studies (four case series and one cohort) were included in this review. In the included studies, 192 (74 male and 118 females) patients with 198 aneurysms were involved. In total, 153 SE-FDs were used to treat 145 aneurysms. Complete occlusion was achieved in 69/145 (48%) cases and near-complete occlusion in 24/145 (17%) cases from aneurysms treated with SE-FD. Reported postoperative complications included stent thrombosis (n = 4 patients), hemorrhage (n = 5 patients), ischemia (n = 9 patients), and neurological complications (n = 12 patients). In total, four deaths were reported with only one related to the SE-FD procedure. Conclusion: The results of this review are based on observational data, due to the absence of clinical trials. The findings of the included studies suggest that the effectiveness of the SE-FD procedure is lower than previous FDs but the safety is similar. The included studies also suggested that SE-FD has navigability and resistance to twisting, which makes the procedure an easier method to treat aneurysms that are proximal and distal to the circle of Willis deployment. This review highlights the urgency to conduct clinical trials to confirm these suggestions.</p>

	<p>Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that exhibits unique neurological and behavioural characteristics. Our previous work using event-related potentials demonstrated that adults with ADHD process audiovisual multisensory stimuli somewhat differently than neurotypical controls. This study utilised an audiovisual multisensory two-alternative forced-choice discrimination task. Continuous whole-head electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Source localization (sLORETA) software was utilised to determine differences in the contribution made by sources of neural generators pertinent to audiovisual multisensory processing in those with ADHD versus neurotypical controls. Source localization techniques elucidated that the controls had greater neural activity 164 ms post-stimulus onset when compared to the ADHD group, but only when responding to audiovisual stimuli. The source of the increased activity was found to be Brodmann Area 2, postcentral gyrus, right-hemispheric parietal lobe referenced to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates of X = 35, Y = &amp;amp;minus;40, and Z = 70 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). No group differences were present during either of the unisensory conditions. Differences in the integration areas, particularly in the right-hemispheric parietal brain regions, were found in those with ADHD. These alterations may correspond to impaired attentional capabilities when presented with multiple simultaneous sensory inputs, as is the case during a multisensory condition.</p>

                In recent years, neuroscientists have collected conclusive evidence that selective attention to one of the most relevant signals in human environments - i.e., continuous speech - modulates neural phase-locked responses in auditory cortical regions ("neural tracking"). To test whether the human brain enhances targets or suppresses distraction when attending to speech, we here employed a psychophysically augmented speech-tracking paradigm with target, distractor and neutral streams. We demonstrate target enhancement to be behaviourally separable from distractor suppression, but no evidence for neural, below-baseline suppressive responses to distractors. A speech stimulus that was never task-relevant served as a neutral baseline, against which processing of concurrent target speech (relevant on present trial) and distractor speech (relevant on previous trial) was contrasted. Listeners (N = 19; male and female) had to detect short repeats in the target, which enabled us to contrast whether neural responses to target, neutral, or distractor speech would independently explain trial-by-trial variation in attention performance. Feasibility of the neutral baseline was evidenced by enhanced behavioural sensitivity when separating target-versus-distractor compared with target-versus-neutral speech. Temporal response functions revealed enhanced target speech tracking relative to neutral speech but no suppression of distraction below the neutral baseline. The amplitude of neural responses to target speech, but not to neutral or distractor speech, explained accuracy in behavioural repeat detection. Results indicate a necessary revision of the presumed role of enhanced phase-locked neural responses to speech to account for a specific sub-process of selective attention, that is, the enhancement of targets rather than the suppression of distraction.

Significance statementIs selective attention implemented along the central auditory pathway primarily via enhancement (i.e., neural gain) of behaviourally relevant targets, or by active (i.e., below-baseline) suppression of potential distractors, or both? Most current studies reporting attentional effects in the neural and behavioural response do not allow us to distinguish between such competing explanations of target enhancement versus distractor suppression. In a psychophysically augmented continuous-speech paradigm with three concurrently active sound locations, we show that selective attention to speech is implemented primarily via an enhancement of attended speech and not via suppression of distracting speech in the brain. These results suggest that the presumed role of neural responses to speech primarily reflects a specific sub process of selective attention, namely, target enhancement.

                Gene-environment interactions in the postnatal period have a long-term impact on neurodevelopment. To effectively model neurodevelopment in the mouse, we incorporated several validated behavioural tests to develop a behavioural pipeline that measures translationally relevant milestones of development in mice. The behavioral phenotype of 1060 wild type and genetically-modified mice was examined in parallel with structural brain imaging. The influence of genetics, sex, and early life stress on behaviour and neuroanatomy was determined using traditional statistical and machine learning methods. The results demonstrated that neuroanatomical diversity was primarily associated with genotype whereas behavioural phenotypic diversity was observed to be more susceptible to gene-environment interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Antisense oligonucleotide therapy rescues disturbed brain rhythms and sleep in juvenile and adult mouse models of Angelman syndrome</a></h4>

              
                UBE3A encodes ubiquitin protein ligase E3A, and in neurons its expression from the paternal allele is repressed by the UBE3A antisense transcript (UBE3A-ATS). This leaves neurons susceptible to loss-of-function of maternal UBE3A. Indeed, Angelman syndrome, a severe neurodevelopmental disorder, is caused by maternal UBE3A deficiency. A promising therapeutic approach to treating Angelman syndrome is to reactivate the intact paternal UBE3A by suppressing UBE3A-ATS. Prior studies show that many neurological phenotypes of maternal Ube3a knockout mice can only be rescued by reinstating Ube3a expression in early development, indicating a restricted therapeutic window for Angelman syndrome. Here we report that reducing Ube3a-ATS by antisense oligonucleotides in juvenile or adult maternal Ube3a knockout mice rescues the abnormal electroencephalogram rhythms and sleep disturbance, two prominent clinical features of Angelman syndrome. Importantly, the degree of phenotypic improvement correlates with the increase of Ube3a protein levels. These results indicate that the therapeutic window of genetic therapies for Angelman syndrome is broader than previously thought, and electroencephalogram power spectrum and sleep architecture should be used to evaluate the clinical efficacy of therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synaptic homeostasis transiently leverages Hebbian mechanisms for a multiphasic response to inactivity</a></h4>

              
                Neurons use various forms of negative feedback to maintain their synaptic strengths within an operationally useful range. While this homeostatic plasticity is thought to distinctly counteract the destabilizing positive feedback of Hebbian plasticity, there is considerable overlap in the molecular components mediating both forms of plasticity. The varying kinetics of these components spurs additional inquiry into the dynamics of synaptic homeostasis. We discovered that upscaling of synaptic weights in response to prolonged inactivity is nonmonotonic. Surprisingly, this seemingly oscillatory adaptation involved transient appropriation of molecular effectors associated with Hebbian plasticity, namely CaMKII, L-type Ca2+ channels, and Ca2+-permeable AMPARs, and homeostatic elements such as calcineurin. We created a dynamic model that shows how traditionally "Hebbian" and "homeostatic" mechanisms can cooperate to autoregulate postsynaptic Ca2+ levels. We propose that this combination of mechanisms allows excitatory synapses to adapt to prolonged activity changes and safeguard the capability to undergo future strengthening on demand.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A novel fully-automated system for lifelong continuous phenotyping of mouse cognition and behaviour</a></h4>

              
                Comprehensive ethologically-relevant behavioural phenotyping in rodent experiments is essential for deciphering the neural basis of animal cognition. Automated home-cage monitoring systems present a valuable tool to fulfil this need. However, they often involve complex animal training routines, water or food deprivation, and probe a limited range of behaviours. Here, we present a new fully automated AI-driven home-cage system for cognitive and behavioural phenotyping in mice. The system incorporates spontaneous alternation T-maze, novel-object recognition and object-in-place recognition tests combined with monitoring of an animal position, water consumption, quiescence and locomotion patterns, all carried out continuously and simultaneously in an unsupervised fashion over long periods of time. Mice learnt the tasks rapidly without any need for water or food restrictions. We applied ethomics approach to show that combined statistical properties of multiple behaviours can be used to discriminate between mice with hippocampal, medial entorhinal and sham lesions and accurately predict genotype of Alzheimer disease mouse models on an individual animal level, surpassing the performance of several gold standard cognitive tests. This technology could enable large-scale behavioural screening for genes and neural circuits underlying spatial memory and other cognitive processes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain injuries and complex motor learning suppress Olig2 in a subpopulation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells</a></h4>

              
                Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are uniformly distributed in the mammalian brain, however their function is rather heterogeneous in respect to their origin, location, receptor/channel expression and age. The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Olig2 is expressed in all OPCs as a pivotal determinant of their differentiation. Here, we identified a subset (2-26%) of OPCs lacking Olig2 in various brain regions including cortex, corpus callosum, CA1 and dentate gyrus. These Olig2 negative (Olig2neg) OPCs were enriched in the juvenile brain and decreased subsequently with age, being rarely detectable in the adult brain. However, the loss of this population was not due to apoptosis or microglia-dependent phagocytosis. Unlike Olig2pos OPCs, these subset cells could not be labelled for the mitotic marker Ki67. And, accordingly, BrdU was incorporated only by a three-day long-term labeling but not by a two-hour short pulse, suggesting these cells do not proliferate any more but were derived from proliferating OPCs. The Olig2neg OPCs exhibited a less complex morphology than Olig2pos ones. Olig2neg OPCs preferentially remain in a precursor stage rather than differentiating into highly branched oligodendrocytes. Changing the adjacent brain environment, e.g. by acute injuries or by complex motor learning tasks stimulated the transition of Olig2pos OPCs to Olig2neg cells in the adult. Taken together, our results demonstrate that OPCs transiently suppress Olig2 upon changes of the brain activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adaptive oscillators provide a hard-coded Bayesian mechanism for rhythmic inference</a></h4>

              
                Bayesian theories of perception suggest that the human brain internalizes a model of environmental patterns to reduce sensory noise and improve stimulus processing. The internalization of external regularities is particularly manifest in the time domain: humans excel at predictively synchronizing their behavior with external rhythms, as in dance or music performance. The neural processes underlying rhythmic inferences are debated: whether predictive perception relies on high-level generative models or whether it can readily be implemented locally by hard-coded intrinsic oscillators synchronizing to rhythmic input remains unclear. Here, we propose that these seemingly antagonistic accounts can be conceptually reconciled. In this view, neural oscillators may constitute hard-coded physiological priors - in a Bayesian sense - that reduce temporal uncertainty and facilitate the predictive processing of noisy rhythms. To test this, we asked human participants to track pseudo-rhythmic tone sequences and assess whether the final tone was early or late. Using a Bayesian model, we account for various aspects of participants' performance and demonstrate that the classical distinction between absolute and relative mechanisms can be unified under this framework. Next, using a dynamical systems perspective, we successfully model this behavior using an adaptive frequency oscillator which adjusts its spontaneous frequency based on the rate of stimuli. This model better reflects human behavior than a canonical nonlinear oscillator and a predictive ramping model, both widely used for temporal estimation and prediction. Our findings suggest that an oscillator may be considered useful as a potential heuristic for a rhythmic prior in the Bayesian sense. Together, the results show that adaptive oscillators provide an elegant and biologically plausible means to subserve Bayesian rhythmic inference, thereby reconciling numerous empirical observations and a priori incompatible frameworks for temporal inferential processes.

	<p>Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type II is an epileptogenic malformation of the neocortex, as well as a leading cause of drug-resistant focal epilepsy in children and young adults. The synaptic dysfunctions leading to intractable seizures in this disease appear to have a tight relationship with the immaturity of GABAergic neurotransmission. The likely outcome would include hyperpolarizing responses upon activation of GABAARs. In addition, it is well-established that neuroinflammation plays a relevant role in the pathogenesis of FCD type II. Here, we investigated whether IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, a prototypical pro-inflammatory cytokine, can influence GABAergic neurotransmission in FCD brain tissues. To this purpose, we carried out electrophysiological recordings on Xenopus oocytes transplanted with human tissues and performed a transcriptomics analysis. We found that IL-1&amp;amp;beta; decreases the GABA currents amplitude in tissue samples from adult individuals, while it potentiates GABA responses in samples from pediatric cases. Interestingly, these cases of pediatric FCD were characterized by a more depolarized EGABA and an altered transcriptomics profile, that revealed an up-regulation of chloride cotransporter NKCC1 and IL-1&amp;amp;beta;. Altogether, these results suggest that the neuroinflammatory processes and altered chloride homeostasis can contribute together to increase the brain excitability underlying the occurrence of seizures in these children.</p>

	<p>Background: We investigated, for the first time, whether there are any sex differences in retrospective self-reported childhood maltreatment (CM) in Italian adult patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BD). Furthermore, the potential impacts of patients&amp;amp;rsquo; age on the CM self-report were investigated. Methods: This retrospective study used the data documented in the electronic medical records of patients who were hospitalized for a 4-week psychiatric rehabilitation program. CM was assessed using the 28-item Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), which evaluates emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, as well as emotional and physical neglect. The linear and logistic regression models were used (&amp;amp;alpha; = 0.01). Results: Three hundred thirty-five patients with MDD (255 women and 80 men) and 168 with BD (97 women and 71 men) were included. In both samples, considerable CM rates were identified, but no statistically significant sex differences were detected in the variety of CTQ-based CM aspects. There was a significant association, with no sex differences, between increasing patients&amp;amp;rsquo; age and a decreasing burden of CM. Conclusion: Both women and men with MDD or BD experienced a similar and considerable CM burden. Our findings support routine CM assessment in psychiatric clinical practice.</p>

	<p>Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) is a multifactorial disorder strongly involving the formation of amyloid-&amp;amp;beta; (A&amp;amp;beta;) oligomers, which subsequently aggregate into the disease characteristic insoluble amyloid plaques, in addition to oxidative stress, inflammation and increased acetylcholinesterase activity. Moreover, A&amp;amp;beta; oligomers interfere with the expression and activity of Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) and Protein kinase B (PKB), also known as AKT. In the present study, the potential multimodal effect of two synthetic isatin thiosemicarbazones (ITSCs), which have been previously shown to prevent A&amp;amp;beta; aggregation was evaluated. Both compounds resulted in fully reversing the A&amp;amp;beta;-mediated toxicity in SK-NS-H cells treated with exogenous A&amp;amp;beta; peptides at various pre-incubation time points and at 1 &amp;amp;mu;M. Cell survival was not recovered when compounds were applied after A&amp;amp;beta; cell treatment. The ITSCs were non-toxic against wild type and 5xFAD primary hippocampal cells. They reversed the inhibition of Akt and GSK-3&amp;amp;beta; phosphorylation in 5xFAD cells. Finally, they exhibited good antioxidant potential and moderate lipoxygenase and acetylcholinesterase inhibition activity. Overall, these results suggest that isatin thiosemicarbazone is a suitable scaffold for the development of multimodal anti-AD agents.</p>

	<p>Glioma peritumoral brain edema (GPTBE) is a frequent complication in patients with glioma. The severity of peritumoral edema endangers patients&amp;amp;rsquo; life and prognosis. However, there are still questions concerning the process of GPTBE formation and evolution. In this study, the patients were split into two groups based on edema scoring findings in the cancer imaging archive (TCIA) comprising 186 TCGA-LGG patients. Using mRNA sequencing data, differential gene (DEG) expression analysis was performed, comparing the two groups to find the key genes affecting GPTBE. A functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes was performed. Then, a protein&amp;amp;ndash;protein interaction (PPI) network was established, and important genes were screened. Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) scores were calculated for major gene sets and comparatively correlated with immune cell infiltration. Overall survival (OS) was analyzed using the Kaplan&amp;amp;ndash;Meier curve. A total of 59 DEGs were found, with 10 of them appearing as important genes. DEGs were shown to be closely linked to inflammatory reactions. According to the network score, IL10 was in the middle of the network. The presence of the IL10 protein in glioma tissues was verified using the human protein atlas (HPA). Furthermore, the gene sets&amp;amp;rsquo; GSVA scores were favorably linked with immune infiltration, particularly, with macrophages. The high-edema group had higher GSVA scores than the low-edema group. Finally, Kaplan&amp;amp;ndash;Meier analysis revealed no differences in OS between the two groups, and eight genes were found to be related to prognosis, whereas two genes were not. GPTBE is linked to the expression of inflammatory genes.</p>

	<p>Papillary tumor of the pineal region (PTPR) is an uncommon entity in which a presurgical suspicion may be crucial for patient management. Maximal safe neurosurgical resection is of choice when PTPR is suspected, whereas non-surgical approaches can be considered in other tumors of the pineal region, such as pineocytoma or concrete subtypes of germ-cell tumors. In general terms, imaging features of tumors of the pineal region have been reported to be unspecific. Nevertheless, in this report, we describe two pathology-confirmed PTPRs in which presurgical proton MR spectroscopy demonstrated extremely high myoinositol, a pattern which drastically differs from that of other pineal tumors. We hypothesize that this high myoinositol may be related to PTPR&amp;amp;rsquo;s known ependymal component, and that it could be used as a specific non-invasive diagnostic signature.</p>

	<p>Objective: To investigate the relationship between post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) and severe post-stroke dysphagia (PSD) and explore the risk factors related to PSCI combined with severe PSD. Methods: Data from patients were collated from the rehabilitation-specific disease database. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Videofluoroscopy Swallowing Study (VFSS), Penetration-aspiration Scale (PAS), and Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) were used to evaluate cognitive and swallowing functions. Differences between groups were determined by the Pearson chi-square test (&amp;amp;chi;2) or Fisher exact test. PAS and FOIS data were analyzed with the use of the Wilcoxon rank-sum or Kruskal&amp;amp;ndash;Wallis test in the prespecified subgroup analysis. Risk factors were investigated by multivariate logistic regression. Results: A total of 1555 patients were identified with PSCI. The results indicated that patients with PSCI had a higher incidence rate of severe PSD as compared to patients without PSCI (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Patients with severe PSCI were more likely to clinically manifest oral phase dysfunction (p = 0.024), while mild PSCI patients mainly manifested pharyngeal phase dysfunction (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). There was a significant difference in FOIS score changes between subgroups during the hospitalization period (severe PSCI vs. moderate PSCI and severe PSCI vs. mild PSCI) (all p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). In addition, multivariate logistic regression revealed pneumonia (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), tracheotomy (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and dysarthria (p = 0.006) were related to PSCI, combined with severe PSD. Conclusion: PSCI may be related to severe PSD. Patients with severe PSCI were more likely to manifest oral phase dysfunction, while mild PSCI manifested pharyngeal phase dysfunction. Pneumonia, tracheotomy, and dysarthria were risk factors related to PSCI combined with severe PSD.</p>

	<p>Literature reviews appear to indicate that Music Therapy (MT) may instil a sense of empowerment and generate feelings of renewed self-confidence, distracting subjects who follow this type of intervention from negative thoughts and, generally, helping patients suffering from Anorexia Nervosa (AN) to redevelop or rediscover their identity. The purpose of the study reported in this paper is to investigate whether MT proposed before an evening meal is capable of decreasing pre-meal anxiety in adolescents suffering from AN who follow the Day-hospital Treatment Programme at the San Bortolo Hospital of Vicenza (Italy). A total of 24 patients participated voluntarily in once-weekly sessions of group-based MT conducted by a qualified music therapist over a period of six months. Before evening meals on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, pre-meal anxiety was measured using a self-report scale, and the MT group session occurred every Wednesday before the evening meal was consumed. MT activities were both active and receptive. It has been found that with respect to Mondays and Tuesdays, pre-meal anxiety was significantly lower on Wednesdays following participation in the MT group. MT is evidently capable of reducing pre-meal anxiety and may be adopted as a supportive element in treatment plans relating to patients with AN in a day-hospital treatment programme.</p>

     alt="Local targets of T-stellate cells in the ventral cochlear nucleus"/>
<p>In addition to their auditory nerve inputs, we show that T-stellate cells within a given isofrequency lamina provide a second modulatable monosynaptic excitatory input to other T-stellate cells as well as to inhibitory L- and D-stellate cells. This circuit may play a significant role in acoustic information processing. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>T-stellate cells in the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) are known to have local axon collaterals that terminate in the vicinity of their dendrites and cell bodies within the same isofrequency lamina in parallel with the auditory nerve fibers that innervate them. Excitatory synaptic connections between stellate cells within an isofrequency lamina are hypothesized to be involved in the nitric oxide-mediated upregulation of T-stellate responses to their auditory input. This could serve as a mechanism of variable gain control in the enhancement of responses to vowel spectral peaks. Previous studies have provided indirect evidence for these possible synaptic interconnections between T-stellate cells, but unequivocal identification has yet to be established. Here, we used retrograde neuronal tracing with adeno-associated viral vector or biotinylated dextran amine injected into the inferior colliculus (IC) to detect the postsynaptic target of T-stellate cells within the VCN. We show that backfilled T-stellate cell axons make monosynapatic connections on the labeled cell bodies and dendrites of other labeled T-stellate cells within an isofrequency lamina. Electron microscopy revealed that T-stellate terminals can also make synapses on structures not retrogradely labeled from the IC. Glycine antibodies combined with the viral labeling indicated that these nonbackfilled structures that the labeled T-stellate terminals were synapsing on are most likely the cell bodies and dendrites of two size categories of glycinergic VCN cells, whose sizes and relative numbers indicated they are the D- and L-stellate cells. These cells are known to provide inhibitory inputs back onto T-stellate cells. Our data indicate that, in addition to their auditory nerve input, T-stellate cells provide a second modulatable excitatory input to both inhibitory and excitatory cells in a VCN isofrequency lamina and may play a significant role in acoustic information processing.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sexual activity causes differential changes in the expression of markers of neural activation (c-Fos and ΔFosB) and neural plasticity (Arc and BDNF/trkB), as determined either by Western Blot (BDNF, trkB, Arc, and ΔFosB) or immunohistochemistry (BDNF, trkB, Arc, and c-Fos), in the hippocampus of male Roman high (RHA) and low avoidance (RLA) rats, two psychogenetically selected rat lines that display marked differences in sexual behavior (RHA rats exhibit higher sexual motivation and better copulatory performance than RLA rats). Both methods showed (with some differences) that sexual activity modifies the expression levels of these markers in the hippocampus of Roman rats depending on: (i) the level of sexual experience, that is, changes were usually more evident in sexually naïve than in experienced rats; (ii) the hippocampal partition, that is, BDNF and Arc increased in the dorsal but tended to decrease in the ventral hippocampus; (iii) the marker considered, that is, in sexually experienced animals BDNF, c-Fos, and Arc levels were similar to those of controls, while ΔFosB levels increased; and (iv) the rat line, that is, changes were usually larger in RHA than RLA rats. These findings resemble those of early studies in RHA and RLA rats showing that sexual activity influences the expression of these markers in the nucleus accumbens, medial prefrontal cortex, and ventral tegmental area, and show for the first time that also in the hippocampus sexual activity induces neural activation and plasticity, events that occur mainly during the first phase of the acquisition of sexual experience and depend on the genotypic/phenotypic characteristics of the animals.</p>

     alt="Sex-specific cannabinoid 1 receptors on GABAergic neurons in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray mediate analgesia in mice"/><p>Compared with male mice, female mice have higher expression of GABAergic CB<sub>1</sub>Rs in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG). Thereby, activation of CB<sub>1</sub>Rs disinhibits GABA-vGlut2 feedforward inhibitory circuitry, which contributes to descending pain modulation. This contribution occurs to a greater extent in female mice than in male mice, which eventually exerts more robust analgesia in females.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sex differences in analgesic effects have gradually attracted public attention in preclinical and clinical studies. Both human and animal females are more sensitive to cannabinoid antinociception than males. Expression of the cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB<sub>1</sub>R) and the function of the endocannabinoid system have been explored in both male and female mice and CB<sub>1</sub>Rs in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) participate in antinociception. However, whether there are cell-type- and sex-specific patterns of vlPAG CB<sub>1</sub>R expression that affect analgesia is unknown. In the current study, we either activated or inhibited CB<sub>1</sub>Rs in the vlPAG and found that female mice produced stronger analgesia or developed more robust mechanical allodynia than males did. Specific deletion of GABAergic CB<sub>1</sub>Rs in the vlPAG promoted stronger mechanical allodynia in female mice than that in male mice. However, no sex differences in cannabinoid antinociception were found following chemogenetic inhibition of GABAergic neurons. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we found that the sex difference in cannabinoid antinociception was due to females having higher expression of GABAergic CB<sub>1</sub>Rs in the vlPAG than males. Furthermore, activation of CB<sub>1</sub>Rs in the vlPAG significantly reduced the frequency of GABA-mediated spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents recorded in vGlut2-tdTomato positive neurons in both sexes. This effect was greater in females than males and this reduction was closely related to CB<sub>1</sub>R expression difference between sexes. Our work indicates that vlPAG GABAergic CB<sub>1</sub>Rs modulate cannabinoid-mediated analgesia in a sex-specific manner, which may provide a potential explanation of sex difference found in the analgesic effect of cannabinoids.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distributing task-related neural activity across a cortical networkthrough task-independent connections</a></h4>

              
                Task-related neural activity is widespread across populations of neurons during goal-directed behaviors. However, little is known about the synaptic reorganization and circuit mechanisms that lead to broad activity changes. Here we trained a limited subset of neurons in a spiking network with strong synaptic interactions to reproduce the activity of neurons in the motor cortex during a decision-making task. We found that task-related activity, resembling the neural data, emerged across the network, even in the untrained neurons. Analysis of trained networks showed that strong untrained synapses, which were independent of the task and determined the dynamical state of the network, mediated the spread of task-related activity. Optogenetic perturbations suggest that the motor cortex is strongly-coupled, supporting the applicability of the mechanism to cortical networks. Our results reveal a cortical mechanism that facilitates distributed representations of task-variables by spreading the activity from a subset of plastic neurons to the entire network through task-independent strong synapses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Generating New Musical Preferences from Hierarchical Mapping of Predictions to Reward</a></h4>

              
                Prediction learning is considered a fundamental feature of biological systems that underlies perception, action, and reward. For cultural artifacts like music, isolating the genesis of reward from prediction is challenging, since predictions are acquired implicitly throughout life. Here, we examined the trajectory of listeners preferences for melodies in a novel musical scale, where local and global predictions were independently manipulated. Across seven studies (n = 842 total) in two cultures, participants preferred melodies that were presented more during exposure (globally predictable) and that followed schematic expectations (locally predictable). Learning trajectories depended on music reward sensitivity. Furthermore, fMRI showed that while auditory cortical activation reflects predictions, functional connectivity between auditory and reward areas encodes preference. The results are the first to show a hierarchical, relatively culturally-independent process by which predictions map onto reward. Collectively, our findings propose a novel mechanism by which the human brain links predictions with reward value.

                Microglia are the brains resident immune cells, performing surveillance to promote homeostasis and healthy functioning. While chemical signaling in microglia is well-studied, the mechanical cues regulating their function are less well-understood. Here, we investigate the role of the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1 in microglia migration, pro-inflammatory cytokine production and stiffness sensing. We demonstrated the functional expression of Piezo1 in microglia and identified genes whose expression was affected by conditional Piezo1 knockout in transgenic mice. Functional assays revealed that Piezo1-deficiency in microglia enhanced migration towards amyloid {beta}-protein, and decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines produced upon stimulation by lipopolysaccharide, both in vitro and in vivo. The phenomenon could be mimicked or reversed using a Piezo1-specific agonist or antagonist. Finally, we also showed that Piezo1 mediated the effect of substrate stiffness-induced migration and cytokine expression. Altogether, we show that Piezo1 is an important molecular mediator for microglia, its activation modulating their migration and immune responses.

                SignificanceIn vivo imaging and electrophysiology are powerful tools to explore neuronal function that each offer unique complementary information with advantages and limitations. Capturing both data types from the same neural population in the freely moving animal would allow researchers to take advantage of the capabilities of both modalities and further understand how they relate to each other.

AimHere we present a head-mounted neural implant suitable for in vivo two-photon imaging of neuronal activity with simultaneous extracellular electrical recording in head-fixed or freely moving animals.

ApproachA GRIN lens-based head-mounted neural implant with extracellular electrical recording provided by tetrodes on the periphery of the GRIN lens was chronically implanted. The design of the neural implant allows for recording from head-fixed animals, as well as freely moving animals by coupling the imaging system to a coherent imaging fiber bundle.

ResultsWe demonstrate simultaneous two-photon imaging of GCaMP and extracellular electrophysiology of neural activity in awake head-fixed, and freely moving mice. Using the collected information, we perform correlation analysis to reveal positive correlation between optical and local field potential recordings.

ConclusionSimultaneously recording neural activity using both optical and electrical methods provides complementary information from each modality. Designs that can provide such bimodal recording in freely moving animals allow for the investigation of neural activity underlying a broader range of behavioral paradigms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Two types of motor inhibition after action errors in humans</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive behavior requires the ability to appropriately react to action errors. Post-error slowing of response times (PES) is one of the most reliable phenomena in cognitive neuroscience. It has been proposed that PES is partially achieved through inhibition of the motor system. However, there is no direct evidence for this link - or indeed, that the motor system is physiologically inhibited after errors altogether. Here, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation and electromyography to measure cortico-spinal excitability (CSE) across four experiments using a Simon task, in which human participants sometimes committed errors. Errors were followed by reduced CSE at two different time points, and in two different modes. Shortly after error commission (250ms) CSE was broadly suppressed - i.e., even task-unrelated motor effectors were inhibited. During the preparation of the subsequent response, CSE was specifically reduced at task-related effectors only. This latter effect was directly related to PES, with stronger CSE suppression accompanying greater PES. This suggests that PES is achieved through increased inhibitory control during post-error responses. To provide converging evidence, we then re-analyzed an openly-available EEG dataset that contained both Simon- and Stop-signal tasks using independent component analysis. We found that the same neural source component that indexed action-cancellation in the stop-signal task also showed clear PES-related activity during post-error responses in the Simon task. Together, these findings provide clear evidence that post-error adaptation is partially achieved through motor inhibition. Moreover, inhibition is engaged in two modes (first non-selective, then selective), aligning with recent multi-stage theories of error processing.

	<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system with features of demyelination and axonal degeneration at a young age. Genetic factors may play an important role in the development of multiple sclerosis. (1) Objective: To investigate IL-10 rs1800871, rs1800872, rs1800896, and IL-10 serum levels in patients with multiple sclerosis. (2) Methods: Our study included patients with multiple sclerosis (n = 127) and healthy volunteers (n = 195). The subjects&amp;amp;rsquo; DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes and genotyped by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The results were analyzed using the program &amp;amp;ldquo;IBM SPSS Statistics 27.0&amp;amp;rdquo;. (3) Results: The IL-10 SNPs were analyzed between the MS and control groups; however, no statistically significant results were found. The serum levels of IL-10 in the groups of MS and healthy subjects were not statistically significantly different (median (IQR): 0.828 (1.533) vs. 0.756 (0.528), p = 0.872). (4) Conclusion:&amp;amp;nbsp;IL-10 rs1800871, rs1800872, and rs1800896 and serum IL-10 levels are not likely to be associated with MS development. However, individuals carrying the rare haplotypes of rs1800871, rs1800872, and rs1800896 were associated with increased odds of MS (p = 0.006).</p>

	<p>Many research methods applied in molecular neuroscience require the collection of hippocampal samples, but a still poorly recognized problem is contamination with the choroid plexus during brain dissection. Because of a distinct pattern of gene expression, its inclusion in brain samples can obscure or even confound conclusions drawn from molecular studies. Therefore, we tested our dissection method designed for removal of tissue contamination using expression of the transthyretin gene (Ttr) as a marker of the choroid plexus. Additionally, we also validated dissection of the entire hippocampus into its dorsal, intermediate and ventral subdivisions using the expression of Trhr and Lct genes as molecular markers of anatomical subdivisions. The PCR analysis showed that Ttr is expressed at a residual level in hippocampal samples that display an mRNA level several hundred lower than the adjacent control tissue colocalized with the choroid plexus. This indicates that the applied method for dissecting the hippocampus from a fresh brain allows for replicable removal of the majority of choroid plexus from hippocampal samples. In turn, differences in expression of Lct and Trhr confirmed the proper dissection of dorsal, intermediate and ventral subdivisions from fresh brain tissue. Therefore, a special emphasis on the removal of tissue contamination and avoidance of tissue distortions makes our protocol especially suitable for molecular experiments performed either on the entire hippocampus or its subdivisions.</p>

	<p>Brain asymmetry is connected with motor performance, suggesting that hemiparetic patients have different gait patterns depending on the side of the lesion. This retrospective cohort study aims to further investigate the difference between right and left hemiplegia in order to assess whether the injured side can influence the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s clinical characteristics concerning gait, thus providing insights for new personalized rehabilitation strategies. The data from 33 stroke patients (17 with left and 16 with right hemiplegia) were retrospectively compared with each other and with a control group composed of 20 unaffected age-matched individuals. The 3D gait analysis was used to assess kinematic data and spatio-temporal parameters. Compared to left hemiplegic patients, right hemiplegic patients showed worse spatio-temporal parameters (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) and better kinematic parameters (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Both pathological groups were characterized by abnormal gait parameters in comparison with the control group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). These findings show an association between the side of the lesion&amp;amp;mdash;right or left&amp;amp;mdash;and the different stroke patients&amp;amp;rsquo; gait patterns: left hemiplegic patients show better spatio-temporal parameters, whereas right hemiplegic patients show better segmentary motor performances. Therefore, further studies may develop and assess new personalized rehabilitation strategies considering the injured hemisphere and brain asymmetry.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Evidence for Independent Processing of Shape by Vision and Touch</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Although visual object recognition is well studied and relatively well understood, much less is known about how shapes are recognized by touch and how such haptic stimuli might be compared with visual shapes. One might expect that the processes of visual and haptic object recognition engage similar brain structures given the advantages of avoiding redundant brain circuitry and indeed there is some evidence that this is the case. A potentially fruitful approach to understanding the differences in how shapes might be neurally represented is to find an algorithmic method of comparing shapes, which agrees with human behavior and determines whether that method differs between different modality conditions. If not, it would provide further evidence for a shared representation of shape. We recruited human participants to perform a one-back same&ndash;different visual and haptic shape comparison task both within (i.e., comparing two visual shapes or two haptic shapes) and across (i.e., comparing visual with haptic shapes) modalities. We then used various shape metrics to predict performance based on the shape, orientation, and modality of the two stimuli that were being compared on each trial. We found that the metrics that best predict shape comparison behavior heavily depended on the modality of the two shapes, suggesting differences in which features are used for comparing shapes depending on modality and that object recognition is not necessarily performed in a single, modality-agnostic region.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Size regulation of multiple organelles competing for a limiting subunit pool</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Deb Sankar Banerjee, Shiladitya Banerjee</p>

How cells regulate the size of intracellular structures and organelles is a longstanding question. Recent experiments suggest that size control of intracellular structures is achieved through the depletion of a limiting subunit pool in the cytoplasm. While the limiting pool model ensures organelle-to-cell size scaling, it does not provide a mechanism for robust size control of multiple co-existing structures. Here we develop a generalized theory for size-dependent growth of intracellular structures to demonstrate that robust size control of multiple intracellular structures, competing for a limiting subunit pool, is achieved via a negative feedback between the growth rate and the size of the individual structure. This design principle captures size maintenance of a wide variety of subcellular structures, from cytoskeletal filaments to three-dimensional organelles. We identify the feedback motifs for structure size regulation based on known molecular processes, and compare our theory to existing models of size regulation in biological assemblies. Furthermore, we show that positive feedback between structure size and growth rate can lead to bistable size distribution and spontaneous size selection.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Systematic perturbation of an artificial neural network: A step towards quantifying causal contributions in the brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kayson Fakhar, Claus C. Hilgetag</p>

Lesion inference analysis is a fundamental approach for characterizing the causal contributions of neural elements to brain function. This approach has gained new prominence through the arrival of modern perturbation techniques with unprecedented levels of spatiotemporal precision. While inferences drawn from brain perturbations are conceptually powerful, they face methodological difficulties. Particularly, they are challenged to disentangle the true causal contributions of the involved elements, since often functions arise from coalitions of distributed, interacting elements, and localized perturbations have unknown global consequences. To elucidate these limitations, we systematically and exhaustively lesioned a small artificial neural network (ANN) playing a classic arcade game. We determined the functional contributions of all nodes and links, contrasting results from sequential single-element perturbations with simultaneous perturbations of multiple elements. We found that lesioning individual elements, one at a time, produced biased results. By contrast, multi-site lesion analysis captured crucial details that were missed by single-site lesions. We conclude that even small and seemingly simple ANNs show surprising complexity that needs to be addressed by multi-lesioning for a coherent causal characterization.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Metastable spiking networks in the replica-mean-field limit</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Luyan Yu, Thibaud O. Taillefumier</p>

Characterizing metastable neural dynamics in finite-size spiking networks remains a daunting challenge. We propose to address this challenge in the recently introduced replica-mean-field (RMF) limit. In this limit, networks are made of infinitely many replicas of the finite network of interest, but with randomized interactions across replicas. Such randomization renders certain excitatory networks fully tractable at the cost of neglecting activity correlations, but with explicit dependence on the finite size of the neural constituents. However, metastable dynamics typically unfold in networks with mixed inhibition and excitation. Here, we extend the RMF computational framework to point-process-based neural network models with exponential stochastic intensities, allowing for mixed excitation and inhibition. Within this setting, we show that metastable finite-size networks admit multistable RMF limits, which are fully characterized by stationary firing rates. Technically, these stationary rates are determined as the solutions of a set of delayed differential equations under certain regularity conditions that any physical solutions shall satisfy. We solve this original problem by combining the resolvent formalism and singular-perturbation theory. Importantly, we find that these rates specify probabilistic pseudo-equilibria which accurately capture the neural variability observed in the original finite-size network. We also discuss the emergence of metastability as a stochastic bifurcation, which can be interpreted as a static phase transition in the RMF limits. In turn, we expect to leverage the static picture of RMF limits to infer purely dynamical features of metastable finite-size networks, such as the transition rates between pseudo-equilibria.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Integrated view and comparative analysis of baseline protein expression in mouse and rat tissues</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shengbo Wang, David García-Seisdedos, Ananth Prakash, Deepti Jaiswal Kundu, Andrew Collins, Nancy George, Silvie Fexova, Pablo Moreno, Irene Papatheodorou, Andrew R. Jones, Juan Antonio Vizcaíno</p>

The increasingly large amount of proteomics data in the public domain enables, among other applications, the combined analyses of datasets to create comparative protein expression maps covering different organisms and different biological conditions. Here we have reanalysed public proteomics datasets from mouse and rat tissues (14 and 9 datasets, respectively), to assess baseline protein abundance. Overall, the aggregated dataset contained 23 individual datasets, including a total of 211 samples coming from 34 different tissues across 14 organs, comprising 9 mouse and 3 rat strains, respectively.
In all cases, we studied the distribution of canonical proteins between the different organs. The number of canonical proteins per dataset ranged from 273 (tendon) and 9,715 (liver) in mouse, and from 101 (tendon) and 6,130 (kidney) in rat. Then, we studied how protein abundances compared across different datasets and organs for both species. As a key point we carried out a comparative analysis of protein expression between mouse, rat and human tissues. We observed a high level of correlation of protein expression among orthologs between all three species in brain, kidney, heart and liver samples, whereas the correlation of protein expression was generally slightly lower between organs within the same species. Protein expression results have been integrated into the resource Expression Atlas for widespread dissemination.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Active inference unifies intentional and conflict-resolution imperatives of motor control</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Antonella Maselli, Pablo Lanillos, Giovanni Pezzulo</p>

The field of motor control has long focused on the achievement of external goals through action (e.g., reaching and grasping objects). However, recent studies in conditions of multisensory conflict, such as when a subject experiences the rubber hand illusion or embodies an avatar in virtual reality, reveal the presence of unconscious movements that are not goal-directed, but rather aim at resolving multisensory conflicts; for example, by aligning the position of a person’s arm with that of an embodied avatar. This second, conflict-resolution imperative of movement control did not emerge in classical studies of motor adaptation and online corrections, which did not allow movements to reduce the conflicts; and has been largely ignored so far in formal theories. Here, we propose a model of movement control grounded in the theory of active inference that integrates <i>intentional</i> and <i>conflict-resolution</i> imperatives. We present three simulations showing that the active inference model is able to characterize movements guided by the intention to achieve an external goal, by the necessity to resolve multisensory conflict, or both. Furthermore, our simulations reveal a fundamental difference between the (active) inference underlying <i>intentional</i> and <i>conflict-resolution</i> imperatives by showing that it is driven by two different (model and sensory) kinds of prediction errors. Finally, our simulations show that when movement is only guided by conflict resolution, the model incorrectly infers that is velocity is zero, as if it was not moving. This result suggests a novel speculative explanation for the fact that people are unaware of their subtle compensatory movements to avoid multisensory conflict. Furthermore, it can potentially help shed light on deficits of motor awareness that arise in psychopathological conditions.

Being able to see the beauty of this world is a wonderful thing unfortunately unavailable to people with inherited blindness. In this issue of PLOS Biology, Mercey and colleagues present optimized expansion microscopy for retinal tissue, which represents a huge step forward in our ability to study these blinding conditions.

This Primer explores a PLOS Biology study which uses ultrastructure expansion microscopy to study the inner scaffold of the photoreceptor connecting cilium, the location of multiple proteins implicated in inherited forms of progressive sight loss such as retinitis pigmentosa and Leber congenital amaurosis.

                Foodborne pathogens represent a significant cause of negative impacts on human health and the economy worldwide. Unfortunately, information about epidemiological insights in Latin American countries is scarce. The consumption of ready-to-eat street food in Ecuador is extensive, and information about the presence of foodborne pathogens, their virulence factors, and antimicrobial resistance is negligible. This data includes the occurrence, phenotypic antibiotic resistance profiles, and antibiotic resistance genes of Enterobacterales isolated from ready-to-eat street food in Ambato, central Ecuador during 2020 and 2021. The most common genera detected were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and Cronobacter spp. Agar disk diffusion assays were performed to determine their phenotypic resistance. The presence of antibiotic resistance genes conferring resistance against colistin, β-Lactams, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones, and amphenicols was detected via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Educating delinquent youths: A qualitative approach to understand the Malaysian story [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This paper reports on the first stage of a larger research project on the education of delinquent youths in Malaysia. Specifically, this paper addresses the challenges of educating delinquent youths in the country. As a developing nation, Malaysia faces various issues pertaining social and youth development. The question explored in this study is whether delinquent youths in Malaysia are neglected in terms of systematic and adequate education. In Malaysia, delinquent youths are sent to correctional facilities all around the country, where they are separated from school systems, their families and communities; it can be argued that these youths are deprived of moral support from society. This paper aims to identify the challenges around educating delinquent youths in Malaysia and to recommend potential solutions to these challenges. Methods: The research approaches adopted for this paper included content analysis of printed documents and preliminary informal interviews with the staff at one correctional facility. Content analysis data were gathered from departmental and government documents made public as well as past research on delinquent youths. Meanwhile, a curtesy visit was made to a correctional facility in Kuala Lumpur to obtain preliminary input into the education and training provided at the facility. Results: The authors found that there are three main challenges to sufficiently educating delinquent youths in Malaysia. These include unclear policy on the education of youths at correctional facilities; the lack of frameworks facilitating the education of these youths; and the lack of awareness and understanding on the need for educating these youths, despite their behaviors. Conclusions: The paper ends with two solutions to these challenges and future directions for the education of delinquent youths in Malaysia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Brain structural abnormalities in six major psychiatric disorders: shared variation and network perspectives [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Common brain abnormalities are a possible explanation for comorbidities in psychiatric disorders. Challenges in understanding these conditions are likely due to the paucity of studies able to analyze the extent and regional distribution of shared morphometric abnormalities between disorders. Recently, Opeal et al. presented an elegant rationale to investigate shared and specific morphometric measures of cortical thickness and subcortical gray matter volume between healthy individuals and subjects across six major psychiatric disorders. Although their approach has the potential to systematically portray shared brain alterations, the chosen principal component analysis solution may not address the central question of the observed shared versus specific brain alterations due to misspecification of the number of components. Given how this misspecification can lead to different conclusions, we reanalyzed Opel et al. data to thoroughly determine the number of factors to be considered, explore the alternative solution, and visualize the patterns of shared brain matter correlations using network analysis. Our approach suggests that a unidimensional solution was appropriate in this situation. The unidimensional solution indicated that brain alterations in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) had a significant negative component loading, suggesting that brain abnormalities found in ASD covaried with major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), schizophrenia (SCZ), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), a finding not demonstrated by the original work. Network analysis indicated that SCZ had the highest strength, BD the highest closeness, and BD and MDD had the highest betweenness in the network. This work highlights how different component solutions can lead to different conclusions, with important implications for the understanding of overlapped patterns of symptoms among six major psychiatric diseases. The network approach is complementary in indicating central markers of specific psychopathology domains. Investigations using shared-variation and network perspectives are promising for the study of pathophysiological patterns of common brain alterations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cre/lox regulated conditional rescue and inactivation with zebrafish UFlip alleles generated by CRISPR-Cas9 targeted integration</a></h4>

              
                The ability to regulate gene activity spatially and temporally is essential to investigate cell type-specific gene function during development and in postembryonic processes and disease models. The Cre/<i>lox</i> system has been widely used for performing cell and tissue-specific conditional analysis of gene function in zebrafish. However, simple and efficient methods for isolation of stable, Cre/<i>lox</i> regulated zebrafish alleles are lacking. Here we applied our GeneWeld CRISPR-Cas9 targeted integration strategy to generate floxed alleles that provide robust conditional inactivation and rescue. A universal targeting vector, UFlip, with sites for cloning short homology arms flanking a floxed 2A-mRFP gene trap, was integrated into an intron in <i>rbbp4</i> and <i>rb1</i>. <i>rbbp4<sup>off</sup></i> and <i>rb1<sup>off</sup></i> integration alleles resulted in strong mRFP expression, &gt;99% reduction of endogenous gene expression, and recapitulated known indel loss of function phenotypes. Introduction of Cre led to stable inversion of the floxed cassette, loss of mRFP expression, and phenotypic rescue. <i>rbbp4<sup>on</sup></i> and <i>rb1<sup>on</sup></i> integration alleles did not cause phenotypes in combination with a loss of function mutation. Addition of Cre led to conditional inactivation by stable inversion of the cassette, gene trapping and mRFP expression, and the expected mutant phenotype. Neural progenitor Cre drivers were used for conditional inactivation and phenotypic rescue to showcase how this approach can be used in specific cell populations. Together these results validate a simplified approach for efficient isolation of Cre/<i>lox</i> responsive conditional alleles in zebrafish. Our strategy provides a new toolkit for generating genetic mosaics and represents a significant advance in zebrafish genetics.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Functional requirements for a Samd14-capping protein complex in stress erythropoiesis</a></h4>

              
                Acute anemia induces rapid expansion of erythroid precursors and accelerated differentiation to replenish erythrocytes. Paracrine signals involving cooperation between SCF/Kit signaling and other signaling inputs are required for the increased erythroid precursor activity in anemia. Our prior work revealed that the Sterile Alpha Motif (SAM) Domain 14 (<i>Samd14</i>) gene increases the regenerative capacity of the erythroid system in a mouse genetic model and promotes stress-dependent Kit signaling. However, the mechanism underlying Samd14's role in stress erythropoiesis is unknown. We identified a protein-protein interaction between Samd14 and the α- and β heterodimers of the F-actin capping protein (CP) complex. Knockdown of the CP β subunit increased erythroid maturation in murine ex vivo cultures and decreased colony forming potential of stress erythroid precursors. In a genetic complementation assay for Samd14 activity, our results revealed that the Samd14-CP interaction is a determinant of erythroid precursor cell levels and function. Samd14-CP promotes SCF/Kit signaling in CD71<sup>med</sup> spleen erythroid precursors. Given the roles of Kit signaling in hematopoiesis and Samd14 in Kit pathway activation, this mechanism may have pathological implications in acute/chronic anemia.

                Familial Dysautonomia (FD) is a sensory and autonomic neuropathy caused by mutations in <i>Elongator complex protein 1</i> (<i>ELP1</i>). FD patients have small trigeminal nerves and impaired facial pain and temperature perception. These signals are relayed by nociceptive neurons in the trigeminal ganglion, a structure comprised of both neural crest- and placode-derived cells. Mice lacking <i>Elp1</i> in neural crest derivatives ('<i>Elp1</i> CKO') are born with small trigeminal ganglia, suggesting Elp1 is important for trigeminal ganglion development, yet the function of Elp1 in this context is unknown. We demonstrate that Elp1, expressed in both neural crest- and placode-derived neurons, is not required for initial trigeminal ganglion formation. However, <i>Elp1</i> CKO trigeminal neurons exhibit abnormal axon outgrowth and deficient target innervation. Developing nociceptors expressing the receptor TrkA undergo early apoptosis in <i>Elp1</i> CKO, while TrkB- and TrkC-expressing neurons are spared, indicating Elp1 supports the target innervation and survival of trigeminal nociceptors. Further, we demonstrate that specific TrkA deficits in the Elp1 CKO trigeminal ganglion reflect the neural crest lineage of most TrkA neurons, versus the placodal lineage of most TrkB and TrkC neurons. Altogether, these findings explain defects in cranial gangliogenesis that may lead to loss of facial pain and temperature sensation in FD.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Obligate sexual reproduction of a homothallic fungus closely related to the Cryptococcus pathogenic species complex</a></h4>

              
                Sexual reproduction is a ubiquitous and ancient trait of eukaryotic life. While sexual organisms are usually faced with the challenge of finding a compatible mating partner, species as diverse as animals, plants, and fungi have repeatedly evolved the ability to reproduce sexually without an obligate requirement for another individual. Here, we uncovered the underlying mechanism of self-compatibility (homothallism) in <i>Cryptococcus depauperatus</i>, a fungal species sister to the clinically relevant human fungal pathogens <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> and <i>Cryptococcus gattii</i> species complexes. In contrast to <i>C. neoformans</i> or <i>C. gattii</i>, which grow as a yeast in the asexual stage, and produce hyphae, basidia, and infectious spores during the sexual stage, <i>C. depauperatus</i> grows exclusively as hyphae decorated with basidia and abundant spores and appears to be continuously engaged in sexual reproduction. By combining the insights from comparative genomics and genetic analyses of mutants defective in key mating and meiosis genes, we demonstrate the sexual cycle of <i>C. depauperatus</i> involves meiosis, and reveal that self-compatibility is orchestrated by the expression, in the same cell, of an unlinked mating receptor (Ste3a) and pheromone ligand (MFa) pair seemingly derived from opposite mating types of a heterothallic (self-sterile) ancestor. We identified a putative mating-type (<i>MAT</i>) determining region containing genes phylogenetically aligned with <i>MAT</i>&lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt; alleles of other species, and a few <i>MAT</i>a gene alleles scattered and unlinked throughout the genome, but no homologs of the mating-type homeodomain genes <i>SXI1</i> (<i>HD1</i>) and <i>SXI2</i> (<i>HD2</i>). Comparative genomic analyses suggested a dramatic remodeling of the <i>MAT</i> locus possibly owing to reduced selective constraints to maintain mating-type genes in tight linkage, associated with a transition to self-fertility. Our findings support <i>C. depauperatus</i> as an obligately sexual, homothallic fungal species and provide additional insight into the repeated transitions between modes of sexual reproduction that have occurred throughout the fungal kingdom.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Convergent mosaic brain evolution is associated with the evolution of novel electrosensory systems in teleost fishes</a></h4>

              
                Brain region size generally scales allometrically with brain size, but mosaic shifts in brain region size independent of brain size have been found in several lineages and may be related to the evolution of behavioral novelty. African weakly electric fishes (Mormyroidea) evolved a mosaically enlarged cerebellum and hindbrain, yet the relationship to their behaviorally novel electrosensory system remains unclear. We addressed this by studying South American weakly electric fishes (Gymnotiformes) and weakly electric catfishes (<i>Synodontis</i> spp.), which evolved varying aspects of electrosensory systems, independent of mormyroids. If the mormyroid mosaic increases are related to evolving an electrosensory system, we should find similar mosaic shifts in gymnotiforms and <i>Synodontis</i>. Using micro-computed tomography scans, we quantified brain region scaling for multiple electrogenic, electroreceptive, and non-electrosensing species. We found mosaic increases in cerebellum in all three electrogenic lineages relative to non-electric lineages and mosaic increases in torus semicircularis and hindbrain associated with the evolution of electrogenesis and electroreceptor type. These results show that evolving novel electrosensory systems is repeatedly and independently associated with changes in the sizes of individual major brain regions independent of brain size, suggesting that selection can impact structural brain composition to favor specific regions involved in novel behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Arousal state dependence of the cortical blood volume - pupil diameter relationship</a></h4>

              
                Arousal state profoundly affects neural activity and vascular dynamics in the cortex, with sleep causing large changes in local field potentials (LFP) and increases in blood flow. Here we investigate how arousal state dictates the relationship between external measures of arousal, pupil diameter and blink rate, with neural activity and blood volume in the somatosensory cortex in both male and female head-fixed mice and determine whether optical measures of pupil diameter can accurately predict arousal state for classifying of neural data. Pupil diameter was consistently smaller during REM and NREM sleep than in the awake state. Pupil diameter changes were coherent with both changes in blood volume and gamma-band power in the somatosensory cortex, but the strength and sign of this relationship varied with behavioral state. We observed a strong negative correlation between pupil diameter and both blood volume and gamma-band power during periods of rest and sleep, though the correlations between pupil diameter and blood volume became positive during periods of alertness and active whisking, consistent with fidgeting and other body motions driving vasodilation in the somatosensory cortex. Blinking was associated with increases in arousal, and subsequent large decreases in blood volume when the mouse was asleep. Coherence of bilateral measures of gamma-band power and blood volume dropped immediately following a blink, indicating a 'reset' of vascular and neural activity. Using only pupil diameter, we could determine if the mouse is awake or asleep with high accuracy with a temporal resolution of seconds. Our results demonstrate a very strong reciprocal relationship between pupil diameter and hemodynamics signals in unanesthetized mice, reflecting the pronounced effects of arousal on cerebrovascular dynamics.

                Memory deficits are a hallmark of many different neurological and psychiatric conditions. The Rey-Osterrieth complex figure (ROCF) is the state-of-the-art assessment tool for neuropsychologists across the globe to assess the degree of non-verbal visual memory deterioration. To obtain a score, a trained clinician inspects a patient's ROCF drawing and quantifies deviations from the original figure. This manual procedure is time-consuming, slow and scores vary depending on the clinician's experience, motivation and tiredness. Here, we leverage novel deep learning architectures to automatize the rating of memory deficits. For this, a multi-head convolutional neural network was trained on 20225 ROCF drawings. Unbiased ground truth ROCF scores were obtained from crowdsourced human intelligence. The neural network outperforms both online raters and clinicians. Our AI-powered scoring system provides healthcare institutions worldwide with a digital tool to assess objectively, reliably and time-efficiently the performance in the ROCF test from hand-drawn images.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Not only perception but also grasping actions obey Weber's law</a></h4>

              
                Weber's law, the principle that the uncertainty of perceptual estimates increases proportionally with object size, is regularly violated when considering the uncertainty of the grip aperture during grasping movements. The origins of this perception-action dissociation are debated and are attributed to various reasons, including different coding of visual size information for perception and action, biomechanical factors, the use of positional information to guide grasping, or, sensorimotor calibration. Here, we contrasted these accounts and compared perceptual and grasping uncertainties by asking people to indicate the visually perceived center of differently sized objects (Perception condition) or to grasp and lift the same objects with the requirement to achieve a balanced lift (Action condition). We found that the variability (uncertainty) of contact positions increased as a function of object size in both perception and action. The adherence of the Action condition to Weber's law and the consequent absence of a perception-action dissociation contradict the predictions based on different coding of visual size information and sensorimotor calibration. These findings provide clear evidence that human perceptual and visuomotor systems rely on the same visual information and suggest that the previously reported violations of Weber's law in grasping movements should be attributed to other factors.

                Neurons and astrocytes derived from Alzheimers Disease (AD) patient induced pluripotent stem cells are an evolving technology used to study the pathogenesis and etiology of AD. As the utility of mouse models of AD are increasingly coming into questions, using iPSC technology may offer an opportunity to study this disease with human substrates. Herein, we using a hypothesis generating platform, the PamGene12 Kinome Array, to identify core protein kinases in neurons and astrocytes derived from familial AD patient iPSCs. We identified five core protein kinases in these cells and examined the pathways in which they are enriched. Importantly, we complement our findings using an in-silico approach with postmortem AD brain datasets. While these protein kinases have been conceptualized in the context of traditional AD pathology, they have not been explored in the context of aberrant signaling in the pathophysiology of the disease.

                Primary cilia are microtubule-based signaling organelles present in the plasma membrane of most cell types, including mature astrocytes and neurons. However, little is known about the role of this organelle in the mature brain. Data from our lab show that neuronal primary cilia (nPC) is required for soluble amyloid beta oligomer signaling and modulation of autophagy, and that these events are age dependent. Here, we hypothesize that astrocytes react to the loss of nPC and that aging might impact these events. For that purpose, we have characterized morphological changes in astrocytes as well as in the cilium and autophagy of these cells in brain tissue from young and old mice with impaired PC in neurons. Our results show that upon loss of PC in neurons astrocytes become reactive and reduce their lysosomal capacity, an effect that is reinforced with aging. Moreover, aging reduced the pool of ciliated astrocytes, which might impact their ability to react to extracellular events. Overall, our data suggest that the PC might act an intermediary in the communication between astrocytes and neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Axo-vascular coupling mediated by oligodendrocytes</a></h4>

              
                The high energy requirements of the cortical gray matter are met by the precise cooperation of neurons, glia, and vascular cells in a process known as neurovascular coupling (NVC). In contrast, the existence and significance of NVC in white matter (WM) are still debated and basic regulatory mechanisms are unknown. We recently discovered that oligodendrocytes sense the spiking axons' activity via NMDA receptors and regulate their cell surface expression of glucose transporter GLUT1 allowing an increase in glycolytic metabolism that enables lactate release to metabolically support the axons. Here, we show for the mouse optic nerve (ON), a model WM tract, that the vascular support is also dynamically controlled. Axonal spiking activity induces small vessel dilations which are sustained for more than 20 minutes upon the ending of electrical stimulation. Pharmacological inhibition shows that the electrically evoked dilation is mediated by the prostaglandin E2 receptor EP4 and can be modulated by the oxygen concentration, as has been shown in the grey matter. Importantly, we found in ONs from conditional mouse mutants that oligodendroglial NMDA receptors are required for this type of neurovascular response, demonstrating a critical role of oligodendrocytes in coupling axonal activity to pericyte function. Reminiscent of NVC in cortical slices, the 'axo-vascular' response is slower and may represent a more rudimentary form of neurovascular coupling.

                Background: Targeting the renin angiotensin system, especially with angiotensin receptor II blockers (ARB), and related vascular dysfunction is a promising therapeutic intervention for cognitive impairment including Alzheimers Disease (AD). The underlying mechanisms of the effects of ARB is unclear. This study sought to examine if treatment with candesartan, an ARB, affects neurobehavioral manifestation and the underlying neuro- and vascular mechanisms in male and female TgF344-AD rats. Methods: Candesartan or vehicle was administered to TgF344-AD rats (n=127) daily from 12-months to 18-months of age. Behavioral assays (spontaneous alternation test, novel object recognition, water radial arm maze) and neuropathologic assessment were completed along with brain proteome and measures of contractility in 12- and 18-month rat brains. Results: Untreated 18-month TgF344-AD showed impairments in learning and increased perseverative working memory errors on the water radial arm maze (WRAM). These behavioral changes were corrected with candesartan treatment in female rats only. Treatment with candesartan was also associated with improved vascular reactivity and reduced blood pressure in both wild type and TgF344-AD male and female rats. Although there was no effect on amyloid-{beta} treatment with candesartan reduced whole brain clusterin, an AD-risk associated protein, and GFAP in female TgF344-AD. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that candesartan administered in the early stages of AD has a sexual dimorphic response in Tgf344-AD rat, where it reduced cognitive disturbances only in female TgF344-AD rat. These effects appear to be independent of changes in blood pressure and amyloid-{beta} reduction and are likely mediated through mechanisms related to clusterin and GFAP pathways.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Measuring brain critical dynamics to inform Brain-Computer Interfaces</a></h4>

              
                The reconfiguration of large-scale interactions among multiple brain regions underpins complex behavior. It manifests in bursts of activations, called neuronal avalanches, which can be tracked non-invasively as they expand across the brain. Responding to a new task requires brain regions to appropriately reconfigure their interactions, which might in turn affect the path of propagation of neuronal avalanches, providing a readily-accessible read out of the processes sustaining behavior. As such, neuronal avalanche measures constitute natural candidates to design brain-computer interfaces. To test this hypothesis, we used source-reconstructed magneto/electroencephalography, comparing resting-state to motor imagery conditions during a BCI protocol. For each experimental condition, we computed an individual avalanche transition matrix, to track the probability that an avalanche would spread across any two regions. Then, we selected those edges whose transition probabilities significantly differed between conditions, at the individual level and in the majority of the participants. We found a robust topography of the edges that were affected by the execution of the task, which mainly hinge upon the premotor regions. Furthermore, we related the individual differences to the task performance, showing that significant correlations are predominantly positive and involve edges connecting pre/motor regions to parietal ones. Our results show that the pattern of propagation of large-scale perturbations are related to behavior, and that they can be used to optimize brain-computer interfaces.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Automatic Sleep Stage Classification with Optimized Selection of EEG Channels</a></h4>

              
                Visual inspection of Polysomnography (PSG) recordings by sleep experts based on established guidelines has been the gold standard in sleep stage classification. This approach is expensive, time consuming and mostly limited to experimental research and clinical cases of major sleep disorders. Various automatic approaches to sleep scoring have been emerging in the past years and are opening the way to a quick computational assessment of sleep architecture that may find its way to the clinics. With the hope to make sleep scoring a fully automated process in the clinics, we report here an ensemble algorithm that aims at not only predicting sleep stages but of doing so with an optimized minimal number of EEG channels. For that, we combine a genetic algorithm based optimization with a classification framework that minimizes the number of channels used by the machine learning algorithm to quantify sleep stages. This resulted in a scoring with an F1 score of 0.793 for the fully automatic model and 0.806 for the model trained on 10 percent of the unseen subject, both with only 3 EEG channels. The ensemble algorithm is based on a combination of shallow learning (extremely randomized trees) and deep learning (MiniRocket) classifiers. The algorithm was trained, validated and tested on night sleep PSG data collected from 7 subjects. The novelty of our approach lies on the use of the minimum information needed for automated sleep scoring, based on a systematic search that concurrently selects the optimal-minimum number of EEG channels and the best performing features for the machine learning classifier. The optimization framework presented in this work may enable new designs for sleep scoring devices suited to studies in the comfort of the homes, easily and inexpensively and in this way facilitate experimental and clinical studies in large populations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A robust intensity distribution alignment for harmonization of T1w intensity values</a></h4>

              
                Variations in image intensities between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions affect the subsequent image processing and its derived outcomes. Therefore, it is necessary to normalize images of different scanners/acquisitions, especially for longitudinal studies where a change of scanner or pulse sequence often happens. Here, we propose a robust intensity distribution alignment (RIDA) method to remove between-scan effects. The method is based on MRI T1w images acquired in close succession and robustly aligns two cumulative distribution functions (CDF) of voxel intensities to improve image-derived outcomes of a range of subcortical brain structures with different acquisition parameters. We compare RIDA with the other image harmonization methods: mica and RAVEL. We study three intra-scanner and three inter-scanner protocol variations among the same 20 participants scanned with Siemens 1.5T Avanto, 3T Skyra, and 3T Prisma scanners on the same day and use image-derived volumetric outputs from the Sequence Adaptive Multimodal Segmentation (SAMSEG) method. We find that CDF-based intensity harmonization (mica and RIDA) significantly reduces intensity differences, improves consistency in volume quantification, and increases spatial overlap between two images acquired in close succession. The improvements are most considerable if the intensity normalization is based on subcortical structures only (RIDA), excluding cortical regions, instead of the whole brain. However, the effect of the corrections varies considerably as a function of the compared scanners and sequences. In conclusion, the RIDA scan- effect normalization improves the consistency of image-derived measures, but its performance depends on several factors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Disentanglement of Resting State Brain Networks for Localizing Epileptogenic Zone in Focal Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Resting state electromagnetic recordings have been analyzed in epilepsy patients aiding presurgical evaluation. However, it has been rarely explored how pathological networks can be separated and thus used for epileptogenic focus localization purpose. We proposed here a resting state EEG/MEG analysis framework, to disentangle brain functional networks represented by electrophysiological oscillations. Firstly, by using an Embedded Hidden Markov Model (EHMM), we constructed a state space for resting state recordings consisting of brain states with different spatiotemporal patterns. After that, functional connectivity analysis along with graph theory were applied on the extracted brain states to quantify the network features of the extracted brain states, and we determine the source location of pathological states based on these features. The EHMM model was rigorously evaluated using computer simulations. Our simulation results revealed the proposed framework can extract brain states with high accuracy regarding both spatial and temporal profiles. We than validated the entire framework as compared with clinical ground truth in 10 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy who underwent MEG recordings. We segmented the resting state MEG recordings into a few brain states with diverse connectivity patterns and extracted pathological brain states by applying graph theory on the constructed functional networks. We showed reasonable localization results using the extracted pathological brain states in 6/10 patients, as compared to the invasive clinical findings. The framework can serve as an objective tool in extracting brain functional networks from noninvasive resting state electromagnetic recordings. It promises to aid presurgical evaluation guiding intracranial EEG electrodes implantation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Study of Event-Related Potentials during Monaural and Bilateral Hearing in Single Sided Deaf Cochlear Implant Users</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Single sided deafness (SSD) is characterized by a profoundly deaf ear and normal hearing in the contralateral ear. A cochlear implant (CI) is the only method to restore functional hearing in a profoundly deaf ear. In a previous study, we identified that the cortical processing of a CI signal differs from the normal hearing ear (NHE) when directly compared using an auditory oddball paradigms consisting of pure tones. However, it is unclear how the electrical and acoustic signals from each ear are combined. This study aims to understand how the provision of the CI in combination with the NHE may improve SSD CI users ability to discriminate and evaluate auditory stimuli. Design: Electroencephalography (EEG) from ten SSD-CI participants (four participated in the previous pure-tone study) were recorded during a semantic acoustic oddball task, where they were required to discriminate between odd and even numbers. Stimuli were presented in four hearing conditions: directly through the CI, directly to the NHE, or in free field with the CI switched on and off. We examined task-performance (response time and accuracy) and measured N1, P2, N2N4 and P3b event-related brain potentials (ERPs) linked to the detection, discrimination, and evaluation of task relevant stimuli. Sound localization and speech in noise comprehension was also examined. Results: In direct presentation, task performance was superior during NHE compared to CI (Shorter and less varied RTs [~720 vs. ~842 ms], higher target accuracy [~93 vs. ~70%]) and early neural responses (N1 and P2) were enhanced for NHE suggesting greater signal saliency. However, the size of N2N4 and P3b target-standard effects did not differ significantly between NHE and CI. In free field, target accuracy was similarly high for both FF-on and -off (~95%), with some evidence of CI interference during FF-on (more variable and slightly but significantly delayed RTs [~737 vs. ~709 ms]). Early neural responses and late effects were also greater during FF-on. Performance on sound localization and speech in noise comprehension (SCINNHE configuration only) was significantly greater during CI-on. Conclusion: Both behavioral and neural responses in the semantic oddball task were sensitive to CI in both direct and free-field presentations. Direct conditions revealed that participants could perform the task with the CI alone, although performance was sub-optimal and early neural responses was reduced when compared to the NHE. For free-field, the addition of the CI was associated with enhanced early and later neural responses but did not improved task performance. Enhanced neural responses show that the additional input from the CI is modulating relevant perceptual and cognitive processes, but the benefit of binaural hearing on behavior may not be realized in simple oddball tasks which can be adequately performed with the NHE. Future studies interested in binaural hearing should examine performance under noisy conditions and/or employ spatial cues to allow headroom for the measurement of binaural benefit.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identifying cortical areas that underlie the transformation from retinal to world motion signals</a></h4>

              
                Accurate motion perception requires that the visual system integrate the retinal motion signals received by the two eyes into a single representation of 3D (i.e., world) motion. However, most experimental paradigms limit the motion stimuli to the fronto-parallel plane (i.e., 2D motion) and are thus unable to dissociate retinal and world motion signals. Here, we used stereoscopic displays to present separate motion signals to the two eyes and examined their representation in visual cortex using fMRI. Specifically, we presented random-dot motion stimuli that produced percepts of various 3D motion trajectories. We also presented control stimuli that contained the same retinal motion energy in the two eyes but were inconsistent with any 3D motion trajectory. We decoded the stimuli from BOLD activity using a probabilistic decoding algorithm. We found that 3D motion direction can be reliably decoded in three major clusters in the human visual system. In early visual cortex (V1-V3), we found no significant difference in decoding performance between the 3D motion and control stimuli, suggesting that these areas represent retinal motion rather than world motion signals. In voxels in and surrounding hMT and IPS0 however, decoding performance was consistently superior for 3D motion compared to control stimuli. Our results reveal the parts of the visual processing hierarchy that are critical for the transformation of retinal into world motion signals and suggest a role for IPS0 in the representation of 3D motion signals, in addition to its sensitivity to 3D object structure and static depth.

                The phenomenon of musical 'consonance' is crucial for many musical styles, determining how notes are organized into scales, how scales are tuned, and how chords are constructed from scales. Western music theory assumes that consonance depends solely on frequency ratios between chord tones; however, psychoacoustic theories predict a dependency also on the 'timbre' (tone color) of the underlying sounds. We investigate this possibility with 24 large-scale behavioral experiments (4,666 participants), constructing detailed continuous maps of consonance judgments for different timbres, and simulating these judgments with representative computational models. We find that timbral manipulations can indeed modify consonance judgments, transforming both the magnitude and the location of consonance peaks. We show how these results shed new light into the mechanisms underlying consonance perception as well as the cultural evolution of scale systems. More broadly, this work showcases how large-scale behavioral experiments can inform classical questions in auditory perception.

                The amygdala is a complex brain structure in the vertebrate telencephalon, essential for regulating social behaviors, emotions and (social) cognition. In contrast to the vast majority of neuron types described in the many nuclei of the mammalian amygdala, little is known about the neuronal diversity in non-mammals, making reconstruction of its evolution particularly difficult. Here, we characterize glutamatergic neuron types in the amygdala of the salamander Pleurodeles waltl. Our single-cell RNA sequencing data indicate the existence of at least ten distinct types and subtypes of glutamatergic neurons in the salamander amygdala. In situ hybridization for marker genes indicates that these neuron types are located in three major subdivisions: the lateral amygdala, the medial amygdala, and a newly-defined area demarcated by high expression of the transcription factor Sim1. The gene expression profiles of these neuron types suggest similarities with specific neuron types in the sauropsid and mammalian amygdala, and in particular the evolutionary conservation of Sim1-expressing amygdalar neurons in tetrapods. Taken together, our results reveal a surprising diversity of glutamatergic neuron types in the amygdala of salamanders, despite the anatomical simplicity of their brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transferability of cathodal tDCS effects from the primary motor to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex: a multimodal TMS-EEG study</a></h4>

              
                Neurophysiological effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have been extensively studied over the primary motor cortex (M1). Much less is however known about its effects over non-motor areas, such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which is the neuronal foundation for many high-level cognitive functions and involved in neuropsychiatric disorders. In this study, we, therefore, explored the transferability of cathodal tDCS effects over M1 to the PFC. Eighteen healthy human participants (11 males and 8 females) were involved in eight randomized sessions, in which four cathodal tDCS dosages, low, medium, and high, as well as sham stimulation, were applied over the M1 and PFC. After-effects of tDCS were evaluated via transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-electroencephalography (EEG), and TMS-elicited motor evoked potentials (MEP), for the outcome parameters TMS-evoked potentials (TEP), TMS-evoked oscillations, and MEP amplitude alterations. TEPs were studied both at the regional and global scalp levels. The results indicate a regional dosage-dependent nonlinear neurophysiological effect of M1 tDCS, which is not one-to-one transferable to PFC tDCS. Low and high dosages of M1 tDCS reduced early positive TEP peaks (P30, P60), and MEP amplitudes, while an enhancement was observed for medium dosage M1 tDCS (P30 and MEP amplitudes). In contrast, prefrontal low, medium and high dosage tDCS uniformly reduced the early positive TEP peak amplitudes. Furthermore, for both cortical areas, regional tDCS-induced modulatory effects were not observed for late TEP peaks, nor TMS-evoked oscillations. However, at the global scalp level, widespread effects of tDCS were observed for both, TMS-evoked potentials and oscillations. This study provides the first direct physiological comparison of tDCS effects applied over different brain areas and therefore delivers crucial information for future tDCS applications.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dietary polyphenols drive alterations in behavior, transcriptional regulation, and commensal microbiota in models of opioid use.</a></h4>

              
                Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) is a neuropsychiatric condition associated with tremendous medical and social consequences. Despite this burden, current pharmacotherapies for OUD are ineffective or intolerable for many patients. As such, interventions aimed at promoting overall health and resilience against OUD are of immense clinical and societal interest. Recently, treatment with a Bioactive Dietary Polyphenol Preparation (BDPP) was shown to promote behavioral resilience and adaptive neuroplasticity in multiple models of neuropsychiatric disease. Here, we assessed effects of BDPP treatment on behavioral and molecular responses to repeated morphine treatment. We find that BDPP pre-treatment alters responses across the dose range for both locomotor sensitization and conditioned place preference. Most notably, polyphenol treatment consistently reduced formation of preference at low dose (5mg/kg) morphine but enhanced it at high dose (15mg/kg). In parallel, we performed transcriptomic profiling of the nucleus accumbens, which again showed a dose x polyphenol interaction. At high dose morphine, BDPP pre-treatment potentiated gene expression changes induced by morphine particularly for genes related to synaptic function. We also profiled microbiome composition and function, as polyphenols are metabolized by the microbiome and can act as prebiotics. The profile revealed polyphenol treatment markedly altered microbiome composition and function, particularly in the low dose morphine group. Finally, we investigated involvement of the SIRT1 histone deacetylase, and the role of specific polyphenol metabolites in these behavioral phenotypes. Taken together, these results demonstrate that polyphenols have robust dose-dependent effects on behavioral and physiological responses to morphine and lay the foundation for future translational work.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spatiotemporal dynamics of memory encoding and memory retrieval states</a></h4>

              
                Memory encoding and memory retrieval are neurally distinct brain states that can be differentiated on the basis of cortical network activity. However, it is unclear whether sustained engagement of one network or fluctuations between multiple networks give rise to these memory states. The spatiotemporal dynamics of memory states may have important implications for memory behavior and cognition; however, measuring temporally resolved signals of cortical networks poses a challenge. Here we recorded scalp electroencephalography from subjects performing a mnemonic state task in which they were biased toward memory encoding or retrieval. We performed a microstate analysis in order to measure the temporal dynamics of cortical networks throughout this mnemonic state task. We find that microstate E, a putative analog of the default mode network, shows temporally sustained dissociations between memory encoding and retrieval, with greater engagement during retrieve compared to encode trials. We further show that decreased engagement of microstate E is a general property of encoding, rather than a reflection of retrieval suppression. Together, these findings show that memory states are supported by sustained engagement of a particular cortical network. Memory success, as well as cognition more broadly, may be influenced by the ability to engage or disengage microstate E in a goal-dependent manner.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pre-neuronal processing of haptic sensory cues via dispersive high-frequency vibrational modes</a></h4>

              
                Sense of touch is one of the major channels of perception. Neural coding of object features conveyed by rodents' whiskers has been a model to study early stages of haptic information uptake. While high-precision spike timing has been observed during whisker sweeping across textured surfaces, the exact nature of whisker micromotions that spike trains encode remained elusive. Here, we discovered that whisker swept over textured object vibrates with a regular series of higher order vibrational modes spanning frequencies up to 10KHz. These high frequency modes carry up to 80% of vibrational energy, exhibit 100X smaller damping ratio, and propagate along the whisker 10X faster, that makes them the fastest and the most powerful messengers of shockwaves generated by micro-collisions with surface roughness. We conclude that a whisker is a dispersive pre-neuronal processor that transforms tactile information into a time sequenced code with ultra-high information capacity that contributes to haptic perception.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A comparison of methods to suppress electrocardiographic artifacts in local field potential recordings</a></h4>

              
                ObjectiveSensing-enabled neurostimulators for deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy record neural activity directly from the stimulating electrodes in the form of local field potentials (LFPs). However, these LFPs are often contaminated with electrocardiographic (ECG) artifacts that impede the detection of physiomarkers for adaptive DBS research. This study systematically compared the ability of different ECG suppression methods to recover disease-specific electrical brain activity from ECG-contaminated LFPs.

ApproachThree ECG suppression methods were evaluated: (1) QRS interpolation of the Perceive toolbox, (2) four variants of a template subtraction method, and (3) sixteen variants of a singular value decomposition (SVD) method. The performance of these methods was examined using LFPs recorded with the Medtronic PerceptTM PC system from the subthalamic nucleus in nine patients with Parkinsons disease while stimulation was turned off ("OFF-DBS"; anode disconnected) and while stimulation was turned on at 0 mA ("ON-DBS 0 mA"; anode connected). In addition, ECG-contaminated LFPs were simulated by scaling a co-recorded external ECG signal and adding it to the OFF-DBS LFPs.

Main ResultsECG artifacts were present in 10 out of 18 ON-DBS 0 mA recordings. All ECG suppression methods were able to drastically reduce the percent difference of beta band (13 - 35 Hz) spectral power and at least partly recover the beta peak and beta burst dynamics. Using predetermined R-peaks improved the performance of the ECG suppression methods. Lengthening the time window around the R-peaks resulted in stronger reduction in artifact-induced beta band power but at an increased risk of flattening the beta peak and loss of beta burst dynamics.

SignificanceThe SVD method formed the preferred trade-off between artifact cleaning and signal loss, as long as its parameter settings (time window around the R-peaks; number of components) are adequately chosen.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Molecular and functional mechanisms of long-term visual habituation in larval zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Long-term habituation allows animals to learn to ignore persistent but unimportant stimuli. Despite being the most basic form of learning, a consensus model on the underlying mechanisms has yet to emerge. We have exploited a visual habituation paradigm in larval zebrafish, where larvae will learn to reduce their reactions to abrupt global dimming (a dark flash). Using a drug-screening approach, we first identified pathways that potently altered habituation learning, including GABAergic inhibition, Melatonin and Estrogen signaling. To determine how habituation manifests at the circuit-level, we used whole-brain pERK and 2-photon Ca2+ imaging. These analyses identified 12 classes of neurons that differ in their stimulus response profile, rate of adaptation during learning, anatomical location, and GABAergic identity. By analyzing how GABA and Melatonin alter population activity, we propose a model for dark flash habituation in which the suppression of activity begins early in the visual pathway but downstream of the retina. This suppression is mediated by GABAergic inhibitory motifs resulting in heterogeneous inhibition of distinct neuronal types in the dark flash circuit. Our results have identified multiple molecular pathways acting in functional cell types underlying a form of long-term plasticity in a vertebrate brain, and allow us to propose the first iteration of a model for how and where this learning process is encoded in individual neurons to shape learned behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The meningeal transcriptional response to traumatic brain injury and aging</a></h4>

              
                Emerging evidence suggests that the meningeal compartment plays instrumental roles in various neurological disorders and can modulate neurodevelopment and behavior. While this has sparked great interest in the meninges, we still lack fundamental knowledge about meningeal biology. Here, we utilized high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) techniques to investigate the transcriptional response of the meninges to traumatic brain injury (TBI) and aging in the sub-acute and chronic time frames. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we first explored how mild TBI affects the cellular and transcriptional landscape in the meninges in young mice at one week post-injury. Then, using bulk RNA sequencing, we assessed the differential long-term outcomes between young and aged mice following a TBI. In our scRNA-seq studies, we found that mild head trauma leads to an activation of type I interferon (IFN) signature genes in meningeal macrophages as well as the mobilization of multiple distinct sub-populations of meningeal macrophages expressing hallmarks of either classically activated or wound healing macrophages. We also revealed that dural fibroblasts in the meningeal compartment are highly responsive to TBI, and pathway analysis identified differential expression of genes linked to various neurodegenerative diseases. For reasons that remain poorly understood, the elderly are especially vulnerable to head trauma, where even mild injuries can lead to rapid cognitive decline and devastating neuropathology. To better understand the differential outcomes between the young and the elderly following brain injury, we performed bulk RNA-seq on young and aged meninges from mice that had received a mild TBI or Sham treatment 1.5 months prior. Notably, we found that aging alone induced massive upregulation of meningeal genes involved in antibody production by B cells and type I IFN signaling. Following injury, the meningeal transcriptome had largely returned to its pre-injury signature in young mice. In stark contrast, aged TBI mice still exhibited massive upregulation of immune-related genes and markedly reduced expression of genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and maintenance of cellular junctions. Overall, these findings illustrate the dynamic and complex transcriptional response of the meninges to mild head trauma. Moreover, we also reveal how aging modulates the meningeal response to TBI.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neurochemistry-enriched dynamic causal models of magnetoencephalography, using magnetic resonance spectroscopy</a></h4>

              
                We present a hierarchical (i.e., empirical) Bayesian framework for testing hypotheses about synaptic neurotransmission, based on the integration of ultra-high field magnetic resonance spectroscopy (7T-MRS) and magnetoencephalography. A first level dynamic causal modelling of cortical microcircuits is used to infer the connectivity parameters of a generative model of neurophysiological observations. At the second level, 7T- magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) estimates of regional neurotransmitter concentration supply empirical priors on synaptic connectivity. We compare the evidence for alternative empirical priors, defined by monotonic functions of spectroscopic estimates, on subsets of synaptic connections. For efficiency and reproducibility, we used Bayesian model reduction, parametric empirical Bayes and variational Bayesian inversion. In particular, we used Bayesian model reduction to compare models of how spectroscopic neurotransmitter measures inform estimates of synaptic connectivity. This identifies the synaptic connections that are influenced by neurotransmitter levels, as measured by 7T-MRS. We demonstrate the method using resting-state magnetoencephalography (i.e., task-free recording) and 7T-MRS data from healthy adults. We validate the analysis by split-sampling of the magnetoencephalography dataset. Our results confirm the hypotheses that GABA concentration influences local recurrent inhibitory intrinsic connectivity in deep and superficial cortical layers, while glutamate influences the excitatory connections between superficial and deep layers and connections from superficial to inhibitory interneurons. The method is suitable for applications with magnetoencephalography or electroencephalography, and is well-suited to evince the mechanisms of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including responses to psychopharmacological interventions.

                Dendrites form arbors whose size, shape and complexity define how neurons cover their receptive territories. Actin dynamics contribute to growth and remodelling of dendrite arbors. Here we examined how Spire, a conserved actin nucleation factor, promotes formation of new branches in vivo. In live imaging of Drosophila class IV dendritic arborisation (c4da) neurons, Spire was observed at new sites of branch initiation, where it assembled new actin polymer prior to filopodial outgrowth. For dendrite arborization, Spire required intact structural domains to nucleate actin and target the secretory network, and Spire interacted with Rab11 GTPase, a key regulator of recycling endosomes. Together, these findings support a model that Spire cooperates with Rab11 to promote new dendrite branches by linking localized actin assembly with intracellular trafficking of endosomes that deliver lipids and cargoes to fuel protrusive outgrowth of nascent dendrites.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A unitary model of auditory frequency change perception</a></h4>

              
                Changes in the frequency content of sounds over time are arguably the most basic form of information about the behavior of sound-emitting objects. In perceptual studies, such changes have mostly been investigated separately, as aspects of either pitch or timbre. Here, we propose a unitary account of "up" and "down" subjective judgments of frequency change, based on a model combining auditory correlates of acoustic cues in a sound-specific and listener-specific manner. To do so, we introduce a generalized version of so-called Shepard tones, allowing symmetric manipulations of spectral information on a fine scale, usually associated to pitch (spectral fine structure, SFS), and on a coarse scale, usually associated timbre (spectral envelope, SE). In a series of behavioral experiments, listeners reported "up" or "down" shifts across pairs of generalized Shepard tones that differed in SFS, in SE, or in both. We observed the classic properties of Shepard tones for either SFS or SE shifts: subjective judgements followed the smallest log-frequency change direction, with cases of ambiguity and circularity. Interestingly, when both SFS and SE changes were applied concurrently (synergistically or antagonistically), we observed a trade-off between cues. Listeners were encouraged to report when they perceived "both" directions of change concurrently, but this rarely happened, suggesting a unitary percept. A computational model could accurately fit the behavioral data by combining different cues reflecting frequency changes after auditory filtering. The model revealed that cue weighting depended on the nature of the sound. When presented with harmonic sounds, listeners put more weight on SFS-related cues, whereas inharmonic sounds led to more weight on SE-related cues. Moreover, these stimulus-based factors were modulated by inter-individual differences, revealing variability across listeners in the detailed recipe for "up" and "down" judgments. We argue that frequency changes are tracked perceptually via the adaptive combination of a diverse set of cues, in a manner that is in fact similar to the derivation of other basic auditory dimensions such as spatial location.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Columnar scale lesions in barrel cortex degrade tactile discrimination but not detection</a></h4>

              
                Primary sensory cortices typically display functional topography, suggesting that even small cortical volumes may underpin perception of specific stimuli. Because traditional loss-of-function approaches have a relatively large radius of effect (>1 mm), the behavioral necessity of smaller cortical volumes remains unclear. In the mouse primary vibrissal somatosensory cortex (vS1),  barrels with a radius of [~]150 m receive input predominantly from a single whisker, partitioning vS1 into a topographic map of well-defined columns. Here, we train animals implanted with a cranial window over vS1 to perform single-whisker perceptual tasks. We then use high-power laser exposure centered on the barrel representing the spared whisker to produce lesions with an average volume of [~]2 barrels. These columnar scale lesions impair performance on object location discrimination tasks without disrupting vibrissal kinematics. Animals with degraded discrimination performance can immediately perform a detection task with high accuracy. Animals trained de novo on both simple and complex detection tasks showed no behavioral deficits following columnar scale lesions. Thus, vS1 barrels are necessary for performing object location discrimination but not simple or complex object detection behaviors.

                Decreased cognitive ability is a major consequence of exposure to drugs of abuse, but the underlying neuroplastic changes have been elusive. We show that both phencyclidine and methamphetamine cause a population of prelimbic pyramidal neurons to switch from a glutamatergic to a GABAergic phenotype. Overriding the gain of GABA with RNA-interference prevents drug-induced cognitive deficits and locomotor sensitization, connecting the change in neurotransmitter identity with altered behavior. Chemogenetic suppression of drug-induced hyperactivity also prevents the change in transmitter phenotype or reverses it after it has occurred, preventing or rescuing the associated behavioral changes. These findings may provide therapeutic opportunities to mitigate drug-induced cognitive deficits by manipulating electrical activity in the prelimbic cortex.

                1.Following exocytosis at active zones, synaptic vesicle membranes and membrane-bound proteins must be recycled. The endocytic machinery that drives this recycling accumulates in the periactive zone (PAZ), a region of the synapse adjacent to active zones, but the organization of this machinery within the PAZ, and how PAZ composition relates to active zone release properties remains unknown. The PAZ is also enriched for cell adhesion proteins, but their function at these sites is poorly understood. Here, using Airyscan and STED imaging of Drosophila synapses, we develop a quantitative framework describing the organization and ultrastructure of the PAZ. Different endocytic proteins localize to distinct regions of the PAZ, suggesting that sub-domains are specialized for distinct biochemical activities, stages of membrane remodeling, or synaptic functions. We find that the accumulation and distribution of endocytic but not adhesion PAZ proteins correlate with the abundance of the scaffolding protein Bruchpilot at active zones - a structural correlate of release probability. These data suggest that endocytic and exocytic activities are spatially correlated. Taken together, our results provide a new approach to quantify synaptic architecture and identify novel relationships between the exocytic and endocytic apparatus at the synapse.

This well-established effect is called spatial summation of pain (SSp) and has been the subject of multiple investigations. Here, we used cold-induced SSp to investigate the effect of attention on the spatial tuning of nociceptive processing. Forty pain-free volunteers (N=40, 20 females) participated in this experiment. They took part in an SSp paradigm based on three hand immersions into cold water (5{degrees}C): Participants either immersed the ulnar segment ("a"), radial segment ("b") or both hand segments ("a+b") and provided overall pain ratings. In some trials based on "a+b" immersions, they were also asked to provide divided (i.e., first pain in "a" then in "b"; or reversed) and directed attention ratings (i.e., pain only in "a" or "b"). Results confirmed a clear SSp effect in which reported pain during immersions of "a" or "b" was less intense than pain during immersions of "a+b" (p<0.001). Data also confirmed that spatial tuning was altered. SSp was fully abolished when participants provided two ratings in a divided fashion (p<0.001). Furthermore, pain was significantly lower when attention was directed only to one segment ("a" OR "b") during "a+b" immersion (p<0.001). We conclude that spatial tuning is dynamically driven by attention as reflected in abolished SSp. Directed attention was sufficient to focus spatial tuning and abolish SSp. Results support the role of cognitive processes such as attention in spatial tuning.

                The cerebellum is involved in learning of fine motor skills, yet whether presynaptic plasticity contributes to such learning remains elusive. Here we report that the EPAC-PKC{varepsilon} module has a critical role in a presynaptic form of long-term potentiation in the cerebellum and motor behavior. Presynaptic cAMP-EPAC-PKC{varepsilon} signaling cascade induces a previously unidentified threonine phosphorylation of RIM1, and thereby initiates the assembly of the Rab3A-RIM1-Munc13-1 tripartite complex that facilitates docking and release of synaptic vesicles. Granule cell-specific blocking of EPAC-PKC{varepsilon} signaling abolishes presynaptic long-term potentiation at the parallel fiber to Purkinje cell synapses and impairs basic performance and learning of cerebellar motor behavior. These results unveil a functional relevance of presynaptic plasticity that is regulated through a novel signaling cascade, thereby enriching the spectrum of cerebellar learning mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamics of spike time encoding in the olfactory bulb</a></h4>

              
                In the mammalian olfactory bulb (OB), gamma oscillations in the local field potential are generated endogenously during odor sampling. Such oscillations arise from dynamical systems that generate organized periodic behavior in neural circuits, and correspond to spike timing constraints at fine timescales. While the cellular and network mechanisms of gamma oscillogenesis in the OB are reasonably well established, it remains unclear how these fine-timescale dynamics serve to represent odors. Are patterns of spike synchrony on the gamma timescale replicable and odor-specific? Does the transformation to a spike-timing metric embed additional computations? To address these questions, we used OB slices to examine the spike timing dynamics evoked by "fictive odorants" generated via spatiotemporally patterned optogenetic stimulation of olfactory sensory neuron axonal arbors. We found that a small proportion of mitral/tufted cells phase-lock strongly to the fast oscillations evoked by fictive odorants, and exhibit tightly coupled spike-spike synchrony on the gamma timescale during this stimulation. Moreover, the specific population of synchronized neurons differed based on the "quality", but not the "concentration", of the fictive odorant presented, and was conserved across multiple presentations of the same fictive odorant. Given the established selectivity of piriform cortical pyramidal neurons for inputs synchronized on this timescale, we conclude that spike synchronization on a milliseconds timescale is a metric by which the OB encodes and exports afferent odor information in a concentration-invariant manner. As a corollary, mitral/tufted cell spikes that are not organized in time may not contribute effectively to the ensemble odor representation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Data-driven dissection of the Fever Effect in Autism Spectrum Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Some individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) demonstrate marked behavioral improvements during febrile episodes, in what is perhaps the only present-day means of modulating the core ASD phenotype. Understanding the nature of this so-called Fever Effect is therefore essential for leveraging this natural temporary relief of symptoms to a sustained efficacious intervention. Towards this goal, we used machine learning to analyze the rich clinical data of the Simons Simplex Collection, in which 1 out of every 6 children with ASD was reported to improve during febrile episodes, across multiple ASD domains. Reported behavioral improvements during febrile episodes were associated with maternal infection in pregnancy (OR = 1.7, 95% CI = [1.42, 2.03], P = 4.24x10-4) and gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction (OR=1.46, 95% CI = [1.15, 1.81], P = 1.94x10-3). Family members of children reported to improve when febrile have an increased prevalence of autoimmune disorders (OR=1.43, 95% CI = [1.23, 1.67], P = 3.0x10-6), language disorders (OR=1.63, 95% CI = [1.29, 2.04], P = 2.5x10-5), and neuropsychiatric disorders (OR=1.59, 95% CI = [1.34, 1.89], P < 1x10-6). Since both GI abnormalities and maternal immune activation have been linked to ASD via proinflammatory cytokines, these results support the involvement of proinflammatory cytokines in the Fever Effect, consistent with findings in mouse models. This work advances our understanding of the fever-responsive ASD subtype and motivates future studies to directly test the link between proinflammatory cytokines and behavioral modifications in individuals with ASD.

Lay summarySome individuals with ASD demonstrate marked behavioral improvements when they have a fever. However, the magnitude, scope, nature, and underlying neurobiological basis of the so-called Fever Effect remain unknown. This large-scale biomedical data analysis found that children with ASD reported to improve when febrile tend to be those with worse gastrointestinal symptoms and whose mothers reported an infection during pregnancy. These and other findings point to the involvement of proinflammatory cytokines in this phenomenon.

                The Mercator projection map of the world provides a useful, but distorted, view of the relative scale of countries. Current cellular models suffer from a similar distortion. Here, we undertook an in-depth structural analysis of the molecular dimensions in the cells computational machinery, the MeshCODE, that is assembled from a meshwork of binary switches in the scaffolding proteins talin and vinculin. Talin contains a series of force-dependent binary switches and each domain switching state introduces quantised step-changes in talin length on a micrometre scale. The average dendritic spine is 1 {micro}m in diameter so this analysis identifies a plausible Gearbox-like mechanism for dynamic regulation of synaptic function, whereby the positioning of enzymes and substrates relative to each other, mechanically-encoded by the MeshCODE switch patterns, might control synaptic transmission. Based on biophysical rules and experimentally derived distances, this analysis yields a novel perspective on biological digital information.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamic top-down biasing implements rapid adaptive changes to individual movements</a></h4>

              
                Complex behaviors depend on the coordinated activity of neural ensembles in interconnected brain areas. The behavioral function of such coordination, often measured as co-fluctuations in neural activity across areas, is poorly understood. One hypothesis is that rapidly varying co-fluctuations may be a signature of moment-by-moment task-relevant influences of one area on another. We tested this possibility for error-corrective adaptation of birdsong, a form of motor learning which has been hypothesized to depend on the top-down influence of a higher-order area, LMAN, in shaping moment-by-moment output from a primary motor area, RA. In paired recordings of LMAN and RA in singing birds, we discovered a neural signature of a top-down influence of LMAN on RA, quantified as an LMAN-leading co-fluctuation between these areas. During learning, this co-fluctuation strengthened in a premotor temporal window linked to the specific movement, sequential context, and acoustic modification associated with learning. Moreover, transient perturbation of LMAN activity specifically within this premotor window caused rapid occlusion of pitch modifications, consistent with LMAN conveying a temporally localized motor-biasing signal. Combined, our results reveal a dynamic top-down influence of LMAN on RA that varies on the rapid timescale of individual movements and is flexibly linked to contexts associated with learning. This finding indicates that inter-area co-fluctuations can be a signature of dynamic top-down influences that support complex behavior and its adaptation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Vulnerable Brain Networks Associated with Risk for Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Brain connectomes provide untapped potential for identifying individuals at risk for Alzheimers disease (AD), and can help provide novel targets based on selective circuit vulnerability. Age, APOE4 genotype, and female sex are thought to contribute to the selective vulnerability of brain networks in Alzheimers disease, in a manner that differentiates pathological versus normal aging. These brain networks may predict pathology otherwise hard to detect, decades before overt disease manifestation and cognitive decline. Uncovering network based biomarkers at prodromal, asymptomatic stages may offer new windows of opportunity for interventions, either therapeutic or preventive. We used a sample of 72 people across the age span to model the relationship between Alzheimers disease risk and vulnerable brain networks. Sparse Canonical Correlation analysis (SCCA) revealed relationships between brain subgraphs and AD risk, with bootstrap based confidence intervals. When constructing a composite AD risk factor based on sex, age, genotype, the highest weight was associated with genotype. Next, we mapped networks associated with auditory, visual, and olfactory memory, and identified networks extending beyond the main nodes known to be involved in these functions. The inclusion of cognitive metrics in a composite risk factor pointed to vulnerable networks, and associated with the specific memory tests. These regions with the highest cumulative degree of connectivity in our studies were the pericalcarine, insula, banks of the superior sulcus and cerebellum. To help scale up our approach, we extended Tensor Network Principal Component Analysis (TNPCA) to evaluate AD risk related subgraphs, introducing CCA components and sparsity. When constructing a composite AD risk factor based on sex, age, and genotype, and family risk factor the most significant risk was associated with age. Our sparse regression based predictive models revealed vulnerable networks associated with known risk factors. The prediction error was 17% for genotype, 24% for family risk factor, and 5 years for age. Age prediction in groups including MCI and AD subjects involved several regions that were not prominent for age prediction otherwise. These regions included the middle and transverse temporal, paracentral and superior banks of temporal sulcus, as well as the amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus. The joint estimation of AD risk and connectome based mappings involved the cuneus, temporal, and cingulate cortices known to be associated with AD, and add new candidates, such as the cerebellum, whose role in AD is to be understood. Our predictive modeling approaches for AD risk factors represent a stepping stone towards single subject prediction, based on distances from normative graphs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Early and lifelong effects of APOE4 on neuronal gene expression networks relevant to Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) genotype and aging are critical risk factors for Alzheimers disease (AD). Aged APOE4 knock-in (APOE4-KI) mice have phenotypes reflecting features of AD. We conducted a large-scale single nucleus RNA-sequencing study to identify cell-type-specific effects of APOE4 on hippocampal gene expression during aging. APOE4-KI mice showed prominent alterations, relative to APOE3-KI mice, in neuronal transcriptome related to synaptic function, calcium signaling, and MAPK/Rap1/Pld signal transduction, starting by 5 months and persisting during aging. Mice with the APOE4 gene removed specifically from neurons failed to show most of these neuronal transcriptomic changes, suggesting a specific effect of neuron-derived APOE4 on the transcriptome. APOE4 affects similar cellular pathways in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human neurons transplanted into APOE4-KI mouse hippocampus and in cortical neurons from aged human brains. Thus, neuronal APOE4 has early and persistent effects on neuronal transcriptomes, suggesting the requirement of early interventions for successfully treating APOE4-related AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A multivariate brain signature for reward</a></h4>

              
                The processing of rewards and losses are crucial for learning to adapt to an ever changing environment. Dysregulated reward processes are prevalent in mental health and substance use disorders. While many human brain measures related to reward have been based on activity in individual brain regions, recent studies indicate that many affective and motivational processes are encoded in distributed systems that span multiple regions. Consequently, decoding these processes using individual regions yields small effect sizes and limited reliability, whereas predictive models based on distributed patterns yield much larger effect sizes and excellent reliability. To create such a predictive model for the processes of rewards and losses, from now on termed the Brain Reward Signature (BRS), we trained a LASSO-PCR model to predict the signed magnitude of monetary rewards and losses on the Monetary Incentive Delay task (MID; N = 39) and achieved a high significant decoding performance (92% for decoding rewards versus losses). We subsequently demonstrate the generalizability of our signature on another version of the MID in a different sample (92% decoding accuracy for rewards versus losses; N = 12) and on a gambling task from a large sample (73% decoding accuracy for rewards versus losses, N = 1084) from the Human Connectome Project. Lastly, we also provided preliminary evidence for specificity to rewarding outcomes by illustrating that the signature map generates estimates that significantly differ between rewarding and negative feedback (92% decoding accuracy) but do not differ for conditions that differ in disgust rather than reward in a novel Disgust-Delay Task (N = 39). We thus created a BRS that can be used to make specific, generalizable and reproducible predictions about brain responses to rewards and losses.

                Brain-machine interfaces have shown promise in extracting upper extremity movement intention from the thoughts of nonhuman primates and people with tetraplegia. Attempts to restore a user's own hand and arm function have employed functional electrical stimulation (FES), but most work has restored discrete grasps. Little is known about how well FES can control continuous finger movements. Here, we use a low-power brain-controlled functional electrical stimulation (BCFES) system to restore continuous volitional control of finger positions to a monkey with a temporarily paralyzed hand. In a one-dimensional, continuous, finger-related target acquisition task, the monkey improved his success rate to 83% (1.5s median acquisition time) when using the BCFES system during temporary paralysis from 8.8% (9.5s median acquisition, equivalent to chance) when attempting to use his temporarily paralyzed hand. With two monkeys under general anesthesia, we found FES alone could control the monkeys' fingers to rapidly reach targets in a median 1.1s but caused oscillation about the target. Finally, when attempting to perform a virtual two-finger continuous target acquisition task in brain-control mode following temporary hand paralysis, we found performance could be completely recovered by executing recalibrated feedback-intention training one time following temporary paralysis. These results suggest that BCFES can restore continuous finger function during temporary paralysis using existing low-power technologies and brain-control may not be the limiting performance factor in a BCFES neuroprosthesis.

This is likely because auditory deprivation during a developmental critical period (CP) induces long-lasting deficits in perception and ACx encoding of temporally-varying sounds. CPs also create susceptibility to early-life stress (ELS) in neural regions involved with cognition and anxiety. As CP mechanisms are shared by sensory cortices and higher neural regions, ACx and temporal encoding may also be susceptible to ELS. To examine the effects of ELS on temporal processing, we developed a model of ELS in the Mongolian gerbil, a well-established model for auditory processing. ELS induction impaired the behavioral detection of short gaps in sound, which are critical for speech perception. This was accompanied by reduced neural responses to gaps in ACx, the auditory periphery, and auditory brainstem. These ELS effects presumably degrade the fidelity of sensory representations available to higher regions, and could contribute to ELS-induced problems with cognition.

                A common impairment in aging is age-related hearing loss (presbycusis), which manifests as impaired spectrotemporal processing. Aging is accompanied by alteration in normal inhibitory (GABA) neurotransmission and changes in excitatory (NMDA and AMPA) synapses in the auditory cortex (ACtx). However, the circuit mechanisms responsible for age-related auditory dysfunction remain unknown. Here we investigated how auditory cortical microcircuits change with age. We performed laser-scanning photostimulation (LSPS) combined with whole-cell patch clamp recordings from Layer (L) 2/3 cells in primary auditory cortex (A1) in young adult (postnatal day (P) 47-P72) and aged (P543 to P626) male and female CBA/CaJ mice. We found that L2/3 cells in aged male animals display functional hypoconnectivity of both excitatory and inhibitory circuits originating from L4. Compared to cells from young adult mice, cells from aged male mice have fewer inhibitory connections from L4 while female mice show weaker connection strength. These results suggest a sex-specific reduction in excitatory and inhibitory intralaminar cortical circuits in aged mice compared with young adult animals. We speculate that these unbalanced changes in cortical circuits contribute to the functional manifestations of age-related hearing loss in both males and females.

                As information about the world is conveyed from the sensory periphery to central neural circuits, it mixes with complex ongoing cortical activity. How do neural populations keep track of sensory signals, separating them from noisy ongoing activity? Here we show that sensory signals are encoded more reliably, with less noise in certain low-dimensional subspaces. These coding subspaces are defined by correlations between simultaneously recorded neural activity in primary sensory cortex and upstream sensory brain regions; the most correlated dimensions were best for decoding. We analytically predicted and experimentally confirmed that coding subspaces can be further improved when defined based on populations with lower noise correlations between cortex and upstream regions. We show that this principle generalizes across diverse sensory stimuli in the olfactory system and the visual system of awake mice. Our results suggest the cortex may multiplex different functions by executing them in different low dimensional subspaces.

                Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is fundamental to neuroscience, where detailed structural brain scans improve clinical diagnoses and provide accurate neuroanatomical information. Apart from time-consuming scanning protocols, higher image resolution can be obtained with super resolution algorithms. We investigated the generalization abilities of Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (SRGANs) across different populations. T1-weighted scans from three large cohorts were used, spanning older subjects, newborns, and patients with brain tumor- or treatment-induced tissue changes. Upsampling quality was validated using synthetic and anatomical metrics. Models were first trained on each cohort, yielding high image quality and anatomical fidelity. When applied across cohorts, no artifacts were introduced by the SRGANs. SRGANs that were trained on a dataset combining all cohorts also did not induce any population-based artifacts. We showed that SRGANs provide a prime example of robust AI, where application on unseen populations did not introduce artifacts due to training data bias (e.g., insertion or removal of tumor-related signals and contrast inversion). This is an important step in the deployment of SRGANs in real-world settings.

                In the present paper we propose a non-parametric statistical test procedure for interval scaled, paired samples data that circumvents the multiple comparison problem (MCP) by relating the data to the rank order of its group averages. Using an auto-regressive procedure, a single test statistic for multiple groups is obtained that allows for qualitative statements about whether multiple group averages are in fact different and how they can be sorted. The presented procedure outperforms classical tests, such as pairwise conducted t-tests and ANOVA, in some circumstances. Furthermore, the test is robust against noise and does not require the data to follow any particular distribution. If A is a data matrix containing N observations for k groups, then the test statistic {eta} can be computed by {eta} = {sum}f(Ai,s)/N, where s is a vector of length k containing the average for each group, transformed into unique rank values. This statistic is compared to the distribution D, obtained by Monte Carlo sampling from the permutation distribution. It will be demonstrated that D can be described by a normal distribution for a variety of input data distributions and choices for f, as long as a set of criteria is met. Comparing {eta} to the permutation distribution controls the false alarm (FA) rate sufficiently, since the exact p-value can be estimated. Multiple examples of possible choices for f will be discussed, as well as detailed descriptions of the underlying test assumptions, possible interpretations and use cases. All mathematical derivations are supported with a set of simulations, written in Python that can be downloaded from https://gitlab.com/TommyClausner/aros-test together with an implementation of the test itself.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Validation of a new coil array tailored for dog functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies</a></h4>

              
                Comparative neuroimaging allows for the identification of similarities and differences between species. It provides an important and promising avenue, to answer questions about the evolutionary origins of the brain's organization, in terms of both structure and function. Dog fMRI has recently become one particularly promising and increasingly used approach to study brain function and coevolution. In dog neuroimaging, image acquisition has so far been mostly performed with coils originally developed for use in human MRI. Since such coils have been tailored to human anatomy, their sensitivity and data quality is likely not optimal for dog MRI. Therefore, we developed a multi-channel receive coil (K9 coil) tailored for high-resolution functional imaging in canines, optimized for dog cranial anatomy. In this paper we report structural (n = 9) as well as functional imaging data (resting-state, n = 6; simple visual paradigm, n = 9) collected with the K9 coil in comparison to reference data collected with a human knee coil. Our results show that the K9 coil significantly outperforms the human knee coil, improving the signal-to-noise ratio across the imaging modalities. We noted increases of roughly 45% signal-to-noise in the structural and functional domain. In terms of translation to functional fMRI data collected in a visual flickering checkerboard paradigm, group-level analyses show that the K9 coil performs better than the knee coil as well. These findings demonstrate how hardware improvements may be instrumental in driving data quality, and thus, quality of imaging results, for dog-human comparative neuroimaging.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Beta oscillations and waves in motor cortex can be accounted for by the interplay of spatially-structured connectivity and fluctuating inputs</a></h4>

              
                The beta rhythm (13-30 Hz) is a prominent brain rhythm. Recordings in primates during instructed-delay reaching tasks have shown that different types of traveling waves of oscillatory activity are associated with episodes of beta oscillations in motor cortex during movement preparation. We propose here a simple model of motor cortex based on local excitatory-inhibitory neuronal populations coupled by longer range excitation, where additionally inputs to the motor cortex from other neural structures are represented by stochastic inputs on the different model populations. We show that the model accurately reproduces the statistics of recording data when these external inputs are correlated on a short time scale (25 ms) and have two different components, one that targets the motor cortex locally and another one that targets it in a global and synchronized way. The model reproduces the distribution of beta burst durations, the proportion of the different observed wave types, and wave speeds, which we show not to be linked to axonal propagation speed. When the long-range connectivity is anisotropic, traveling waves are found to preferentially propagate along the axis where connectivity decays the fastest. Different from previously proposed mechanistic explanations, the model suggests that traveling waves in motor cortex are the reflection of the dephasing by external inputs, putatively of thalamic origin, of an os- cillatory activity that would otherwise be spatially synchronized by recurrent connectivity.

                We present an integrative proteomic strategy for the nomination and validation of proteins associated with cognitive resilience to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Correlation network analysis across distinct stages of AD was used to prioritize protein modules linked to resilience. Neuritin (NRN1), a hub protein in a module associated with synaptic biology, was identified as a top candidate of resilience and selected for functional validation in cultured neurons. NRN1 provided dendritic spine resilience against amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}), and NRN1 blocked A{beta}-induced neuronal hyperexcitability. The impact of exogenous NRN1 on the proteome of cultured neurons was assessed and integrated with the AD brain network. This revealed over-lapping synapse-related biology that linked NRN1-induced changes in cultured neurons with human pathways associated with AD resilience. Collectively, this highlights the utility of integrating the proteome from human brain and model systems to prioritize therapeutic targets that mediate resilience to AD.

                Human cortical organoids, three-dimensional neuronal cell cultures derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells, have recently emerged as promising models of human brain development and dysfunction. Transplantation of human brain organoids into the mouse brain has been shown to be a successful in vivo model providing vascularization for long term chronic experiments. However, chronic functional connectivity and responses evoked by external sensory stimuli has yet to be demonstrated, due to limitations of chronic recording technologies. Here, we develop an experimental paradigm based on transparent graphene microelectrode arrays and two-photon imaging for longitudinal, multimodal monitoring of human organoids transplanted in the mouse cortex. The transparency of graphene microelectrodes permits visual and optical inspection of the transplanted organoid and the surrounding cortex throughout the chronic experiments where local field potentials and multi-unit activity (MUA) are recorded during spontaneous activity and visual stimuli. These experiments reveal that visual stimuli evoke electrophysiological responses in the organoid, matching the responses from the surrounding cortex. Increases in the power of the gamma and MUA bands as well as phase locking of MUA events to slow oscillations evoked by visual stimuli suggest functional connectivity established between the human and mouse tissue. Optical imaging through the transparent microelectrodes shows vascularization of the organoids. Postmortem histological analysis exhibits morphological integration and synaptic connectivity with surrounding mouse cortex as well as migration of organoid cells into the surrounding cortex. This novel combination of stem cell and neural recording technologies could serve as a unique platform for comprehensive evaluation of organoids as models of brain development and dysfunction and as personalized neural prosthetics to restore lost, degenerated, or damaged brain regions.

                Performing endovascular medical interventions safely and efficiently requires a diverse set of skills that need to be practised in dedicated training sessions. Here, we used multimodal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to determine the structural and functional plasticity and core skills associated with skill acquisition. A training group learned to perform a simulator-based endovascular procedure, while a control group performed a simplified version of the task; multimodal MR images were acquired before and after training. Using a well-controlled interaction design, we found strong, multimodal evidence for the role of the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) in endovascular skill acquisition that is in line with previous work implicating the structure in simple visuo-motor and mental rotation tasks. Our results provide a unique window into the multimodal nature of rapid structural and functional plasticity of the human brain while learning a multifaceted and complex clinical skill. Further, our results provide a detailed description of the plasticity process associated with endovascular skill acquisition and highlight specific facets of skills that could enhance current medical pedagogy and be useful to explicitly target during clinical resident training.

	<p>An embryo&amp;amp;rsquo;s in-utero exposure to ethanol due to a mother&amp;amp;rsquo;s alcohol drinking results in a range of deficits in the child that are collectively termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Prenatal ethanol exposure is one of the leading causes of preventable intellectual disability. Its neurobehavioral underpinnings warrant systematic research. We investigated the immediate effects on embryos of acute prenatal ethanol exposure during gestational days (GDs) and the influence of such exposure on persistent neurobehavioral deficits in adult offspring. We administered pregnant C57BL/6J mice with ethanol (1.75 g/kg) (GDE) or saline (GDS) intraperitoneally (i.p.) at 0 h and again at 2 h intervals on GD 8 and GD 12. Subsequently, we assessed apoptosis, differentiation, and signaling events in embryo forebrains (E13.5; GD13.5). Long-lasting effects of GDE were evaluated via a behavioral test battery. We also determined the long-term potentiation and synaptic plasticity-related protein expression in adult hippocampal tissue. GDE caused apoptosis, inhibited differentiation, and reduced pERK and pCREB signaling and the expression of transcription factors Pax6 and Lhx2. GDE caused persistent spatial and social investigation memory deficits compared with saline controls, regardless of sex. Interestingly, GDE adult mice exhibited enhanced repetitive and anxiety-like behavior, irrespective of sex. GDE reduced synaptic plasticity-related protein expression and caused hippocampal synaptic plasticity (LTP and LTD) deficits in adult offspring. These findings demonstrate that binge-like ethanol exposure at the GD8 and GD12 developmental stages causes defects in pERK&amp;amp;ndash;pCREB signaling and reduces the expression of Pax6 and Lhx2, leading to impaired cellular differentiation during the embryonic stage. In the adult stage, binge-like ethanol exposure caused persistent synaptic and behavioral abnormalities in adult mice. Furthermore, the findings suggest that combining ethanol exposure at two sensitive stages (GD8 and GD12) causes deficits in synaptic plasticity-associated proteins (Arc, Egr1, Fgf1, GluR1, and GluN1), leading to persistent FASD-like neurobehavioral deficits in mice.</p>

	<p>Brain tumor semantic segmentation is a critical medical image processing work, which aids clinicians in diagnosing patients and determining the extent of lesions. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in computer vision tasks in recent years. For 3D medical image tasks, deep convolutional neural networks based on an encoder&amp;amp;ndash;decoder structure and skip-connection have been frequently used. However, CNNs have the drawback of being unable to learn global and remote semantic information well. On the other hand, the transformer has recently found success in natural language processing and computer vision as a result of its usage of a self-attention mechanism for global information modeling. For demanding prediction tasks, such as 3D medical picture segmentation, local and global characteristics are critical. We propose SwinBTS, a new 3D medical picture segmentation approach, which combines a transformer, convolutional neural network, and encoder&amp;amp;ndash;decoder structure to define the 3D brain tumor semantic segmentation job as a sequence-to-sequence prediction challenge in this research. To extract contextual data, the 3D Swin Transformer is utilized as the network&amp;amp;rsquo;s encoder and decoder, and convolutional operations are employed for upsampling and downsampling. Finally, we achieve segmentation results using an improved Transformer module that we built for increasing detail feature extraction. Extensive experimental results on the BraTS 2019, BraTS 2020, and BraTS 2021 datasets reveal that SwinBTS outperforms state-of-the-art 3D algorithms for brain tumor segmentation on 3D MRI scanned images.</p>

	<p>Maintaining normal gonadal axis hormone levels is important for improving the condition of male patients with pituitary adenoma. The current literature is somewhat divided on the results of evaluations of gonadal axis function in male patients with pituitary adenoma before and after treatment, and the increasing demand for better quality of life has provided motivation for this research to continue. In this article, we summarize the feasibility of using testosterone as an indicator for assessing male function and discuss the changes reported in various studies for gonadal hormones before and after treatment in male patients with pituitary adenoma. It is important for clinicians to understand the advantages of each treatment option and the effectiveness of assessing gonadal function. The rationale behind the theory that pituitary adenomas affect gonadal function and the criteria for evaluating pituitary&amp;amp;ndash;gonadal axis hormones should be explored in more depth.</p>

	<p>Risky decision-making (RDM) is when individuals make choices based on the definite cognition for the probabilities of the options. Risk is embodied in the certainty of reward, and the smaller the probability is, the greater the risk will be. As simulated in human behavior paradigms, RDM scenarios in real life are often guided by external cues that inform the likelihood of receiving certain rewards. There are few studies on the neural basis of RDM behavior guided by external cues, which is related to the relative paucity of the animal behavioral paradigms. Here, we established a cue-guided RDM task to detect the behavior of rats making a decision between a small certain reward and a large uncertain reward in a naturalistic manner. The reward of the risk option could be adjusted to observe the change of choice. Our results showed that: (1) rats were able to master the operation of the cue-guided RDM task; (2) many rats were inclined to choose risk rather than the safe option when the reward expectations were equal; (3) rats were able to adjust the decision strategy in time upon a change in risk, suggesting that they have the ability to perceive risk indicated by the external cues.</p>

	<p>Research on sensorimotor rhythms (SMR) based on neurofeedback (NFb) emphasizes improvements in selective attention associated with SMR amplification. However, the long-term training proposed in most studies posed the question of acceptability, which led to the evaluation of the potential of a single NFb session. Based on cognitive and autonomic controls interfering with attention processes, we hypothesized changes in selective attention after a single SMR-NFb session, along with changes in brain&amp;amp;ndash;heart interplay, which are reflected in the multifractality of heartbeat dynamics. Here, young healthy participants (n = 35, 20 females, 21 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3 years) were randomly assigned either to a control group (Ctrl) watching a movie or to a neurofeedback (NFb) group performing a single session of SMR-NFb. A headset with EEG electrodes (positioned on C3 and C4) connected to a smartphone app served to guide and to evaluate NFb training efficacy. A Stroop task was performed for 8 min by each group before and after the intervention (movie vs. SMR-NFb) while collecting heart rate variability and C4-EEG for 20 min. When compared to Ctrl, the NFb group exhibited better Stroop performance, especially when facing incongruent trials. The multifractality and NFb training efficacy were identified as strong predictors of the gain in global Stroop performance, while multifractality was the only predictor regarding incongruent trials. We conclude that a single session of SMR-NFb improves selective attention in healthy individuals through the specific reorganization of brain&amp;amp;ndash;heart interplay, which is reflected in multifractal heartbeat dynamics.</p>

                <p>This exploratory case–control study investigates the synaptic marker beta-synuclein in serum and plasma pTau181 in adults with Down syndrome (DS) with (sDS, <i>n</i> = 14) and without (aDS, <i>n</i> = 47) clinical symptoms of Alzheimer disease (AD) as well as euploid controls (<i>n</i> = 23). Beta-synuclein was higher in aDS and more pronounced in sDS (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), whereas pTau181 was only higher in sDS (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Both markers showed good discriminatory power (area under the curve &gt; 0.90) to distinguish symptomatic from asymptomatic AD. The data indicate that synaptic alterations belong to the earliest AD-associated events in DS and highlight the value of serum beta-synuclein as a potential early marker of AD.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Collier/Olf/EBF (COE) transcription factors have distinct expression patterns in the developing and mature nervous system. To date, a neurological disease association has been conclusively established for only the <i>Early B-cell Factor-3</i> (<i>EBF3</i>) COE family member through the identification of heterozygous loss-of-function variants in individuals with autism spectrum/neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). Here, we identify a symptom severity risk association with missense variants primarily disrupting the zinc finger domain (ZNF) in <i>EBF3</i>-related NDD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A phenotypic assessment of 41 individuals was combined with a literature meta-analysis for a total of 83 individuals diagnosed with <i>EBF3</i>-related NDD. Quantitative diagnostic phenotypic and symptom severity scales were developed to compare <i>EBF3</i> variant type and location to identify genotype–phenotype correlations. To stratify the effects of <i>EBF3</i> variants disrupting either the DNA-binding domain (DBD) or the ZNF, we used <i>in vivo</i> fruit fly UAS-GAL4 expression and <i>in vitro</i> luciferase assays.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We show that patient symptom severity correlates with <i>EBF3</i> missense variants perturbing the ZNF, which is a key protein domain required for stabilizing the interaction between EBF3 and the target DNA sequence. We found that ZNF-associated variants failed to restore viability in the fruit fly and impaired transcriptional activation. However, the recurrent variant EBF3 p.Arg209Trp in the DBD is capable of partially rescuing viability in the fly and preserved transcriptional activation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We describe a symptom severity risk association with ZNF perturbations and EBF3 loss-of-function in the largest reported cohort to date of EBF3-related NDD patients. This analysis should have potential predictive clinical value for newly identified patients with <i>EBF3</i> gene variants. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:138–153</p>
