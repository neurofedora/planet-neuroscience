              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Two common and distinct forms of variation in human functional brain networks</a></h4>

              
                The cortex has a characteristic layout with specialized functional areas forming distributed large-scale networks. However, substantial work shows striking variation in this organization across people, which relates to differences in behavior. While a dominant assumption is that cortical 'variants' represent boundary shifts in the borders between regions, here we show that variants can also occur at a distance from their typical position, forming ectopic intrusions. Both forms of variants are common across individuals, but the forms differ in their location, network linkages, and activations during tasks. Sub-groups of individuals share similar variant properties, but sub-grouping on the two variant forms appears independent. This work argues that individual differences in brain organization commonly occur in two dissociable forms, border shifts and ectopic intrusions, that must be separately accounted for in the analysis of cortical systems across people. This work expands our knowledge of cortical variation in humans and helps reconceptualize the discussion of how cortical systems variability arises and links to individual differences in behavior.

                Hypercoagulation is a hallmark of both the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It increases the risk for vascular thrombosis, including peripheral artery diseases. Among others, acute limb ischemia (ALI) is one of most common complications that requires immediate and prompt treatments to reduce morbidity and mortality. However, the complex interplay between COVID-19, T2DM and its complications (e.g., diabetic nephropathy), and ALI creates a great challenge in the management of the disease. Here, we present a case of a 59-year-old diabetic female with progressive pain in her left leg in the last five years, which was significantly intensified following COVID-19 diagnosis. Bluish coloration, numbness and functional impairments were observed during examinations with no palpable pulsation on left posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries. The patient also had diabetic nephropathy (stage III), hypoalbuminemia, anemia and a urinary tract infection that complicated the management of the disease. Due to the excruciating pain and the worsening of the limb conditions, right leg revascularization and left leg amputation were performed at day 14 after admission. Following the surgeries, no more pain was observed and patient was discharged for further follow-up at the outpatient clinic.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Genetic dissection of complex traits using hierarchical biological knowledge</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hidenori Tanaka, Jason F. Kreisberg, Trey Ideker</p>

Despite the growing constellation of genetic loci linked to common traits, these loci have yet to account for most heritable variation, and most act through poorly understood mechanisms. Recent machine learning (ML) systems have used hierarchical biological knowledge to associate genetic mutations with phenotypic outcomes, yielding substantial predictive power and mechanistic insight. Here, we use an ontology-guided ML system to map single nucleotide variants (SNVs) focusing on 6 classic phenotypic traits in natural yeast populations. The 29 identified loci are largely novel and account for ~17% of the phenotypic variance, versus <3% for standard genetic analysis. Representative results show that sensitivity to hydroxyurea is linked to SNVs in two alternative purine biosynthesis pathways, and that sensitivity to copper arises through failure to detoxify reactive oxygen species in fatty acid metabolism. This work demonstrates a knowledge-based approach to amplifying and interpreting signals in population genetic studies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Inactivation mode of sodium channels defines the different maximal firing rates of conventional versus atypical midbrain dopamine neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christopher J. Knowlton, Tabea Ines Ziouziou, Niklas Hammer, Jochen Roeper, Carmen C. Canavier</p>

Two subpopulations of midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons are known to have different dynamic firing ranges <i>in vitro</i> that correspond to distinct projection targets: the originally identified conventional DA neurons project to the dorsal striatum and the lateral shell of the nucleus accumbens, whereas an atypical DA population with higher maximum firing frequencies projects to prefrontal regions and other limbic regions including the medial shell of nucleus accumbens. Using a computational model, we show that previously identified differences in biophysical properties do not fully account for the larger dynamic range of the atypical population and predict that the major difference is that originally identified conventional cells have larger occupancy of voltage-gated sodium channels in a long-term inactivated state that recovers slowly; stronger sodium and potassium conductances during action potential firing are also predicted for the conventional compared to the atypical DA population. These differences in sodium channel gating imply that longer intervals between spikes are required in the conventional population for full recovery from long-term inactivation induced by the preceding spike, hence the lower maximum frequency. These same differences can also change the bifurcation structure to account for distinct modes of entry into depolarization block: abrupt versus gradual. The model predicted that in cells that have entered depolarization block, it is much more likely that an additional depolarization can evoke an action potential in conventional DA population. New experiments comparing lateral to medial shell projecting neurons confirmed this model prediction, with implications for differential synaptic integration in the two populations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Envelope reconstruction of speech and music highlights stronger tracking of speech at low frequencies</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nathaniel J. Zuk, Jeremy W. Murphy, Richard B. Reilly, Edmund C. Lalor</p>

The human brain tracks amplitude fluctuations of both speech and music, which reflects acoustic processing in addition to the encoding of higher-order features and one’s cognitive state. Comparing neural tracking of speech and music envelopes can elucidate stimulus-general mechanisms, but direct comparisons are confounded by differences in their envelope spectra. Here, we use a novel method of frequency-constrained reconstruction of stimulus envelopes using EEG recorded during passive listening. We expected to see music reconstruction match speech in a narrow range of frequencies, but instead we found that speech was reconstructed better than music for all frequencies we examined. Additionally, models trained on all stimulus types performed as well or better than the stimulus-specific models at higher modulation frequencies, suggesting a common neural mechanism for tracking speech and music. However, speech envelope tracking at low frequencies, below 1 Hz, was associated with increased weighting over parietal channels, which was not present for the other stimuli. Our results highlight the importance of low-frequency speech tracking and suggest an origin from speech-specific processing in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis of COVID-19 exit strategies in an individual-based transmission model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Federica Gugole, Luc E. Coffeng, Wouter Edeling, Benjamin Sanderse, Sake J. de Vlas, Daan Crommelin</p>

Many countries are currently dealing with the COVID-19 epidemic and are searching for an exit strategy such that life in society can return to normal. To support this search, computational models are used to predict the spread of the virus and to assess the efficacy of policy measures before actual implementation. The model output has to be interpreted carefully though, as computational models are subject to uncertainties. These can stem from, e.g., limited knowledge about input parameters values or from the intrinsic stochastic nature of some computational models. They lead to uncertainties in the model predictions, raising the question what distribution of values the model produces for key indicators of the severity of the epidemic. Here we show how to tackle this question using techniques for uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis. We assess the uncertainties and sensitivities of four exit strategies implemented in an agent-based transmission model with geographical stratification. The exit strategies are termed Flattening the Curve, Contact Tracing, Intermittent Lockdown and Phased Opening. We consider two key indicators of the ability of exit strategies to avoid catastrophic health care overload: the maximum number of prevalent cases in intensive care (IC), and the total number of IC patient-days in excess of IC bed capacity. Our results show that uncertainties not directly related to the exit strategies are secondary, although they should still be considered in comprehensive analysis intended to inform policy makers. The sensitivity analysis discloses the crucial role of the intervention uptake by the population and of the capability to trace infected individuals. Finally, we explore the existence of a safe operating space. For Intermittent Lockdown we find only a small region in the model parameter space where the key indicators of the model stay within safe bounds, whereas this region is larger for the other exit strategies.

Rats and mice use their whiskers to probe the environment. By rhythmically swiping their whiskers back and forth they can detect the existence of an object, locate it, and identify its texture. Localization can be accomplished by inferring the whisker’s position. Rhythmic neurons that track the phase of the whisking cycle encode information about the azimuthal location of the whisker. These neurons are characterized by preferred phases of firing that are narrowly distributed. Consequently, pooling the rhythmic signal from several upstream neurons is expected to result in a much narrower distribution of preferred phases in the downstream population, which however has not been observed empirically. Here, we show how spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) can provide a solution to this conundrum. We investigated the effect of STDP on the utility of a neural population to transmit rhythmic information downstream using the framework of a modeling study. We found that under a wide range of parameters, STDP facilitated the transfer of rhythmic information despite the fact that all the synaptic weights remained dynamic. As a result, the preferred phase of the downstream neuron was not fixed, but rather drifted in time at a drift velocity that depended on the preferred phase, thus inducing a distribution of preferred phases. We further analyzed how the STDP rule governs the distribution of preferred phases in the downstream population. This link between the STDP rule and the distribution of preferred phases constitutes a natural test for our theory.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Hierarchy and control of ageing-related methylation networks</a></h4>

DNA methylation provides one of the most widely studied biomarkers of ageing. Since the methylation of CpG dinucleotides function as switches in cellular mechanisms, it is plausible to assume that by proper adjustment of these switches age may be tuned. Though, adjusting hundreds of CpG methylation levels coherently may never be feasible and changing just a few positions may lead to biologically unstable state.
A prominent example of methylation-based age estimators is provided by Horvath’s clock, based on 353 CpG dinucleotides, showing a high correlation (not necessarily causation) with chronological age across multiple tissue types. On this small subset of CpG dinucleotides we demonstrate how the adjustment of one methylation level leads to a cascade of changes at other sites. Among the studied subset, we locate the most important CpGs (and related genes) that may have a large influence on the rest of the sub-system. According to our analysis, the structure of this network is way more hierarchical compared to what one would expect based on ensembles of uncorrelated connections. Therefore, only a handful of CpGs is enough to modify the system towards a desired state.
When propagation of the change over the network is taken into account, the resulting modification in the predicted age can be significantly larger compared to the effect of isolated CpG perturbations. By adjusting the most influential single CpG site and following the propagation of methylation level changes we can reach up to 5.74 years in virtual age reduction, significantly larger than without taking into account of the network control. Extending our approach to the whole methylation network may identify key nodes that have controller role in the ageing process.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Transcriptomic entropy benchmarks stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte maturation against endogenous tissue at single cell level</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Suraj Kannan, Michael Farid, Brian L. Lin, Matthew Miyamoto, Chulan Kwon</p>

The immaturity of pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived tissues has emerged as a universal problem for their biomedical applications. While efforts have been made to generate adult-like cells from PSCs, direct benchmarking of PSC-derived tissues against <i>in vivo</i> development has not been established. Thus, maturation status is often assessed on an <i>ad-hoc</i> basis. Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers a promising solution, though cross-study comparison is limited by dataset-specific batch effects. Here, we developed a novel approach to quantify PSC-derived cardiomyocyte (CM) maturation through transcriptomic entropy. Transcriptomic entropy is robust across datasets regardless of differences in isolation protocols, library preparation, and other potential batch effects. With this new model, we analyzed over 45 scRNA-seq datasets and over 52,000 CMs, and established a cross-study, cross-species CM maturation reference. This reference enabled us to directly compare PSC-CMs with the <i>in vivo</i> developmental trajectory and thereby to quantify PSC-CM maturation status. We further found that our entropy-based approach can be used for other cell types, including pancreatic beta cells and hepatocytes. Our study presents a biologically relevant and interpretable metric for quantifying PSC-derived tissue maturation, and is extensible to numerous tissue engineering contexts.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Adaptation supports short-term memory in a visual change detection task</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Brian Hu, Marina E. Garrett, Peter A. Groblewski, Douglas R. Ollerenshaw, Jiaqi Shang, Kate Roll, Sahar Manavi, Christof Koch, Shawn R. Olsen, Stefan Mihalas</p>

The maintenance of short-term memories is critical for survival in a dynamically changing world. Previous studies suggest that this memory can be stored in the form of persistent neural activity or using a synaptic mechanism, such as with short-term plasticity. Here, we compare the predictions of these two mechanisms to neural and behavioral measurements in a visual change detection task. Mice were trained to respond to changes in a repeated sequence of natural images while neural activity was recorded using two-photon calcium imaging. We also trained two types of artificial neural networks on the same change detection task as the mice. Following fixed pre-processing using a pretrained convolutional neural network, either a recurrent neural network (RNN) or a feedforward neural network with short-term synaptic depression (STPNet) was trained to the same level of performance as the mice. While both networks are able to learn the task, the STPNet model contains units whose activity are more similar to the <i>in vivo</i> data and produces errors which are more similar to the mice. When images are omitted, an unexpected perturbation which was absent during training, mice often do not respond to the omission but are more likely to respond to the subsequent image. Unlike the RNN model, STPNet produces a similar pattern of behavior. These results suggest that simple neural adaptation mechanisms may serve as an important bottom-up memory signal in this task, which can be used by downstream areas in the decision-making process.

Parasites target the plant immune system for successful colonization. A new study in PLOS Biology reveals that unrelated parasites have evolved effectors that specifically suppress the function of helper nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeats (NLRs), explaining the complex plant–parasite coevolutionary dynamics.

For successful colonization, parasites need to target the plant immune system. This Primer explores a new study in PLOS Biology which reveal that unrelated parasites have evolved effectors which specifically suppress the function of helper NLRs, explaining the complex plant-parasite coevolutionary dynamics.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Salivary biomarkers associated with the progression of disease in people living with HIV: A scoping review protocol [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Biomarkers are measurable indicators of normal biological processes, which provide an objective assessment of the physiologic state of living systems. Saliva contains several biomarkers that serve as a diagnostic tool in health and disease. Evaluation of a multitude of salivary components could potentially predict the clinical outcome. This is especially critical in a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Scrupulous evaluation of relevant biomarkers could facilitate the early detection of HIV, determine the stage of infection and monitor the disease progression. Currently, there is a paucity of validated biomarkers in saliva predicting the disease progression in people living with HIV. In this scoping review, we aim to provide an overview of the available evidence on salivary markers associated with the progression of disease in people living with HIV. Methods: The authors shall develop a tailored search strategy for each database using relevant keywords. We will search for eligible studies indexed in the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and gray literature. We will restrict the search to studies published in the English language. Following deduplication, all search results will be exported to the EPPI reviewer web, where two independent reviewers using a data extraction tool developed and pretested by the review authors will screen eligible studies. The result of this review will be reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist and reporting guidelines. Discussion: The proposed scoping review protocol will enable the identification and assessment of salivary biomarkers, which can predict disease progression in patients with HIV infection. The synthesis of evidence from this review will assist in improving our current understanding of biomarkers used to evaluate the progression of HIV infection.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Pulmonary function parameters among marble industry workers in Lahore, Pakistan [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Occupational contact with dust particles is a well-known phenomenon, particularly in developing countries of the world. Crystalline silica present in marble dust is the main etiology of a rising prevalence of obstructive lung diseases in marble stone workers, who are in direct contact with marble dust in the surrounding environment during their regular work.  The purpose of this study was to compare the pulmonary function parameters of workers in marble workshops and age matched healthy individuals in the Lahore District of Pakistan. Methods: The study included 164 male individuals, 82 individuals working in marble workshops and 82 healthy individuals from the same community. Data were collected through in-person interviews using a structured questionnaire after obtaining written consent. A Spiro Lab spirometry for pulmonary function tests was used to identify any change in the lung function parameters. FVC% (forced vital capacity), FEV 1 (forced expiratory volume in first second) and FEV1 / FVC ratio were evaluated. Results: Mean age in the exposed group (marble workers) and non-exposed group (healthy individuals) were 29.92 ± 6.19 and 30.58 ± 6.37 years, respectively. The mean years of work experience of the exposed group was 11.92 ± 5.67 years. A statistically insignificant difference was observed between marble exposed workers & healthy individuals from the demographic variables. Lung function parameters in marble workers exhibited a highly significant (P < 0.001) decrease in FVC%, FEV1 & FEV1 / FVC ratio when compared to healthy individuals. Seventy-one percent of marble workers had abnormal pulmonary parameters whereas 34% of workers had restrictive pulmonary impairment. Marble workers who had worked for more than 15 years had a highly significant risk of developing abnormal pulmonary function (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Continuous exposure to marble dust deteriorates the lung function of marble workers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A hybrid recommender system based on data enrichment on the ontology modelling [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A recommender system captures the user preferences and behaviour to provide a relevant recommendation to the user. In a hybrid model-based recommender system, it requires a pre-trained data model to generate recommendations for a user. Ontology helps to represent the semantic information and relationships to model the expressivity and linkage among the data. Methods: We enhanced the matrix factorization model accuracy by utilizing ontology to enrich the information of the user-item matrix by integrating the item-based and user-based collaborative filtering techniques. In particular, the combination of enriched data, which consists of semantic similarity together with rating pattern, will help to reduce the cold start problem in the model-based recommender system. When the new user or item first coming into the system, we have the user demographic or item profile that linked to our ontology. Thus, semantic similarity can be calculated during the item-based and user-based collaborating filtering process. The item-based and user-based filtering process are used to predict the unknown rating of the original matrix. Results: Experimental evaluations have been carried out on the MovieLens 100k dataset to demonstrate the accuracy rate of our proposed approach as compared to the baseline method using (i) Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and (ii) combination of item-based collaborative filtering technique with SVD. Experimental results demonstrated that our proposed method has reduced the data sparsity from 0.9542% to 0.8435%. In addition, it also indicated that our proposed method has achieved better accuracy with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.9298, as compared to the baseline method (RMSE: 0.9642) and the existing method (RMSE: 0.9492). Conclusions: Our proposed method enhanced the dataset information by integrating user-based and item-based collaborative filtering techniques. The experiment results shows that our system has reduced the data sparsity and has better accuracy as compared to baseline method and existing method.

                Despite the intervention of WHO on vaccination for reducing the spread of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), there are records of the high prevalence of HBV in some regions. In this paper, a mathematical model was formulated to analyze the acquisition and transmission process of the virus with the view of identifying the possible way of reducing the menace and mitigating the risk of the virus. The models' positivity and boundedness were demonstrated using well-known theorems. Equating the differential equations to zero demonstrates the equilibria of the solutions i.e., the disease-free and endemic equilibrium. The next Generation Matrix method was used to compute the basic reproduction number for the models. Local and global stabilities of the models were shown via linearization and Lyapunov function methods respectively. The importance of testing and treatment on the dynamics of HBV were fully discussed in this paper. It was discovered that testing at the acute stage of the virus and chronic unaware state helps in better management of the virus.

                Background: Low Birth Weight (LBW) is a global health concern for childhood mortality and morbidity. The objectives of this study were to assess the association between the number of Antenatal Care Visits (ANC) and LBW among Bangladeshi newborns, and to identify the demographic and socio-economic predictors of LBW.   Methods: Our present cross-sectional study is based on the secondary data of the Bangladesh Demography and Health Survey (BDHS) 2014. Complete data of 4,235 (weighted) mother-child pairs were included in the analysis.   Results: The overall prevalence of LBW among newborns were found to be 19.3% (95% CI: 17.8-20.9). Among the mothers who received antenatal care services 1-3 times during pregnancy, 35% had less possibility of having LBW babies [COR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.50-0.85]. The association remained significant after adjusting the analysis with the sex of the newborn, administrative regions (division), maternal educational status, mother’s weight status and fathers’ occupation [AOR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.55-0.99]. Additionally, the sex of the newborn, division, maternal education, maternal weight status, and fathers’ occupational status were found to be significantly associated with LBW.   Conclusion: Increasing the coverage of antenatal services and enabling mothers to receive quality antenatal services may substantially contribute to reducing the prevalence of LBW in Bangladesh.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">PARROT is a flexible recurrent neural network framework for analysis of large protein datasets</a></h4>

              
                The rise of high-throughput experiments has transformed how scientists approach biological questions. The ubiquity of large-scale assays that can test thousands of samples in a day has necessitated the development of new computational approaches to interpret this data. Among these tools, machine learning approaches are increasingly being utilized due to their ability to infer complex nonlinear patterns from high-dimensional data. Despite their effectiveness, machine learning (and in particular deep learning) approaches are not always accessible or easy to implement for those with limited computational expertise. Here we present PARROT, a general framework for training and applying deep learning-based predictors on large protein datasets. Using an internal recurrent neural network architecture, PARROT is capable of tackling both classification and regression tasks while only requiring raw protein sequences as input. We showcase the potential uses of PARROT on three diverse machine learning tasks: predicting phosphorylation sites, predicting transcriptional activation function of peptides generated by high-throughput reporter assays, and predicting the fibrillization propensity of amyloid beta with data generated by deep mutational scanning. Through these examples, we demonstrate that PARROT is easy to use, performs comparably to state-of-the-art computational tools, and is applicable for a wide array of biological problems.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structural characterization of NrnC identifies unifying features of dinucleotidases</a></h4>

              
                RNA degradation is fundamental for cellular homeostasis. The process is carried out by various classes of endolytic and exolytic enzymes that together degrade an RNA polymer to mono-ribonucleotides. Within the exoribonucleases, nano-RNases play a unique role as they act on the smallest breakdown products and hence catalyze the final steps in the process. We recently showed that oligoribonuclease (Orn) acts as a dedicated diribonucleotidase, defining the ultimate step in RNA degradation that is crucial for cellular fitness (Kim et al., 2019). Whether such a specific activity exists in organisms that lack Orn-type exoribonucleases remained unclear. Through quantitative structure-function analyses we show here that NrnC-type RNases share this narrow substrate length preference with Orn. Although NrnC employs similar structural features that distinguish these two classes as dinucleotidases from other exonucleases, the key determinants for dinucleotidase activity are realized through distinct structural scaffolds. The structures together with comparative genomic analyses of the phylogeny of DEDD-type exoribonucleases indicates convergent evolution as the mechanism of how dinucleotidase activity emerged repeatedly in various organisms. The evolutionary pressure to maintain dinucleotidase activity further underlines the important role these analogous proteins play for cell growth.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Characterizing human mobility patterns in rural settings of sub-Saharan Africa</a></h4>

              
                Human mobility is a core component of human behavior and its quantification is critical for understanding its impact on infectious disease transmission, traffic forecasting, access to resources and care, intervention strategies, and migratory flows. When mobility data are limited, spatial interaction models have been widely used to estimate human travel, but have not been extensively validated in low- and middle-income settings. Geographic, sociodemographic, and infrastructure differences may impact the ability for models to capture these patterns, particularly in rural settings. Here, we analyzed mobility patterns inferred from mobile phone data in four Sub-Saharan African countries to investigate the ability for variants on gravity and radiation models to estimate travel. Adjusting the gravity model such that parameters were fit to different trip types, including travel between more or less populated areas and/or different regions, improved model fit in all four countries. This suggests that alternative models may be more useful in these settings and better able to capture the range of mobility patterns observed.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Monocyte-derived transcriptome signature indicates antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis as a potential mechanism of vaccine-induced protection against HIV-1</a></h4>

              
                A gene signature previously correlated with mosaic adenovirus 26 vaccine protection in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and SHIV challenge models in non-human primates (NHP). In this report we investigated presence of this signature as a correlate of reduced risk in human clinical trials and potential mechanisms of protection. The absence of this gene signature in the DNA/rAd5 human vaccine trial, which did not show efficacy, strengthens our hypothesis that this signature is only enriched in studies that demonstrated protection. This gene signature was enriched in the partially effective RV144 human trial that administered the ALVAC/protein vaccine, and we find that the signature associates with both decreased risk of HIV-1 acquisition and increased vaccine efficacy. Total RNA-seq in a clinical trial that used the same vaccine regimen as the RV144 HIV vaccine implicated antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) as a potential mechanism of vaccine protection. CITE-seq profiling of 53 surface markers and transcriptomes of 53,777 single cells from the same trial showed that genes in this signature were primarily expressed in cells belonging to the myeloid lineage, including monocytes, which are major effector cells for ADCP. The consistent association of this transcriptome signature with vaccine efficacy represents a tool both to identify potential mechanisms, as with ADCP here, and to screen novel approaches to accelerate development of new vaccine candidates.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Gamete expression of TALE class HD genes activates the diploid sporophyte program in Marchantia polymorpha</a></h4>

              
                Eukaryotic life cycles alternate between haploid and diploid phases and in phylogenetically diverse unicellular eukaryotes, expression of paralogous homeodomain genes in gametes primes the haploid-to-diploid transition. In the unicellular Chlorophyte alga <i>Chlamydomonas</i> KNOX and BELL TALE-homeodomain genes mediate this transition. We demonstrate that in the liverwort <i>Marchantia polymorpha</i> paternal (sperm) expression of three of five phylogenetically diverse BELL genes, Mp<i>BELL234</i>, and maternal (egg) expression of both Mp<i>KNOX1</i> and Mp<i>BELL34 </i>mediate the haploid-to-diploid transition. Loss-of-function alleles of Mp<i>KNOX1</i> result in zygotic arrest, whereas loss of either maternal or paternal Mp<i>BELL234</i> results in variable zygotic and early embryonic arrest. Expression of Mp<i>KNOX1</i> and Mp<i>BELL34</i> during diploid sporophyte development is consistent with a later role for these genes in patterning the sporophyte. These results indicate that the ancestral mechanism to activate diploid gene expression was retained in early diverging land plants and subsequently co-opted during evolution of the diploid sporophyte body.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ectocytosis prevents accumulation of ciliary cargo in C. elegans sensory neurons</a></h4>

              
                Cilia are sensory organelles protruding from cell surfaces. Release of Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) from cilia was previously observed in mammals, Chlamydomonas, and in male <i>C. elegans</i>. Using the EV marker TSP-6 (an ortholog of mammalian CD9) and other ciliary receptors, we show that EVs are formed from ciliated sensory neurons in <i>C. elegans</i> hermaphrodites. Release of EVs is observed from two ciliary locations: the cilia tip and/or Periciliary Membrane Compartment (PCMC). Outward budding of EVs from the cilia tip leads to their release into the environment. EVs budding from the PCMC are concomitantly phagocytosed by the associated glial cells. To maintain cilia composition, a tight regulation of cargo import and removal is achieved by the action of Intra-Flagellar Transport (IFT). Unbalanced IFT due to cargo overexpression or mutations in the IFT machinery leads to local accumulation of ciliary proteins. Disposal of excess ciliary proteins via EVs reduces their local accumulation and exports them to the environment and/or to the glia associated to these ciliated neurons. We suggest that EV budding from cilia subcompartments acts as a safeguard mechanism to remove deleterious excess of ciliary material.

                Animals seeking survival needs must be able to assess different locations of threats in their habitat. However, the neural integration of spatial and risk information essential for guiding goal-directed behavior remains poorly understood. Thus, we investigated simultaneous activities of fear-responsive basal amygdala (BA) and place-responsive dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) neurons as rats left the safe nest to search for food in an exposed space and encountered a simulated 'predator'. In this realistic situation, BA cells increased their firing rates and dHPC place cells decreased their spatial stability near the threat. Importantly, only those dHPC cells synchronized with the predator-responsive BA cells remapped significantly as a function of escalating risk location. Moreover, optogenetic stimulation of BA neurons was sufficient to cause spatial avoidance behavior and disrupt place fields. These results suggest a dynamic interaction of BA's fear signalling cells and dHPC's spatial coding cells as animals traverse safe-danger areas of their environment.

                Sensory input arrives from thalamus in cortical layer (L) 4, from which it flows predominantly to superficial layers, so that L4 to L2 constitutes one of the earliest cortical feedforward networks. Despite extensive study, the transformation performed by this network remains poorly understood. We use two-photon calcium imaging in L2-4 of primary vibrissal somatosensory cortex (vS1) to record neural activity as mice perform an object localization task with two whiskers. We find that touch responses sparsen but become more reliable from L4 to L2, with superficial neurons responding to a broader range of touches. Decoding of sensory features either improves from L4 to L2 or remains unchanged. Pairwise correlations increase superficially, with L2/3 containing ensembles of mostly broadly tuned neurons responding robustly to touch. Thus, from L4 to L2, cortex transitions from a dense probabilistic code to a sparse and robust ensemble-based code that improves stimulus decoding, facilitating perception.

                The cerebellum's involvement in cognitive, affective and motor functions is mediated by connections to different regions of the cerebral cortex. A distinctive feature of cortico-cerebellar loops that has been demonstrated in the animal work is a topographic organization that is preserved across its different components. Here we used diffusion imaging tractography to characterize the connections between the pons and the individual lobules of the cerebellum, and generate a classification of the pons based on its pattern of connectivity. We identified a rostral to caudal gradient in the pons, similar to that observed in the animal work, such that rostral regions were preferentially connected to cerebellar lobules involved in non-motor, and caudal regions with motor regions. These findings advance our fundamental understanding of the cerebellum, and the classifications we generated provide context for future research into the pontocerebellar tract's involvement in health and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Long-term Motor Learning in the Wild with High Volume Video Game Data</a></h4>

              
                Motor learning occurs over long periods of practice during which motor acuity (the ability to execute actions more accurately, precisely, and within a shorter amount of time) improves. Laboratory-based motor learning studies are typically limited to a small number of participants and a time frame of minutes to several hours per participant. Thus, there is a need to assess the generalizability of theories and findings from lab-based motor learning studies on much larger samples across longer time scales. In addition, laboratory-based studies of motor learning use relatively simple motor tasks which participants are unlikely to be intrinsically motivated to learn, limiting the interpretation of their findings in more ecologically valid settings. We studied the acquisition and longitudinal refinement of a complex sensorimotor skill embodied in a first-person shooter video game scenario, with a large sample size (N = 7174 participants, 682,564 repeats of the 60 sec game) over a period of months. Participants voluntarily practiced the gaming scenario for as much as several hours per day up to 100 days. We found improvement in performance accuracy (quantified as hit rate) was modest over time but motor acuity (quantified as hits per second) improved considerably, with 40-60% retention from one day to the next. We observed steady improvements in motor acuity across multiple days of video game practice, unlike most motor learning tasks studied in the lab that hit a performance ceiling rather quickly. Learning rate was a nonlinear function of baseline performance level, amount of daily practice, and to a lesser extent, number of days between practice sessions. In addition, we found that the benefit of additional practice on any given day was non-monotonic; the greatest improvements in motor acuity were evident with about an hour of practice and 90% of the learning benefit was achieved by practicing 30 minutes per day. Taken together, these results provide a proof-of-concept in studying motor skill acquisition outside the confines of the traditional laboratory and provide new insights into how a complex motor skill is acquired in an ecologically valid setting and refined across much longer time scales than typically explored.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An EEG study on the effect of being overweight on anticipatory and consummatory reward in response to pleasant taste stimuli</a></h4>

              
                Two-thirds of adults in the United Kingdom currently suffer from overweight or obesity, making it one of the biggest contributors to health problems. Within the framework of the incentive sensitisation theory, it has been hypothesised that overweight people experience heightened reward anticipation when encountering cues that signal food, such as pictures and smells of food, but that they experience less reward from consuming food compared to normal-weight people. There is, however, little evidence for this prediction. Few studies test both anticipation and consumption in the same study, and even fewer with electroencephalography (EEG). This study sought to address this gap in the literature by measuring scalp activity when overweight and normal-weight people encountered cues signalling the imminent arrival of pleasant and neutral taste stimuli, and when they received these stimuli. The behavioural data showed that there was a smaller difference in valence ratings between the pleasant and neutral taste in the overweight than normal-weight group, in accordance with our hypothesis. However, contrary to our hypothesis, the groups did not differ in their electrophysiological response to taste stimuli. Instead, there was a reduction in N1 amplitude to both taste and picture cues in overweight relative to normal-weight participants. This suggests that reduced attention to cues may be a crucial factor in risk of overweight.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Increased temporal discounting and reduced model-based control in problem gambling are not substantially modulated by exposure to virtual gambling environments.</a></h4>

              
                High-performance virtual reality (VR) technology has opened new possibilities for the examination of the reactivity towards addiction-related cues (cue-reactivity) in addiction. In this preregistered study (https://osf.io/4mrta), we investigated the subjective, physiological, and behavioral effects of gambling-related VR environment exposure in participants reporting frequent or pathological gambling (n=31) as well as non-gambling controls (n=29). On two separate days, participants explored two rich and navigable VR-environments (neutral: cafe vs. gambling-related: casino/sports-betting facility), while electrodermal activity and heart rate were continuously measured using remote sensors. Within VR, participants performed a temporal discounting task and a sequential decision-making task designed to assess model-based and model-free contributions to behavior. Replicating previous findings, we found strong evidence for increased temporal discounting and reduced model-based control in participants reporting frequent or pathological gambling. Although VR gambling environment exposure increased subjective craving, there was if anything inconclusive evidence for further behavioral or physiological effects. Instead, VR exposure substantially increased physiological arousal (electrodermal activity), across groups and conditions. VR is a promising tool for the investigation of context effects in addiction, but some caution is warranted since effects of real gambling environments might not generally replicate in VR. Future studies should delineate how factors such as cognitive load and ecological validity could be balanced to create a more naturalistic VR experience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">DYNAMICS OF NEUROMUSCULAR TRANSMISSION REPRODUCED BY CALCIUM-DEPENDENT SERIAL TRANSITIONS IN THE VESICLE FUSION COMPLEX</a></h4>

              
                Neuromuscular transmission, from spontaneous release to facilitation and depression was accurately reproduced by a mechanistic kinetic model of sequential maturation transitions in the molecular fusion complex. The model incorporates three predictions. First, sequential calcium-dependent forward transitions take vesicles from docked to pre-primed to primed states, followed by fusion. Second, pre-priming and priming are reversible. Third, fusion and recycling are unidirectional. The model was fed with experimental data from previous studies while the backward ({beta}) and recycling ({rho}) rate constant values were fitted. Classical experiments were successfully reproduced when every forward () rate constant had the same value, and both backward rate constants were 50-100 times larger. Such disproportion originated an abruptly decreasing gradient of resting vesicles from docked to primed states. Simulations also predict that: i. Spontaneous release reflects primed to fusion spontaneous transitions. ii. Calcium elevations synchronize the series of forward transitions that lead to fusion. iii Facilitation reflects a transient increase of priming following calcium-dependent transitions. iv. Backward transitions and recycling restore the resting state. v. Depression reflects backward transitions and slow recycling after intense release. Such finely-tuned kinetics offers a mechanism for collective non-linear transitional adaptations of a homogeneous vesicle pool to an ever-changing pattern of electrical activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Circuit contributions to sensory-driven glutamatergic drive of olfactory bulb mitral and tufted cells during odorant inhalation</a></h4>

              
                In the mammalian olfactory bulb (OB), mitral/tufted (MT) cells respond to odorant inhalation with diverse temporal patterns that are thought to encode odor information. Much of this diversity is already apparent at the level of glutamatergic input to MT cells, which receive direct, monosynaptic excitatory input from olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) as well as multisynaptic excitatory drive via glutamatergic interneurons. Both pathways are also subject to modulation by inhibitory circuits in the glomerular layer of the OB. To understand the role of direct OSN input versus postsynaptic OB circuit mechanisms in shaping diverse dynamics of glutamatergic drive to MT cells, we imaged glutamate signaling onto MT cell dendrites in anesthetized mice while blocking multisynaptic excitatory drive with ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists and blocking presynaptic modulation of glutamate release from OSNs with GABAB receptor antagonists. GABAB receptor blockade increased the magnitude of inhalation-linked glutamate transients onto MT cell apical dendrites without altering their inhalation-linked dynamics, confirming that presynaptic inhibition impacts the gain of OSN inputs to the OB. Surprisingly, blockade of multisynaptic excitation only modestly impacted glutamatergic input to MT cells, causing a slight reduction in the amplitude of inhalation-linked glutamate transients in response to low odorant concentrations and no change in the dynamics of each transient. Postsynaptic blockade also modestly impacted glutamate dynamics over a slower timescale, mainly by reducing adaptation of the glutamate response across multiple inhalations of odorant. These results suggest that direct glutamatergic input from OSNs provides the bulk of excitatory drive to MT cells, and that diversity in the dynamics of this input may be a primary determinant of the temporal diversity in MT cell responses that underlies odor representations at this stage.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spatiotemporal components of sustained functional hyperemia are differentially modulated by locomotion and silenced with vascular chemogenetics</a></h4>

              
                Neural activity underlying sensation, movement or cognition drives regional blood flow enhancement (termed functional hyperemia) to increase the oxygen supply to respiring cells for as long as needed to meet energy demands. However, functional hyperemia is often studied under anesthesia which typically yields response profiles that appear temporally and spatially homogenous. We have insufficient understanding of the underlying kinetics of oxygen delivery in awake animals, especially during specific behaviours that may influence neurally-driven enhancements in cerebral blood flow. Using widefield intrinsic optical signal imaging in awake, head-fixed but active mice, we demonstrated distinct early and late components to changes in intravascular oxygenation in response to sustained (30s) whisker stimulation. We found that the late component (20-30s), but not the early component (1-5s), was strongly influenced by level of whisking/locomotion in the region of highest response and in surrounding regions. Optical flow analyses revealed complex yet stereotyped spatial properties of the early and late components that were related to location within the optical window and the initial state of the cerebral vasculature. In attempt to control these complex response characteristics, we drove a canonical microvasculature constriction pathway using mural cell Gq-chemogenetic mice. A low-dose of systemic C21 strongly limited both the magnitude and spatial extent of the sensory-evoked hemodynamic response, showing that functional hyperemia can be severely limited by direct mural cell activation. These data provide new insights into the cerebral microcirculation in the awake state and may have implications for interpreting functional imaging data.

                White matter supports critical brain functions such as learning and memory, modulates the distribution of action potentials, and acts as a relay of neural communication between different brain regions. Interestingly, neuronal cell bodies exist in deeper white matter tissue, neurotransmitter vesicles are released directly in white matter, and white matter blood-oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals are detectable across a range of different tasks -- all appearing to reflect intrinsic electrical signals in white matter. Yet, such signals within white matter have largely been ignored. Here, we elucidate the properties of white matter signals using intracranial EEG. We show that such signals capture the communication between brain regions and differentiate pathophysiologies of epilepsy. In direct contradiction to past assumptions about white matter inactivity, we show that white matter recordings can elucidate brain function and pathophysiology not apparent in gray matter. Broadly, white matter functional recordings acquired through implantable devices may provide a wealth of currently untapped knowledge about the neurobiology of disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hippocampus maintains a flexible and coherent map under reward flavor-landmark cue conflict.</a></h4>

              
                Animals predominantly use salient visual cues (landmarks) for efficient navigation over other sensory modalities. When the relative position of the visual cues is altered, the hippocampal population exhibits heterogeneous responses and constructs context-specific spatial maps. Another critical factor that can strongly modulate spatial representation is the presence of reward. Reward features can drive behavior and are known to bias spatial attention. However, it is unclear whether reward flavors are used for spatial reference in the presence of distal cues and how the hippocampus population dynamics changes when the association between reward flavors and distal cues is altered. We investigated these questions by recording place cells from the CA1 while the rats ran in an environment with the conflicting association between reward flavors and distal cues. We report that the hippocampal place cells coherently and dynamically bind to reward flavors or distal cues across sessions, but not simultaneously suggesting the use of a single spatial map. We found that place cells maintained their spatial offset in the cue conflict conditions, thus showing a robust spatial coupling featuring an attractor-like property in the CA1. When the textures were added on the track, the coherency of the CA1 is degraded, as the hippocampus showed a heterogeneous response and weak spatial coupling of co-recorded cells suggesting a break away from the attractor network. These results indicate that reward flavors alone may be used for spatial reference but may not cause sufficient input difference to create context-specific spatial maps in the CA1.

                Under physiological conditions in vivo astrocytes internalize and degrade neuronal mitochondria in a process called transmitophagy. Mitophagy is widely reported to be impaired in neurodegeneration but it is unknown whether and how transmitophagy is altered in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we report that the internalization and degradation of neuronal mitochondria are significantly increased in astrocytes isolated from aged AD mouse brains. We also demonstrate for the first time a similar phenomenon between human neurons and AD astrocytes, and in murine hippocampi in vivo. The results suggest the involvement of S100a4 in impaired mitochondrial transfer between neurons and aged AD astrocytes. Significant increases in the mitophagy regulator Ambra1 were observed in the aged AD astrocytes. These findings demonstrate altered neuron-supporting functions of aged AD astrocytes and provide a starting point for studying the molecular mechanisms of transmitophagy in AD.

                Discovery of molecules in living systems and demonstration of their functional roles are pivotal in furthering our understanding of the molecular basis of biology. ppGpp (guanosine-5-diphosphate, 3-diphosphate) has been detected in prokaryotes for more than five decades. Here we report that a genetic screen followed by chemical analysis revealed the presence of ppGpp in Drosophila.It can be detected in germ-free Drosophila and its level is controlled by an enzyme encoded by the mesh1 gene in Drosophila. Loss of function mutations in mesh1, which encoded the ppGpp degrading enzyme led to longer sleep latency and less total sleep. These phenotypes could be rescued by wild type mesh1, but not by the enzymatically defective mutant Mesh1E66A, functionally implicating ppGpp. Ectopic expression of RelA, the E. colisynthetase for ppGpp, phenocopied mesh1 knockout mutants, whereas overexpression of mesh1 resulted in the opposite phenotypes, supporting that ppGpp is both necessary and sufficient in sleep regulation. mesh1 is expressed in a specific population of neurons, and a chemoconnectomic screen followed by genetic intersection experiments implicate the pars intercerebralis (PI) as the site of ppGpp function. Our results have thus revealed that ppGpp is present in animals after long lag since its discovery in bacteria. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that ppGpp in a specific subset of neurons plays a physiological role in regulating sleep.

                Correlated variability (spike count correlations, rSC) in a population of neurons can constrain how information is read out, depending on behavioral task and neuronal tuning. Here we tested whether rSC also depends on neuronal functional class. We recorded from populations of neurons in macaque superior colliculus (SC), a structure that contains well-defined functional classes. We found that during a guided saccade task, different classes of neurons exhibited differing degrees of rSC. "Delay class" neurons displayed the highest rSC, especially during the delay epoch of saccade tasks that relied on working memory. This was only present among Delay class neurons within the same hemisphere. The dependence of rSC on functional class indicates that subpopulations of SC neurons occupy distinct circuit niches with distinct inputs. Such subpopulations should be accounted for differentially when attempting to model or infer population coding principles in the SC, or elsewhere in the primate brain.

                Despite disagreement about how anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) supports decision making, a recent hypothesis suggests that activity in this region is best understood in the context of a task or series of tasks. One important task-level variable is average reward because it is both a known driver of effortful behaviour and an important determiner of the tasks in which we choose to engage. Here we asked how average task value affects reward-related ACC activity. To answer this question, we measured a reward-related signal said to be generated in ACC called the reward positivity (RewP) while participants gambled in three tasks of differing average value. The RewP was reduced in the high-value task, an effect that was not explainable by either reward magnitude or outcome expectancy. Average task value also affected cue-locked frontal midline theta (FMT), an ACC signal linked to cognitive control: FMT was enhanced for low-value cues relative to high-value cues. This effect was related to behaviour, as the more FMT a participant exhibited, the better they performed. These results suggest that ACC does not evaluate outcomes and cues in isolation, but in the context of the value of the current task.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Deletion or inhibition of astrocytic transglutaminase 2 promotes functional recovery after spinal cord injury</a></h4>

              
                Following CNS injury astrocytes become reactive and exhibit pro-regenerative or harmful properties. However, the molecular mechanisms that cause astrocytes to adopt either phenotype are not well understood. Transglutaminase 2 (TG2) plays a key role in regulating the response of astrocytes to insults. Here we used mice in which TG2 was specifically deleted in astrocytes (Gfap-Cre+/- TG2fl/fl, referred to here as TG2-A-cKO) in a spinal cord contusion injury (SCI) model. Deletion of TG2 from astrocytes resulted in a significant improvement in motor function following SCI. GFAP and NG2 immunoreactivity, as well as number of SOX9 positive cells, were significantly reduced in TG2-A-cKO mice. RNA-seq analysis of spinal cords from TG2-A-cKO and control mice 3 days postinjury identified thirty-seven differentially expressed genes, all of which were increased in TG2-A-cKO mice. Pathway analysis reveals a prevalence for fatty acid metabolism, lipid storage and energy pathways, which play essential roles in neuron-astrocyte metabolic coupling. Excitingly, treatment of wild type mice with the selective TG2 inhibitor VA4 significantly improved functional recovery after SCI, similar to what was observed using the genetic model. These findings indicate the use of TG2 inhibitors as a novel strategy for the treatment of SCI and other CNS injuries.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Episodic memory precision and reality monitoring following stimulation of angular gyrus</a></h4>

              
                The qualities of remembered experiences are often used to inform 'reality monitoring' judgments, our ability to distinguish real and imagined events (Johnson & Raye, 1981). Previous experiments have tended to investigate only whether reality monitoring decisions are accurate or not, providing little insight into the extent to which reality monitoring may be affected by qualities of the underlying mnemonic representations. We used a continuous-response memory precision task to measure the quality of remembered experiences that underlie two different types of reality monitoring decisions: agency decisions that distinguish actions performed by participants and the experimenter, and perceptual decisions that distinguish perceived and imagined experiences. The data revealed memory precision to be associated with higher accuracy in both agency and perceptual reality monitoring decisions, with reduced precision linked with a tendency to misattribute self-generated experiences to external sources. We then sought to investigate the possible neurocognitive basis of these observed associations by applying brain stimulation to a region that has been implicated in precise recollection of personal events, left angular gyrus. Stimulation of angular gyrus selectively reduced the association between memory precision and self-referential reality monitoring decisions, relative to control site stimulation. Angular gyrus may, therefore, be important for the ability to imbue remembered experiences with a sense of self-agency, a key component of 'autonoetic consciousness' that characterises episodic memory (Tulving, 1985).

                Pavlovian fear conditioning is widely used to study mechanisms of fear learning, but high-throughput studies are hampered by the labor-intensive nature of examining participants in the lab. To circumvent this bottle-neck, fear conditioning tasks have been developed for remote delivery. Previous studies have examined remotely delivered fear conditioning protocols using expectancy ratings and affective ratings. Here we replicate and extend these findings using an internet-delivered version of the Screaming Lady paradigm, evaluating the effects on negative affective ratings and response time to an auditory probe during stimulus presentations. In a sample of 80 adults, we observed clear evidence of both fear acquisition and extinction using affective ratings. Response times were faster when probed early, but not later, during presentation of stimuli paired with an aversive scream. The response time findings are at odds with previous lab-based studies showing slower responses to threat-predicting cues. The findings underscore the feasibility of employing remotely delivered fear conditioning paradigms with affective ratings as outcome, and highlights the need for further research examining optimal parameters for concurrent response time measures or alternate modes of non-verbal estimation of conditioned responses in Pavlovian conditioning protocols.

                Regular musical activity as a highly-stimulating lifestyle activity is proposed to be protective against age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study investigated associations between lifelong regular musical instrument playing, late-life cognitive abilities and brain morphology in older adults. We show that musical activity over the life course is associated with better global cognition, working memory, executive functions, language, and visuospatial abilities accounting for reserve proxies. Playing music is not significantly associated with gray matter volume in regions most affected by aging and AD. Selectively in the musically active participants, multi-domain cognitive abilities were enhanced with preserved gray matter volume in frontal and temporal regions. Our correlational findings suggest that playing a musical instrument may improve the recruitment of existing brain resources to facilitate late-life cognitive capacities. We propose that engaging in regular musical activity could serve as a low-threshold multimodal enrichment strategy that may promote cognitive resilience in advanced age.

                Background The impact of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on cortical neurons is currently hard to predict based on a priori biophysical and anatomical knowledge alone. This problem can hamper the reliability and reproducibility of protocols aimed at measuring electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to TMS. New Method We introduce and release a novel software tool to facilitate and standardize the acquisition of TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs). The tool, rt-TEP (real-time TEP), interfaces with different EEG amplifiers and offers a series of informative visualization modes to assess in real time the immediate impact of TMS on the underlying neuronal circuits. Results We show that rt-TEP can be used to abolish or minimize magnetic and muscle artifacts contaminating the post-stimulus period thus affording a clear visualization and quantification of the amplitude of the early (<50 ms) EEG response after averaging a limited number of trials. This real-time readout can then be used to adjust TMS parameters (e.g. site, orientation, intensity) and experimental settings (e.g. loudness and/or spectral features of the noise masking) to ultimately maximize direct cortical effects over the undesired sensory effects of the coil's discharge. Comparison with Existing Methods The ensemble of real-time visualization modes of rt-TEP are not implemented in any current commercial software and provide a key readout to titrate TMS parameters beyond the a priori information provided by anatomical models. Conclusions Real-time optimization of stimulation parameters with rt-TEP can facilitate the acquisition of reliable TEPs with a high signal-to-noise ratio and improve the standardization and reproducibility of data collection across laboratories.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Relationships between individual differences in dual process and electrophysiological signatures of familiarity and recollection during retrieval</a></h4>

              
                Our everyday memories can vary in terms of accuracy and phenomenology. One theoretical account that can help understand how to categorize these differences delineates between memories that are remembered versus familiar. This difference largely hinges on whether the memories contain information about both an item itself as well as associated details (Remember) versus those that are devoid of these associated contextual details (Familiar). This distinction has been supported by computational modeling of behavior, studies in patients, and neuroimaging work including differences both in electrophysiological and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Yet, compelling convergent evidence directly linking individual differences in estimates of Recollection and Familiarity, the mathematical estimates of differences in Remember versus Familiar judgments, with their concomitant electrophysiological signatures is lacking. The present study measured memory responses to a recognition memory task while participants underwent simultaneous electrophysiological recordings of brain activity. Non-parametric cluster-based permutation analyses revealed selective associations between electrophysiological signatures ofFamiliarity and Recollection with their respective behavioral estimates. These results support the idea that Recollection and Familiarity are distinct phenomena and is the first to relate individual differences in both Recollection and Familiarity to electrophysiological signatures.

                Substance use disorder is a difficult disease to treat due to its relapsing nature. In the last decade, opioid use disorder has been a threat to public health, being declared an epidemic by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This is a tragic situation, considering there are currently effective, yet not ideal, treatments to prevent relapse. Recent research has shown that hormones that modulate hunger and satiety also can modulate motivated behavior for drugs of abuse. For example, the short-acting analog of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), an incretin hormone that regulates homeostatic feeding, has been shown to reduce responding for rewarding stimuli such as food, cocaine, heroin and nicotine. Here, we tested the acute effects of the long-acting GLP-1 analog, liraglutide, on heroin seeking. We found that, in rats with heroin self-administration experience, subcutaneous (sc) administration of an acute dose of 0.3 mg/kg liraglutide was effective in preventing relapse after exposure to three major precipitators: drug-associated cues, stress, and the drug itself. However, the effects of the drug were contingent upon the pretreatment time, with the drug being fully effective when administered using a 6 h, rather than a 4 h pretreatment time. Finally, we confirmed that the reduction in drug seeking is not due to a locomotor impairment, as liraglutide did not significantly alter performance in a rotarod test. As such, this acute non-opioid treatment may serve as a new and effective bridge to treatment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Principles governing the topological organization of object selectivities in ventral temporal cortex</a></h4>

              
                To achieve the computational goal of rapidly recognizing miscellaneous objects in the environment despite large variations in their appearance, our mind represents objects in a high-dimensional object space to provide separable category information and enable the extraction of different kinds of information necessary for various levels of the visual processing. To implement this abstract and complex object space, the ventral temporal cortex (VTC) develops different object-selective regions with a certain topological organization as the physical substrate. However, the principle that governs the topological organization of object selectivities in the VTC remains unclear. Here, equipped with the wiring cost minimization principle constrained by the wiring length of neurons in the human temporal lobe, we constructed a hybrid self-organizing map (SOM) model as an artificial VTC (VTC-SOM) to explain how the abstract and complex object space is faithfully implemented in the brain. In two in silico experiments with the empirical brain imaging and single-unit data, our VTC-SOM predicted the topological structure of fine-scale functional regions (face-, object-, body-, and place-selective regions) and the boundary (i.e., middle Fusiform Sulcus) in large-scale abstract functional maps (animate vs. inanimate, real-word large-size vs. small-size, central vs. peripheral), with no significant loss in functionality (e.g., categorical selectivity, a hierarchy of view-invariant representations). These findings illustrated that the simple principle utilized in our model, rather than multiple hypotheses such as temporal associations, conceptual knowledge, and computational demands together, was apparently sufficient to determine the topological organization of object-selectivities in the VTC. In this way, the high-dimensional object space is implemented in a two-dimensional cortical surface of the brain faithfully.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multimodal Detection of Dopamine by Sniffer Cells Expressing Genetically Encoded Fluorescence Sensors</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine serves an important role in supporting both locomotor control and higher brain functions such as motivation and learning. Dopaminergic dysfunction is implicated in an equally multidimensional spectrum of neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases. Extracellular dopamine levels are known to be tightly controlled by presynaptic dopamine transporters (DAT), which is also a main target of psychostimulants. Still, detailed data on dopamine dynamics in space and time is needed to fully understand how dopamine signals are encoded and translated into cellular and behavioral responses, and to uncover the pathological effects of dopamine-related diseases. The recently developed genetically encoded fluorescent dopamine sensors enable unprecedented monitoring of dopamine dynamics and have changed the field of in vivo dopamine recording. However, the potential of these sensors to be used for in vitro and ex vivo assays remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate a generalizable blueprint for making dopamine 'sniffer' cells for multimodal detection of dopamine in vitro and ex vivo. We generated sniffer cell lines with inducible expression of six different dopamine sensors and performed a head-to-head comparison of sensor properties to guide users in sensor selection. In proof-of-principle experiments, we show how the sniffer cells can be applied to measure release of endogenous dopamine from cultured neurons and striatal slices, and for determining total dopamine content in striatal tissue. Furthermore, we use the sniffer cells to quantify DAT-mediated dopamine uptake, and AMPH-induced and constitutive dopamine efflux as a radiotracer free, high-throughput alternative to electrochemical- and radiotracer-based assays. Importantly, the sniffer cells framework can readily be applied to other transmitter systems for which the list of genetically encoded fluorescent sensors is rapidly growing.

                The human brain generates a rich repertoire of spatio-temporal activity patterns, which support a wide variety of motor and cognitive functions. These patterns of activity change with age in a multi-factorial manner. One of these factors is the variations in the brain's connectomics that occurs along the lifespan. However, the precise relationship between high-order functional interactions and connnectomics, as well as their variations with age are largely unknown, in part due to the absence of mechanistic models that can efficiently map brain connnectomics to functional connectivity in aging. To investigate this issue, we have built a neurobiologically-realistic whole-brain computational model using both anatomical and functional MRI data from 161 participants ranging from 10 to 80 years old. We show that the age differences in high-order functional interactions can be largely explained by variations in the connectome. Based on this finding, we propose a simple neurodegeneration model that is representative of normal physiological aging. As such, when applied to connectomes of young participant it reproduces the age-variations that occur in the high-order structure of the functional data. Overall, these results begin to disentangle the mechanisms by which structural changes in the connectome lead to functional differences in the ageing brain. Our model can also serve as a starting point for modelling more complex forms of pathological ageing or cognitive deficits.

                Mindfulness meditation has been shown to increase resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which is thought to reflect improvements in attention to the present moment. However, prior research in long-term meditation practitioners lacked quantitative measures of attention that would provide a more direct behavioral correlate and interpretational anchor for PCC- DLPFC connectivity and was inherently limited by small sample sizes. Moreover, whether mindfulness meditation primarily impacts brain function locally, or impacts the dynamics of large-scale brain networks, remained unclear. Here, we sought to replicate and extend prior findings of increased PCC- DLPFC rsFC in a sample of 40 long-term meditators (average practice= 3759 hours) who also completed a behavioral assay of attention. In addition, we tested a network-based framework of changes in inter-regional connectivity by examining network-level connectivity. We found that meditators had stronger PCC-rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) rsFC, lower connector hub strength across the default mode network (DMN) relative to other functional networks, and better attention to task, compared to 124 meditation-naive controls. Orienting attention positively correlated with PCC- rostrolateral PFC connectivity, and negatively correlated with DMN connector hub strength. These findings provide novel evidence that posterior cingulate- rostrolateral PFC rsFC may support attention orienting, consistent with a role for rostrolateral PFC in meta-cognitive background awareness that is a core component of mindfulness meditation training. Our results further demonstrate that long-term mindfulness meditation may improve attention and strengthen the underlying brain networks.

                This work describes a newly developed experimental mouse model reproducing features of blast-induced neurotrauma (BINT), induced in operationally relevant manner using a compressed air-driven shock tube. Mild BINT (smBINT) was induced by one exposure to a low-intensity blast (LIB), whereas subconcussive BINT (rscBINT) was caused by repeated exposures to LIB. To mimic an operational scenario when a soldier is standing when exposed to blast using a quadruped experimental animal (mouse), a whole-body holder was developed to position mice in a bipedal stance, face-on toward the pressure wave generated in a shock tube. This restraint avoids bobble head movement, thus prevents tertiary blast effects, and allows administration of fast-acting inhaled anesthetics via nose cone. Using this model, we established and validated paradigms for primary blast-induced mild and repetitive traumatic brain injuries Our results showed that a single exposure to 69 kPa (10 psi) was capable of inducing smBINT, whereas three-rounds of exposure to 41 kPa (6 psi) caused rscBINT. Mice recovered rapidly from both types of BINT without prolonged neurological dysfunction. Mild superficial pathology was found predominantly in the lungs 24h after injury, with equivalent pathology after smBINT or repetitive rscBINT. The Purkinje layer of the cerebellum exhibited neuronal damage persisting up to 7d. Similar to some other models as well as clinical findings, this model reproduces blast-induced cerebellar pathology. In conclusion, this model positioning mice in a bipedal stance and facing front-on toward the shockwave provides realistic representation of operational scenarios and reproduces militarily-relevant smBINT and rscBINT in the laboratory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Stabilization of spine Synaptopodin by mGluR1 is required for mGluR-LTD</a></h4>

              
                Dendritic spines, actin-rich protrusions forming the postsynaptic sites of excitatory synapses, undergo activity-dependent molecular and structural remodeling. Activation of group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors - mGluR1 and mGluR5 - by synaptic or pharmacological stimulation, induces LTD but whether this is accompanied with spine elimination remains unresolved. A subset of telencephalic mushroom spines contains the spine apparatus (SA), an enigmatic organelle composed of stacks of smooth endoplasmic reticulum, whose formation depends on the expression of the actin-bundling protein Synaptopodin. Allocation of Synaptopodin to spines appears governed by cell-intrinsic mechanisms as the relative frequency of spines harboring Synaptopodin is conserved in vivo and in vitro. Here we show that expression of Synaptopodin/SA in spines is required for induction of mGluR-LTD at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses. Post-mGluR-LTD, mushroom spines lacking Synaptopodin/SA are selectively lost whereas spines harboring it are preserved, a process dependent on activation of mGluR1 but not mGluR5. Mechanistically, we find that mGluR1 supports physical retention of Synaptopodin within excitatory spine synapses during LTD while triggering lysosome-dependent degradation of the protein residing in dendritic shafts. Together, these results reveal a cellular mechanism, dependent on mGluR1, which enables selective preservation of stronger spines containing Synaptopodin/SA while eliminating weaker ones and potentially countering spurious strengthening by de novo recruitment of Synaptopodin. Overall our results identify spines with Synaptopodin/SA as the locus of mGluR-LTD and underscore the importance of the molecular microanatomy of spines in synaptic plasticity.

	<p>The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health are now well documented, however, few studies have been focused on the role of coping strategies and resilience in counterbalancing these detrimental effects. Data are derived from the COvid Mental hEalth Trial (COMET), a national multicentric trial carried out in the Italian general population. The final sample consisted of 20,720 participants, 53.1% (n = 11,000) of the sample reported low levels of resilience. Adaptive coping strategies and resilience levels did not have any significant protective impact on the levels of depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Only self-distraction was a risk factor for poor mental health (Beta Coefficient, B = 0.1, 95% Confidence Interval, CI: 0.003 to 0.267 for stress symptoms; B = 0.2; 95% CI: 0.077 to 0.324 for anxiety symptoms and B = 0.2, 95% CI: 0.105 to 0.382 for depressive symptoms). High levels of resilience were predicted by adaptive coping strategies, such as acceptance (B = 1.8, CI 95% = 1.4–2.7). Exposure to the different weeks of lockdown, being infected by COVID-19, and being a healthcare professional did not influence the levels of resilience. Our findings should be carefully considered, since the low levels of resilience may represent the missing link between the pandemic and the current increase in mental health problems.</p>

	<p>Media news during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic often entail complex numerical concepts such as exponential increase or reproduction number. This study investigated whether people have difficulties in understanding such information and whether these difficulties are related to numerical competence, reflective thinking, and risk proneness. One hundred sixty-three participants provided answers to a numeracy scale focusing on complex numerical concepts relevant to COVID-19 (COV Numeracy Scale). They also provided responses to well-established objective and subjective scales, questions about affective states, and questions about the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher scores on the COV Numeracy Scale correlated with higher scores on the Health Numeracy Scale, in the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT), and in self-assessments of verbal comprehension, mathematical intelligence, and subjective numeracy. Interestingly, scores on the COV Numeracy Scale also positively correlated with the number of consulted information sources about COVID-19. Accuracy in the CRT emerged as a significant predictor, explaining ca. 14% of variance on the COV Numeracy Scale. The results suggest that people with lower reflective thinking skills and lower subjective and objective numerical competence can be more at disadvantage when confronted with COVID-related numerical information in everyday life. These findings advise caution in the communication of relevant public health information that entails complex numerical concepts.</p>

	<p>Neurodevelopmental disorders are frequently associated with sleep disturbances. One class of neurodevelopmental disorders, the genetic synaptopathies, is caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins found at the synapse. Mutations in these genes cause derangement of synapse development and function. We utilized a validated sleep instrument, Children’s Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) to examine the nature of sleep abnormalities occurring in individuals with two synaptopathies—Phelan–McDermid syndrome (PMD) (N = 47, male = 23, female = 24, age 1–46 years) and SYNGAP1-related intellectual disability (SYNGAP1-ID) (N = 64, male = 31, female = 33, age 1–64 years), when compared with unaffected siblings (N = 61, male = 25, female = 36, age 1–17 years). We found that both PMD and SYNGAP1-ID have significant sleep abnormalities with SYNGAP1-ID having greater severity of sleep disturbance than PMD. In addition, sleep disturbances were more severe for PMD in individuals 11 years and older compared with those less than 11 years old. Individuals with either disorder were more likely to use sleep aids than unaffected siblings. In conclusion, sleep disturbances are a significant phenotype in the synaptopathies PMD and SYNGAP1-ID. Improved sleep is a viable endpoint for future clinical trials for these neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

	<p>The ability to rapidly stop or change a planned action is a critical cognitive process that is impaired in schizophrenia. The current study aimed to examine whether this impairment reflects familial vulnerability to schizophrenia across two experiments comparing unaffected first-degree relatives to healthy controls. First, we examined performance on a saccadic stop-signal task that required rapid inhibition of an eye movement. Then, in a different sample, we investigated behavioral and neural responses (using fMRI) during a stop-signal task variant that required rapid modification of a prepared eye movement. Here, we examined differences between relatives and healthy controls in terms of activation and effective connectivity within an oculomotor control network during task performance. Like individuals with schizophrenia, the unaffected relatives showed behavioral evidence for more inefficient inhibitory processes. Unlike previous findings in individuals with schizophrenia, however, the relatives showed evidence for a compensatory waiting strategy. Behavioral differences were accompanied by more activation among the relatives in task-relevant regions across conditions and group differences in effective connectivity across the task that were modulated differently by the instruction to exert control over a planned saccade. Effective connectivity parameters were related to behavioral measures of inhibition efficiency. The results suggest that individuals at familial risk for schizophrenia were engaging an oculomotor control network differently than controls and in a way that compromises inhibition efficiency.</p>

	<p>Oxytocin (OXT) is known to affect various social processes, including social comparisons and intergroup competition. In this study, we examined whether social comparisons in intergroup situations can be modulated by OXT and, if so, how this modulation manifests. Using a double-blind placebo-controlled design, we randomly assigned male participants to either OXT or placebo treatment and then asked them to play a card game with either an in-group or an out-group member. The OXT-treated participants showed a greater social comparison effect in the games with an out-group member than in games with an in-group member. Specifically, the participants in the OXT treatment condition showed a greater acceptance rate for relative gain (downward comparison) and a lower acceptance rate for relative loss (upward comparison) while playing with an out-group member rather than an in-group member. In contrast, no such effect was observed among placebo-treated participants. These findings demonstrate that OXT facilitates intergroup social comparisons with out-group versus in-group members.</p>

                Cell surface receptors are critical for cell signaling and constitute a quarter of all human genes. Despite their importance and abundance, receptor interaction networks remain understudied because of difficulties associated with maintaining membrane proteins in their native conformation and their typically weak interactions. To overcome these challenges, we developed an...

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Convincing evidence of blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) alterations has been demonstrated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and barrier repair is imperative to prevent motor neuron dysfunction. We showed benefits of human bone marrow-derived CD34+ cells (hBM34+) and endothelial progenitor cells (hBM-EPCs) intravenous transplantation into symptomatic G93A SOD1 mutant mice on barrier reparative processes. These gains likely occurred by replacement of damaged endothelial cells, prolonging motor neuron survival. However, additional investigations are needed to confirm the effects of administered cells on integrity of the microvascular endothelium. The aim of this study was to determine tight junction protein levels, capillary pericyte coverage, microvascular basement membrane, and endothelial filamentous actin (F-actin) status in spinal cord capillaries of G93A SOD1 mutant mice treated with human bone marrow-derived stem cells. Tight junction proteins were detected in the spinal cords of cell-treated versus non-treated mice via Western blotting at four weeks after transplant. Capillary pericyte, basement membrane laminin, and endothelial F-actin magnitudes were determined in cervical/lumbar spinal cord tissues in ALS mice, including controls, by immunohistochemistry and fluorescent staining. Results showed that cell-treated versus media-treated ALS mice substantially increased tight junction protein levels, capillary pericyte coverage, basement membrane laminin immunoexpressions, and endothelial cytoskeletal F-actin fluorescent expressions. The greatest benefits were detected in mice receiving hBM-EPCs versus hBM34+ cells. These study results support treatment with a specific cell type derived from human bone marrow toward BSCB repair in ALS. Thus, hBM-EPCs may be advanced for clinical applications as a cell-specific approach for ALS therapy through restored barrier integrity.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Machine learning approach for automatic recognition of tomato-pollinating bees based on their buzzing-sounds</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alison Pereira Ribeiro, Nádia Felix Felipe da Silva, Fernanda Neiva Mesquita, Priscila de Cássia Souza Araújo, Thierson Couto Rosa, José Neiva Mesquita-Neto</p>

Bee-mediated pollination greatly increases the size and weight of tomato fruits. Therefore, distinguishing between the local set of bees–those that are efficient pollinators–is essential to improve the economic returns for farmers. To achieve this, it is important to know the identity of the visiting bees. Nevertheless, the traditional taxonomic identification of bees is not an easy task, requiring the participation of experts and the use of specialized equipment. Due to these limitations, the development and implementation of new technologies for the automatic recognition of bees become relevant. Hence, we aim to verify the capacity of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in recognizing the taxonomic identity of visiting bees to tomato flowers based on the characteristics of their buzzing sounds. We compared the performance of the ML algorithms combined with the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and with classifications based solely on the from fundamental frequency, leading to a direct comparison between the two approaches. In fact, some classifiers powered by the MFCC–especially the SVM–achieved better performance compared to the randomized and sound frequency-based trials. Moreover, the buzzing sounds produced during sonication were more relevant for the taxonomic recognition of bee species than analysis based on flight sounds alone. On the other hand, the ML classifiers performed better in recognizing bees genera based on flight sounds. Despite that, the maximum accuracy obtained here (73.39% by SVM) is still low compared to ML standards. Further studies analyzing larger recording samples, and applying unsupervised learning systems may yield better classification performance. Therefore, ML techniques could be used to automate the taxonomic recognition of flower-visiting bees of the cultivated tomato and other buzz-pollinated crops. This would be an interesting option for farmers and other professionals who have no experience in bee taxonomy but are interested in improving crop yields by increasing pollination.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Integration, coincidence detection and resonance in networks of spiking neurons expressing Gamma oscillations and asynchronous states</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Eduarda Susin, Alain Destexhe</p>

Gamma oscillations are widely seen in the awake and sleeping cerebral cortex, but the exact role of these oscillations is still debated. Here, we used biophysical models to examine how Gamma oscillations may participate to the processing of afferent stimuli. We constructed conductance-based network models of Gamma oscillations, based on different cell types found in cerebral cortex. The models were adjusted to extracellular unit recordings in humans, where Gamma oscillations always coexist with the asynchronous firing mode. We considered three different mechanisms to generate Gamma, first a mechanism based on the interaction between pyramidal neurons and interneurons (PING), second a mechanism in which Gamma is generated by interneuron networks (ING) and third, a mechanism which relies on Gamma oscillations generated by pacemaker <i>chattering</i> neurons (CHING). We find that all three mechanisms generate features consistent with human recordings, but that the ING mechanism is most consistent with the firing rate change inside Gamma bursts seen in the human data. We next evaluated the responsiveness and resonant properties of these networks, contrasting Gamma oscillations with the asynchronous mode. We find that for both slowly-varying stimuli and precisely-timed stimuli, the responsiveness is generally lower during Gamma compared to asynchronous states, while resonant properties are similar around the Gamma band. We could not find conditions where Gamma oscillations were more responsive. We therefore predict that asynchronous states provide the highest responsiveness to external stimuli, while Gamma oscillations tend to overall diminish responsiveness.

Immunotherapies provide effective treatments for previously untreatable tumors and identifying tumor-specific epitopes can help elucidate the molecular determinants of therapy response. Here, we describe a pipeline, ISOTOPE (ISOform-guided prediction of epiTOPEs In Cancer), for the comprehensive identification of tumor-specific splicing-derived epitopes. Using RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry for MHC-I associated proteins, ISOTOPE identified neoepitopes from tumor-specific splicing events that are potentially presented by MHC-I complexes. Analysis of multiple samples indicates that splicing alterations may affect the production of self-epitopes and generate more candidate neoepitopes than somatic mutations. Although there was no difference in the number of splicing-derived neoepitopes between responders and non-responders to immune therapy, higher MHC-I binding affinity was associated with a positive response. Our analyses highlight the diversity of the immunogenic impacts of tumor-specific splicing alterations and the importance of studying splicing alterations to fully characterize tumors in the context of immunotherapies. ISOTOPE is available at https://github.com/comprna/ISOTOPE.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Conventional measures of intrinsic excitability are poor estimators of neuronal activity under realistic synaptic inputs</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Adrienn Szabó, Katalin Schlett, Attila Szücs</p>

Activity-dependent regulation of intrinsic excitability has been shown to greatly contribute to the overall plasticity of neuronal circuits. Such neuroadaptations are commonly investigated in patch clamp experiments using current step stimulation and the resulting input-output functions are analyzed to quantify alterations in intrinsic excitability. However, it is rarely addressed, how such changes translate to the function of neurons when they operate under natural synaptic inputs. Still, it is reasonable to expect that a strong correlation and near proportional relationship exist between static firing responses and those evoked by synaptic drive. We challenge this view by performing a high-yield electrophysiological analysis of cultured mouse hippocampal neurons using both standard protocols and simulated synaptic inputs via dynamic clamp. We find that under these conditions the neurons exhibit vastly different firing responses with surprisingly weak correlation between static and dynamic firing intensities. These contrasting responses are regulated by two intrinsic K-currents mediated by Kv1 and K<sub>ir</sub> channels, respectively. Pharmacological manipulation of the K-currents produces differential regulation of the firing output of neurons. Static firing responses are greatly increased in stuttering type neurons under blocking their Kv1 channels, while the synaptic responses of the same neurons are less affected. Pharmacological blocking of K<sub>ir</sub>-channels in delayed firing type neurons, on the other hand, exhibit the opposite effects. Our subsequent computational model simulations confirm the findings in the electrophysiological experiments and also show that adaptive changes in the kinetic properties of such currents can even produce paradoxical regulation of the firing output.

                <p>by Jaie Woodard, Wei Zheng, Yang Zhang</p>

Three-dimensional structures of proteins can provide important clues into the efficacy of personalized treatment. We perform a structural analysis of variants within three inherited lysosomal storage disorders, comparing variants responsive to pharmacological chaperone treatment to those unresponsive to such treatment. We find that predicted ΔΔG of mutation is higher on average for variants unresponsive to treatment, in the case of datasets for both Fabry disease and Pompe disease, in line with previous findings. Using both a single decision tree and an advanced machine learning approach based on the larger Fabry dataset, we correctly predict responsiveness of three Gaucher disease variants, and we provide predictions for untested variants. Many variants are predicted to be responsive to treatment, suggesting that drug-based treatments may be effective for a number of variants in Gaucher disease. In our analysis, we observe dependence on a topological feature reporting on contact arrangements which is likely connected to the order of folding of protein residues, and we provide a potential justification for this observation based on steady-state cellular kinetics.

Bridgeford, Shangsi Wang, Zeyi Wang, Ting Xu, Cameron Craddock, Jayanta Dey, Gregory Kiar, William Gray-Roncal, Carlo Colantuoni, Christopher Douville, Stephanie Noble, Carey E.

Replicability, the ability to replicate scientific findings, is a prerequisite for scientific discovery and clinical utility. Troublingly, we are in the midst of a replicability crisis. A key to replicability is that multiple measurements of the same item (e.g., experimental sample or clinical participant) under fixed experimental constraints are relatively similar to one another. Thus, statistics that quantify the relative contributions of accidental deviations—such as measurement error—as compared to systematic deviations—such as individual differences—are critical. We demonstrate that existing replicability statistics, such as intra-class correlation coefficient and fingerprinting, fail to adequately differentiate between accidental and systematic deviations in very simple settings. We therefore propose a novel statistic, <i>discriminability</i>, which quantifies the degree to which an individual’s samples are relatively similar to one another, without restricting the data to be univariate, Gaussian, or even Euclidean. Using this statistic, we introduce the possibility of optimizing experimental design via increasing discriminability and prove that optimizing discriminability improves performance bounds in subsequent inference tasks. In extensive simulated and real datasets (focusing on brain imaging and demonstrating on genomics), only optimizing data <i>discriminability</i> improves performance on all subsequent inference tasks for each dataset. We therefore suggest that designing experiments and analyses to optimize discriminability may be a crucial step in solving the replicability crisis, and more generally, mitigating accidental measurement error.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dynamic modelling of the PI3K/MTOR signalling network uncovers biphasic dependence of mTORC1 activity on the mTORC2 subunit SIN1</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Milad Ghomlaghi, Guang Yang, Sungyoung Shin, David E. James, Lan K. Nguyen</p>

The PI3K/MTOR signalling network regulates a broad array of critical cellular processes, including cell growth, metabolism and autophagy. The mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) kinase functions as a core catalytic subunit in two physically and functionally distinct complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2, which also share other common components including MLST8 (also known as GβL) and DEPTOR. Despite intensive research, how mTORC1 and 2 assembly and activity are coordinated, and how they are functionally linked remain to be fully characterized. This is due in part to the complex network wiring, featuring multiple feedback loops and intricate post-translational modifications. Here, we integrate predictive network modelling, <i>in vitro</i> experiments and -omics data analysis to elucidate the emergent dynamic behaviour of the PI3K/MTOR network. We construct new mechanistic models that encapsulate critical mechanistic details, including mTORC1/2 coordination by MLST8 (de)ubiquitination and the Akt-to-mTORC2 positive feedback loop. Model simulations validated by experimental studies revealed a previously unknown biphasic, threshold-gated dependence of mTORC1 activity on the key mTORC2 subunit SIN1, which is robust against cell-to-cell variation in protein expression. In addition, our integrative analysis demonstrates that ubiquitination of MLST8, which is reversed by OTUD7B, is regulated by IRS1/2. Our results further support the essential role of MLST8 in enabling both mTORC1 and 2’s activity and suggest MLST8 as a viable therapeutic target in breast cancer. Overall, our study reports a new mechanistic model of PI3K/MTOR signalling incorporating MLST8-mediated mTORC1/2 formation and unveils a novel regulatory linkage between mTORC1 and mTORC2.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Cerebellar complex spikes multiplex complementary behavioral information</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Akshay Markanday, Junya Inoue, Peter W. Dicke, Peter Thier</p>

Purkinje cell (PC) discharge, the only output of cerebellar cortex, involves 2 types of action potentials, high-frequency simple spikes (SSs) and low-frequency complex spikes (CSs). While there is consensus that SSs convey information needed to optimize movement kinematics, the function of CSs, determined by the PC’s climbing fiber input, remains controversial. While initially thought to be specialized in reporting information on motor error for the subsequent amendment of behavior, CSs seem to contribute to other aspects of motor behavior as well. When faced with the bewildering diversity of findings and views unraveled by highly specific tasks, one may wonder if there is just one true function with all the other attributions wrong? Or is the diversity of findings a reflection of distinct pools of PCs, each processing specific streams of information conveyed by climbing fibers? With these questions in mind, we recorded CSs from the monkey oculomotor vermis deploying a repetitive saccade task that entailed sizable motor errors as well as small amplitude saccades, correcting them. We demonstrate that, in addition to carrying error-related information, CSs carry information on the metrics of both primary and small corrective saccades in a time-specific manner, with changes in CS firing probability coupled with changes in CS duration. Furthermore, we also found CS activity that seemed to predict the upcoming events. Hence PCs receive a multiplexed climbing fiber input that merges complementary streams of information on the behavior, separable by the recipient PC because they are staggered in time.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Prefrontal cortical activity predicts the occurrence of nonlocal hippocampal representations during spatial navigation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jai Y. Yu, Loren M. Frank</p>

The receptive field of a neuron describes the regions of a stimulus space where the neuron is consistently active. Sparse spiking outside of the receptive field is often considered to be noise, rather than a reflection of information processing. Whether this characterization is accurate remains unclear. We therefore contrasted the sparse, temporally isolated spiking of hippocampal CA1 place cells to the consistent, temporally adjacent spiking seen within their spatial receptive fields (“place fields”). We found that isolated spikes, which occur during locomotion, are strongly phase coupled to hippocampal theta oscillations and transiently express coherent nonlocal spatial representations. Further, prefrontal cortical activity is coordinated with and can predict the occurrence of future isolated spiking events. Rather than local noise within the hippocampus, sparse, isolated place cell spiking reflects a coordinated cortical–hippocampal process consistent with the generation of nonlocal scenario representations during active navigation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Integrating evidence-based interventions in clinical settings in Jordan: a policy brief [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Evidence-based nursing practice (EBNP) is considered a major and very important global paradigm shift. Unfortunately, most healthcare providers and researchers embrace the concept of evidence-based practice (EBP) without integrating this concept in clinical settings. The current situation of EBP and new practice guidelines utilization in Jordan are scarce. This policy brief aimed to discusses the process of utilizing nursing EBP in clinical settings in Jordan. Methods: The authors adopted an action plan utilizing a systematic approach to develop and implement specific strategies and policies to integrate EBP in clinical settings in Jordanian hospitals. We present an experience of one country in terms of introducing a policy brief to establish an EBP policy accompanied by developing an EBP unit in the hospital's country. Results: A comprehensive description of this policy is provided with reference to the eminent steps of policy analysis and evaluation. In fact, EBP policies and clinical practice guidelines should keep a live document and revise regularly or as needed. Overall, the authors suggest the development of a unit for EBP to deal with issues related to clinical practice guidelines. Conclusions: Expected outcomes for the introduction of the EBP unit and its policy include increase research utilization and accelerated adoption of new evidence, increase the quality of care provided, increase patient, staff, and managers satisfaction, and decrease staff workload by reducing complications associated with medical errors and outdated interventions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">COVID-19 impact: Customised economic stimulus package recommender system using machine learning techniques [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The Malaysian government reacted to the pandemic’s economic effect with the Prihatin Rakyat Economic Stimulus Package (ESP) to cushion the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) impact on households. The ESP consists of cash assistance, utility discount, moratorium, Employee Provident Fund (EPF) cash withdrawals, credit guarantee scheme and wage subsidies. A survey carried out by the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM) shows that households prefer different types of financial assistance. These preferences forge the need to effectively customise ESPs to manage the economic burden among low-income households. In this study, a recommender system for such ESPs was designed by leveraging data analytics and machine learning techniques. Methods: This study used a dataset from DOSM titled “Effects of COVID-19 on the Economy and Individual - Round 2,” collected from April 10 to April 24, 2020. Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining was followed to develop machine learning models to classify ESP receivers according to their preferred subsidies types. Four machine learning techniques—Decision Tree, Gradient Boosted Tree, Random Forest and Naïve Bayes—were used to build the predictive models for each moratorium, utility discount and EPF and Private Remuneration Scheme (PRS) cash withdrawals subsidies. The best predictive model was selected based on F-score metrics. Results: Among the four machine learning techniques, Gradient Boosted Tree outperformed the rest. This technique predicted the following: moratorium preferences with 93.8% sensitivity, 82.1% precision and 87.6% F-score; utilities discount with 86% sensitivity, 82.1% precision and 84% F-score; and EPF and PRS with 83.6% sensitivity, 81.2% precision and 82.4% F-score. Households that prefer moratorium subsidies did not favour other financial aids except for cash assistance.  Conclusion: Findings present machine learning models that can predict individual household preferences from ESP. These models can be used to design customised ESPs that can effectively manage the financial burden of low-income households.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Digital signature schemes with strong existential unforgeability [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Digital signature schemes (DSS) are ubiquitously used for public authentication in the infrastructure of the internet, in addition to their use as a cryptographic tool to construct even more sophisticated schemes such as those that are identity-based. The security of DSS is analyzed through the existential unforgeability under chosen message attack (EUF-CMA) experiment which promises unforgeability of signatures on new messages even when the attacker has access to an arbitrary set of messages and their corresponding signatures. However, the EUF-CMA model does not account for attacks such as an attacker forging a different signature on an existing message, even though the attack could be devastating in the real world and constitutes a severe breach of the security system. Nonetheless, most of the DSS are not analyzed in this security model, which possibly makes them vulnerable to such an attack. In contrast, a better security notion known as strong EUF-CMA (sEUF-CMA) is designed to be resistant to such attacks. This review aims to identify DSS in the literature that are secure in the sEUF-CMA model. In addition, the article discusses the challenges and future directions of DSS. In our review, we consider the security of existing DSS that fit our criterion in the sEUF-CMA model; our criterion is simple as we only require the DSS to be at least secure against the minimum of existential forgery. Our findings are categorized into two classes: the direct and indirect classes of sEUF-CMA. The former is inherently sEUF-CMA without any modification while the latter requires some transformation. Our comprehensive  review contributes to the security and cryptographic research community by discussing the efficiency and security of DSS that are sEUF-CMA, which aids in selecting robust DSS in future design considerations.

                The Stimulating Peripheral Activity to Relieve Conditions (SPARC) program integrates biological and neural information to create anatomical and functional maps of the peripheral nervous system. The SPARC Portal hosts a dynamic storage for the datasets, models, and resources to help the researchers find and produce data. Currently, the SPARC Portal provides a primary search tool, which lacks some features to improve the search experience. To purposefully retrieve the required information from the stored datasets and resources, we have developed an Advanced QUery Architecture (AQUA) for the SPARC Portal. Near-real-time auto-completion of the queries, close-matches suggestions, and multiple filters to narrow or sort the results are the major features of AQUA with the goal to enhance the usability of the SPARC search engine.

                Background Antioxidants show nephroprotective effect against vancomycin associated nephrotoxicity (VAN) in animals. This study aimed to assess the ascorbic acid nephro-protective role against VAN clinically. Methods Forty-one critically ill patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: intervention group (vancomycin IV plus ascorbic acid, n=21) or control group (vancomycin IV only, n=20). Primary outcomes were the incidence of VAN and the absolute change in creatinine parameters, while mortality rate was the secondary outcome. Nephrotoxicity was defined as an increase in serum creatinine (S.cr) by at least 0.5 mg/dL or 50% of baseline for at least two successive measurements. This study is registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03921099), April 2019. Results Mean absolute S.cr increase was significant when compared between both groups, P-value = 0.036, where S.cr increased by 0.05(0.12) and 0.34(0.55) mg/dL in the intervention and control groups, respectively. Mean absolute Cr.cl decline was significant when compared between both groups, P-value = 0.04, where Cr.cl was decreased by 5.9(17.8) and 22.3(30.4) ml/min in the intervention and control groups, respectively. Incidence of VAN was 1/21(4.7%) versus 5/20(25%) in the intervention and control groups, respectively (RR: 0.19; CI: 0.024–1.49; P-value = 0.093). Mortality was higher in the control group; however, it was not statistically significant, P-value = 0.141. Conclusion Co-administration of ascorbic acid with vancomycin preserved renal function and reduced the absolute risk of VAN by 20.3%, however, the reduction in VAN incidence didn’t reach statistical significance level. Further large multicenter prospective trials are recommended.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Any neuron can perform linearly non-separable computations [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Multiple studies have shown how dendrites enable some neurons to perform linearly non-separable computations. These works focus on cells with an extended dendritic arbor where voltage can vary independently, turning dendritic branches into local non-linear subunits. However, these studies leave a large fraction of the nervous system unexplored. Many neurons, e.g. granule cells, have modest dendritic trees and are electrically compact. It is impossible to decompose them into multiple independent subunits. Here, we upgraded the integrate and fire neuron to account for saturating dendrites. This artificial neuron has a unique membrane voltage and can be seen as a single layer. We present a class of linearly non-separable computations and how our neuron can perform them. We thus demonstrate that even a single layer neuron with dendrites has more computational capacity than without. Because any neuron has one or more layer, and all dendrites do saturate, we show that any dendrited neuron can implement linearly non-separable computations.

                Background: Autonomous vehicles are important in smart transportation. Although exciting progress has been made, it remains challenging to design a safety mechanism for autonomous vehicles despite uncertainties and obstacles that occur dynamically on the road. Collision detection and avoidance are indispensable for a reliable decision-making module in autonomous driving. Methods: This study presents a robust approach for forward collision warning using vision data for autonomous vehicles on Malaysian public roads. The proposed architecture combines environment perception and lane localization to define a safe driving region for the ego vehicle. If potential risks are detected in the safe driving region, a warning will be triggered. The early warning is important to help avoid rear-end collision. Besides, an adaptive lane localization method that considers geometrical structure of the road is presented to deal with different road types. Results: Precision scores of mean average precision (mAP) 0.5, mAP 0.95 and recall of 0.14, 0.06979 and 0.6356 were found in this study. Conclusions: Experimental results have validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach under different lighting and environmental conditions.

                Background: Vaccine hesitancy (VH) has been identified by the World Health Organization as one among the top ten threats to global public health. There is limited literature regarding VH from developing countries like India. Methods: In this facility based cross-sectional study, 172 mothers of under-five children were assessed regarding VH using the parental attitude towards childhood vaccination questionnaire (PACV). Results: The prevalence of VH was 3.4% (n=6). Only 7.6% (n=13) of the study participants had ever refused vaccination for their child and the most common reason cited for their refusal was that they thought it was not safe (n=6). Government health facilities was the place of routine immunization for 60.5% (n=104) participants. Health care providers (n =79, 46%) were the major source of information regarding vaccines. Conclusions: Our study highlights the presence of very low prevalence of VH in Mangalore compared to similar studies from India and other parts of the world. The limited number of participants had refused vaccination due to concerns related to vaccine safety.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Mutations in genes encoding Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase α1, α2, and α3 subunits cause a wide range of disabling neurological disorders, and dysfunction of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase may contribute to neuronal injury in stroke and dementia. To better understand the pathogenesis of these diseases, it is important to determine the expression patterns of the different Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase subunits within the brain and among specific cell types. Using two available scRNA-Seq databases from the adult mouse nervous system, we examined the mRNA expression patterns of the different isoforms of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase α, β and <i>Fxyd</i> subunits at the single-cell level among brain regions and various neuronal populations. We subsequently identified specific types of neurons enriched with transcripts for α1 and α3 isoforms and elaborated how α3-expressing neuronal populations govern cerebellar neuronal circuits. We further analyzed the co-expression network for α1 and α3 isoforms, highlighting the genes that positively correlated with α1 and α3 expression. The top 10 genes for α1 were <i>Chn2</i>, <i>Hpcal1</i>, <i>Nrgn</i>, <i>Neurod1</i>, <i>Selm</i>, <i>Kcnc1</i>, <i>Snrk</i>, <i>Snap25</i>, <i>Ckb</i> and <i>Ccndbp1</i> and for α3 were <i>Sorcs3</i>, <i>Eml5</i>, <i>Neurod2</i>, <i>Ckb</i>, <i>Tbc1d4</i>, <i>Ptprz1</i>, <i>Pvrl1</i>, <i>Kirrel3</i>, <i>Pvalb</i>, and <i>Asic2</i>.</p>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>We study the type of distributions that restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) with different activation functions can express by investigating the effect of the activation function of the hidden nodes on the marginal distribution they impose on observed binary nodes. We report an exact expression for these marginals in the form of a model of interacting binary variables with the explicit form of the interactions depending on the hidden node activation function. We study the properties of these interactions in detail and evaluate how the accuracy with which the RBM approximates distributions over binary variables depends on the hidden node activation function and the number of hidden nodes. When the inferred RBM parameters are weak, an intuitive pattern is found for the expression of the interaction terms, which reduces substantially the differences across activation functions. We show that the weak parameter approximation is a good approximation for different RBMs trained on the MNIST data set. Interestingly, in these cases, the mapping reveals that the inferred models are essentially low order interaction models.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Active inference (ActInf) is an emerging theory that explains perception and action in biological agents in terms of minimizing a free energy bound on Bayesian surprise. Goal-directed behavior is elicited by introducing prior beliefs on the underlying generative model. In contrast to prior beliefs, which constrain all realizations of a random variable, we propose an alternative approach through chance constraints, which allow for a (typically small) probability of constraint violation, and demonstrate how such constraints can be used as intrinsic drivers for goal-directed behavior in ActInf. We illustrate how chance-constrained ActInf weights all imposed (prior) constraints on the generative model, allowing, for example, for a trade-off between robust control and empirical chance constraint violation. Second, we interpret the proposed solution within a message passing framework. Interestingly, the message passing interpretation is not only relevant to the context of ActInf, but also provides a general-purpose approach that can account for chance constraints on graphical models. The chance constraint message updates can then be readily combined with other prederived message update rules without the need for custom derivations. The proposed chance-constrained message passing framework thus accelerates the search for workable models in general and can be used to complement message-passing formulations on generative neural models.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The transformation of synaptic input into action potential in nerve cells is strongly influenced by the morphology of the dendritic arbor as well as the synaptic efficacy map. The multiplicity of dendritic branches strikingly enables a single cell to act as a highly nonlinear processing element. Studies have also found functional synaptic clustering whereby synapses that encode a common sensory feature are spatially clustered together on the branches. Motivated by these findings, here we introduce a multibranch formal model of the neuron that can integrate synaptic inputs nonlinearly through collective action of its dendritic branches and yields synaptic clustering. An analysis in support of its use as a computational building block is offered. Also offered is an accompanying gradient descent–based learning algorithm. The model unit spans a wide spectrum of nonlinearities, including the parity problem, and can outperform the multilayer perceptron in generalizing to unseen data. The occurrence of synaptic clustering boosts the generalization efficiency of the unit, which may also be the answer for the puzzling ubiquity of synaptic clustering in the real neurons. Our theoretical analysis is backed up by simulations. The study could pave the way to new artificial neural networks.</span>

It is also proposed as a framework for planning in AI. Unfortunately, the complex mathematics required to create new models can impede application of active inference in neuroscience and AI research. This letter addresses this problem by providing a complete mathematical treatment of the active inference framework in discrete time and state spaces and the derivation of the update equations for any new model. We leverage the theoretical connection between active inference and variational message passing as described by John Winn and Christopher M. Bishop in 2005. Since variational message passing is a well-defined methodology for deriving Bayesian belief update equations, this letter opens the door to advanced generative models for active inference. We show that using a fully factorized variational distribution simplifies the expected free energy, which furnishes priors over policies so that agents seek unambiguous states. Finally, we consider future extensions that support deep tree searches for sequential policy optimization based on structure learning and belief propagation.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Up to now, modern machine learning (ML) has been based on approximating big data sets with high-dimensional functions, taking advantage of huge computational resources. We show that biologically inspired neuron models such as the leaky-integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron provide novel and efficient ways of information processing. They can be integrated in machine learning models and are a potential target to improve ML performance. Thus, we have derived simple update rules for LIF units to numerically integrate the differential equations. We apply a surrogate gradient approach to train the LIF units via backpropagation. We demonstrate that tuning the leak term of the LIF neurons can be used to run the neurons in different operating modes, such as simple signal integrators or coincidence detectors. Furthermore, we show that the constant surrogate gradient, in combination with tuning the leak term of the LIF units, can be used to achieve the learning dynamics of more complex surrogate gradients.To prove the validity of our method, we applied it to established image data sets (the Oxford 102 flower data set, MNIST), implemented various network architectures, used several input data encodings and demonstrated that the method is suitable to achieve state-of-the-art classification performance.We provide our method as well as further surrogate gradient methods to train spiking neural networks via backpropagation as an open-source KERAS package to make it available to the neuroscience and machine learning community. To increase the interpretability of the underlying effects and thus make a small step toward opening the black box of machine learning, we provide interactive illustrations, with the possibility of systematically monitoring the effects of parameter changes on the learning characteristics.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Synapses change on multiple timescales, ranging from milliseconds to minutes, due to a combination of both short- and long-term plasticity. Here we develop an extension of the common generalized linear model to infer both short- and long-term changes in the coupling between a pre- and postsynaptic neuron based on observed spiking activity. We model short-term synaptic plasticity using additive effects that depend on the presynaptic spike timing, and we model long-term changes in both synaptic weight and baseline firing rate using point process adaptive smoothing. Using simulations, we first show that this model can accurately recover time-varying synaptic weights (1) for both depressing and facilitating synapses, (2) with a variety of long-term changes (including realistic changes, such as due to STDP), (3) with a range of pre and postsynaptic firing rates, and (4) for both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. We then apply our model to two experimentally recorded putative synaptic connections. We find that simultaneously tracking fast changes in synaptic weights, slow changes in synaptic weights, and unexplained variations in baseline firing is essential. Omitting any one of these factors can lead to spurious inferences for the others. Altogether, this model provides a flexible framework for tracking short- and long-term variation in spike transmission.</span>

                Spatially remote brain regions show synchronized activity as typically revealed by correlated functional MRI (fMRI) signals. An emerging line of research has focused on the temporal fluctuations of connectivity, however, its relationships with stable connectivity have not been clearly illustrated. We examined the stable and dynamic connectivity from fMRI data when the participants watched four different movie clips. Using inter-individual correlation, we were able to estimate functionally meaningful dynamic connectivity associated with different movies. Widespread consistent dynamic connectivity was observed for each movie clip as well as their differences between clips. A cartoon movie clip showed higher consistent dynamic connectivity with the posterior cingulate cortex and supramarginal gyrus, while a court drama clip showed higher dynamic connectivity with the auditory cortex and temporoparietal junction, which suggest the involvement of specific brain processing for different movie contents. In contrast, stable connectivity was highly similar among the movie clips, and showed fewer statistical significant differences. The patterns of dynamic connectivity had higher accuracy for classifications of different movie clips than the stable connectivity and regional activity. These results support the functional significance of dynamic connectivity in reflecting functional brain changes, which could provide more functionally related information than stable connectivity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Gli1 regulates the postnatal acquisition of peripheral nerve architecture</a></h4>

              
                Peripheral nerves are organized into discrete cellular compartments. Axons, Schwann cells (SCs), and endoneurial fibroblasts (EFs) reside within the endoneurium and are surrounded by the perineurium - a cellular sheath comprised of layers of perineurial glia (PNG). SC secretion of Desert Hedgehog (Dhh) regulates this organization. In Dhh nulls, the perineurium is deficient and the endoneurium is subdivided into small compartments termed minifascicles. Human Dhh mutations cause a peripheral neuropathy with similar defects. Here we examine the role of Gli1, a canonical transcriptional effector of hedgehog signaling, in regulating peripheral nerve organization. We identify PNG, EFs, and pericytes as Gli1-expressing cells by genetic fate mapping. Although expression of Dhh by SCs and Gli1 in target cells is coordinately regulated with myelination, Gli1 expression unexpectedly persists in Dhh null EFs. Thus, Gli1 is expressed in EFs non-canonically i.e., independent of hedgehog signaling. Gli1 and Dhh also have non-redundant activities. In contrast to Dhh nulls, Gli1 nulls have a normal perineurium. Like Dhh nulls, Gli1 nulls form minifascicles, which we show likely arise from EFs. Thus, Dhh and Gli1 are independent signals: Gli1 is dispensable for perineurial development but functions cooperatively with Dhh to drive normal endoneurial development. During development, Gli1 also regulates endoneurial extracellular matrix production, nerve vascular organization, and has modest, non-autonomous effects on SC sorting and myelination of axons. Finally, in adult nerves, induced deletion of Gli1 is sufficient to drive minifascicle formation. Thus, Gli1 regulates the development and is required to maintain the endoneurial architecture of peripheral nerves.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Chronic sodium bromide treatment relieves autistic-like behavioral deficits in three mouse models of autism</a></h4>

              
                Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental disorders whose diagnosis relies on deficient social interaction and communication together with repetitive behavior. To date, no pharmacological treatment has been approved that ameliorates social behavior in patients with ASD. Based on the excitation/inhibition imbalance theory of autism, we hypothesized that bromide ions, long used as an antiepileptic medication, could relieve core symptoms of ASD. We evaluated the effects of chronic sodium bromide (NaBr) administration on autistic-like symptoms in three genetic mouse models of autism: Oprm1-/- , Fmr1-/- and Shank3{Delta}ex13-16-/- mice. We showed that chronic NaBr treatment relieved autistic-like behaviors in these three models. In Oprm1-/- mice, these beneficial effects were superior to those of chronic bumetanide administration. At transcriptional level, chronic NaBr in Oprm1 null mice was associated with increased expression of genes coding for chloride ions transporters, GABAA receptor subunits, oxytocin and mGlu4 receptor. Lastly, we uncovered synergistic alleviating effects of chronic NaBr and a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of mGlu4 receptor on autistic-like behavior in Oprm1-/- mice. We evidenced in heterologous cells that bromide ions behave as PAMs of mGlu4, providing a molecular mechanism for such synergy. Our data reveal the therapeutic potential of bromide ions, alone or in combination with a PAM of mGlu4 receptor, for the treatment of ASDs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The calcium sensor synaptotagmin-1 is critical for phasic axonal dopamine release in the striatum and mesencephalon, but is dispensable for basic motor behaviors in mice</a></h4>

              
                Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons, a population of cells that are critical for motor control, motivated behaviors and cognition, release DA via an exocytotic mechanism from both their axonal terminals and their somatodendritic (STD) compartment. In Parkinson's disease (PD), it is striking that motor dysfunctions only become apparent after extensive loss of DA innervation. Although it has been hypothesized that this resilience is due to the ability of many motor behaviors to be sustained through a basal tone of DA and diffuse transmission, experimental evidence for this is limited. Here we conditionally deleted the calcium sensor synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) in DA neurons (cKODA mice) to abrogate most activity-dependent axonal DA release in the striatum and mesencephalon, leaving STD DA release intact. Strikingly, Syt1 cKODA mice showed intact performance in multiple unconditioned DA-dependent motor tasks, suggesting that activity-dependent DA release is dispensable for such basic motor functions. Basal extracellular levels of DA in the striatum were unchanged, suggesting that a basal tone of extracellular DA is sufficient to sustain basic movement. We also found multiple adaptations in the DA system of cKODA mice, similar to those happening at early stages of PD. Taken together, our findings reveal the striking resilience of DA-dependent motor functions in the context of a near-abolition of phasic DA release, shedding new light on why extensive loss of DA innervation is required to reveal motor dysfunctions in PD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">GABA and IA Independently Regulate rNST Responses to Afferent Input</a></h4>

              
                Taste responses in the rostral nucleus of the solitary tract (rNST) influence motivated ingestive behavior via ascending pathways, and consummatory reflex behavior via local, brainstem connections. Modifications to the afferent signal within the rNST include changes in gain (the overall rate of neuron activity) and changes in gustatory tuning (the degree to which individual neurons respond to divergent gustatory qualities). These alterations of the sensory signal derive from both synaptic interactions within the nucleus and the constitutive cellular membrane properties of rNST neurons. GABA neurons are well represented within the rNST, as is expression of KV4.3, a channel for a rapidly inactivating outward K+ current (IA). GABAergic synapses suppress rNST responses to afferent input and previous studies showed that this suppression is greater in cells expressing IA, suggesting a possible interaction. Here, we examine the potential interaction between GABAergic inhibition and IA channels in a series of patch clamp experiments. Optogenetic release of GABA suppressed rNST responses to afferent (electrical) stimulation and this effect was greater in cells with IA, confirming an earlier report. We further observed that the composite inhibitory postsynaptic potential was larger in IA positive cells, suggesting one mechanism for the greater afferent suppression. Blocking IA with the channel blocker AmmTX3, enhanced the response to afferent stimulation, suggesting a suppressive role for this channel in regulating afferent input at rest. However, pharmacologic blockade of IA did not suppress GABAergic inhibition, indicating that IA and GABA independently regulate excitatory afferent input.

                To engage with the world, we must regularly make predictions about the outcomes of physical scenes. How do we make these predictions? Recent evidence points to simulation - the idea that we can introspectively manipulate rich, mental models of the world - as one possible explanation for how such predictions are accomplished. While theories based on simulation are supported by computational models, neuroscientific evidence for simulation is lacking and many important questions remain. For instance, do simulations simply entail a series of abstract computations? Or are they supported by sensory representations of the objects that comprise the scene being simulated? We posit the latter and suggest that the process of simulating a sequence of physical interactions is likely to evoke an imagery-like envisioning of those interactions. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we demonstrate that when participants predict how a ball will fall through an obstacle-filled display, motion-sensitive brain regions are activated. We further demonstrate that this activity, which occurs even though no motion is being sensed, resembles activity patterns that arise while participants perceive the ball's motion. This finding suggests that the process of simulating the ball's movement is accompanied by a sensory representation of this movement. These data thus demonstrate that mental simulations recreate sensory depictions of how a physical scene is likely to unfold.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Environmental and molecular modulation of motor individuality in larval zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Innate behavioral biases such as human handedness are a ubiquitous form of inter-individual variation that are not strictly hardwired into the genome and are influenced by diverse internal and external cues. Yet, genetic and environmental factors modulating behavioral variation remain poorly understood, especially in vertebrates. To identify genetic and environmental factors that influence behavioral variation, we take advantage of larval zebrafish light-search behavior. During light-search, individuals preferentially turn in leftward or rightward loops, in which directional bias is sustained and non-heritable, and maintained by a habenula-rostral PT circuit. Here we use a medium-throughput recording strategy and unbiased analysis to show that significant individual to individual variation exists in wildtype larval zebrafish turning preference. We classify stable left, right, and unbiased turning types, with most individuals exhibiting a directional preference. Raising larvae at elevated temperature selectively reduces the leftward turning type and impacts rostral PT neurons, specifically. Exposure to conspecifics, variable salinity, environmental enrichment, and physical disturbance does not significantly impact inter-individual turning bias. Pharmacological manipulation of Notch signaling and carrying a mutant allele of a known Notch pathway affecter gene, gsx2, disrupted turn bias individuality in a dose-dependent manner. These results establish that larval zebrafish is a powerful vertebrate model for inter-individual variation with sensitivity to specific environmental perturbations and gene dosage.

                The ligand-sensing transcription factor Nurr1 emerges as a promising therapeutic target for neurodegenerative pathologies but Nurr1 ligands for functional studies and therapeutic validation are lacking. Here we report pronounced Nurr1 modulation by statins for which clinically relevant neuroprotective effects have been demonstrated. Several statins directly affected Nurr1 activity in cellular and cell-free settings with low micromolar to sub-micromolar potencies. Simvastatin exhibited anti-inflammatory effects in astrocytes which were abrogated by Nurr1 knockdown. Differential gene expression analysis in native and Nurr1 silenced cells revealed strong proinflammatory effects of Nurr1 knockdown while simvastatin treatment induced several neuroprotective mechanisms via Nurr1, for example, in energy utilization and reduced apoptosis. These findings suggest Nurr1 involvement in the well-documented but mechanistically elusive neuroprotection by statins.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The secretome of M1 and M2 microglia differently regulate proliferation, differentiation and survival of adult neural stem/progenitor cell</a></h4>

              
                Microglia has been reported to be able to regulate the proliferation, differentiation and survival of adult Neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) by modulating the microenvironment, which results in different consequences of adult neurogenesis. However, whether the microglial activation is beneficial or harmful to NSPCs is still controversial because of the complexity and variability of microglial activation phenotypes. In this study, we detected the expression levels of M1 marker and M2 marker in IFN-{gamma}- and IL-4-induced microglia at different time, respectively. The phenotypic markers of M1 and M2 microglia were stable for 24 h after removal of IFN-{gamma} and IL-4 intervention, but exhibited different change patterns during the next 24 h. Then, the adult NSPCs were treated by the conditioned medium from IFN-{gamma}- and IL-4-activated microglia. The conditioned medium from IFN-{gamma}-activated microglia promoted apoptosis and astroglial differentiation of NSPCs, while suppressed proliferation and neuronal differentiation of NSPCs. However, the conditioned medium from IL-4-activated microglia exhibited opposite effects on these physiological processes. In addition, the direct treatment of IFN-{gamma} or IL-4 alone did not significantly affect the proliferation, differentiation and survival of NSPCs. These results suggest that the secretome of pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) microglia differently regulated the proliferation, differentiation and survival of adult NSPCs. These findings will help further study the biological mechanism of microglia regulating neurogenesis, and provide a therapeutic strategy for neurological diseases by regulating microglial phenotypes to affect neurogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neurotransmitter regulation rather than cell-intrinsic properties shape the high-pass filtering properties of olfactory bulb glomeruli</a></h4>

              
                GABAergic periglomerular (PG) cells in the olfactory bulb are proposed to mediate an intraglomerular high-pass filter through inhibition targeted onto a glomerulus. With this mechanism, weak stimuli (e.g., an odor with a low affinity for an odorant receptor) mainly produce PG cell-driven inhibition but strong stimuli generate enough excitation to overcome inhibition. PG cells may be particularly susceptible to being activated by weak stimuli due to their intrinsically small size and high input resistance. Here, we used dual-cell patch-clamp recordings and imaging methods in bulb slices obtained from wild-type and transgenic rats with labeled GABAergic cells to test a number of predictions of the high-pass filtering model. We first directly compared the responsiveness of PG cells with that of external tufted cells (eTCs), which are a class of excitatory interneurons that reside in a parallel but opposing position in the glomerular circuitry. PG cells were in fact found to be no more responsive than eTCs at low levels of sensory neuron activity. While PG cells required smaller currents to be excited, this advantage was offset by the fact that a given level of sensory neuron activity produced much smaller synaptic currents. We did however identify other factors that shaped the excitation/inhibition balance in a manner that would support a high-pass filter, including glial glutamate transporters and presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors. We conclude that a single glomerulus may act as a high-pass filter to enhance the contrast between different olfactory stimuli through mechanisms that are largely independent cell intrinsic properties.

                Spinal cord, as part of the central nervous system, accounts for the main communication pathway between the brain and the peripheral nervous system. Spinal cord injury is a devastating and largely irreversible neurological trauma, and can result in lifelong disability and paralysis with no available cure. In vivo spinal cord imaging in mouse models without introducing immunological artifacts is critical to understand spinal cord pathology and discover effective treatments. We developed a minimal-invasive intervertebral window by retaining ligamentum flavum to protect the underlying spinal cord. By introducing an optical clearing method, we achieved repeated two-photon fluorescence and stimulated Raman scattering imaging at subcellular resolution with up to 16 imaging sessions over 167 days and observed no inflammatory response. Using this optically cleared intervertebral window, we studied the neuron-glia dynamics following laser axotomy and observed strengthened contact of microglia with the nodes of Ranvier during axonal degeneration. By enabling long-term, repetitive, stable, high-resolution and inflammation-free imaging of mouse spinal cord, our method provides a reliable platform in the research aiming at understanding and treatment of spinal cord pathology.

                Reward motivation enhances memory through interactions between mesolimbic, hippocampal, and cortical systems - both during and after encoding. Developmental changes in these distributed neural circuits may lead to age-related differences in reward-motivated memory and the underlying neural mechanisms. Converging evidence from cross-species studies suggests that subcortical dopamine signaling is increased during adolescence, which may lead to stronger memory representations of rewarding, relative to mundane, events and changes in the contributions of underlying subcortical and cortical brain mechanisms across age. Here, we used fMRI to examine how reward motivation influences the "online" encoding and "offline" post-encoding brain mechanisms that support long-term associative memory from childhood to adulthood. We found that reward motivation led to both age-invariant as well as adolescent-specific enhancements in associative memory after 24 hours. Furthermore, reward-related memory benefits were linked to age-varying neural mechanisms. During encoding, interactions between the prefrontal cortex and ventral tegmental area (VTA) were associated with better high-reward memory to a greater degree with increasing age. Pre- to post-encoding changes in functional connectivity between the anterior hippocampus and VTA were also associated with better high-reward memory, but more so at younger ages. Our findings suggest that there may be developmental shifts - from offline subcortical to online cortical processes - in the brain mechanisms supporting reward-motivated memory.

                Background: Crocin is a major active component of saffron (Crocus sativus) with many beneficial effects. More recently, crocin has been proposed for management of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we demonstrated for the first time that crocin reduced amyloid-beta generation through promoting alpha cleavage of APP processing and inhibited ER stress by attenuating UPR signaling in N2a/APP cells. Methodology: Mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells stably transfected with the Swedish mutant APP (N2a/APP) was used as a cellular model for AD pathogenesis. Vector transfected cells (N2a/vector) were employed to serve as control. The toxicity of crocin was first evaluated and non-toxic treatment of crocin (>30 micromolar for 24 h) was used for further investigations. Amyloid beta levels were determined by ELISA. Expression levels of UPR signaling proteins were determined by using Western blot. Results: Crocin significantly inhibited the protein expression of total APP in N2a/APP cells and promoted alpha cleavage of APP processing to increase sAPPalpha generation, but only modestly reduced BACE-1 and PS1, suggesting amyloid beta reduction by crocin was mainly associated with the non-amyloidogenic APP processing. Further investigation on ER stress related protein expressions showed that GRP78, CHOP, p-PERK, p-eIF2alpha, p-IREalpha, XBP1, ATF6alpha, and PDI were all significantly elevated in N2a/APP cells compared to N2a/vector. Crocin effectively reduced the levels of GRP78 and CHOP, and significantly inhibited p-PERK/p-eIF2, and AT6, while slightly reduced p-IRE1alpha. Conclusion: The present study showed that crocin was effective at blocking amyloid beta generation and inhibiting ER stress associated overactivation of UPR signaling in AD cell model N2a/APP. The results provided evidence for crocin as useful natural product for the treatment of AD.

                Active avoidance behavior, in which an animal performs an action to avoid a stressor, is crucial for survival and may provide insight into avoidance behaviors seen in anxiety disorders. Active avoidance requires the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), which is thought to regulate avoidance via downstream projections to the striatum and amygdala. However, the endogenous activity of projection-defined dmPFC subpopulations during active avoidance learning remains unexplored. Here we utilized fiber photometry to record from the dmPFC and its downstream projections to the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA) during active avoidance learning in mice. We examined neural activity during conditioned stimulus (CS) presentations, active avoidance, and cued freezing. Both prefrontal projections showed learning-related increases in activity during CS onset throughout active avoidance training. The dmPFC as a whole showed increased activity during avoidance and decreased activity during cued freezing. Finally, dmPFC-DMS and dmPFC-BLA projections showed divergent encoding of active avoidance behavior, with the dmPFC-DMS projection showing increased activity and the dmPFC-BLA showing decreased activity during active avoidance. Our results identify differential prefrontal encoding of active and passive coping behaviors in the same behavioral paradigm and demonstrate divergent encoding of active avoidance in projection-specific dmPFC subpopulations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Intact reading ability in spite of a spatially distributed visual word form 'area' in an individual born without the left superior temporal lobe</a></h4>

              
                The visual word form area (VWFA) is an experience-dependent brain region in the left ventral temporal cortex of literate adults that responds selectively to visual words. Why does it emerge in this stereotyped location? Past research has shown that the VWFA is preferentially connected to the left-lateralized frontotemporal language network. However, it remains unclear whether the presence of a typical language network and its connections with ventral temporal cortex (VTC) are critical for the VWFA's emergence, and whether alternative functional architectures may support reading ability. We explored these questions in an individual (EG) born without the left superior temporal lobe but exhibiting normal reading ability. Using fMRI, we recorded brain activation to visual words, objects, faces, and scrambled words in EG and neurotypical controls. We did not observe word selectivity either in EG's right homotope of the VWFA (rVWFA)--the most expected location given that EG's language network is right-lateralized--or in her spared left VWFA (lVWFA), in the presence of typical face selectivity in both the right and left fusiform face area (rFFA, lFFA). Interestingly, multivariate pattern analyses revealed voxels in EG's rVWFA and lVWFA that showed 1) higher within- than between- category correlations for words (e.g., Words-Words>Words-Faces), and 2) higher within-category correlations for words than other categories (e.g., Words-Words>Faces-Faces). These results suggest that a typical left-hemisphere language network may be necessary for the emergence of focal word selectivity within ventral temporal cortex, and that orthographic processing may depend on a distributed neural code, which appears capable of supporting reading ability.

	<p>Accurate identification of the prodromal stage of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), in adults with Down syndrome (MCI-DS) has been challenging because there are no established diagnostic criteria that can be applied for people with lifelong intellectual disabilities (ID). As such, the sequence of cognitive decline in adults with DS has been difficult to ascertain, and it is possible that domain constructs characterizing cognitive function in neurotypical adults do not generalize to this high-risk population. The present study examined associations among multiple measures of cognitive function in adults with DS, either prior to or during the prodromal stage of AD to determine, through multiple statistical techniques, the measures that reflected the same underlying domains of processing. Participants included 144 adults with DS 40–82 years of age, all enrolled in a larger, multidisciplinary study examining biomarkers of AD in adults with DS. All participants had mild or moderate lifelong intellectual disabilities. Overall AD-related clinical status was rated for each individual during a personalized consensus conference that considered performance as well as health status, with 103 participants considered cognitively stable (CS) and 41 to have MCI-DS. Analyses of 17 variables derived from 10 tests of cognition indicated that performance reflected three underlying factors: language/executive function, memory, and visuomotor. All three domain composite scores significantly predicted MCI-DS status. Based upon path modeling, the language/executive function composite score was the most affected by prodromal AD. However, based upon structural equation modeling, tests assessing the latent construct of memory were the most impacted, followed by those assessing visuomotor, and then those assessing language/executive function. Our study provides clear evidence that cognitive functioning in older adults with DS can be characterized at the cognitive domain level, but the statistical methods selected and the inclusion or exclusion of certain covariates may lead to different conclusions. Best practice requires investigators to understand the internal structure of their variables and to provide evidence that their variables assess their intended constructs.</p>

	<p>Background: The rapid expansion and severity of the COVID-19 contagion has had negative physical and psychological health implications for millions of people around the world, but even more so among children and adolescents. Given the severity of the situation and the small number of studies on the direct influence of viral infection on the cognitive development within adolescents, the present study aims at understanding the consequences of contracting the virus and being hospitalized in relation to cognitive functioning, in particular, for executive functioning, among adolescents. Methods: To all subjects included in the sample, divided into four groups based on the severity of the COVID-19 infection, were administered the WISC-IV in order to evaluate the global cognitive functioning, and subsequently, the subtests Courses and Tower of London (ToL), both part of the BVN 12–18, were administered for the evaluation of executive operation. Results: Our analyses showed that between subjects who did not contract the viral infection and those who contracted it in an asymptomatic form, there are no significant differences in cognitive functioning, but only in executive functioning. Furthermore, in both hospitalized and non-hospitalized subjects, we found lower scores especially for WM skills, while IQ scores are in a medium range. Conclusion: the present study shows that contracting the viral infection and, thus, being hospitalized, caused greater problems and difficulties as compared to those who were not hospitalized, impacting global cognitive (and executive) functioning, especially the WM. We believe that these results could allow an early detection of alterations in cognitive and executive functioning, a fundamental aspect of the interventions that occur in evolutionary phases such as those related to pre-adolescence, allowing, therefore, the activation of functional recovery pathways in a short time.</p>

	<p>Background: The combination of intralabyrinthine schwannoma (ILS) removal and cochlear implantation is the standard of care after surgical resection for audiological rehabilitation. Intracochlear ILS is not only the most frequent tumor in this group of schwannomas, but it is also, to some degree, surgically the most challenging because of its position behind the modiolus. Recent developments in the knowledge of implant position, implant magnet choice, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences make an MRI follow-up after surgical removal possible. Thus far, no results are known about the surgical success and residual rate of these kind of tumors. The aim of the present study was to perform an early MRI follow-up for the evaluation of residual or recurrent intracochlear ILS after surgical removal and cochlear implantation. Methods: In a retrospective study, we evaluated seven patients after an intracochlear ILS removal and single-stage cochlear implantation with a mean period of 13.4 months post surgery with a 3T T1 GAD 2 mm sequence for a residual ILS. Patients were operated on using an individualized technique concept. Results: In six out of seven cases, 3 T T1 GAD 2 mm MRI follow-up showed no residual or recurrent tumor. In one case, a T1 signal indicated a tumor of the upper inner auditory canal (IAC) at the MRI follow up. Conclusion: MRI follow-up as a quality control tool after ILS removal and cochlear implantation is highly important to exclude residual tumors. Long-term MRI evaluation results are needed and can be obtained under consideration of implant position, implant magnet, and MRI sequence choice. A preoperative MRI slice thickness less than 2 mm can be recommended to visualize possible modiolar and IAC expansion.</p>

	<p>Attachment scholars have long argued that insecure attachment patterns are associated with vulnerability to internalizing symptoms, such as depression and anxiety symptoms. However, accumulating evidence from the past four decades, summarized in four large meta-analyses evaluating the link between insecure attachment subtypes and internalizing symptoms, provide divergent evidence for this claim. This divergent evidence may be accounted for, at least in part, by the developmental period under examination. Specifically, children with histories of deactivating (i.e., insecure/avoidant) but not hyperactivating (i.e., insecure/resistant) attachment patterns in infancy and early childhood showed elevated internalizing symptoms. In contrast, adolescents and adults with hyperactivating (i.e., insecure/preoccupied) but not deactivating (i.e., insecure/dismissing) attachment classifications showed elevated internalizing symptoms. In this paper, we summarize findings from four large meta-analyses and highlight the divergent meta-analytic findings that emerge across different developmental periods. We first present several potential methodological issues that may have contributed to these divergent findings. Then, we leverage clinical, developmental, and evolutionary perspectives to propose a testable lifespan development theory of attachment and internalizing symptoms that integrates findings across meta-analyses. According to this theory, subtypes of insecure attachment patterns may be differentially linked to internalizing symptoms depending on their mis/match with the developmentally appropriate orientation tendency toward caregivers (in childhood) or away from them (i.e., toward greater independence in post-childhood). Lastly, we offer future research directions to test this theory.</p>

	<p>Mental activity in sleep often involves visual and auditory content. Chemosensory (olfactory and gustatory) experiences are less common and underexplored. The aim of the study was to identify olfaction-related factors that may affect the occurrence of chemosensory dream content. Specifically, we investigated the effects of all-night exposure to an ambient odour, participants’ appraisal of their current olfactory environment, their general propensity to notice odours and act on them (i.e., odour awareness), and their olfactory acuity. Sixty pre-screened healthy young adults underwent olfactory assessment, completed a measure of odour awareness, and spent three nights in weekly intervals in a sleep laboratory. The purpose of the first visit was to adapt to the experimental setting. On the second visit, half of them were exposed to the smell of vanillin or thioglycolic acid and the other half to an odourless control condition. On the third visit, they received control or stimulation in a balanced order. On each visit, data were collected twice: once from the first rapid eye movement (REM) stage that occurred after 3 a.m., and then shortly before getting up, usually from a non-REM stage. Participants were asked to report the presence of sensory dream content and to assess their current olfactory environment. Neither exposure, nor participants’ assessments of the ambient odour, or olfactory acuity affected reports of chemosensory dream content but they were more frequent in individuals with greater odour awareness. This finding may have implications for treatment when such experiences become unwanted or bothersome.</p>

	<p>Pain is an important non-motor symptom of Parkinson’s disease (PD). It negatively impacts the quality of life. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying pain in PD remain to be elucidated. This study sought to use electroencephalographic (EEG) coherence analysis to compare neuronal synchronization in neuronal networks between patients with PD, with and without pain. Twenty-four patients with sporadic PD were evaluated for the presence of pain. Time-frequency and coherence analyses were performed on their EEG data. Whole-brain and regional coherence were calculated and compared between pain-positive and pain-negative patients. There was no significant difference in the whole-brain coherence between the pain-positive and pain-negative groups. However, temporal–temporal coherence differed significantly between the two groups (p = 0.031). Our findings indicate that aberrant synchronization of inter-temporal regions is involved in PD-related pain. This will further our understanding of the mechanisms underlying pain in PD.</p>

	<p>Adults with Down syndrome (DS) have an exceptionally high frequency of Alzheimer disease (AD) with a wide variability in onset, from 40 to 70 years of age. Equally prevalent in DS is hypothyroidism. In this study, we sought to quantify the relationship between the two. A total of 232 adults with DS and AD were stratified into three AD onset age groups: early (&amp;amp;lt;47 years), typical (48–59), and late (&amp;amp;gt;59). Among patients with available data, differences in the distributions of demographics, hypothyroidism variables (presence, age of onset), thyroid function tests, thyroid autoantibodies, and APOE genotypes were assessed (e.g., chi-squared, Mann–Whitney tests). Spearman and partial Spearman correlations and ordinal logistic regression models were constructed to quantify the association between ages of AD and hypothyroidism onset with and without covariate adjustments. We observed a positive association between the ages of AD and hypothyroidism onset after accounting for APOE-Ɛ4 (correlation: 0.44, 0.24, 0.60; odds ratio: 1.09, 1.05–1.14). However, an early age of hypothyroidism onset and the presence of the APOE-Ɛ4 allele were independently associated with the early age of AD onset. Similar findings were observed when accounting for other factors. Our study provides evidence for the importance of hypothyroidism and associated pathological mechanisms for risk of AD in DS.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Cellular resolution anatomical and molecular atlases for prenatal human brains</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Increasing interest in studies of prenatal human brain development, particularly using new single-cell genomics and anatomical technologies to create cell atlases, creates a strong need for accurate and detailed anatomical reference atlases. In this study, we present two cellular-resolution digital anatomical atlases for prenatal human brain at post-conceptional weeks (PCW) 15 and 21. Both atlases were annotated on sequential Nissl-stained sections covering brain-wide structures on the basis of combined analysis of cytoarchitecture, acetylcholinesterase staining and an extensive marker gene expression dataset. This high information content dataset allowed reliable and accurate demarcation of developing cortical and subcortical structures and their subdivisions. Furthermore, using the anatomical atlases as a guide, spatial expression of 37 and 5 genes from the brains respectively at PCW 15 and 21 was annotated, illustrating reliable marker genes for many developing brain structures. Finally, the present study uncovered several novel developmental features, such as the lack of an outer subventricular zone in the hippocampal formation and entorhinal cortex, and the apparent extension of both cortical (excitatory) and subcortical (inhibitory) progenitors into the prenatal olfactory bulb. These comprehensive atlases provide useful tools for visualization, segmentation, targeting, imaging and interpretation of brain structures of prenatal human brain, and for guiding and interpreting the next generation of cell census and connectome studies.</p>

                <p>Treatment options for cerebral infarction beyond the time window of reperfusion therapy are limited, and novel approaches are needed. PDGF-B is considered neuroprotective; however, it is difficult to administer at effective concentrations to infarct areas. Nanoparticles (NPs) are small and stable; therefore, we modified PDGF-B to the surface of naturally occurring heat shock protein NPs (HSPNPs) to examine its therapeutic effect in cerebral infarction. PDGF-B modified HSPNPs (PDGF-B HSPNPs) were injected 1 d after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (t-MCAO) in CB-17 model mice. We analyzed the infarct volume and motor functional recovery at 3 and 7 d. PDGF-B HSPNPs were specifically distributed in the infarct area, and compared with HSPNPs alone, they significantly reduced infarct volumes and improved neurologic function 3 and 7 d after administration. PDGF-B HSPNP administration was associated with strong phosphorylation of Akt in infarct areas and significantly increased neurotrophin (NT)-3 production as well as reduced cell apoptosis compared with HSPNPs alone. Moreover, astrogliosis in peri-infarct area was significantly upregulated with PDGF-B HSPNPs compared with HSPNPs alone. Treatment with PDGF-B HSPNPs might be a novel approach for treating cerebral infarction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Distinct Opsin 3 (Opn3) Expression in the Developing Nervous System during Mammalian Embryogenesis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Opsin 3 (<I>Opn3</I>) is highly expressed in the adult brain, however, information for spatial and temporal expression patterns during embryogenesis is significantly lacking. Here, an <I>Opn3</I>-eGFP reporter mouse line was used to monitor cell body expression and axonal projections during embryonic and early postnatal to adult stages. By applying 2D and 3D fluorescence imaging techniques, we have identified the onset of Opn3 expression, which predominantly occurred during embryonic stages, in various structures during brain/head development. In addition, this study defines over twenty <I>Opn3</I>-eGFP-positive neural structures never reported before. <I>Opn3</I>-eGFP was first observed at E9.5 in neural regions, including the ganglia that will ultimately form the trigeminal, facial and vestibulocochlear cranial nerves (CNs). As development proceeds, expanded <I>Opn3</I>-eGFP expression coincided with the formation and maturation of critical components of the central and peripheral nervous systems (CNS, PNS), including various motor-sensory tracts, such as the dorsal column-medial lemniscus (DCML) sensory tract, and olfactory, acoustic, and optic tracts. The widespread, yet distinct, detection of <I>Opn3</I>-eGFP already at early embryonic stages suggests that Opn3 might play important functional roles in the developing brain and spinal cord to regulate multiple motor and sensory circuitry systems, including proprioception, nociception, ocular movement, and olfaction, as well as memory, mood, and emotion. This study presents a crucial blueprint from which to investigate autonomic and cognitive opsin-dependent neural development and resultant behaviors under physiological and pathophysiological conditions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">TMEM16A and TMEM16B Modulate Pheromone-Evoked Action Potential Firing in Mouse Vomeronasal Sensory Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The mouse vomeronasal system controls several social behaviors. Pheromones and other social cues are detected by sensory neurons in the vomeronasal organ (VNO). Stimuli activate a transduction cascade that leads to membrane potential depolarization, increase in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> level, and increased firing. The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated chloride channels TMEM16A and TMEM16B are co-expressed within microvilli of vomeronasal neurons, but their physiological role remains elusive. Here, we investigate the contribution of each of these channels to vomeronasal neuron firing activity by comparing wild-type (WT) and knock-out (KO) mice. Performing loose-patch recordings from neurons in acute VNO slices, we show that spontaneous activity is modified by <I>Tmem16a</I> KO, indicating that TMEM16A, but not TMEM16B, is active under basal conditions. Upon exposure to diluted urine, a rich source of mouse pheromones, we observe significant changes in activity. Vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs) from <I>Tmem16a</I> cKO and <I>Tmem16b</I> KO mice show shorter interspike intervals (ISIs) compared with WT mice, indicating that both TMEM16A and TMEM16B modulate the firing pattern of pheromone-evoked activity in VSNs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Effects of Cooling Temperatures via Thermal K2P Channels on Regeneration of High-Frequency Action Potentials at Nodes of Ranvier of Rat A{beta}-Afferent Nerves</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Temperature-sensitive two-pore domain potassium channels (thermal K2P) are recently shown to cluster at nodes of Ranvier (NRs) and play a key role in action potential (AP) regeneration and conduction on A&beta;-afferent nerves. Cooling temperatures affect AP regeneration and conduction on A&beta;-afferent nerves but the underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. Here, we have performed patch-clamp recordings directly at the NR in an <I>ex vivo</I> trigeminal nerve preparation. We have characterized the effects of cooling temperatures on intrinsic electrophysiological properties and AP regeneration at the NR on rat A&beta;-afferent nerves, and determined whether and how thermal K2P channels may be involved in the effects of cooling temperatures. We show that cooling temperatures from 35&deg;C to 15&deg;C decrease outward leak currents, increase input resistance, depolarize resting membrane potential (RMP), broaden AP width and increase latency of AP threshold at the NR. We further demonstrate that cooling temperatures impair regeneration of high-frequency AP trains at the NR. The effects of cooling temperatures on the intrinsic electrophysiological properties and regeneration of high-frequency AP trains at the NR can be partially reversed by BL-1249 (BL), arachidonic acid (AA), and intra-axonal protons, three thermal K2P activators, indicating the involvement of thermal K2P channels. Moreover, we show that at cooling temperatures there are interplays among thermal K2P channels, RMPs, and voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels, which together limit regeneration of high-frequency AP trains at the NR. Our findings demonstrate a new role of thermal K2P channels in temperature-dependent conduction of high-frequency sensory signals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Glymphatic System: A Novel Component of Fundamental Neurobiology</a></h4>

              
                <p>Throughout the body, lymphatic fluid movement supports critical functions including clearance of excess fluid and metabolic waste. The glymphatic system is the analog of the lymphatic system in the CNS. As such, the glymphatic system plays a key role in regulating directional interstitial fluid movement, waste clearance, and, potentially, brain immunity. The glymphatic system enables bulk movement of CSF from the subarachnoid space along periarterial spaces, where it mixes with interstitial fluid within the parenchyma before ultimately exiting from the parenchyma via perivenous spaces. This review focuses on important questions about the structure of this system, why the brain needs a fluid transport system, and unexplored aspects of brain fluid transport. We provide evidence that astrocytes and blood vessels determine the shape of the perivascular space, ultimately controlling the movement of perivascular fluid. Glymphatic fluid movement has the potential to alter local as well as global transport of signaling molecules and metabolites. We also highlight the evidence for cross talk among the glymphatic system, cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal tract, and lymphatic system. Much remains to be studied, but we propose that the glymphatic/lymphatic system acts as a cornerstone in signaling between the brain and body.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Intercellular Arc Signaling Regulates Vasodilation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Injury responses require communication between different cell types in the skin. Sensory neurons contribute to inflammation and can secrete signaling molecules that affect non-neuronal cells. Despite the pervasive role of translational regulation in nociception, the contribution of activity-dependent protein synthesis to inflammation is not well understood. To address this problem, we examined the landscape of nascent translation in murine dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons treated with inflammatory mediators using ribosome profiling. We identified the activity-dependent gene, Arc, as a target of translation <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I>. Inflammatory cues promote local translation of Arc in the skin. Arc-deficient male mice display exaggerated paw temperatures and vasodilation in response to an inflammatory challenge. Since Arc has recently been shown to be released from neurons in extracellular vesicles (EVs), we hypothesized that intercellular Arc signaling regulates the inflammatory response in skin. We found that the excessive thermal responses and vasodilation observed in Arc defective mice are rescued by injection of Arc-containing EVs into the skin. Our findings suggest that activity-dependent production of Arc in afferent fibers regulates neurogenic inflammation potentially through intercellular signaling.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Nociceptors play prominent roles in pain and inflammation. We examined rapid changes in the landscape of nascent translation in cultured dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) treated with a combination of inflammatory mediators using ribosome profiling. We identified several hundred transcripts subject to rapid preferential translation. Among them is the immediate early gene (IEG) Arc. We provide evidence that Arc is translated in afferent fibers in the skin. Arc-deficient mice display several signs of exaggerated inflammation which is normalized on injection of Arc containing extracellular vesicles (EVs). Our work suggests that noxious cues can trigger Arc production by nociceptors which in turn constrains neurogenic inflammation in the skin.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">G-Protein-Coupled Estrogen Receptor (GPER) in the Rostral Ventromedial Medulla Is Essential for Mobilizing Descending Inhibition of Itch</a></h4>

              
                <p>Chronic itch is a troublesome condition and often difficult to cure. Emerging evidence suggests that the periaqueductal gray (PAG)-rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) pathway may play an important role in the regulation of itch, but the cellular organization and molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that a group of RVM neurons distinctively express the G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), which mediates descending inhibition of itch. We found that GPER<sup>+</sup> neurons in the RVM were activated in chronic itch conditions in rats and mice. Selective ablation or chemogenetic suppression of RVM GPER<sup>+</sup> neurons resulted in mechanical alloknesis and increased scratching in response to pruritogens, whereas chemogenetic activation of GPER<sup>+</sup> neurons abrogated itch responses, indicating that GPER<sup>+</sup> neurons are antipruritic. Moreover, GPER-deficient mice and rats of either sex exhibited hypersensitivity to mechanical and chemical itch, a phenotype reversible by the &micro; type opioid receptor (MOR) antagonism. Additionally, significant MOR phosphorylation in the RVM was detected in chronic itch models in wild-type but not in GPER<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> rats. Therefore, GPER not only identifies a population of medullary antipruritic neurons but may also determine the descending antipruritic tone through regulating &micro; opioid signaling.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Therapeutic options for itch are limited because of an as yet incomplete understanding of the mechanisms of itch processing. Our data have provided novel insights into the cellular organization and molecular mechanisms of descending regulation of itch in normal and pathologic conditions. GPER<sup>+</sup> neurons (largely GABAergic) in the RVM are antipruritic neurons under tonic opioidergic inhibition, activation of GPER promotes phosphorylation of MOR and disinhibition of the antipruritic GPER<sup>+</sup> neurons from inhibitory opioidergic inputs, and failure to mobilize GPER<sup>+</sup> neurons may result in the exacerbation of itch. Our data also illuminate on some of the outstanding questions in the field, such as the mechanisms underlying sex bias in itch, pain, and opioid analgesia and the paradoxical effects of morphine on pain and itch.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">RIM-Binding Protein 2 Organizes Ca2+ Channel Topography and Regulates Release Probability and Vesicle Replenishment at a Fast Central Synapse</a></h4>

              
                <p>Rab-interacting molecule (RIM)-binding protein 2 (BP2) is a multidomain protein of the presynaptic active zone (AZ). By binding to RIM, bassoon (Bsn), and voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (Ca<SUB>V</SUB>), it is considered to be a central organizer of the topography of Ca<SUB>V</SUB> and release sites of synaptic vesicles (SVs) at the AZ. Here, we used RIM-BP2 knock-out (KO) mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates of either sex to investigate the role of RIM-BP2 at the endbulb of Held synapse of auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) with bushy cells (BCs) of the cochlear nucleus, a fast relay of the auditory pathway with high release probability. Disruption of RIM-BP2 lowered release probability altering short-term plasticity and reduced evoked EPSCs. Analysis of SV pool dynamics during high-frequency train stimulation indicated a reduction of SVs with high release probability but an overall normal size of the readily releasable SV pool (RRP). The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent fast component of SV replenishment after RRP depletion was slowed. Ultrastructural analysis by superresolution light and electron microscopy revealed an impaired topography of presynaptic Ca<SUB>V</SUB> and a reduction of docked and membrane-proximal SVs at the AZ. We conclude that RIM-BP2 organizes the topography of Ca<SUB>V</SUB>, and promotes SV tethering and docking. This way RIM-BP2 is critical for establishing a high initial release probability as required to reliably signal sound onset information that we found to be degraded in BCs of RIM-BP2-deficient mice <I>in vivo</I>.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Rab-interacting molecule (RIM)-binding proteins (BPs) are key organizers of the active zone (AZ). Using a multidisciplinary approach to the calyceal endbulb of Held synapse that transmits auditory information at rates of up to hundreds of Hertz with submillisecond precision we demonstrate a requirement for RIM-BP2 for normal auditory signaling. Endbulb synapses lacking RIM-BP2 show a reduced release probability despite normal whole-terminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and abundance of the key priming protein Munc13-1, a reduced rate of SV replenishment, as well as an altered topography of voltage-gated (Ca<SUB>V</SUB>)2.1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, and fewer docked and membrane proximal synaptic vesicles (SVs). This hampers transmission of sound onset information likely affecting downstream neural computations such as of sound localization.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Autism Spectrum Disorder/Intellectual Disability-Associated Mutations in Trio Disrupt Neuroligin 1-Mediated Synaptogenesis</a></h4>

              
                <p>We recently identified an autism spectrum disorder/intellectual disability (ASD/ID)-related <I>de novo</I> mutation hotspot in the Rac1-activating GEF1 domain of the protein Trio. Trio is a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF) that is essential for glutamatergic synapse function. An ASD/ID-related mutation identified in Trio's GEF1 domain, Trio D1368V, produces a pathologic increase in glutamatergic synaptogenesis, suggesting that Trio is coupled to synaptic regulatory mechanisms that govern glutamatergic synapse formation. However, the molecular mechanisms by which Trio regulates glutamatergic synapses are largely unexplored. Here, using biochemical methods, we identify an interaction between Trio and the synaptogenic protein Neuroligin 1 (NLGN1) in the brain. Molecular biological approaches were then combined with super-resolution dendritic spine imaging and whole-cell voltage-clamp electrophysiology in hippocampal slices from male and female rats to examine the impact ASD/ID-related Trio mutations have on NLGN1-mediated synaptogenesis. We find that an ASD/ID-related mutation in Trio's eighth spectrin repeat region, Trio N1080I, inhibits Trio's interaction with NLGN1 and prevents Trio D1368V-mediated synaptogenesis. Inhibiting Trio's interaction with NLGN1 via Trio N1080I blocked NLGN1-mediated synaptogenesis and increases in synaptic NMDA Receptor function but not NLGN1-mediated increases in synaptic AMPA Receptor function. Finally, we show that the aberrant synaptogenesis produced by Trio D1368V is dependent on NLGN signaling. Our findings demonstrate that ASD/ID-related mutations in Trio are able to pathologically increase as well as decrease NLGN-mediated effects on glutamatergic neurotransmission, and point to an NLGN1-Trio interaction as part of a key pathway involved in ASD/ID etiology.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A number of genes have been implicated in the development of autism spectrum disorder/intellectual disability (ASD/ID) in humans. It is now important to identify relationships between these genes to uncover specific cellular regulatory pathways that contribute to these disorders. In this study, we discover that two glutamatergic synapse regulatory proteins implicated in ASD/ID, Trio and Neuroligin 1, interact with one another to promote glutamatergic synaptogenesis. We also identify ASD/ID-related mutations in Trio that either inhibit or augment Neuroligin 1-mediated glutamatergic synapse formation. Together, our results identify a synaptic regulatory pathway that, when disrupted, likely contributes to the development of ASD/ID. Going forward, it will be important to determine whether this pathway represents a point of convergence of other proteins implicated in ASD/ID.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Differentiation Status of Hair Cells That Regenerate Naturally in the Vestibular Inner Ear of the Adult Mouse</a></h4>

              
                <p>Aging, disease, and trauma can lead to loss of vestibular hair cells and permanent vestibular dysfunction. Previous work showed that, following acute destruction of ~95% of vestibular hair cells in adult mice, ~20% regenerate naturally (without exogenous factors) through supporting cell transdifferentiation. There is, however, no evidence for the recovery of vestibular function. To gain insight into the lack of functional recovery, we assessed functional differentiation in regenerated hair cells for up to 15 months, focusing on key stages in stimulus transduction and transmission: hair bundles, voltage-gated conductances, and synaptic contacts. Regenerated hair cells had many features of mature type II vestibular hair cells, including polarized mechanosensitive hair bundles with zone-appropriate stereocilia heights, large voltage-gated potassium currents, basolateral processes, and afferent and efferent synapses. Regeneration failed, however, to recapture the full range of properties of normal populations, and many regenerated hair cells had some properties of immature hair cells, including small transduction currents, voltage-gated sodium currents, and small or absent HCN (hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated) currents. Furthermore, although mouse vestibular epithelia normally have slightly more type I hair cells than type II hair cells, regenerated hair cells acquired neither the low-voltage-activated potassium channels nor the afferent synaptic calyces that distinguish mature type I hair cells from type II hair cells and confer distinctive physiology. Thus, natural regeneration of vestibular hair cells in adult mice is limited in total cell number, cell type diversity, and extent of cellular differentiation, suggesting that manipulations are needed to promote full regeneration with the potential for recovery of vestibular function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Death of inner ear hair cells in adult mammals causes permanent loss of hearing and balance. In adult mice, the sudden death of most vestibular hair cells stimulates the production of new hair cells but does not restore balance. We investigated whether the lack of systems-level function reflects functional deficiencies in the regenerated hair cells. The regenerated population acquired mechanosensitivity, voltage-gated channels, and afferent synapses, but did not reproduce the full range of hair cell types. Notably, no regenerated cells acquired the distinctive properties of type I hair cells, a major functional class in amniote vestibular organs. To recover vestibular system function in adults, we may need to solve how to regenerate the normal variety of mature hair cells.</p>

                <p>The spatial organization and dynamic interactions between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs that define the receptive field (RF) of simple cells in the cat primary visual cortex (V1) still raise the following paradoxical issues: (1) stimulation of simple cells in V1 with drifting gratings supports a wiring schema of spatially segregated sets of excitatory and inhibitory inputs activated in an opponent way by stimulus contrast polarity and (2) in contrast, intracellular studies using flashed bars suggest that although ON and OFF excitatory inputs are indeed segregated, inhibitory inputs span the entire RF regardless of input contrast polarity. Here, we propose a biologically detailed computational model of simple cells embedded in a V1-like network that resolves this seeming contradiction. We varied parametrically the RF-correlation-based bias for excitatory and inhibitory synapses and found that a moderate bias of excitatory neurons to synapse onto other neurons with correlated receptive fields and a weaker bias of inhibitory neurons to synapse onto other neurons with anticorrelated receptive fields can explain the conductance input, the postsynaptic membrane potential, and the spike train dynamics under both stimulation paradigms. This computational study shows that the same structural model can reproduce the functional diversity of visual processing observed during different visual contexts.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Identifying generic connectivity motives in cortical circuitry encoding for specific functions is crucial for understanding the computations implemented in the cortex. Indirect evidence points to correlation-based biases in the connectivity pattern in V1 of higher mammals, whereby excitatory and inhibitory neurons preferentially synapse onto neurons respectively with correlated and anticorrelated receptive fields. A recent intracellular study questions this push&ndash;pull hypothesis, failing to find spatial anticorrelation patterns between excitation and inhibition across the receptive field. We present here a spiking model of V1 that integrates relevant anatomic and physiological constraints and shows that a more versatile motif of correlation-based connectivity with selectively tuned excitation and broadened inhibition is sufficient to account for the diversity of functional descriptions obtained for different classes of stimuli.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">From Receptive to Perceptive Fields: Size-Dependent Asymmetries in Both Negative Afterimages and Subcortical On and Off Post-Stimulus Responses</a></h4>

              
                <p>Negative afterimages are perceptual phenomena that occur after physical stimuli disappear from sight. Their origin is linked to transient post-stimulus responses of visual neurons. The receptive fields (RFs) of these subcortical ON- and OFF-center neurons exhibit antagonistic interactions between central and surrounding visual space, resulting in selectivity for stimulus polarity and size. These two features are closely intertwined, yet their relationship to negative afterimage perception remains unknown. Here we tested whether size differentially affects the perception of bright and dark negative afterimages in humans of both sexes, and how this correlates with neural mechanisms in subcortical ON and OFF cells. Psychophysically, we found a size-dependent asymmetry whereby dark disks produce stronger and longer-lasting negative afterimages than bright disks of equal contrast at sizes &gt;0.8&deg;. Neurophysiological recordings from retinal and relay cells in female cat dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus showed that subcortical ON cells exhibited stronger sustained post-stimulus responses to dark disks, than OFF cells to bright disks, at sizes &gt;1&deg;. These sizes agree with the emergence of center-surround antagonism, revealing stronger suppression to opposite-polarity stimuli for OFF versus ON cells, particularly in dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. Using a network-based retino-geniculate model, we confirmed stronger antagonism and temporal transience for OFF-cell post-stimulus rebound responses. A V1 population model demonstrated that both strength and duration asymmetries can be propagated to downstream cortical areas. Our results demonstrate how size-dependent antagonism impacts both the neuronal post-stimulus response and the resulting afterimage percepts, thereby supporting the idea of perceptual RFs reflecting the underlying neuronal RF organization of single cells.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Visual illusions occur when sensory inputs and perceptual outcomes do not match, and provide a valuable tool to understand transformations from neural to perceptual responses. A classic example are negative afterimages that remain visible after a stimulus is removed from view. Such perceptions are linked to responses in early visual neurons, yet the details remain poorly understood. Combining human psychophysics, neurophysiological recordings in cats and retino-thalamo-cortical computational modeling, our study reveals how stimulus size and the receptive-field structure of subcortical ON and OFF cells contributes to the parallel asymmetries between neural and perceptual responses to bright versus dark afterimages. Thus, this work provides a deeper link from the underlying neural mechanisms to the resultant perceptual outcomes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Effect of Serotonin Receptor 5-HT1B on Lateral Inhibition between Spiny Projection Neurons in the Mouse Striatum</a></h4>

              
                <p>The principal neurons of the striatum, the spiny projection neurons (SPNs), make inhibitory synaptic connections with each other via collaterals of their main axon, forming a local lateral inhibition network. Serotonin, acting via the 5-HT1B receptor, modulates neurotransmitter release from SPN terminals in striatal output nuclei, but the role of 5-HT1B receptors in lateral inhibition among SPNs in the striatum is unknown. Here, we report the effects of 5-HT1B receptor activation on lateral inhibition in the mouse striatum. Whole-cell recordings were made from SPNs in acute brain slices of either sex, while optogenetically activating presynaptic SPNs or fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs). Activation of 5-HT1B receptors significantly reduced the amplitude of IPSCs evoked by optical stimulation of both direct and indirect pathway SPNs. This reduction was blocked by application of a 5-HT1B receptor antagonist. Activation of 5-HT1B receptors did not reduce the amplitude of IPSCs evoked from FSIs. These results suggest a new role for serotonin as a modulator of lateral inhibition among striatal SPNs. The 5-HT1B receptor may, therefore, be a suitable target for future behavioral experiments investigating the currently unknown role of lateral inhibition in the function of the striatum.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We show that stimulation of serotonin receptors reduces the efficacy of lateral inhibition between spiny projection neurons (SPNs), one of the biggest GABAergic sources in the striatum, by activation of the serotonin 5-HT1B receptor. The striatum receives serotonergic input from the dorsal raphe nuclei and is important in behavioral brain functions like learning and action selection. Our findings suggest a new role for serotonin in modulating the dynamics of neural interactions in the striatum, which extends current knowledge of the mechanisms of the behavioral effects of serotonin.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neuronal Switching between Single- and Dual-Network Activity via Modulation of Intrinsic Membrane Properties</a></h4>

              
                <p>Oscillatory networks underlie rhythmic behaviors (e.g., walking, chewing) and complex behaviors (e.g., memory formation, decision-making). Flexibility of oscillatory networks includes neurons switching between single- and dual-network participation, even generating oscillations at two distinct frequencies. Modulation of synaptic strength can underlie this neuronal switching. Here we ask whether switching into dual-frequency oscillations can also result from modulation of intrinsic neuronal properties. The isolated stomatogastric nervous system of male <I>Cancer borealis</I> crabs contains two well-characterized rhythmic feeding-related networks (pyloric, ~1 Hz; gastric mill, ~0.1 Hz). The identified modulatory projection neuron MCN5 causes the pyloric-only lateral posterior gastric (LPG) neuron to switch to dual pyloric/gastric mill bursting. Bath applying the MCN5 neuropeptide transmitter Gly<sup>1</sup>-SIFamide only partly mimics the LPG switch to dual activity because of continued LP neuron inhibition of LPG. Here, we find that MCN5 uses a cotransmitter, glutamate, to inhibit LP, unlike Gly<sup>1</sup>-SIFamide excitation of LP. Thus, we modeled the MCN5-elicited LPG switching with Gly<sup>1</sup>-SIFamide application and LP photoinactivation. Using hyperpolarization of pyloric pacemaker neurons and gastric mill network neurons, we found that LPG pyloric-timed oscillations require rhythmic electrical synaptic input. However, LPG gastric mill-timed oscillations do not require any pyloric/gastric mill synaptic input and are voltage-dependent. Thus, we identify modulation of intrinsic properties as an additional mechanism for switching a neuron into dual-frequency activity. Instead of synaptic modulation switching a neuron into a second network as a passive follower, modulation of intrinsic properties could enable a switching neuron to become an active contributor to rhythm generation in the second network.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neuromodulation of oscillatory networks can enable network neurons to switch from single- to dual-network participation, even when two networks oscillate at distinct frequencies. We used small, well-characterized networks to determine whether modulation of synaptic strength, an identified mechanism for switching, is necessary for dual-network recruitment. We demonstrate that rhythmic electrical synaptic input is required for continued linkage with a "home" network, whereas modulation of intrinsic properties enables a neuron to generate oscillations at a second frequency. Neuromodulator-induced switches in neuronal participation between networks occur in motor, cognitive, and sensory networks. Our study highlights the importance of considering intrinsic properties as a pivotal target for enabling parallel participation of a neuron in two oscillatory networks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dissociating the Neural Correlates of Consciousness and Task Relevance in Face Perception Using Simultaneous EEG-fMRI</a></h4>

              
                <p>Current theories of visual consciousness disagree about whether it emerges during early stages of processing in sensory brain regions or later when a widespread frontoparietal network becomes involved. Moreover, disentangling conscious perception from task-related postperceptual processes (e.g., report) and integrating results across different neuroscientific methods remain ongoing challenges. The present study addressed these problems using simultaneous EEG-fMRI and a specific inattentional blindness paradigm with three physically identical phases in female and male human participants. In phase 1, participants performed a distractor task during which line drawings of faces and control stimuli were presented centrally. While some participants spontaneously noticed the faces in phase 1, others remained inattentionally blind. In phase 2, all participants were made aware of the task-irrelevant faces but continued the distractor task. In phase 3, the faces became task-relevant. Bayesian analysis of brain responses demonstrated that conscious face perception was most strongly associated with activation in fusiform gyrus (fMRI) as well as the N170 and visual awareness negativity (EEG). Smaller awareness effects were revealed in the occipital and prefrontal cortex (fMRI). Task-relevant face processing, on the other hand, led to strong, extensive activation of occipitotemporal, frontoparietal, and attentional networks (fMRI). In EEG, it enhanced early negativities and elicited a pronounced P3b component. Overall, we provide evidence that conscious visual perception is linked with early processing in stimulus-specific sensory brain areas but may additionally involve prefrontal cortex. In contrast, the strong activation of widespread brain networks and the P3b are more likely associated with task-related processes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How does our brain generate visual consciousness&mdash;the subjective experience of what it is like to see, for example, a face? To date, it is hotly debated whether it emerges early in sensory brain regions or later when a widespread frontoparietal network is activated. Here, we use simultaneous fMRI and EEG for high spatial and temporal resolution and demonstrate that conscious face perception is predominantly linked to early and occipitotemporal processes, but also prefrontal activity. Task-related processes (e.g., decision-making), on the other hand, elicit brain-wide activations including late and strong frontoparietal activity. These findings challenge numerous previous studies and highlight the importance of investigating the neural correlates of consciousness in the absence of task relevance.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Linear Integration of Sensory Evidence over Space and Time Underlies Face Categorization</a></h4>

              
                <p>Visual object recognition relies on elaborate sensory processes that transform retinal inputs to object representations, but it also requires decision-making processes that read out object representations and function over prolonged time scales. The computational properties of these decision-making processes remain underexplored for object recognition. Here, we study these computations by developing a stochastic multifeature face categorization task. Using quantitative models and tight control of spatiotemporal visual information, we demonstrate that human subjects (five males, eight females) categorize faces through an integration process that first linearly adds the evidence conferred by task-relevant features over space to create aggregated momentary evidence and then linearly integrates it over time with minimum information loss. Discrimination of stimuli along different category boundaries (e.g., identity or expression of a face) is implemented by adjusting feature weights of spatial integration. This linear but flexible integration process over space and time bridges past studies on simple perceptual decisions to complex object recognition behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Although simple perceptual decision-making such as discrimination of random dot motion has been successfully explained as accumulation of sensory evidence, we lack rigorous experimental paradigms to study the mechanisms underlying complex perceptual decision-making such as discrimination of naturalistic faces. We develop a stochastic multifeature face categorization task as a systematic approach to quantify the properties and potential limitations of the decision-making processes during object recognition. We show that human face categorization could be modeled as a linear integration of sensory evidence over space and time. Our framework to study object recognition as a spatiotemporal integration process is broadly applicable to other object categories and bridges past studies of object recognition and perceptual decision-making.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Reactivation of Single-Episode Pain Patterns in the Hippocampus and Decision Making</a></h4>

              
                <p>Aversive and rewarding experiences can exert a strong influence on subsequent behavior. While decisions are often supported by the value of single past episodes, most research has focused on the role of well-learned value associations. Recent studies have begun to investigate the influence of reward-associated episodes, but it is unclear whether these results generalize to negative experiences, such as pain. To investigate whether and how the value of previous aversive experiences modulates behavior and brain activity, in our experiments female and male human participants experienced episodes of high or low pain in conjunction with incidental, trial-unique neutral pictures. In an incentive-compatible surprise test phase, we found that participants avoided pain-paired objects. In a separate fMRI experiment, at test, participants exhibited significant pain value memory. Neurally, when participants were re-exposed to pain-paired objects, we found no evidence for reactivation of pain-related patterns in pain-responsive regions, such as the anterior insula. Critically, however, we found significant reactivation of pain-related patterns of activity in the hippocampus, such that activity significantly discriminated high versus low pain episodes. Further, stronger reactivation in the anterior hippocampus was related to improved pain value memory performance. Our results demonstrate that single incidental aversive experiences can build memories that affect decision-making and that this influence may be supported by the hippocampus.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Aversive and rewarding experiences can exert a strong influence on our subsequent behavior. While decisions are often supported by single past negative or positive episodes, most research has focused on the role of well-learned value associations. In experiments using aversive heat pain in conjunction with incidental objects, we found that participants' choices were biased by the level of pain associated with the objects. Further, when participants saw the objects again, pain-related neural patterns in the hippocampus were re-expressed, and this was related to pain value memory performance. These results suggest a mechanism by which even single negative experiences can guide our later decisions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neural Evidence for Representational Persistence Within Events</a></h4>

              
                <p>How does the brain process continuous experiences so they can be remembered? Evidence suggests that people perceive their experience as a series of distinct and meaningful events. Information encountered within the same event shows greater temporal integration into memory as well as enhanced neural representational similarity. Although these data support the theory that the brain builds and maintains a mental model of the current event that represents recently encountered stimulus information, this hypothesis has not been directly tested. We used fMRI in humans (<I>N</I> = 21, 13 female) to test whether within-event neural similarity indicates the persistence of stimulus representations in a mental model. Participants viewed trial-unique visual images that were grouped into events. We calculated neural pattern similarity across time in the category-selective visual cortex to measure stimulus persistence. Pattern similarity was enhanced within, compared with between, events in the object-sensitive left lateral occipital (LO) cortex. This was specific to situations when objects could persist within a mental model, suggesting modulation of neural activity based on the features and structure of the event. Left LO object persistence was correlated with activity in a medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) region linked to representing mental models within events. mFPC activity also correlated with pattern similarity in the hippocampus but more generally across stimulus categories. Critically, left LO similarity was related to estimates of temporal proximity in memory. The data suggest that temporal neural stability reflects stimulus persistence in mental models and highlight the importance of within-event representational stability in the transformation of experience to memory.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How does the brain process continuous experiences so they can be remembered? One idea is that information persists in mental models during stable events, facilitating the organization of events in memory. Using fMRI pattern similarity analysis, we found enhanced similarity within, compared with between, events in the object-sensitive LO but only when objects could persist within a mental model. mPFC activity correlated with left LO similarity when objects persisted within an event; in contrast, mPFC activity correlated with hippocampal similarity across stimulus categories. Left LO persistence was also related to the remembered temporal proximity of stimuli. The data suggest the brain dynamically maintains stimulus information in mental models during events, supporting the transformation of experience into memory.</p>

                Background: Several studies have investigated whether personalising trial documentation can aid recruitment and retention. We did a ‘study within a trial’ (SWAT) evaluating the effectiveness of a personalised text message compared to a non-personalised text message, on the retention rate in a large orthopaedic trial. Methods: The SWAT was embedded in the Knee Replacement Bandaging Study (KReBS) trial. The primary outcome was the proportion of 12-month questionnaires returned. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of questionnaires completed and time to questionnaire return. Binary data were analysed using logistic regression and time to return using Cox proportional hazards regression.  Odds ratios (OR) and hazard ratios (HR) are presented, with associated 95% confidence intervals (CI) and p-values. Results: In total, 1465 participants were included in the SWAT. In the personalised group, 644/723 (89.1%) of participants returned a questionnaire, compared to 654/742 (88.1%) in the non-personalised group. The absolute difference in return rate was 0.9% (95% CI: -2.3% to 4.2%; p=0.57). There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in the likelihood of returning a questionnaire (OR 1.09; 95% CI: 0.79 to 1.51; p=0.61), the likelihood of returning a complete questionnaire (OR 1.11; 95% CI: 0.82 to 1.51; p=0.50) nor in time to return (HR 1.05; 95% CI: 0.94 to 1.17; p=0.40). Conclusion: This SWAT adds to the growing evidence base for whether personalised text messages are effective. Registration: ISRCTN87127065 (20/02/2017); SWAT 35 (01/12/2015)

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Reconstructing contact network structure and cross-immunity patterns from multiple infection histories</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christian Selinger, Samuel Alizon</p>

Interactions within a population shape the spread of infectious diseases but contact patterns between individuals are difficult to access. We hypothesised that key properties of these patterns can be inferred from multiple infection data in longitudinal follow-ups. We developed a simulator for epidemics with multiple infections on networks and analysed the resulting individual infection time series by introducing similarity metrics between hosts based on their multiple infection histories. We find that, depending on infection multiplicity and network sampling, multiple infection summary statistics can recover network properties such as degree distribution. Furthermore, we show that by mining simulation outputs for multiple infection patterns, one can detect immunological interference between pathogens (i.e. the fact that past infections in a host condition future probability of infection). The combination of individual-based simulations and analysis of multiple infection histories opens promising perspectives to infer and validate transmission networks and immunological interference for infectious diseases from longitudinal cohort data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Slow manifolds within network dynamics encode working memory efficiently and robustly</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Elham Ghazizadeh, ShiNung Ching</p>

Working memory is a cognitive function involving the storage and manipulation of latent information over brief intervals of time, thus making it crucial for context-dependent computation. Here, we use a top-down modeling approach to examine network-level mechanisms of working memory, an enigmatic issue and central topic of study in neuroscience. We optimize thousands of recurrent rate-based neural networks on a working memory task and then perform dynamical systems analysis on the ensuing optimized networks, wherein we find that four distinct dynamical mechanisms can emerge. In particular, we show the prevalence of a mechanism in which memories are encoded along slow stable manifolds in the network state space, leading to a phasic neuronal activation profile during memory periods. In contrast to mechanisms in which memories are directly encoded at stable attractors, these networks naturally forget stimuli over time. Despite this seeming functional disadvantage, they are more efficient in terms of how they leverage their attractor landscape and paradoxically, are considerably more robust to noise. Our results provide new hypotheses regarding how working memory function may be encoded within the dynamics of neural circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Latching dynamics as a basis for short-term recall</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kwang Il Ryom, Vezha Boboeva, Oleksandra Soldatkina, Alessandro Treves</p>

We discuss simple models for the transient storage in short-term memory of cortical patterns of activity, all based on the notion that their recall exploits the natural tendency of the cortex to hop from state to state—latching dynamics. We show that in one such model, and in simple spatial memory tasks we have given to human subjects, short-term memory can be limited to similar low capacity by interference effects, in tasks terminated by errors, and can exhibit similar sublinear scaling, when errors are overlooked. The same mechanism can drive serial recall if combined with weak order-encoding plasticity. Finally, even when storing randomly correlated patterns of activity the network demonstrates correlation-driven latching waves, which are reflected at the outer extremes of pattern space.

                <p>by Grant Kauwe, Tara E. Tracy</p>

Accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) in the brain in Alzheimer disease drives pathophysiology. A study in this issue of PLOS Biology revealed that Aβ from the liver can promote brain pathology, supporting that peripheral Aβ can contribute to neurodegeneration.
