	<p>Neural entrainment to musical rhythm is thought to underlie the perception and production of music. In aging populations, the strength of neural entrainment to rhythm has been found to be attenuated, particularly during attentive listening to auditory streams. However, previous studies on neural entrainment to rhythm and aging have often employed artificial auditory rhythms or limited pieces of recorded, naturalistic music, failing to account for the diversity of rhythmic structures found in natural music. As part of larger project assessing a novel music-based intervention for healthy aging, we investigated neural entrainment to musical rhythms in the electroencephalogram (EEG) while participants listened to self-selected musical recordings across a sample of younger and older adults. We specifically measured neural entrainment to the level of musical pulse&amp;amp;mdash;quantified here as the phase-locking value (PLV)&amp;amp;mdash;after normalizing the PLVs to each musical recording&amp;amp;rsquo;s detected pulse frequency. As predicted, we observed strong neural phase-locking to musical pulse, and to the sub-harmonic and harmonic levels of musical meter. Overall, PLVs were not significantly different between older and younger adults. This preserved neural entrainment to musical pulse and rhythm could support the design of music-based interventions that aim to modulate endogenous brain activity via self-selected music for healthy cognitive aging.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mental health status of women in reproductive age group and its determinants in rural Odisha, India using GHQ 12 questionnaire [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The study was conceived with support from the Department of Health Research (DHR), India to use the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12), to screen women in the reproductive age group, stratified for pregnant, lactating, and nonpregnant and non-lactate women (NPNL), for their mental health status and examine it with their social background to understand the influences around their mental health.   Methods: By multistage sampling, subcenters were selected from 6 districts; women in the 3 groups were selected proportionately in each district, and data was collected on the basis of a pre-tested, pre-designed questionnaire along with the GHQ-12.   Results: Results showed GHQ-12 scores across the 3 categories of women are nearly the same with no significant difference (p=0.91). The higher GHQ (scores >11 to 36) were also noted to be equal for pregnant and lactating women i.e. 41.4% and mildly less for NPNL women 40.7%, reaffirming that pregnancy and the postnatal period add more stress to the woman’s life. Age of the women, age at marriage, hemoglobin levels, and poor Iron Folic Acid (IFA) intake were common predictors for poor mental health in all the 3 strata.  Conclusions: The study suggests that psychological stressors are cross-sectionally present in all three groups of women in the reproductive age group and all three strata need equal focus. Above 40% distress in mental health in women in all strata of the reproductive age group (ie pregnant women, post-natal women, and women not pregnant or lactating) is appalling, contrary to the general opinion that post-natal women alone face mental health compromise. Hence, the life cycle approach is recommended for best results.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The odd log-logistic generalized exponential distribution: Application on survival times of chemotherapy patients data [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The creation of developing new generalized classes of distributions has attracted applied and theoretical statisticians owing to their properties of flexibility. The development of generalized distribution aims to find distribution flexibility and suitability for available data. In this decade, most authors have developed classes of distributions that are new, to become valuable for applied researchers. Methods: This study aims to develop the odd log-logistic generalized exponential distribution (OLLGED), one of the lifetime newly generated distributions in the field of statistics. The advantage of the newly generated distribution is the heavily tailed distributed lifetime data set. Most of the probabilistic properties are derived including generating functions, moments, and quantile and order statistics. Results: Estimation of the model parameter is done by the maximum likelihood method. The performance of parametric estimation is studied through simulation. Application of OLLGED and its flexibilities is done using two data sets and while its performance is done on the randomly simulated data set. Conclusions: The application and flexibility of the OLLGED are ensured through empirical observation using two sets of lifetime data, establishing that the proposed OLLGED can provide a better fit in comparison to existing rival models, such as odd generalized log-logistic, type-II generalized log-logistic, exponential distributions, odd exponential log-logistic, generalized exponential, and log-logistic.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Oral manifestations associated with Novel Coronavirus Disease - 2019 (COVID-19): A questionnaire based hypothetical study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Since the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in 2019, the virus has evolved drastically, presenting with sets of mutations that influence its properties, including transmissibility and antigenicity. The oral mucosa is postulated as probable portal entry and several oral manifestations have been identified, which places dental professionals in a position to recognize probable COVID-19 patients depending on oral signs and symptoms in the initial phases of the disease itself. As co-existing with COVID-19 seems to be a new reality, greater understanding is required regarding early oral signs and symptoms which can be predictors for timely intervention and prevention of complications in COVID-19 patients. The objective of the study is to identify the distinguishing oral signs and symptoms among COVID-19 patients and to establish possible correlation between severity of COVID-19 infection and oral symptoms. Methods: This study recruited 179 ambulatory, non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s Eastern Province's designated hotels for COVID-19 and home isolated patients from the same region using a convenience sample method. Data was collected by qualified and experienced investigators, including two physicians and three dentists, using a validated comprehensive questionnaire through telephonic interviews with the participants. The X2 was used to assess the categorical variables, and odd's ratio was calculated to determine the strength of the association between general symptoms and oral manifestations. Results: Oral and nasopharyngeal lesions or conditions like loss of smell and taste, xerostomia, sore throat, and burning sensation were predictors of COVID-19-related systemic symptoms such as cough, fatigue, fever, and nasal congestion were identified to be statistically significant (p<0.05). Conclusions: The study reveals the occurrence of olfactory or taste dysfunction, dry mouth, sore throat, and burning sensation along with COVID-19 generic symptoms, should be considered as suggestive yet not conclusive indicators of COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A rapid review of the prevalence and onset of urticaria triggered by COVID-19 vaccine [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine is essential to reduce the spread of this disease virus and is very effective at preventing patients with severe symptoms of the disease from dying. As of February 2022, more than 10 billion doses of the COVID-19 vaccine have been administered worldwide, and at least 60% of the world's population have received the first dose of the vaccine. The increasing number of populations receiving the COVID-19 vaccine has increased reports of post-immunization follow-up events, one of which is urticaria. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and onset of urticaria due to the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine. Methods: This study used a rapid review method based on previous research on the prevalence and onset of urticaria due to the COVID-19 vaccine. The articles were obtained from the PubMed and Google Scholar databases. The inclusion criteria were articles containing data on the prevalence and onset of urticaria due to the COVID-19 vaccine, published from December 2020 – January 2022. Results: From the search results and article selection, 20 articles were included in this study. There are 7 articles containing prevalence data, 11 articles containing onset data, and 2 articles containing prevalence and onset data. Research in these articles was conducted in several different countries. There were seven types of vaccine used with doses of 1 or 2. The sample age ranged from 16 to 76 years. In all of the articles, the sample and the incidence of urticaria were mostly female. There were a history of allergies and atopic history in the sample studied. Conclusion: The prevalence rate of urticaria in the population given the COVID-19 vaccine ranged from 0.035% to 3.2%. The time of onset of urticaria in the population given the COVID-19 vaccine ranged from 5 minutes to 10 days.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Analysis of Albania's diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union during the years 1948-1959 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This paper aims to shed light on a very intense period of relations between Albania and the Soviet Union (USSR), focusing on the period from 1948 with the intensification of Albania's relations with the USSR until the termination of diplomatic relations in 1959. The main objective of this paper is to know the truth of the relations of the USSR and its behavior with Albania. Methods: The paper focuses on analyzing this period as a case study, selecting three levels (context-actors-outcomes). Evaluation of the period (1948-1959) is done through the identification of key indicators and the implications of the relationship in domestic and international contexts. The sources used include documents, interviews, films, newspapers, and books. We requested permission to use the Archival resources of the Albanian Central State Archives (AQSH), where they made some accessible non-state secret resources workable only within the archive available to us. Results: The facts show that the relations between Albania and the USSR benefitted Albania more. particularly with a lot of economic support from the USSR, which helped Albania emerge from crisis and build the so-called ‘socialist state’. Through these relations and contributions, Albania took its place in the international arena. We find that this may be because of the geographical position of Albania, as the construction of the Pashaliman naval base and the bay of Vlora indicates. Conclusions: This study tries to demystify this relationship that has had a lot of ambiguity cast over it. Documents of the AQSH do not provide an unbiased overview, as they were compiled with an ideologically charged spirit, making it difficult for researchers to reach conclusions without ideological input from both sides. We hope that we will have the opportunity to access restricted documents to provide a clearer picture of the relations between Albania and the USSR.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Community review: a robust and scalable selection system for resource allocation within open science and innovation communities [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Resource allocation is essential to selection and implementation of innovative projects in science and technology. Current “winner-take-all” models for grant applications require significant researcher time in writing extensive project proposals, and rely on the availability of a few time-saturated volunteer experts. Such processes usually carry over several months, resulting in high effective costs compared to expected benefits. We devised an agile “community review” system to allocate micro-grants for the fast prototyping of innovative solutions. Here we describe and evaluate the implementation of this community review across 147 projects from the “Just One Giant Lab’s OpenCOVID19 initiative” and “Helpful Engineering” open research communities. The community review process uses granular review forms and requires the participation of grant applicants in the review process. Within a year, we organised 7 rounds of review, resulting in 614 reviews from 201 reviewers, and the attribution of 48 micro-grants of up to 4,000 euros. The system is fast, with a median process duration of 10 days, scalable, with a median of 4 reviewers per project independent of the total number of projects, and fair, with project rankings highly preserved after the synthetic removal of reviewers. Regarding potential bias introduced by involving applicants in the process, we find that review scores from both applicants and non-applicants have a similar correlation of r=0.28 with other reviews within a project, matching traditional approaches. Finally, we find that the ability of projects to apply to several rounds allows to foster the further implementation of successful early prototypes, as well as provide a pathway to constructively improve an initially failing proposal in an agile manner. Overall, this study quantitatively highlights the benefits of a frugal, community review system acting as a due diligence for rapid and agile resource allocation in open research and innovation programs, with implications for decentralised communities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: The first reported case of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis with myasthenia gravis in a 27-year-old patient [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is a very rare diffuse lung disease characterized by the accumulation of amorphous and periodic acid Schiff-positive lipoproteinaceous material in the alveolar spaces due to impaired surfactant clearance by alveolar macrophages. Three main types were identified: Autoimmune, secondary and congenital. Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis has been previously reported to be associated with several systemic auto-immune diseases. Accordingly, we present the first case report of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis associated with myasthenia gravis. Case: A 27-year-old female patient, ex-smoker, developed a dyspnea on exertion in 2020. The chest X-ray detected diffuse symmetric alveolar opacities. Pulmonary infection was ruled out, particularly COVID-19 infection. The chest scan revealed the “crazy paving” pattern. The bronchoalveolar lavage showed a rosy liquid with granular acellular eosinophilic material Periodic acid-Schiff positive. According to the lung biopsy results, she was diagnosed with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. The granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor autoantibodies were negative. Nine months later, she was diagnosed with bulbar seronegative myasthenia gravis, confirmed with the electroneuromyography with repetitive nerve stimulation showing significant amplitude decrement of the trapezius and spinal muscles. She was treated with pyridostigmine, oral corticosteroids and azathioprine. Given the worsening respiratory condition of the patient, a bilateral whole lung lavage was performed with a partial resolution of symptoms. Thus, this previously unreported association was treated successfully with rituximab, including improvement of dyspnea, diplopia and muscle fatigability at six months of follow-up. Conclusions: This case emphasizes on the possible association of auto-immune disease to PAP, which could worsen the disease course, as the specific treatment does not exist yet. Hence, further studies are needed to establish clear-cut guidelines for PAP management, particularly when associated to auto-immune diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modelling the spatial dynamics of oncolytic virotherapy in the presence of virus-resistant tumour cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Darshak Kartikey Bhatt, Thijs Janzen, Toos Daemen, Franz J. Weissing</p>

Oncolytic virotherapy is a promising form of cancer treatment that uses native or genetically engineered viruses to target, infect and kill cancer cells. Unfortunately, this form of therapy is not effective in a substantial proportion of cancer patients, partly due to the occurrence of infection-resistant tumour cells. To shed new light on the mechanisms underlying therapeutic failure and to discover strategies that improve therapeutic efficacy we designed a cell-based model of viral infection. The model allows us to investigate the dynamics of infection-sensitive and infection-resistant cells in tumour tissue in presence of the virus. To reflect the importance of the spatial configuration of the tumour on the efficacy of virotherapy, we compare three variants of the model: two 2D models of a monolayer of tumour cells and a 3D model. In all model variants, we systematically investigate how the therapeutic outcome is affected by the properties of the virus (e.g. the rate of viral spread), the tumour (e.g. production rate of resistant cells, cost of resistance), the healthy stromal cells (e.g. degree of resistance to the virus) and the timing of treatment. We find that various therapeutic outcomes are possible when resistant cancer cells arise at low frequency in the tumour. These outcomes depend in an intricate but predictable way on the death rate of infected cells, where faster death leads to rapid virus clearance and cancer persistence. Our simulations reveal three different causes of therapy failure: rapid clearance of the virus, rapid selection of resistant cancer cells, and a low rate of viral spread due to the presence of infection-resistant healthy cells. Our models suggest that improved therapeutic efficacy can be achieved by sensitizing healthy stromal cells to infection, although this remedy has to be weighed against the toxicity induced in the healthy tissue.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Coloring coral larvae allows tracking of local dispersal and settlement</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christopher Doropoulos, George Roff</p>

Quantifying patterns of dispersal and settlement in marine benthic invertebrates is challenging, largely due the complexity of life history traits, small sizes of larvae (<1 mm), and potential for large-scale dispersal (>100 km) in the marine environment. Here, we develop a novel method that allows for immediate differentiation and visual tracking of large numbers of coral larvae (10<sup>6</sup> to 10<sup>9</sup>) from dispersal to settlement. Neutral red and Nile blue stains were extremely effective in coloring larvae, with minimal impacts on survival and settlement following optimization of incubation times and stain concentrations. Field validation to wild-captured larvae from the Great Barrier Reef demonstrates the efficacy of staining across diverse taxa. The method provides a simple, rapid (<60 minutes), low-cost (approximately USD$1 per 10<sup>5</sup> larva) tool to color coral larvae that facilitates a wide range of de novo laboratory and field studies of larval behavior and ecology with potential applications for conservation planning and understanding patterns of connectivity.

                Primates can rapidly switch between different rules that govern the mapping from stimuli to actions. We uncovered a signature of the dynamic reconfiguration of task-specific networks for flexible sensory-motor decisions in the human brain: intrinsic correlations between the population codes for task-relevant stimuli and actions expressed in different brain regions.

While AKT1 is cytoplasmic, shifting to the plasma membrane upon stimulation, AKT2 is mainly nuclear. In cancer cells, AKT3 is constitutively active at the nuclear envelope, where it phosphorylates TSC2 and promotes proliferation.

                Rozenfeld et al. report that caffeine and the PDE2 blocker Bay-607550 stimulate mitochondrial Ca2+ removal in neurons. Inhibition of PDE2 stimulates PKA, which phosphorylates the regulatory domain of the mitochondrial exchanger NCLX, leading to its activation. Upregulation of NCLX prevents excitotoxic neuronal death and enhances new object learning in mice.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A unified framework for measuring selection on cellular lineages and traits</a></h4>

              
                Intracellular states probed by gene expression profiles and metabolic activities are intrinsically noisy, causing phenotypic variations among cellular lineages. Understanding the adaptive and evolutionary roles of such variations requires clarifying their linkage to population growth rates. Extending a cell lineage statistics framework, here we show that a population’s growth rate can be expanded by the cumulants of a fitness landscape that characterize how fitness distributes in a population. The expansion enables quantifying the contribution of each cumulant, such as variance and skewness, to population growth. We introduce a function that contains all the essential information of cell lineage statistics, including mean lineage fitness and selection strength. We reveal a relation between fitness heterogeneity and population growth rate response to perturbation. We apply the framework to experimental cell lineage data from bacteria to mammalian cells, revealing distinct levels of growth rate gain from fitness heterogeneity across environments and organisms. Furthermore, third or higher order cumulants’ contributions are negligible under constant growth conditions but could be significant in regrowing processes from growth-arrested conditions. We identify cellular populations in which selection leads to an increase of fitness variance among lineages in retrospective statistics compared to chronological statistics. The framework assumes no particular growth models or environmental conditions, and is thus applicable to various biological phenomena for which phenotypic heterogeneity and cellular proliferation are important.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The clinical pharmacology of tafenoquine in the radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria: An individual patient data meta-analysis</a></h4>

              
                Tafenoquine is a newly licensed antimalarial drug for the radical cure of <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> malaria. The mechanism of action and optimal dosing are uncertain. We pooled individual data from 1102 patients and 72 healthy volunteers studied in the pre-registration trials. We show that tafenoquine dose is the primary determinant of efficacy. Under an Emax model, we estimate the currently recommended 300 mg dose in a 60 kg adult (5 mg/kg) results in 70% of the maximal obtainable hypnozoiticidal effect. Increasing the dose to 7.5 mg/kg (i.e. 450 mg) would result in 90% reduction in the risk of <i>P. vivax</i> recurrence. After adjustment for dose, the tafenoquine terminal elimination half-life, and day 7 methaemoglobin concentration, but not the parent compound exposure, were also associated with recurrence. These results suggest that the production of oxidative metabolites is central to tafenoquine’s hypnozoiticidal efficacy. Clinical trials of higher tafenoquine doses are needed to characterise their efficacy, safety and tolerability.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Desiccation resistance differences in Drosophila species can be largely explained by variations in cuticular hydrocarbons</a></h4>

              
                Maintaining water balance is a universal challenge for organisms living in terrestrial environments, especially for insects, which have essential roles in our ecosystem. Although the high surface area to volume ratio in insects makes them vulnerable to water loss, insects have evolved different levels of desiccation resistance to adapt to diverse environments. To withstand desiccation, insects use a lipid layer called cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) to reduce water evaporation from the body surface. It has long been hypothesized that the waterproofing capability of this CHC layer, which can confer different levels of desiccation resistance, depends on its chemical composition. However, it is unknown which CHC components are important contributors to desiccation resistance and how these components can determine differences in desiccation resistance. In this study, we used machine learning algorithms, correlation analyses, and synthetic CHCs to investigate how different CHC components affect desiccation resistance in 50 <i>Drosophila</i> and related species. We showed that desiccation resistance differences across these species can be largely explained by variation in CHC composition. In particular, length variation in a subset of CHCs, the methyl-branched CHCs (mbCHCs), is a key determinant of desiccation resistance. There is also a significant correlation between the evolution of longer mbCHCs and higher desiccation resistance in these species. Given that CHCs are almost ubiquitous in insects, we suggest that evolutionary changes in insect CHC components can be a general mechanism for the evolution of desiccation resistance and adaptation to diverse and changing environments.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Host-microbiome metabolism of a plant toxin in bees</a></h4>

              
                While foraging for nectar and pollen, bees are exposed to a myriad of xenobiotics, including plant metabolites, which may exert a wide range of effects on their health. Although the bee genome encodes enzymes that help in the metabolism of xenobiotics, it has lower detoxification gene diversity than the genomes of other insects. Therefore, bees may rely on other components that shape their physiology, such as the microbiota, to degrade potentially toxic molecules. In this study, we show that amygdalin, a cyanogenic glycoside found in honey bee-pollinated almond trees, can be metabolized by both bees and members of the gut microbiota. In microbiota-deprived bees, amygdalin is degraded into prunasin, leading to prunasin accumulation in the midgut and hindgut. In microbiota-colonized bees, on the other hand, amygdalin is degraded even further, and prunasin does not accumulate in the gut, suggesting that the microbiota contribute to the full degradation of amygdalin into hydrogen cyanide. <i>In vitro</i> experiments demonstrated that amygdalin degradation by bee gut bacteria is strain-specific and not characteristic of a particular genus or species. We found strains of <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, <i>Bombilactobacillus</i> and <i>Gilliamella</i> that can degrade amygdalin. The degradation mechanism appears to vary since only some strains produce prunasin as an intermediate. Finally, we investigated the basis of degradation in <i>Bifidobacterium</i> wkB204, a strain that fully degrades amygdalin. We found overexpression and secretion of several carbohydrate-degrading enzymes, including one in glycoside hydrolase family 3 (GH3). We expressed this GH3 in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and detected prunasin as a byproduct when cell lysates were cultured with amygdalin, supporting its contribution to amygdalin degradation. These findings demonstrate that both host and microbiota can act together to metabolize dietary plant metabolites.

                Improving muscle function has great potential to improve the quality of life. To identify novel regulators of skeletal muscle metabolism and function, we performed a proteomic analysis of gastrocnemius muscle from 73 genetically distinct inbred mouse strains, and integrated the data with previously acquired genomics and &gt;300 molecular/phenotypic traits via quantitative trait loci mapping and correlation network analysis. These data identified thousands of associations between protein abundance and phenotypes and can be accessed online (https://muscle.coffeeprot.com/) to identify regulators of muscle function. We used this resource to prioritize targets for a functional genomic screen in human bioengineered skeletal muscle. This identified several negative regulators of muscle function including UFC1, an E2 ligase for protein UFMylation. We show UFMylation is up-regulated in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a disease that involves muscle atrophy. Furthermore, in vivo knockdown of UFMylation increased contraction force, implicating its role as a negative regulator of skeletal muscle function.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Clarifying the role of an unavailable distractor in human multiattribute choice</a></h4>

              
                Decisions between two economic goods can be swayed by a third <i>unavailable</i> 'decoy' alternative, which does not compete for choice, notoriously violating the principles of rational choice theory. Although decoy effects typically depend on the decoy's position in a multiattribute choice space, recent studies using risky prospects (i.e., varying in reward and probability) reported a novel 'positive' decoy effect operating on a single 'value' dimension: the higher the 'expected value' of an unavailable (distractor) prospect was, the easier the discrimination between two available target prospects became, especially when their expected-value difference was small. Here we show that this unidimensional distractor effect affords alternative interpretations: it occurred because the distractor's expected value covaried positively with the subjective utility difference between the two targets. Looking beyond this covariation, we report a modest 'negative' distractor effect operating on subjective utility, as well as classic multiattribute decoy effects. A normatively meaningful model (selective integration), in which subjective utilities are shaped by 'intra-attribute' information distortion, reproduces the multiattribute decoy effects, and as an epiphenomenon, the negative unidimensional distractor effect. These findings clarify the modulatory role of an unavailable distracting option, shedding fresh light on the mechanisms that govern multiattribute decisions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">How enzymatic activity is involved in chromatin organization</a></h4>

              
                Spatial organization of chromatin plays a critical role in genome regulation. Previously, various types of affnity mediators and enzymes have been attributed to regulate spatial organization of chromatin from a thermodynamics perspective. However, at the mechanistic level, enzymes act in their unique ways and perturb the chromatin. Here, we construct a polymer physics model following the mechanistic scheme of Topoisomerase-II, an enzyme resolving topological constraints of chromatin, and investigate how it affects interphase chromatin organization. Our computer simulations demonstrate Topoisomerase-II's ability to phase separate chromatin into eu- and heterochromatic regions with a characteristic wall-like organization of the euchromatic regions. We realized that the ability of the euchromatic regions to cross each other due to enzymatic activity of Topoisomerase-II induces this phase separation. This realization is based on the physical fact that partial absence of self-avoiding interaction can induce phase separation of a system into its self-avoiding and non-self-avoiding parts, which we reveal using a mean-field argument. Furthermore, motivated from recent experimental observations, we extend our model to a bidisperse setting and show that the characteristic features of the enzymatic activity driven phase separation survive there. The existence of these robust characteristic features, even under the non-localized action of the enzyme, highlights the critical role of enzymatic activity in chromatin organization.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Design of novel cyanovirin-N variants by modulation of binding dynamics through distal mutations</a></h4>

              
                We develop integrated co-evolution and dynamic coupling (ICDC) approach to identify, mutate, and assess distal sites to modulate function. We validate the approach first by analyzing the existing mutational fitness data of TEM-1 β-lactamase and show that allosteric positions co-evolved and dynamically coupled with the active site significantly modulate function. We further apply ICDC approach to identify positions and their mutations that can modulate binding affinity in a lectin, cyanovirin-N (CV-N), that selectively binds to dimannose, and predict binding energies of its variants through Adaptive BP-Dock. Computational and experimental analyses reveal that binding enhancing mutants identified by ICDC impact the dynamics of the binding pocket, and show that rigidification of the binding residues compensates for the entropic cost of binding. This work suggests a mechanism by which distal mutations modulate function through dynamic allostery and provides a blueprint to identify candidates for mutagenesis in order to optimize protein function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Role of interneuron subtypes in controlling trial-by-trial output variability in theneocortex</a></h4>

              
                Trial-by-trial variability is a ubiquitous property of neuronal activity in vivo and affects the stimulus response. Computational models have revealed how local network structure and feedforward inputs control the trial-by-trial variability. However, the role of input statistics and different interneuron subtypes in shaping the trial-by-trial variability was less understood. Here we investigated the dynamics of stimulus response in a model of cortical microcircuit with one excitatory and three inhibitory interneuron populations (PV, SST, VIP). We show that the variance ratio of inputs to different neuron populations and input covariances are the main determinants of output trial-by-trial variability. The effect of input covariances is contingent on the input variance ratios. In general, the network shows smaller output trial-by-trial variability in a PV-dominated regime than in an SST-dominated regime. Our work reveals mechanisms by which output trial-by-trial variability can be controlled in a context, state, and task-dependent manner.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Epileptiform activity influences theta-burst induced LTP in the adult hippocampus: a role for lipid raft dynamics in early metaplasticity.</a></h4>

              
                Non-epileptic seizures are identified as a common epileptogenic trigger. Early metaplasticity following seizures may contribute to epileptogenesis by abnormally altering synaptic strength and homeostatic plasticity. We now studied how in vitro epileptiform activity triggers early changes in CA1 long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by theta-burst stimulation (TBS) in rat hippocampal slices and the involvement of lipid rafts in these early metaplasticity events. Two forms of epileptiform activity (EA) were induced: 1) interictal-like EA triggered by withdrawal of Mg2+ and K+ elevation to 6mM in the superfusion medium or 2) ictal-like EA induced by bicuculine (10 M) delivery. LTP induced 30 min post EA was impaired, an effect more pronounced after ictal-like EA. LTP recovered to control levels 60 min post interictal-like EA but was still impaired 60 min after ictal-like EA. The synaptic molecular events underlying this altered LTP were investigated 30 min post EA. Synaptosomes isolated from parallel slices showed enhanced AMPA GluA1 Ser831 phosphorylation but decreased Ser 845 phosphorylation and a marked decrease in GluA1/GluA2 ratio. A marked decrease in flotillin-1 and caveolin-1 levels concomitantly with a moderate increase in PSD-95 and marked increase in gephyrin levels. Altogether, EA differentially influences hippocampal CA1 LTP thorough regulation of GluA1/GluA2 levels and AMPA GluA1 phosphorylation suggesting altered LTP post-seizures may be a relevant target of antiepileptogenic therapies. In addition, this metaplasticity is also associated with marked alterations in classic and synaptic lipid raft markers, suggesting these may also constitute promising targets in epileptogenesis prevention.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">EEG correlates of olfactory processing during an instructed-delay task</a></h4>

              
                EEG correlates of olfaction are of fundamental and practical interest for many reasons. In the field of neural technologies, olfactory-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) represent an approach that could be useful for neurorehabilitation of anosmia, dysosmia and hyposmia. While the idea of a BCI that decodes neural responses to different odors and/or enables odor-based neurofeedback is appealing, the results of previous EEG investigations into the olfactory domain are rather inconsistent, particularly when non-primary processing of olfactory signals is concerned. Here we report the results from an EEG study where an olfaction-based instructed-delay task was implemented. We utilized an olfactory display and a sensor of respiration to present odors in a strictly controlled fashion. Spatio-spectral EEG properties were analyzed to assess the olfactory-related components. Under these experimental conditions, EEG components representing processing of olfactory information were found around channel C4, where changes were detected for the 12-Hz spectral component. Additionally, significant differences in EEG patterns were observed when responses to odors were compared to the responses to odorless stimuli. We conclude EEG recordings are suitable for detecting active processing of odors. As such they could be integrated in a BCI that strives to rehabilitate olfactory disabilities or uses odors for hedonistic purposes.

                Tissue clearing renders entire organs transparent to enable combination with light sheet fluorescence microscopy and accelerate whole tissue imaging. Yet, challenges remain in analyzing the large resulting 3D datasets that consist of terabytes of images and information on millions of labeled cells. Previous work has established pipelines for automated analysis of tissue cleared mouse brains. However, they have focused on single color channels and/or detection of nuclear localized signals, in relatively low-resolution images. To address this gap, we present an automated workflow to map labeled neurons and astrocytes in the genetically distinct Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers (MADM) mouse forebrains. We named the workflow COMBINe (Cell detectiOn in Mouse BraIN) as it combines modules from multiple pipelines. With RetinaNet in its core, we quantitatively analyzed the regional and subregional effects of MADM-based deletion of the Epidermal growth factor receptor on neuronal and astrocyte populations in the mouse forebrain.

                Gene expression intersects with neural activity to produce cortical circuits during brain development. However, the cell biological mechanisms linking gene expression to activity-dependent cortical circuit assembly remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate in mice that a newly discovered function of the neurodevelopmental disorder gene, Syngap1, is to cell-autonomously control intrinsic membrane excitability (IME) in developing cortical glutamatergic neurons. Syngap1 regulation of IME was mechanistically linked to wiring of a cortical circuit motif required for sensory processing and behavioral action. Restoring depressed IME in Syngap1 deficient neurons through genetic targeting of hyper-functional potassium currents unleashed deficient dendritic morphogenesis in upper lamina sensory cortex pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, enhancing dendritic morphogenesis was sufficient to stimulate assembly of translaminar feed-forward excitatory circuit motifs. Thus, Syngap1 promotes excitatory circuit assembly during cortical development by maintaining IME in a range that enables trophic neuronal activity to maximize pyramidal cell somatodendritic maturation and subsequent synapse formation.

                Rodent premotor cortex (M2) integrates information from sensory and cognitive networks for action selection and planning during goal-directed decision making. M2 function is regulated by cortical inputs and ascending neuromodulators, including norepinephrine (NE) released from the locus coeruleus (LC). LC-NE has been shown to modulate the signal to noise ratio of neural representations in target regions prior to decision execution, to increase the salience of relevant stimuli. Using rats performing a two-alternative forced choice task after administration of an adrenergic antagonist (propranolol), we show that action planning in M2 is mediated by adrenergic signaling. Loss of adrenergic signaling results in failure to suppress irrelevant action plans in M2 that disrupts decoding of cue related information, delays decision times, and increases trial omissions, particularly in females. Furthermore, we identify a potential mechanism for the sex bias in behavioral and neural changes after propranolol administration via differential expression of receptors across sexes, particularly on local inhibitory neurons. Overall, we show a critical role for adrenergic signaling in M2 during decision making by suppressing irrelevant information to enable efficient action planning and decision execution.

                Little is known about how animals use tactile sensation to detect important objects and remember their location in a world-based coordinate system. Here, we hypothesized that retrosplenial cortex (RSC), a key network for contextual memory and spatial navigation, represents the location of objects based on tactile sensation. We studied mice that palpate objects with their whiskers while running on a treadmill in a tactile virtual reality in darkness. Using two-photon Ca2+ imaging, we discovered a population of neurons in agranular RSC that signal the location of tactile objects. Tactile object location responses do not simply reflect the sensory stimulus. Instead, they are highly task- and context-dependent and often predict the upcoming object before it is within reach. In addition, most tactile object location neurons also maintain a memory trace of the object's location. These data show that RSC encodes the location and arrangement of tactile objects in a spatial reference frame.

                The availability of high-calorie foods is likely a causative factor for high rates of obesity and metabolic disorders, which have been linked to food intake dysregulation. Several gut peptides have been implicated in feeding modulation and body mass accumulation. For example, glucagon peptide-like 1 (GLP-1) and peptide tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY) have been shown to mediate satiety and reduce food intake. While systemic administration of such peptides has been explored as a therapy for metabolic disease, the effects of these hormones on taste signaling should also be considered given the importance of taste to feeding decisions. Peptide signaling systems are present in taste buds and oral GLP-1 and PYY signaling has been shown to influence taste responsiveness and feeding. Indeed, we previously demonstrated that genetic knockout of PYY in mice can impact on taste responsiveness and feeding and that viral overexpression of PYY in the salivary glands of these mice can rescue responsiveness. The present work uses AAV-mediated salivary gland treatment of both GLP-1 receptor agonist exendin-4 and PYY encoding vectors to explore the impact of the presence of these peptides on taste and body-mass accumulation in wild-type mice with intact peptide signaling systems. Results showed a significant effect of salivary gland treatment on responsiveness to multiple taste qualities. Treatment with a vector designed to overexpress both peptides in saliva resulted in substantial reduction in body mass accumulation. These findings show taste modulation and impacts on body mass accumulation by the targeting of salivary glands with vectors designed to overexpress metabolic peptides in wild-type mice and suggest that the taste bud is a promising substrate for food intake modulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The utility and caveat of split-GAL4s in the study of neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, afflicting over 1% of the population of age 60 years and above. The loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons is the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) is the primary cause of its characteristic motor symptoms. Studies using Drosophila melanogaster and other model systems have provided much insight into the pathogenesis of PD. However, little is known why certain cell types are selectively susceptible to degeneration in PD. Here we describe an approach to identify vulnerable subpopulations of neurons in the genetic background linked to PD in Drosophila, using the split-GAL4 divers that enable genetic manipulation of a small number of defined cell population. We identify a subtype of DA neurons selectively vulnerable in the model of the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2)-linked familial PD, demonstrating the utility of this approach. We also show an unexpected caveat of the split-GAL4 system in aging-related research: the age-dependent increase in the number of GAL4-labeled cells.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Temporal clustering of sleep spindles for motor skill consolidation and generalizability following learning by physical practice, motor imagery and action observation</a></h4>

              
                Sleep benefits the consolidation of motor skills learned by physical practice, mainly through periodic thalamocortical sleep spindle activity. However, motor skills can be learned without overt movement, either through motor imagery or action observation. Here, we investigated whether sleep spindle activity also supports the consolidation of non-physically learned movements. Forty-five electroencephalographic sleep recordings were collected during a daytime nap after motor sequence learning by physical practice, motor imagery or action observation. Our findings revealed that irrespective of the modality of practice, spindles tend to cluster in trains on a low-frequency time scale of about 50 seconds, and during which spindles iterate every 3-4 seconds. However, despite this apparent modality-unspecific temporal organization of sleep spindles, different behavioral outcomes were elicited. We show that a daytime nap offers an early sleep window that promotes the retention of the learned motor skill following PP and MI practice, and its generalizability towards the transfer of skill from one effector to another after AO practice. Altogether, we demonstrated that the temporal cluster-based organization of sleep spindles may be a general mechanism for effective memory reprocessing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Systematic evaluation of anatomical details on transcranial electric stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation induced electric fields in a non-human primate model</a></h4>

              
                Non-human primates (NHPs) have become key for translational research in noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS). However, in order to create comparable stimulation conditions to humans it is vital to evaluate and match electric fields across species. Numerical models to simulate electric fields are an important tool for experimental planning in NHPs and translation to human studies. It is thus essential to evaluate how anatomical details in NHP models affect NIBS electric fields. Here, we create a highly accurate head model of a non-human primate (NHP) from 10.5 T MR data. We systematically evaluate how muscle tissue and head size (due to different MRI fields of view) affect simulation results in transcranial electric and magnetic stimulation (TES and TMS). Our findings indicate that the inclusion of muscle can affect TES electric field strength up to 29.5% while TMS is largely unaffected. Additionally, comparing a full head model to a cropped head model illustrates the impact of head size on electric fields for both TES and TMS. We find opposing effects between TES and TMS with an increase up to 13.5% for TES and a decrease up to 21.5% for TMS for the cropped head model compared to the full head model. Our results provide important insights into the level of anatomical detail needed for NHP head models and can inform future translational efforts for NIBS studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Astrocytic engagement of the corticostriatal synaptic cleft is disrupted in a mouse model of Huntington disease</a></h4>

              
                Astroglial dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease (HD), and glial replacement can ameliorate disease course. To establish the topographic relationship of diseased astrocytes to medium spiny neuron (MSN) synapses in HD, we used 2-photon imaging to map the relationship of tRFP-tagged striatal astrocytes and rabies-traced, EGFP-tagged coupled neuronal pairs, in R6/2 HD and wild-type (WT) mice. The tagged, prospectively-identified corticostriatal synapses were then studied by correlated light electron microscopy followed by serial block-face scanning EM, allowing nm scale assessment of synaptic structure in 3D. By this means, we compared the astrocytic engagement of single striatal synapses in HD and WT brains. R6/2 HD astrocytes exhibited constricted domains, with significantly less coverage of mature dendritic spines than WT astrocytes, despite enhanced engagement of immature, thin spines. These data suggest that disease-dependent changes in astroglial engagement and sequestration of MSN synapses enable the high synaptic and extrasynaptic levels of glutamate and K+ that underlie the striatal hyperexcitability of HD. As such, these data suggest that astrocytic structural pathology may causally contribute to the synaptic dysfunction and disease phenotype of those neurodegenerative disorders characterized by network overexcitation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fractions strategy differences in those born extremely preterm</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: For those with weak cognitive skills, certain mathematical problem-solving strategies may be more difficult than others. Tailored mathematical instruction that recognizes cognitive load and incorporates ways to reduce this may help to overcome mathematical difficulties. To investigate the effects of different strategies and cognitive load we explored brain hemodynamic responses associated with the use of different strategies to solve subtraction of fractions. We focused on those born extremely preterm (EPT; less than 28 weeks gestation) as they are known to have cognitive challenges and struggle with mathematics in particular. We also included a group of full-term (FT) peers for comparison. Methods: Functional MRI was acquired while the participants mentally solved fraction equations using either an improper fractions strategy, where whole numbers are converted to improper fractions before solving, or a mixed fractions strategy, where computations are carried out separately for the whole numbers and fraction components. Different fraction item types were given, which affected respective required cognitive loads per strategy. Diffusion and T1-weighted structural images were also acquired. All imaging modalities were compared between the two groups. Results: The EPT and FT groups differed in terms of task-related hemodynamic responses, regional volumes, and white matter connectivity. Functional group differences varied with strategy and item type. These differences were greatest when the mixed fractions strategy was prompted for an item type that required relatively greater cognitive load and involved borrowing. Other findings showed reduced white and grey matter volume and reduced white matter connectivity in widespread areas in the EPT group compared to the FT group. Conclusion: Changes in the brain related to preterm birth are complex. The understanding of function and structure presented here may help inform pedagogical practices by allowing for tailoring of mathematical education through identifying suitable strategy adoption that depends on problem type, to circumvent weaknesses in cognitive skills.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Genetic tagging uncovers a robust, selective activation of the thalamic paraventricular nucleus by adverse experiences early in life</a></h4>

              
                Background: Early-life adversity (ELA) is associated with increased risk for mood disorders including depression and substance use disorders. These are characterized by impaired reward-related behaviors, suggesting compromised operations of reward-related brain circuits. However, the brain regions engaged by ELA that mediate these enduring consequences of ELA remain largely unknown. In an animal model of ELA, we have identified aberrant reward-seeking behaviors, a discovery that provides a framework for assessing the underlying circuits. Methods: Employing TRAP2 male and female mice, in which neurons activated within a defined timeframe are permanently tagged, we compared ELA and control-reared mice, assessing the quantity and distribution of ELA-related neuronal activation. After validating the TRAP2 results using native cFos labeling, we defined the molecular identity of this population of activated neurons. Results: We uniquely demonstrate that the TRAP2 system is feasible and efficacious in neonatal mice. Surprisingly, the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) is robustly and almost exclusively activated by ELA and is the only region distinguishing ELA from typical rearing. Remarkably, a large proportion of ELA-activated PVT neurons express CRFR1, the receptor for the stress-related peptide, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), but these neurons do not express CRH itself. Conclusions: We show here that the PVT, an important component of reward circuits which is known to encode remote, emotionally salient experiences to influence future motivated behaviors, encodes adverse experiences as remote as those occurring during the early postnatal period and is thus poised to contribute to the enduring deficits in reward-related behaviors consequent to ELA.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Aβ-CT affective touch: Touch pleasantness ratings for gentle stroking and deep pressure exhibit dependence on A-fibers</a></h4>

              
                Gentle stroking of the skin is a common social touch behavior with positive affective consequences. A preference for slow versus fast stroking of hairy skin has been closely linked to the firing of unmyelinated C-tactile (CT) somatosensory afferents. Because the firing of CT afferents strongly correlates with touch pleasantness, the CT pathway has been considered a social-affective sensory pathway. Recently, ablation of the spinothalamic pathway- thought to convey all C-fiber sensations- in patients with cancer pain impaired pain, temperature, and itch, but not ratings of pleasant touch. This suggested integration of A and CT fiber input in the spinal cord, or A-fiber contributions to computations of touch pleasantness in the brain. However, the causal contribution of A-fibers to touch pleasantness- in humans without pain- remains unknown. In the current, single-blinded study we performed two types of peripheral nerve blocks in healthy adults to temporarily eliminate the contribution of A-fibers to touch perception. Our findings show that when A-fiber function is greatly diminished, the perceived intensity and pleasantness of both gentle stroking and deep pressure are nearly abolished. These findings demonstrate that explicit perception of the pleasantness of CT-targeted brushing and pressure both critically depend on A-fibers.

We observed both increased BOLD signal intensity and functional connectivity that followed a layer-dependent pattern predicted from anatomical connections between SC and other brain structures important for visual processing, motor control, and executive function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The role of a population of descending neurons in the optomotor response in flying Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                To maintain stable flight, animals continuously perform trimming adjustments to compensate for internal and external perturbations. Whereas animals use many different sensory modalities to detect such perturbations, insects rely extensively on optic flow to modify their motor output and remain on course. We studied this behavior in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, by exploiting the optomotor response, a robust reflex in which an animal steers so as to minimize the magnitude of rotatory optic flow it perceives. Whereas the behavioral and algorithmic structure of the optomotor response has been studied in great detail, its neural implementation is not well-understood. In this paper, we present findings implicating a group of nearly homomorphic descending neurons, the DNg02s, as a core component for the optomotor response in flying Drosophila. Prior work on these cells suggested that they regulate the mechanical power to the flight system, presumably via connections to asynchronous flight motor neurons in the ventral nerve cord. When we chronically inactivated these cells, we observed that the magnitude of the optomotor response was diminished in proportion to the number of cells silenced, suggesting that the cells also regulate bilaterally asymmetric steering responses via population coding. During an optomotor response, flies coordinate changes in wing motion with movements of their head, abdomen, and hind legs, which are also diminished when the DNg02 cells are silenced. Using two-photon functional imaging, we show that the DNg02 cells respond most strongly to patterns of horizontal motion and that neuronal activity is closely correlated to motor output. However, unilateral optogenetic activation of DNg02 neurons does not elicit the asymmetric changes in wing motion characteristic of the optomotor response to a visual stimulus, but rather generates bilaterally symmetric increases in wingbeat amplitude. We interpret our experiments to suggest that flight maneuvers in flies require a more nuanced coordination of power muscles and steering muscles than previously appreciated, and that the physical flight apparatus of a fly might permit mechanical power to be distributed differentially between the two wings. Thus, whereas our experiments identify the DNg02 cells as a critical component of the optomotor reflex, our results suggest that other classes of descending cells targeting the steering muscle motor neurons are also required for the behavior.

	<p>Background: The severity of white matter hyperintensity (WMH) in patients with acute lacunar stroke (ALS) may be not completely parallel to cognitive impairment. Controversies persist about the effects of WMH on cognitive dysfunction. It is vital to explore whether the association may be affected by certain factors and whether a subsequent subgroup analysis is necessary. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between WMH and cognitive impairment in acute lacunar stroke patients and the possible causal factors. Methods: We continuously enrolled patients with ALS who were hospitalized at the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University between October 2017 and June 2022. The cognitive function of all patients was assessed by using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale 14 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2 days after the onset of AIS, and the results were adjusted to the education level. The MoCA scale was reevaluated at the 6-month (day 182 &amp;amp;plusmn; 7) follow-up by outpatient visit or video. Demographic and clinical data were collected. The manifestations of chronic cerebral small-vessel disease (CSVD), including the total Fazekas score and total CSVD burden score, were assessed with an MRI scan. A mismatch refers to an inconsistency between the severity of WMH and cognitive dysfunction. A Type 1 mismatch refers to cognitive impairment with mild WMH (total Fazekas score = 0&amp;amp;ndash;1), and a Type 2 mismatch refers to severe WMH (total Fazekas score = 5&amp;amp;ndash;6) in patients with normal cognitive function. Results: Among 213 enrolled ALS patients, 66 patients (31.0%) had cognitive dysfunction, and 40 patients (18.8%) had mismatches. Twenty-seven cases (12.7%) were Type 1 mismatched, and seventeen cases (8.0%) were Type 2 mismatched. Age, gender, fibrinogen and cerebral infarction history were independent risk factors for cognitive impairment in ALS patients. Imaging features, including moderate to severe WMH, deep WMH and the total CSVD burden score, were also independently associated with cognitive impairment. The patients in the mismatched group were older, had more severe deep WMH and had a higher occurrence of depression (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The NIHSS score, depression and microbleeds were significantly different between the Type 1 mismatched group and the matched group (p = 0.018, p = 0.012 and p = 0.047). Patients in the Type 2 mismatched group were male (p = 0.04), had a lower level of fibrinogen (p = 0.005), a lower incidence of CMBs (p = 0.003), a lower total CSVD burden score (p = 0.017), more severe paraventricular WMH (p = 0.035) and milder deep WMH (p = 0.026). Conclusions: Our study examined a homogeneous study cohort of recruited patients with symptomatic ALS. We found heterogeneity between WMH and cognitive function in ALS patients. Despite a similar WMH severity, some baseline clinical features and other conventional CSVD imaging characteristics may account for this heterogeneity phenomenon. Our findings provide data for the early diagnosis and prevention of cognitive impairment in ALS patients and suggest that the severity of WMH is not completely parallel to cognitive impairment. The white matter microstructural injury and remote WMH effects may account for the mismatch phenomenon. More attention should be paid to understanding the underlying mechanisms and finding new imaging markers.</p>

	<p>Auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) are brain-derived electrical signals, following an auditory stimulus, utilised to examine any obstructions along the brain neural-pathways and to diagnose hearing impairment. The clinical evaluation of AEPs is based on the measurements of the latencies and amplitudes of waves of interest; hence, their identification is a prerequisite for AEP analysis. This process has proven to be complex, as it requires relevant clinical experience, and the existing software for this purpose has little practical use. The aim of this study was the development of two automated annotation tools for ABR (auditory brainstem response)- and AMLR (auditory middle latency response)-tests. After the acquisition of 1046 raw waveforms, appropriate pre-processing and implementation of a four-stage development process were performed, to define the appropriate logical conditions and steps for each algorithm. The tools&amp;amp;rsquo; detection and annotation results, regarding the waves of interest, were then compared to the clinicians&amp;amp;rsquo; manual annotation, achieving match rates of at least 93.86%, 98.51%, and 91.51% respectively, for the three ABR-waves of interest, and 93.21%, 92.25%, 83.35%, and 79.27%, respectively, for the four AMLR-waves. The application of such tools in AEP analysis is expected to assist towards an easier interpretation of these signals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Electronic signature and attestation in conveyancing practice: A Malaysian legal perspective [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background  The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic brought about an unprecedented disruption to global business activities. Physical face-to-face activities must be restricted due to movement control order (MCO). The clients are required to sign the documents physically in the presence of the solicitor who must subsequently attest to the signature of the clients. The issue arises whether electronic signature (e-signature) and attestation are permissible under the laws of Malaysia. The aim of this research was to study the legality of e-signature and attestation in conveyancing practice in Malaysia and subsequently to propose recommendations to overcome these issues.   Methods   This is qualitative study and not an empirical study. The data was collected by library-based research from various primary and secondary data sources, including case law in Malaysia, written statutes, publication of journal and article.   Results  The Digital Signatures Act 1997 (DSA) and the Electronic Commerce Act 2006 (ECA) have legalised e-signatures. The DSA is the law that governs the digital signatures in Malaysia. ECA has listed a few documents which are not legally accepted if signed electronically, namely Power of Attorney, the Wills and codicils, the Trusts, and negotiable instruments. However, with regards to the issue of attestation of these documents, there are no clear laws which govern the attestation. The legal issue arises when the lawyers who have attested these documents are liable to be called as witness under the Evidence Act 1950 to testify their signature if these documents are tendered as evidence in any court proceedings.   Conclusion  The laws in Malaysia have provided sufficient provisions for e-signatures but not the issue of attestation via online. Thus, it is suggested that there is a need for unique legal framework for attestation via online in Malaysia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effects of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for breast cancer in health care quality improvements. A second systematic review. [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Traditionally, EB-CPGs have been believed to mainly improve the quality and consistency of health care, but this claim must be conclusively proven. We used the Donabedian three-dimensional model (structure, process, and patient outcomes) to assess improvements in the quality of medical care derived from implementing EB-CPGs. This study corresponds to the second systematic review carried out as a series of studies on different clinical issues that aim to evaluate the effectiveness of the application of the EB-CPG for improving the quality of care. Methods: We followed the methods described by the Cochrane Handbook and presented a descriptive analysis because of the high heterogeneity found across the included studies. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, and EBSCO Host databases, as well as the grey literature, between 1990 and April 2021. No language restrictions were applied. Only randomised clinical trials (RCTs) were selected. Results: Of the total of 364 interventions included in the eleven RCTs evaluated, 11 (3%) were related to healthcare structure, 51 (14%) to the healthcare delivery process and 302 (83%) to patient outcomes. Regarding the impact of using the EB-CPGs, in 303 interventions (83%), there were no significant differences between the control and experimental groups. In 4 interventions (1%), the result favoured the control and intervention groups in 57 of the interventions (16%). Conclusions: Our study showed that EB-CPGs slightly enhanced the quality of health care in the three dimensions described by Donabedian. Future RCTs should improve their design and methodological rigour by considering the certainty of the evidence supporting the EB-CPGs recommendations. In that context, broader analyses could be performed, having more concise hypotheses for further research. Registration: PROSPERO CRD42020205594

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Monitoring of awake bruxism by intelligent app [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background. Bruxism is a topic of much controversy and is continually debated in the field of dentistry due to the multifaceted clinical relationship that results in painful conditions and consequences to patients. The aim of this review was to determine the effectiveness of a smartphones app in monitoring awake bruxism. Methods. PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42021271190). The eligibility criteria were as followed: observational studies, case–control studies, studies that reported odds ratios, and studies on awake bruxism. The following keywords were searched: [smartphones apps] AND [apps] AND [awake bruxism], OR [sleep bruxism], OR [sleep hygiene], OR [parasomnias], AND [habits]. Results. All the included studies found that the use of the smartphone app allows controlled awake bruxism monitoring. The results also show that the slepp bruxism and awake bruxism  are interactive, having negative synergism and substantially increasing the risks of temporomandibular joint pain and temporomandibular disorders. Discussion. In the awake bruxims it was possible to identify 70% symptoms through the different frequencies of behavior provided by the App, within the present technological tools have become daily in young and adult population. The app is effective and easy to use by patients, effectively limiting biases the time of evaluation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mutation patterns of resistance genes for macrolides, aminoglycosides, and rifampicin in nontuberculous mycobacteria isolates from Kenya [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) treatment constitutes a macrolide-based antibiotic regimen in combination with aminoglycosides for Rapid-Growing mycobacteria (RGM), and rifampicin for Slow-Growing mycobacteria (SGM). Mutations in the anti-NTM drug target regions promote NTM evolution to mutant strains that are insusceptible to NTM drugs leading to treatment failure. We, therefore, described the mutation patterns of anti-NTM drug target genes including rrl, rrs, and rpoB in NTM isolates from Kenya.  Methods: We carried out a cross-sectional study that included 122 NTM obtained from the sputum of symptomatic tuberculosis-negative patients in Kenya. All the 122 NTM underwent targeted sequencing of the rrl gene. The 54 RGM were also sequenced for rrs, and the 68 SGM were sequenced for rpoB genes using ABI 3730XL analyzer. The obtained sequences were aligned to their wild-type reference sequences for each gene using Geneious then mutations were identified. Pearson chi-square at 95% confidence interval tested the association of NTM to mutation patterns for each gene. Results: Twenty-eight (23%) of the NTM harbored mutations associated with resistance to at least one of the macrolide-based therapy antibiotics. Twelve (10.4%)  NTM comprising 7(58.3%) of RGM and 5(41.7%) of SGM had mutations in the rrl gene. For ten (83.3%) NTM, mutations were found at position 2058, while for two (16.6%) NTM, mutations were found at position 2059. Six (11.1%) of the 54 RGM exhibited mutations in the aminoglycoside target gene rrs at location 1408. Ten (14.7%) of the 68 SGM harbored mutations in the rpoB gene with 40 percent having mutations at codon 531. Conclusion: We demonstrated a significant level of mutations associated with drug resistance for macrolides, aminoglycosides, and rifampicin in NTM isolated from symptomatic TB negative patients in Kenya.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The role of open research in improving the standards of evidence synthesis: current challenges and potential solutions in systematic reviews [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) are the cornerstone of evidence-based medicine and are placed at the top of the level-of-evidence pyramid. To date, there are several methodological resources available from international organizations such as the Cochrane Collaboration that aim to aid researchers in conducting high-quality secondary research and promoting reproducibility, transparency and scientific rigour. Nevertheless, researchers still face challenges in most stages of evidence synthesis. Open research and the FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) principles are rising initiatives being increasingly implemented in primary research. However, their beneficial role in secondary research is less emphasized. This article addresses how the challenges commonly faced during evidence synthesis research could be overcome using open research practices and currently available open research tools. Despite the phenomenally simple SR workflow, researchers still find tasks such as framing the SR research question, search strategy development, data extraction, and assessing for bias, challenging. The implementation of FAIR practices, including prospective registration at the PROSPERO database, abiding with the PRISMA guidelines, and making all SR data openly available could have significant benefits in avoiding duplication of effort and reducing research waste while improving the reporting standards of SRs. Additionally, this article highlights the need for further education in open research culture to overcome ethical and motivational barriers in implementing open research practices in evidence synthesis. Finally, in the era of technological breakthroughs, artificial intelligence may eventually be incorporated into the process of SRs and should abide by the FAIR standards for open research.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Remeshing flexible membranes under the control of free energy</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xinxin Wang, Gaudenz Danuser</p>

Cell membranes are flexible and often undergo large-scale morphological changes during processes like mitosis, protrusion and retraction, or vesicle fusion. Mathematical modeling of cell membranes depends on a representation of the free-form surface by discrete meshes. During morphological changes, these meshes must be adjusted under the minimization of the total free energy. Current methodology for meshing is limited in one of two ways: 1) Free energy-dependent methods have no restriction on the mesh geometry. The resulting irregular meshes cause artifacts in follow-up models of morphodynamics. 2) Geometry-dependent methods maintain mesh quality but violate the physics of free energy minimization. To fill this gap, we regulate mesh geometries via a free-energy-determined remeshing process: adding and removing mesh elements upon morphological changes based on barrier crossings in a double-barrier potential between neighboring vertices in the meshes. We test the method’s robustness by reproducing the morphodynamics of red blood cells and vesicle fusions; and we demonstrate the method’s adaptability by simulating the formation of filopodia, lamellipodia and invaginations. Finally, we use the method to study a mechanical decoupling effect of two connected membrane tethers that has been recently observed experimentally, but has not been mechanistically explained in the context of a complete membrane surface. We propose a biophysical model that strengthens the decoupling effect and broadens the original interpretation of the experiment. The method is developed in C/Matlab and distributed via https://github.com/DanuserLab/biophysicsModels.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Secuer: Ultrafast, scalable and accurate clustering of single-cell RNA-seq data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nana Wei, Yating Nie, Lin Liu, Xiaoqi Zheng, Hua-Jun Wu</p>

Identifying cell clusters is a critical step for single-cell transcriptomics study. Despite the numerous clustering tools developed recently, the rapid growth of scRNA-seq volumes prompts for a more (computationally) efficient clustering method. Here, we introduce Secuer, a Scalable and Efficient speCtral clUstERing algorithm for scRNA-seq data. By employing an anchor-based bipartite graph representation algorithm, Secuer enjoys reduced runtime and memory usage over one order of magnitude for datasets with more than 1 million cells. Meanwhile, Secuer also achieves better or comparable accuracy than competing methods in small and moderate benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we showcase that Secuer can also serve as a building block for a new consensus clustering method, Secuer-consensus, which again improves the runtime and scalability of state-of-the-art consensus clustering methods while also maintaining the accuracy. Overall, Secuer is a versatile, accurate, and scalable clustering framework suitable for small to ultra-large single-cell clustering tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Leveraging infectious disease models to interpret randomized controlled trials: Controlling enteric pathogen transmission through water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Andrew F. Brouwer, Marisa C. Eisenberg, Kevin M. Bakker, Savannah N. Boerger, Mondal H. Zahid, Matthew C. Freeman, Joseph N. S. Eisenberg</p>

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluate hypotheses in specific contexts and are often considered the gold standard of evidence for infectious disease interventions, but their results cannot immediately generalize to other contexts (e.g., different populations, interventions, or disease burdens). Mechanistic models are one approach to generalizing findings between contexts, but infectious disease transmission models (IDTMs) are not immediately suited for analyzing RCTs, since they often rely on time-series surveillance data. We developed an IDTM framework to explain relative risk outcomes of an infectious disease RCT and applied it to a water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) RCT. This model can generalize the RCT results to other contexts and conditions. We developed this compartmental IDTM framework to account for key WASH RCT factors: i) transmission across multiple environmental pathways, ii) multiple interventions applied individually and in combination, iii) adherence to interventions or preexisting conditions, and iv) the impact of individuals not enrolled in the study. We employed a hybrid sampling and estimation framework to obtain posterior estimates of mechanistic parameter sets consistent with empirical outcomes. We illustrated our model using WASH Benefits Bangladesh RCT data (n = 17,187). Our model reproduced reported diarrheal prevalence in this RCT. The baseline estimate of the basic reproduction number R 0 for the control arm (1.10, 95% CrI: 1.07, 1.16) corresponded to an endemic prevalence of 9.5% (95% CrI: 7.4, 13.7%) in the absence of interventions or preexisting WASH conditions. No single pathway was likely able to sustain transmission: pathway-specific R 0 s for water, fomites, and all other pathways were 0.42 (95% CrI: 0.03, 0.97), 0.20 (95% CrI: 0.02, 0.59), and 0.48 (95% CrI: 0.02, 0.94), respectively. An IDTM approach to evaluating RCTs can complement RCT analysis by providing a rigorous framework for generating data-driven hypotheses that explain trial findings, particularly unexpected null results, opening up existing data to deeper epidemiological understanding.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">EEG-representational geometries and psychometric distortions in approximate numerical judgment</a></h4>

When judging the average value of sample stimuli (e.g., numbers) people tend to either over- or underweight extreme sample values, depending on task context. In a context of overweighting, recent work has shown that extreme sample values were overly represented also in neural signals, in terms of an anti-compressed geometry of number samples in multivariate electroencephalography (EEG) patterns. Here, we asked whether neural representational geometries may also reflect a relative underweighting of extreme values (i.e., compression) which has been observed behaviorally in a great variety of tasks. We used a simple experimental manipulation (instructions to average a single-stream or to compare dual-streams of samples) to induce compression or anti-compression in behavior when participants judged rapid number sequences. Model-based representational similarity analysis (RSA) replicated the previous finding of neural anti-compression in the dual-stream task, but failed to provide evidence for neural compression in the single-stream task, despite the evidence for compression in behavior. Instead, the results indicated enhanced neural processing of extreme values in either task, regardless of whether extremes were over- or underweighted in subsequent behavioral choice. We further observed more general differences in the neural representation of the sample information between the two tasks. Together, our results indicate a mismatch between sample-level EEG geometries and behavior, which raises new questions about the origin of common psychometric distortions, such as diminishing sensitivity for larger values.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Regional mutational signature activities in cancer genomes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Caitlin Timmons, Quaid Morris, Caitlin F. Harrigan</p>

Cancer genomes harbor a catalog of somatic mutations. The type and genomic context of these mutations depend on their causes and allow their attribution to particular mutational signatures. Previous work has shown that mutational signature activities change over the course of tumor development, but investigations of genomic region variability in mutational signatures have been limited. Here, we expand upon this work by constructing regional profiles of mutational signature activities over 2,203 whole genomes across 25 tumor types, using data aggregated by the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) consortium. We present GenomeTrackSig as an extension to the TrackSig R package to construct regional signature profiles using optimal segmentation and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We find that 426 genomes from 20 tumor types display at least one change in mutational signature activities (changepoint), and 306 genomes contain at least one of 54 recurrent changepoints shared by seven or more genomes of the same tumor type. Five recurrent changepoint locations are shared by multiple tumor types. Within these regions, the particular signature changes are often consistent across samples of the same type and some, but not all, are characterized by signatures associated with subclonal expansion. The changepoints we found cannot strictly be explained by gene density, mutation density, or cell-of-origin chromatin state. We hypothesize that they reflect a confluence of factors including evolutionary timing of mutational processes, regional differences in somatic mutation rate, large-scale changes in chromatin state that may be tissue type-specific, and changes in chromatin accessibility during subclonal expansion. These results provide insight into the regional effects of DNA damage and repair processes, and may help us localize genomic and epigenomic changes that occur during cancer development.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">ToMExO: A probabilistic tree-structured model for cancer progression</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mohammadreza Mohaghegh Neyshabouri, Jens Lagergren</p>

Identifying the interrelations among cancer driver genes and the patterns in which the driver genes get mutated is critical for understanding cancer. In this paper, we study cross-sectional data from cohorts of tumors to identify the cancer-type (or subtype) specific process in which the cancer driver genes accumulate critical mutations. We model this mutation accumulation process using a tree, where each node includes a driver gene or a set of driver genes. A mutation in each node enables its children to have a chance of mutating. This model simultaneously explains the mutual exclusivity patterns observed in mutations in specific cancer genes (by its nodes) and the temporal order of events (by its edges). We introduce a computationally efficient dynamic programming procedure for calculating the likelihood of our noisy datasets and use it to build our Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference algorithm, ToMExO. Together with a set of engineered MCMC moves, our fast likelihood calculations enable us to work with datasets with hundreds of genes and thousands of tumors, which cannot be dealt with using available cancer progression analysis methods. We demonstrate our method’s performance on several synthetic datasets covering various scenarios for cancer progression dynamics. Then, a comparison against two state-of-the-art methods on a moderate-size biological dataset shows the merits of our algorithm in identifying significant and valid patterns. Finally, we present our analyses of several large biological datasets, including colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, and pancreatic cancer. In all the analyses, we validate the results using a set of method-independent metrics testing the causality and significance of the relations identified by ToMExO or competing methods.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Using genetic data to identify transmission risk factors: Statistical assessment and application to tuberculosis transmission</a></h4>

Identifying host factors that influence infectious disease transmission is an important step toward developing interventions to reduce disease incidence. Recent advances in methods for reconstructing infectious disease transmission events using pathogen genomic and epidemiological data open the door for investigation of host factors that affect onward transmission. While most transmission reconstruction methods are designed to work with densely sampled outbreaks, these methods are making their way into surveillance studies, where the fraction of sampled cases with sequenced pathogens could be relatively low. Surveillance studies that use transmission event reconstruction then use the reconstructed events as response variables (i.e., infection source status of each sampled case) and use host characteristics as predictors (e.g., presence of HIV infection) in regression models. We use simulations to study estimation of the effect of a host factor on probability of being an infection source via this multi-step inferential procedure. Using TransPhylo—a widely-used method for Bayesian estimation of infectious disease transmission events—and logistic regression, we find that low sensitivity of identifying infection sources leads to dilution of the signal, biasing logistic regression coefficients toward zero. We show that increasing the proportion of sampled cases improves sensitivity and some, but not all properties of the logistic regression inference. Application of these approaches to real world data from a population-based TB study in Botswana fails to detect an association between HIV infection and probability of being a TB infection source. We conclude that application of a pipeline, where one first uses TransPhylo and sparsely sampled surveillance data to infer transmission events and then estimates effects of host characteristics on probabilities of these events, should be accompanied by a realistic simulation study to better understand biases stemming from imprecise transmission event inference.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Input correlations impede suppression of chaos and learning in balanced firing-rate networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rainer Engelken, Alessandro Ingrosso, Ramin Khajeh, Sven Goedeke, L. F. Abbott</p>

Neural circuits exhibit complex activity patterns, both spontaneously and evoked by external stimuli. Information encoding and learning in neural circuits depend on how well time-varying stimuli can control spontaneous network activity. We show that in firing-rate networks in the balanced state, external control of recurrent dynamics, i.e., the suppression of internally-generated chaotic variability, strongly depends on correlations in the input. A distinctive feature of balanced networks is that, because common external input is dynamically canceled by recurrent feedback, it is far more difficult to suppress chaos with common input into each neuron than through independent input. To study this phenomenon, we develop a non-stationary dynamic mean-field theory for driven networks. The theory explains how the activity statistics and the largest Lyapunov exponent depend on the frequency and amplitude of the input, recurrent coupling strength, and network size, for both common and independent input. We further show that uncorrelated inputs facilitate learning in balanced networks.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Orientation control strategies and adaptation to a visuomotor perturbation in rotational hand movements</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Or Zruya, Ilana Nisky</p>

Computational approaches to biological motor control are used to discover the building blocks of human motor behaviour. Models explaining features of human hand movements have been studied thoroughly, yet only a few studies attempted to explain the control of the orientation of the hand; instead, they mainly focus on the control of hand translation, predominantly in a single plane. In this study, we present a new methodology to study the way humans control the orientation of their hands in three dimensions and demonstrate it in two sequential experiments. We developed a quaternion-based score that quantifies the geodicity of rotational hand movements and evaluated it experimentally. In the first experiment, participants performed a simple orientation-matching task with a robotic manipulator. We found that rotations are generally performed by following a geodesic in the quaternion hypersphere, which suggests that, similarly to translation, the orientation of the hand is centrally controlled, possibly by optimizing geometrical properties of the hand’s rotation. This result established a baseline for the study of human response to perturbed visual feedback of the orientation of the hand. In the second experiment, we developed a novel visuomotor rotation task in which the rotation is applied on the hand’s rotation, and studied the adaptation of participants to this rotation, and the transfer of the adaptation to a different initial orientation. We observed partial adaptation to the rotation. The patterns of the transfer of the adaptation to a different initial orientation were consistent with the representation of the orientation in extrinsic coordinates. The methodology that we developed allows for studying the control of a rigid body without reducing the dimensionality of the task. The results of the two experiments open questions for future studies regarding the mechanisms underlying the central control of hand orientation. These results can be of benefit for many applications that involve fine manipulation of rigid bodies, such as teleoperation and neurorehabilitation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Early enforcement of cell identity by a functional component of the terminally differentiated state</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Zahra Bahrami-Nejad, Zhi-Bo Zhang, Stefan Tholen, Sanjeev Sharma, Atefeh Rabiee, Michael L. Zhao, Fredric B. Kraemer, Mary N. Teruel</p>

How progenitor cells can attain a distinct differentiated cell identity is a challenging problem given the fluctuating signaling environment in which cells exist and that critical transcription factors are often not unique to a differentiation process. Here, we test the hypothesis that a unique differentiated cell identity can result from a core component of the differentiated state doubling up as a signaling protein that also drives differentiation. Using live single-cell imaging in the adipocyte differentiation system, we show that progenitor fat cells (preadipocytes) can only commit to terminally differentiate after up-regulating FABP4, a lipid buffer that is highly enriched in mature adipocytes. Upon induction of adipogenesis in mouse preadipocyte cells, we show that after a long delay, cells first abruptly start to engage a positive feedback between CEBPA and PPARG before then engaging, after a second delay, a positive feedback between FABP4 and PPARG. These sequential positive feedbacks both need to engage in order to drive PPARG levels past the threshold for irreversible differentiation. In the last step before commitment, PPARG transcriptionally increases FABP4 expression while fatty acid-loaded FABP4 increases PPARG activity. Together, our study suggests a control principle for robust cell identity whereby a core component of the differentiated state also promotes differentiation from its own progenitor state.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A brain-wide form of presynaptic active zone plasticity orchestrates resilience to brain aging in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sheng Huang, Chengji Piao, Christine B. Beuschel, Zhiying Zhao, Stephan J. Sigrist</p>

The brain as a central regulator of stress integration determines what is threatening, stores memories, and regulates physiological adaptations across the aging trajectory. While sleep homeostasis seems to be linked to brain resilience, how age-associated changes intersect to adapt brain resilience to life history remains enigmatic. We here provide evidence that a brain-wide form of presynaptic active zone plasticity (“PreScale”), characterized by increases of active zone scaffold proteins and synaptic vesicle release factors, integrates resilience by coupling sleep, longevity, and memory during early aging of <i>Drosophila</i>. PreScale increased over the brain until mid-age, to then decreased again, and promoted the age-typical adaption of sleep patterns as well as extended longevity, while at the same time it reduced the ability of forming new memories. Genetic induction of PreScale also mimicked early aging-associated adaption of sleep patterns and the neuronal activity/excitability of sleep control neurons. Spermidine supplementation, previously shown to suppress early aging-associated PreScale, also attenuated the age-typical sleep pattern changes. Pharmacological induction of sleep for 2 days in mid-age flies also reset PreScale, restored memory formation, and rejuvenated sleep patterns. Our data suggest that early along the aging trajectory, PreScale acts as an acute, brain-wide form of presynaptic plasticity to steer trade-offs between longevity, sleep, and memory formation in a still plastic phase of early brain aging.

                Background: The use of data-independent data acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) on biological samples from domestic animals is still uncommon. Here, sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra (SWATH-MS) – a variant of DIA-MS was used to analyse serum peptides of healthy sheep as compared with serum of sick sheep by interrogating a novel peptide spectral library (PSL). This approach enabled the detection and annotation of a wide range of proteins, than conventional clinical pathology protein assays. Methods: Serum samples from healthy sheep were obtained from a commercial source and normalised to represent a healthy sheep proteome background and then compared with serum samples of sheep suffering from a range of naturally-acquired illnesses submitted to The University of Queensland, Australia. Purified tryptic peptides were subjected to liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) on a quadrupole time-of-flight instrument (TripleTOF 5600+, SCIEX) set in a cyclic data-independent acquisition (DIA) mode using a generic (SWATH™, SCIEX) acquisition method. Data were processed using PeakView® v2.2 software with SWATH™ Acquisition MicroApp 2.0 (SCIEX) and MarkerView™ v1.3 software (SCIEX) pipeline to generate protein lists for downstream gene ontology annotation and pathway analysis of identified proteins. Results: There were distinct differences in peptide chromatographic features of sick sheep samples compared to those from healthy sheep. Healthy and sick sheep serum samples yielded 335 and 236 protein identifications (IDs), respectively. There were 96 protein IDs unique to sick sheep serum. A total of 431 protein IDs were annotated by combining healthy control and sick sheep protein IDs. Conclusions: SWATH analysis successfully aided in the detection some established clinicopathological serum biochemical analytes. This approach enabled the distinction of protein profiles of sick sheep samples from a healthy control sample, thereby providing a promising future perspective for the application of SWATH analysis in veterinary clinical use.

                As research becomes more interdisciplinary, fast-paced, data-intensive, and collaborative, there is an increasing need to share data and other research products in accordance with Open Science principles. In response to this need, we created an Open Science & Data Collaborations (OSDC) program at the Carnegie Mellon University Libraries that provides Open Science tools, training, collaboration opportunities, and community-building events to support Open Research and Open Science adoption. This program presents a unique end-to-end model for Open Science programs because it extends open science support beyond open repositories and open access publishing to the entire research lifecycle. We developed a logic model and a preliminary assessment metrics framework to evaluate the impact of the program activities based on existing data collected through event and workshop registrations and platform usage. The combination of these evaluation instruments has provided initial insight into our service productivity and impact. It will further help to answer more in-depth questions regarding the program impact, launch targeted surveys, and identify priority service areas and interesting Open Science projects.

                Background: Lack of knowledge among parents can result in inappropriate administration practices.  After analyzing different studies among children, there was no data on challenges and barriers in the administration of drugs among children in this region because of the diverse environmental issues and challenges in the UAE. The objective of this study was to determine the reported administration practices of parents and challenges and barriers in the administration of drugs among children in UAE. Methods: A questionnaire-based survey was conducted. A convenience sampling technique was used to collect the data. An online Raosoft® sample size calculator was applied (n = 248). The inclusion criteria were parents who had a child under 10 years of age and gave consent to participate in this study. Children with vision problems, cognitive/physical disabilities, and caregivers other than parents were excluded from this study. Results: The study reported response rate of 73.2%. The mean ± S.D age of the parents in years was 35.5 ± 7.8, and the mean ± S.D of children aged years was 2.60 ± 1.54. The majority of parents (83.9%) completing the survey were mothers and resided in the city (97.2%). When the children did not like taking tablet drugs 41.9% used multiple practices and 26.2% of parents reported treatment failure due to oral drug administration. Around 47.6% of those who were interviewed reported that their children had swallowing problems during the administration of oral medication. A total of 22.2% of parents reported that they gave drugs in doses higher than prescribed by the doctor to treat their children more quickly. Similarly, a total of 64.5% of the parents reported self-medication without consultation from a healthcare provider. Conclusions: The study concluded that there were inappropriate drug administration practices among parents. Parents reported administration of higher doses to treat their children quickly.

                Background: Children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) are at an increased risk of cardiovascular complications. The aim of this study was to assess the role of speckle tracking echocardiography in detecting subclinical myocardial damage in children with SCA. Methods: A cross-sectional case–control study was conducted at the echocardiography laboratory of the military hospital of Tunis between July and December 2018. Thirty patients with SCA were included. A control(C) group including 30 normally developing children was selected and matched to the SCA group by sex and age. We compared between the two groups: conventional echocardiographic parameters including cardiac output, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), thickness and the global longitudinal strain (GLS). The echocardiographic measurements were indexed according to body surface area. The left ventricular (LV) GLS association with clinical characteristics and echocardiographic parameters were also evaluated. Results: Patients and controls were matched for age and sex: the mean age was (11± 2years) in SCA group versus (12± 1 years) in C group with a sex ratio of (1.31 versus 1.27, respectively). Body surface area was comparable. LV hypertrophy and dilation were revealed in the SCA group, whereas measurements were normal in the C group. No significant differences were observed for cardiac output (p=0.4). LVEF were preserved in both groups. However, two-dimensional (2D) LVGLS was impaired in 46% of SCA group (n=14) with mean value of (-21%±3.07 vs -25%±2.98; p<0.01).In SCA group, impaired LVGLS was significantly associated with LV mass (r = – 0.399, p<0.01), LV tele diastolic diameter(r= -0.419, p<0.01) and left atrial volume (r= - 0.399, p< 0.04). In multivariate analysis, LV mass was the only independent factor. Conclusions: In the present study, LVGLS measurement revealed subclinical LV systolic impairment in patients with SCA. Therefore, 2D strain could be beneficial to detect the natural history of LV dysfunction in SCA.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Enhancement of surface properties of polyetheretherketone implant material by fractional laser texturing [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is a promising implant material due to its superior biomechanical strength. However, due to its hydrophobic nature and lack of cellular adhesion properties, it has poor integration with bone tissue. Methods: A fractional CO2 laser was used with various parameters for surface texturing of PEEK substrate to enhance its surface properties. An optical microscope and field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) were used to examine the surface morphology of untextured and laser-textured samples. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was performed to determine the effect of the laser on the microstructure of PEEK. Surface microroughness, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and wettability were investigated. Results: There were significant increases in microroughness, nanoroughness, surface area ratio, and wettability after laser texturing with no change in the elemental composition. The best results were obtained by using 400 µs laser pulse duration with a dot separation distance of 0.2 mm and a 60° staggered dots pattern. Conclusions: Laser surface texturing of PEEK implant material by fractional CO2 laser is an easy and fast method of introducing patterned topographical features with no need for additional devices. With further investigations, this method of PEEK modification might have the potential to be used in the implant field.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A transit map for micro-scale urban development in Alexandria, Egypt [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Due to Egypt's strategic location among countries, transportation is one of the most significant development sectors because it plays a major part in today's economy and society and has a large influence on growth and employment. Over the years, the Egyptian General Organisation of Physical Planning (GOPP) has prepared strategic general urban plans in collaboration with local and foreign organisations, including transportation plans. The constant focus of authorities on strategic plans and their inability to implement them on schedule are a major issue. In other words, they always take development from a distant perspective and do not deal with the main problem that exists within cities, as the existing micro-scale transit built environments (MSTBEs) of cities are not ready due to a lack of transit-oriented communities (TOCs), sustainably developed transit supply systems, and mobility hubs. Methods: The "Enhanced MSTBE Phases" methodology is used for the key elements of the study design used in this research, depending on data collection, approvals, techniques, and analysis methods. As a case study, these key elements are in the documentation, analysis, and development of the Muharram Bek El Mowkaf El Gedid Mobility Hub (MBMH) and the 800 m radius around it. Results: The results indicate that Enhanced MSTBE Phases led to the establishment of the MBMH and the 800 m radius surrounding it as a sustainable MSTBE in Alexandria, Egypt, which is chosen as the case study. Conclusions: The development of this MSTBE is a catalyst for future effects that will have a long-term impact on meso-scale and, ultimately, macro-scale transit built environments.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Neuropathological Insights into Unexpected Cognitive Decline in Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Some patients unexpectedly display an unfavorable cognitive course after epilepsy surgery subsequent to any direct cognitive sequelae of the surgical treatment. Therefore, we conducted in-depth neuropathological examinations of resective specimens from corresponding patients to provide insights as to the underlying disease processes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this study, cases with significant cognitive deterioration following a previous postoperative assessment were extracted from the neuropsychological database of a longstanding epilepsy surgical program. An extensive reanalysis of available specimens was performed using current, state-of-the-art neuropathological examinations. Patients without cognitive deterioration but matched in regard to basic pathologies served as controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among the 355 operated patients who had undergone more than one postoperative neuropsychological examination, 30 (8%) showed significant cognitive decline in the period after surgery. Of the 24 patients with available specimens, 71% displayed further neuropathological changes in addition to the typical spectrum (ie, hippocampal sclerosis, focal cortical dysplasias, vascular lesions, and low-grade tumors), indicating (1) a secondary, putatively epilepsy-independent neurodegenerative disease process; (2) limbic inflammation; or (3) the enigmatic pathology pattern of "hippocampal gliosis" without segmental neurodegeneration. In the controls, the matched individual principal epilepsy-associated pathologies were not found in combination with the secondary pathology patterns of the study group.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings indicate that patients who unexpectedly displayed unfavorable cognitive development beyond any direct surgical effects show rare and very particular pathogenetic causes or parallel, presumably independent, neurodegenerative alterations. A multicenter collection of such cases would be appreciated to discern presurgical biomarkers that help with surgical decision-making. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Hippocampal adult neural stem cells emerge from progeny of the neuroepithelial lineage during murine brain development. Hippocampus development is increasingly well understood. However, the clonal relationships between early neuroepithelial stem cells and postnatal neurogenic cells remain unclear, especially at the single-cell level. Here we report fate bias and gene expression programs in thousands of clonally related cells in the juvenile hippocampus based on single-cell RNA-seq of barcoded clones. We find evidence for early fate restriction of neuroepithelial stem cells to either neurogenic progenitor cells of the dentate gyrus region or oligodendrogenic, non-neurogenic fate supplying cells for other hippocampal regions including gray matter areas and the Cornu ammonis region 1/3. Our study provides new insights into the phenomenon of early fate restriction guiding the development of postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus, a medial temporal lobe brain region, is critical for the consolidation of information from short-term memory into long-term episodic memory and for spatial memory that enables navigation. Hippocampal damage in humans has been linked to amnesia and memory loss, characteristic of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Numerous studies indicate that the rodent hippocampus contributes significantly to long-term memory for spatial and nonspatial information. For example, muscimol-induced depression of CA1 neuronal activity in the dorsal hippocampus impairs the encoding, consolidation, and retrieval of nonspatial object memory in mice. Here, a chemogenetic designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) approach was used to test the selective involvement of CA1 pyramidal neurons in memory retrieval for objects and for spatial location in a cohort of male C57BL/6J mice. Activation of the inhibitory (hM4Di) DREADDs receptor expressed in CA1 neurons significantly impaired the retrieval of object memory in the spontaneous object recognition task and of spatial memory in the Morris water maze. Silencing of CA1 neuronal activity in hM4Di-expressing mice was confirmed by comparing Fos expression in vehicle- and clozapine-<i>N</i>-oxide-treated mice after exploration of a novel environment. Histological analyses revealed that expression of the hM4Di receptor was limited to CA1 neurons of the dorsal hippocampus. These results suggest that a common subset of CA1 neurons (i.e., those expressing hM4Di receptors) in mouse hippocampus contributed to the retrieval of long-term memory for nonspatial and spatial information. Our findings support the view that the contribution of the rodent hippocampus is like that of the primate hippocampus, specifically essential for global memory. Our results further validate mice as a suitable model system to study the neurobiological mechanisms of human episodic memory, but also in developing treatments and understanding the underlying causes of diseases affecting long-term memory, such as Alzheimer's disease.</p>

<p>This study demonstrates that nanoparticulate matter (nPM) exposure and chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) promote oxidative stress and induce neuronal apoptosis in a synergistic manner. Oligodendrocytes are preferentially vulnerable to the toxicity of nPM exposure and CCH. nPM exposure causes mature oligodendrocyte cell death and increases the number oligodendrocyte precursor cells.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) may amplify the neurotoxicity of nanoscale particulate matter (nPM), resulting in white matter injury. This study characterized the joint effects of nPM (diameter ≤ 200 nm) and CCH secondary to bilateral carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) exposure on neuronal and white matter injury in a murine model. nPM was collected near a highway and re-aerosolized for exposure. Ten-week-old C57BL/6 male mice were randomized into four groups: filtered air (FA), nPM, FA + BCAS, and nPM + BCAS. Mice were exposed to FA or nPM for 10 weeks. BCAS surgeries were performed. Markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis were examined. nPM + BCAS exposure increased brain hemisphere TNFα protein compared to FA. iNOS and HNE immunofluorescence were increased in the corpus callosum and cerebral cortex of nPM + BCAS mice compared to FA. While nPM exposure alone did not decrease cortical neuronal cell count, nPM decreased corpus callosum oligodendrocyte cell count. nPM exposure decreased mature oligodendrocyte cell count and increased oligodendrocyte precursor cell count in the corpus callosum. nPM + BCAS mice exhibited a 200% increase in cortical neuronal TUNEL staining and a 700% increase in corpus callosum oligodendrocyte TUNEL staining compared to FA. There was a supra-additive interaction between nPM and BCAS on cortical neuronal TUNEL staining (2.6× the additive effects of nPM + BCAS). nPM + BCAS exposure increased apoptosis, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress in the cerebral cortex and corpus callosum. nPM + BCAS exposure increased neuronal apoptosis above the separate responses to each exposure. However, oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum demonstrated a greater susceptibility to the combined neurotoxic effects of nPM + BCAS exposure.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Measurement of speech in individuals with selective mutism: A systematic review [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The main characteristic of selective mutism (SM) is the failure to speak in specific social situations. Thus, assessing speech across social contexts is important for confirming a diagnosis of SM and for differentiating it from other disorders. The purpose of this review was to organize how the core symptom of SM, a lack of speech in specific social situations, has been assessed in previous studies. Methods: A systematic search of articles was conducted in three databases, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and PubMed and reviews of surveys or experimental studies that reported empirical data on individuals with SM were performed. We excluded review, qualitative, epidemiological, and intervention studies. The study summarized the diagnostic criteria, methods of confirming SM diagnosis, distinction of SM from other disorders, and methods of speech assessment. Results: A total of 447 articles were screened, where 60 articles were considered eligible. The results demonstrate that different interviews and questionnaires were used to establish the diagnosis of SM. However, the majority of interviews and questionnaires lacked validation. Only two (2/60) articles used validated methods of speech assessment to confirm SM diagnosis. Moreover, a consensus was lacking on the assessment method for differentiating SM from other disorders across studies. Specifically, 17 studies measured speech and are not intended for diagnosis. The majority of studies (16/17) used the questionnaire to assess the severity of the SM condition, and only one study conducted behavioral observation. Assessment methods based on the measurement of speech in real-life situations for individuals with SM were not established. Conclusion: We have the limitation that we did not review intervention studies. However, this systematic review revealed the problem that speech assessment methods for surveys or experimental studies of SM were not established. Future studies should establish methods of speech assessment across social situations to assess SM symptoms.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Glycine inhibits NINJ1 membrane clustering to suppress plasma membrane rupture in cell death</a></h4>

              
                First recognized more than 30 years ago, glycine protects cells against rupture from diverse types of injury. This robust and widely observed effect has been speculated to target a late downstream process common to multiple modes of tissue injury. The molecular target of glycine that mediates cytoprotection, however, remains elusive. Here, we show that glycine works at the level of NINJ1, a newly identified executioner of plasma membrane rupture in pyroptosis, necrosis, and post-apoptosis lysis. NINJ1 is thought to cluster within the plasma membrane to cause cell rupture. We demonstrate that the execution of pyroptotic cell rupture is similar for human and mouse NINJ1, and that NINJ1 knockout functionally and morphologically phenocopies glycine cytoprotection in macrophages undergoing lytic cell death. Next, we show that glycine prevents NINJ1 clustering by either direct or indirect mechanisms. In pyroptosis, glycine preserves cellular integrity but does not affect upstream inflammasome activities or accompanying energetic cell death. By positioning NINJ1 clustering as a glycine target, our data resolve a long-standing mechanism for glycine-mediated cytoprotection. This new understanding will inform the development of cell preservation strategies to counter pathologic lytic cell death.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Insight into the evolutionary assemblage of cranial kinesis from a Cretaceous bird</a></h4>

              
                The independent movements and flexibility of various parts of the skull, called cranial kinesis, are an evolutionary innovation that is found in living vertebrates only in some squamates and crown birds and is considered to be a major factor underpinning much of the enormous phenotypic and ecological diversity of living birds, the most diverse group of extant amniotes. Compared to the postcranium, our understanding of the evolutionary assemblage of the characteristic modern bird skull has been hampered by sparse fossil records of early cranial materials, with competing hypotheses regarding the evolutionary development of cranial kinesis among early members of the avialans. Here, a detailed three-dimensional reconstruction of the skull of the Early Cretaceous enantiornithine <i>Yuanchuavis kompsosoura</i> allows for its in-depth description, including elements that are poorly known among early-diverging avialans but are central to deciphering the mosaic assembly of features required for modern avian cranial kinesis. Our reconstruction of the skull shows evolutionary and functional conservation of the temporal and palatal regions by retaining the ancestral theropod dinosaurian configuration within the skull of this otherwise derived and volant bird. Geometric morphometric analysis of the palatine suggests that loss of the jugal process represents the first step in the structural modifications of this element leading to the kinetic crown bird condition. The mixture of plesiomorphic temporal and palatal structures together with a derived avialan rostrum and postcranial skeleton encapsulated in <i>Yuanchuavis</i> manifests the key role of evolutionary mosaicism and experimentation in early bird diversification.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Glycolytic flux-signaling controls mouse embryo mesoderm development</a></h4>

              
                How cellular metabolic state impacts cellular programs is a fundamental, unresolved question. Here we investigated how glycolytic flux impacts embryonic development, using presomitic mesoderm (PSM) patterning as the experimental model. First, we identified fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) as an in vivo sentinel metabolite that mirrors glycolytic flux within PSM cells of post-implantation mouse embryos. We found that medium-supplementation with FBP, but not with other glycolytic metabolites, such as fructose 6-phosphate and 3-phosphoglycerate, impaired mesoderm segmentation. To genetically manipulate glycolytic flux and FBP levels, we generated a mouse model enabling the conditional overexpression of dominant active, cytoplasmic PFKFB3 (cytoPFKFB3). Overexpression of cytoPFKFB3 indeed led to increased glycolytic flux/FBP levels and caused an impairment of mesoderm segmentation, paralleled by the downregulation of Wnt-signaling, reminiscent of the effects seen upon FBP-supplementation. To probe for mechanisms underlying glycolytic flux-signaling, we performed subcellular proteome analysis and revealed that cytoPFKFB3 overexpression altered subcellular localization of certain proteins, including glycolytic enzymes, in PSM cells. Specifically, we revealed that FBP supplementation caused depletion of Pfkl and Aldoa from the nuclear-soluble fraction. Combined, we propose that FBP functions as a flux-signaling metabolite connecting glycolysis and PSM patterning, potentially through modulating subcellular protein localization.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A Bayesian approach to single-particle electron cryo-tomography in RELION-4.0</a></h4>

              
                We present a new approach for macromolecular structure determination from multiple particles in electron cryo-tomography (cryo-ET) data sets. Whereas existing subtomogram averaging approaches are based on 3D data models, we propose to optimise a regularised likelihood target that approximates a function of the 2D experimental images. In addition, analogous to Bayesian polishing and contrast transfer function (CTF) refinement in single-particle analysis, we describe approaches that exploit the increased signal-to-noise ratio in the averaged structure to optimise tilt series alignments, beam-induced motions of the particles throughout the tilt series acquisition, defoci of the individual particles, as well as higher-order optical aberrations of the microscope. Implementation of our approaches in the open-source software package RELION aims to facilitate their general use, in particular for those researchers who are already familiar with its single-particle analysis tools. We illustrate for three applications that our approaches allow structure determination from cryo-ET data to resolutions sufficient for de novo atomic modelling.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Activity disruption causes degeneration of entorhinal neurons in a mouse model of Alzheimer's circuit dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by selective vulnerability of distinct cell populations; however, the cause for this specificity remains elusive. Here we show that entorhinal cortex layer 2 (EC2) neurons are unusually vulnerable to prolonged neuronal inactivity compared with neighboring regions of the temporal lobe, and that reelin+ stellate cells connecting EC with the hippocampus are preferentially susceptible within the EC2 population. We demonstrate that neuronal death after silencing can be elicited through multiple independent means of activity inhibition, and that preventing synaptic release, either alone or in combination with electrical shunting, is sufficient to elicit silencing-induced degeneration. Finally, we discovered that degeneration following synaptic silencing is governed by competition between active and inactive cells, which is a circuit refinement process traditionally thought to end early in postnatal life. Our data suggests that the developmental window for wholesale circuit plasticity may extend into adulthood for specific brain regions. We speculate that this sustained potential for remodeling by entorhinal neurons may support lifelong memory but renders them vulnerable to prolonged activity changes in disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dependence of diffusion in Escherichia coli cytoplasm on protein size, environmental conditions and cell growth</a></h4>

              
                Inside prokaryotic cells, passive translational diffusion typically limits the rates with which cytoplasmic proteins can reach their locations. Diffusion is thus fundamental to most cellular processes, but the understanding of protein mobility in the highly crowded and non-homogeneous environment of a bacterial cell is still limited. Here we investigated the mobility of a large set of proteins in the cytoplasm of <i>Escherichia coli</i>, by employing fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) combined with simulations and theoretical modeling. We conclude that cytoplasmic protein mobility could be well described by Brownian diffusion in the confined geometry of the bacterial cell and at the high viscosity imposed by macromolecular crowding. We observed similar size dependence of protein diffusion for the majority of tested proteins, whether native or foreign to <i>E. coli</i>. For the faster-diffusing proteins, this size dependence is well consistent with the Stokes-Einstein relation once taking into account the specific dumbbell shape of protein fusions. Pronounced subdiffusion and hindered mobility are only observed for proteins with extensive interactions within the cytoplasm. Finally, while protein diffusion becomes markedly faster in actively growing cells, at high temperature, or upon treatment with rifampicin, and slower at high osmolarity, all of these perturbations affect proteins of different sizes in the same proportions, which could thus be described as changes of a well-defined cytoplasmic viscosity.

                Pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) are sensory epithelial cells that transmit airway status to the brain via sensory neurons and locally via calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and γ- aminobutyric acid (GABA). Several other neuropeptides and neurotransmitters have been detected in various species, but the number, targets, functions, and conservation of PNEC signals are largely unknown. We used scRNAseq to profile hundreds of the rare mouse and human PNECs. This revealed over 40 PNEC neuropeptide and peptide hormone genes, most cells expressing unique combinations of 5–18 genes. Peptides are packaged in separate vesicles, their release presumably regulated by the distinct, multimodal combinations of sensors we show are expressed by each PNEC. Expression of the peptide receptors predicts an array of local cell targets, and we show the new PNEC signal angiotensin directly activates one subtype of innervating sensory neuron. Many signals lack lung targets so may have endocrine activity like those of PNEC-derived carcinoid tumors. PNECs are an extraordinarily rich and diverse signaling hub rivaling the enteroendocrine system.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Effects of dopamine D2/3 and opioid receptor antagonism on the trade-off between model-based and model-free behaviour in healthy volunteers</a></h4>

              
                Human behaviour requires flexible arbitration between actions we do out of habit and actions that are directed towards a specific goal. Drugs that target opioid and dopamine receptors are notorious for inducing maladaptive habitual drug consumption; yet, how the opioidergic and dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems contribute to the arbitration between habitual and goal-directed behaviour is poorly understood. By combining pharmacological challenges with a well-established decision-making task and a novel computational model, we show that the administration of the dopamine D2/3 receptor antagonist amisulpride led to an increase in goal-directed or ‘model-based’ relative to habitual or ‘model-free’ behaviour, whereas the non-selective opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone had no appreciable effect. The effect of amisulpride on model-based/model-free behaviour did not scale with drug serum levels in the blood. Furthermore, participants with higher amisulpride serum levels showed higher explorative behaviour. These findings highlight the distinct functional contributions of dopamine and opioid receptors to goal-directed and habitual behaviour and support the notion that even small doses of amisulpride promote flexible application of cognitive control.

                Recent advances in connectomic and neurophysiological tools make it possible to probe whole-brain mechanisms in the mouse that underlie cognition and behavior. Based on experimental data, we developed a large-scale model of the mouse brain for a cardinal cognitive function called working memory, the brain's ability to internally hold and process information without sensory input. In the model, interregional connectivity is constrained by mesoscopic connectome data. The density of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in the model varies systematically across the cortex. We found that the long-range cell type-specific targeting and density of cell classes define working memory representations. A core cortical subnetwork and the thalamus produce distributed persistent activity, and the network exhibits numerous attractor states. Novel cell type-specific graph theory measures predicted the activity patterns and core subnetwork. This work highlights the need for cell type-specific connectomics, and provides a theory and tools to interpret large-scale recordings of brain activity during cognition.

                The spinal cord is of fundamental importance for somatosensory processing and plays a significant role in various pathologies, such as chronic pain. However, knowledge on spinal cord processing in humans is limited due to the vast technical challenges involved in its investigation via non-invasive recording approaches. Here, we aim to address these challenges by developing an electrophysiological approach -- based on a high-density electrode-montage -- that allows for characterizing spinal cord somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and combining this with concurrent recordings of the spinal cord's input (peripheral nerve action potentials) and output (SEPs in brainstem and cortex). In two separate experiments, we first methodologically validate the approach (including replication and robustness analyses) and then assess its application in the context of a neuroscientific question (integrative processes along the neural hierarchy). Critically, we demonstrate the benefits of multi-channel recordings in terms of enhancing sensitivity via spatial filtering, which also allows for obtaining spinal cord SEPs at the single-trial level. We make use of this approach to demonstrate the feasibility of recording spinal cord SEPs in low-signal scenarios (single-digit stimulation) and -- most importantly -- to provide evidence for bottom-up signal integration already at the level of the spinal cord. Taken together, our approach of concurrent multi-channel recordings of evoked responses along the neural hierarchy allows for a comprehensive assessment of the functional architecture of somatosensory processing at a millisecond timescale.

                In the hippocampus, lifelong neurogenesis is maintained by a pool of multipotent adult neural stem cells (aNSCs) residing in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus (DG). Yet, the mechanisms guiding the transition of NSCs from developmental to adult remain unclear. By using nestin-reporter mice deficient for D2, a cyclin expressed mainly postnatally, we show that the aNSC pool is established through D2-dependent proliferation during the first two weeks of life. The absence of D2 allows the normal development of the DG until birth but prevents the postnatal formation of radial glia-like aNSCs. Additionally, retroviral fate mapping demonstrates that aNSCs are born on-site from precursors located in the DG shortly after birth. Altogether, our data suggest that aNSCs are a population distinct from developmental NSCs and thus imply that adult hippocampal neurogenesis is not a mere continuation of development.

                High-density electrophysiology probes have opened new possibilities for systems neuroscience in human and non-human animals, but probe motion (or drift) while recording poses a challenge for downstream analyses, particularly in human recordings. Here, we improve on the state of the art for tracking this drift with an algorithm termed DREDge (Decentralized Registration of Electrophysiology Data) with four major contributions. First, we extend previous decentralized methods to exploit multiband information, leveraging the local field potential (LFP), in addition to spikes detected from the action potentials (AP). Second, we show that the LFP-based approach enables registration at sub-second temporal resolution. Third, we introduce an efficient online motion tracking algorithm, allowing the method to scale up to longer and higher spatial resolution recordings, which could facilitate real-time applications. Finally, we improve the robustness of the approach by accounting for the nonstationarities that occur in real data and by automating parameter selection. Together, these advances enable fully automated scalable registration of challenging datasets from both humans and mice.

                Dynamic functional organization by synchronization is theorized to be essential for dimension reduction of the cerebellar learning space. We analyzed a large amount of coordinate-localized, two-photon imaging data from cerebellar Crus II in mice undergoing Go/No-go reinforcement learning. Tensor component analysis revealed that a majority of climbing fiber inputs to Purkinje cells were reduced to only four functional components, corresponding to accurate timing control of motor initiation related to a Go cue, cognitive error-based learning, reward processing, and inhibition of erroneous behaviors after a No-go cue. Spatial distribution of these components coincided well with the boundaries of Aldolase-C/zebrin II expression in Purkinje cells, whereas several components are mixed in single neurons. Synchronization within individual components was bidirectionally regulated according to specific task contexts and learning stages. These findings suggest that the cerebellum, based on anatomical compartments, reduces dimensions by self-organization of components, a feature that may inspire new-generation AI designs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Older age is associated with a shift from ventral to dorsal PCC in pathways connecting the DMN with visual and limbic areas and a directionality shift in pathways connecting the DMN with sensorimotor areas</a></h4>

              
                Alterations in the default mode network (DMN) are known to associated with aging and with neurological and psychiatric diseases. We assessed age-dependent changes in interactions within the DMN and between the DMN with other brain areas, and correlations of these interactions with a battery of neuropsychological tests to formulate a macroscopic model of ageing. Using a novel multivariate analysis method, enabling determination of directed pathways, on resting-state functional MRI data from fifty young and thirty-one old healthy individuals, we identified directed intra- and inter-DMN directed pathways that differed between the groups and used their correlations with neuropsychological tests to infer their behavioral meaning. Pathways connecting the DMN with visual and limbic regions in old subjects engaged at BOLD low frequency and involved the dorsal PCC. In young subjects, they were at high frequency and involved the ventral PCC. Pathways combining the sensorimotor (SM) and the DMN, were efferent in young subjects (DMN<SM) and afferent in old subjects (DMN>SM). Most inter-DMN pathways in the old subjects, correlated with reduced speed and working memory and, were DMN efferent (DMN>). We suggest a macroscopic model of aging centered in the DMN. It suggests that the reduced sensorimotor efferent, probably brought about from reduced physical activity, and the increased need to control such activities by the mPFC, causes a higher dependency on external versus internal cues. This results in a shift from ventral to dorsal PCC of inter-DMN pathways. Consequently, the model combines physical activity with ageing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ketamines rapid antidepressant effects are mediated by Ca2+ - permeable AMPA receptors in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Ketamine is shown to enhance excitatory synaptic drive in the hippocampus, which is presumed to underlie its rapid antidepressant effects. Moreover, ketamines therapeutic actions are likely mediated by enhancing neuronal Ca2+ signaling. However, ketamine is a noncompetitive NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonist that inhibits excitatory synaptic transmission and postsynaptic Ca2+ signaling. Thus, it is a puzzling question how ketamine enhances glutamatergic and Ca2+ activity in neurons to induce rapid antidepressant effects while blocking NMDARs in the hippocampus. Here, we find that ketamine treatment for one hour in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons significantly reduces calcineurin activity to elevate AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunit GluA1 phosphorylation. This phosphorylation ultimately induces the expression of Ca2+ - permeable, GluA2-lacking, and GluA1-containing AMPARs (CP-AMPARs). Such ketamine-induced expression of CP-AMPARs enhances glutamatergic activity and synaptic plasticity in cultured hippocampal neurons. When a sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine is given to mice, it increases synaptic GluA1 levels, but not GluA2, and GluA1 phosphorylation in the hippocampus within one hour after treatment. These changes are likely mediated by ketamine-induced reduction of calcineurin activity in the hippocampus. Using the open field and tail suspension tests, we demonstrate that a low dose of ketamine rapidly reduces anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors in both male and female mice. However, when in vivo treatment of a CP-AMPAR antagonist abolishes the ketamines effects on animals behavior. We thus discover that ketamine at the low dose promotes the expression of CP-AMPARs via reduction of calcineurin activity in the hippocampus, which in turn enhances synaptic strength to induce rapid antidepressant actions.

                The dorsal (DS) and ventral striatum (VS) receive dopaminergic projections that control motor functions and reward-related behavior. It remains poorly understood how dopamine release dynamics across different temporal scales in these regions are coupled to behavioral outcomes. Here, we employ the dopamine sensor dLight1.3b together with multi-region fiber photometry and machine learning-based analysis to decode dopamine dynamics across striatum during selfpaced exploratory behavior in mice. Our data show a striking coordination of rapidly fluctuating signal in the DS, carrying information across dopamine levels, with a slower signal in the VS, consisting mainly of slow-paced transients. Importantly, these release dynamics correlated with discrete behavioral motifs, such as turns, running and grooming on a subsecond-to-minutes time scale. Disruption of dopamine dynamics with cocaine caused randomization of action selection sequencing and disturbance of DS-VS coordination. The data suggest that distinct dopamine dynamics of DS and VS jointly encode behavioral sequences during unconstrained activity with DS modulating the stringing together of actions and VS the signal to initiate and sustain the selected action.

                Microglia are heterogenous cells characterized by distinct populations each contributing to specific biological processes in the nervous system, including neuroprotection. To elucidate the impact of sex-specific microglia heterogenicity to the susceptibility of neuronal stress, we analysed the dynamic changes in shape and motility occurring in primary mouse microglia following pro-inflammatory or neurotoxic insults, thus finding sex-specific responses of microglial subpopulations. Male microglia exhibited a pro-inflammatory phenotype, whereas female microglia showed enhanced neuroprotective capabilities associated with the activation of Nrf2 detoxification pathway in neurons. The sex difference in neuroprotective functions is lost by inhibition of glucocerebrosidase, the product of the GBA1 gene, mutations of which are the major risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). This finding is consistent with the increased risk of PD observed in female carriers of GBA1 mutation, when compared with wild type population, suggesting a role for microglial functionality in the etiopathogenesis of PD-GBA1.

                Cortical neurons in primary sensory cortex carry not only sensory but also behavior-related information. However, it remains unclear how these types of information emerge and are integrated with one another over learning and what the relative contribution of activity in individual cells versus neuronal populations is in this process. Current evidence supports two opposing views of learning-related changes: 1) sensory information increases in primary cortex or 2) sensory information remains stable in primary cortex but its readout efficiency in association cortices increases. Here, we investigate these questions in primary sensory cortex during learning of a sensory task. Over the course of weeks, we imaged neuronal activity at different depths within layers 2 and 3 of the mouse vibrissal primary somatosensory cortex (vS1) before, during, and after training on a whisker-based object-localization task. We leveraged information theoretical analysis to quantify stimulus and behavior-related information in vS1 and estimate how much neural activity encoding sensory information is used to inform perceptual choices as sensory learning progresses. We also quantified the extent to which these types of information are supported by an individual neuron or population code. We found that, while sensory information rises progressively from the start of training, choice information is only present in the final stages of learning and is increasingly supported by a population code. Moreover, we demonstrate that not only the increase in available information, but also a more efficient readout of such information in primary sensory cortex mediate sensory learning. Together, our results highlight the importance of primary cortical neurons in perceptual learning.

                Sign-tracking (ST) describes the propensity to approach and contact a Pavlovian reward cue. By contrast, goal-trackers (GTs) respond to such a cue solely by retrieving the reward. These behaviors index the presence of opponent cognitive-motivational traits, with STs exhibiting attentional control deficits, behavior dominated by incentive motivational processes, and vulnerability for addictive drug taking. Attentional control deficits in STs were previously attributed to attenuated cholinergic signaling, resulting from deficient translocation of intracellular choline transporters (CHTs) into synaptosomal plasma membrane. Here we investigated a post-translational modification of CHTs (poly-ubiquitination), and tested the hypothesis that elevated cytokine signaling in STs contributes to CHT modification. We demonstrated that intracellular CHTs, but not plasma membrane CHTs, are highly ubiquitinated in male and female sign-tracking rats when compared with GTs. Moreover, levels of cytokines measured in two brain regions, but not spleen, were higher in STs than in GTs. Activation of the innate immune system by systemic administration of the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) elevated ubiquitinated CHT levels in cortex and striatum of GTs only, suggesting ceiling effects in STs. In spleen, LPS increased levels of most cytokines in both phenotypes. In cortex, LPS particularly robustly increased levels of the chemokines CCL2 and CXCL10. Phenotype-specific increases were restricted to GTs, again suggesting ceiling effects in STs. These results indicate that interactions between elevated brain immune modulator signaling and CHT regulation are essential components of the neuronal underpinnings of the addiction vulnerability trait indexed by sign-tracking.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Why is the perceptual octave stretched? An account based on mismatched time constants within the auditory brainstem.</a></h4>

              
                This paper suggests an explanation for listeners' greater tolerance to positive than negative mistuning of the higher tone within an octave pair. It hypothesizes a neural circuit tuned to cancel the lower tone, that also cancels the higher tone if that tone is in tune. Imperfect cancellation is the cue to mistuning of the octave. The circuit involves two neural pathways, one delayed with respect to the other, that feed a coincidence-sensitive neuron via excitatory and inhibitory synapses. A mismatch between the time constants of these two synapses results in an asymmetry in sensitivity to mismatch. Specifically, if the time constant of the delayed pathway is greater than that of the direct pathway, there is a greater tolerance to positive mistuning than to negative mistuning. The model is directly applicable to the harmonic octave (concurrent tones), but extending it to the melodic octave (successive tones) requires additional assumptions that are discussed. The paper reviews evidence from auditory psychophysics and physiology in favor - or against - this explanation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Unitary Mechanism Underlies Adaptation to Both Local and Global Environmental Statistics in Time Perception</a></h4>

              
                Our sense of the passage of time flexibly adapts to the statistical properties of the temporal context. Humans and non-human species exhibit a perceptual bias towards the mean of durations previously observed as well as serial dependence, a perceptual bias towards the duration of recently processed events. Here we asked whether those two phenomena arise from a unitary mechanism or reflect the operation of two distinct systems that adapt separately to the global and local statistics of the environment. We employed a set of duration reproduction tasks in which the target duration was sampled from distributions with different variances and means. The central tendency and serial dependence biases were jointly modulated by the range and the variance of the prior, and these effects were well-captured by a unitary mechanism model in which temporal expectancies are updated after each trial based on perceptual observations. Alternative models that assume separate mechanisms for global and local contextual effects failed to capture the empirical results.

                The visual signal processing in the retina requires the precise organization of diverse neuronal types working in concert. We performed spatial transcriptomic profiling of over 100,000 cells from the mouse retia, uncovering the spatial distribution of all major retina cell types with over 100 cell subtypes. Our data revealed that the retina is organized in a laminar structure at the major cell type and subgroup level, both of which has strong correlation with the birth order of the cell. In contrast, overall random dispersion of cells within sub-laminar layers indicates that retinal mosaics are driven by dendritic field patterning rather than neuron soma placement. Through the integration of single cell transcriptomic and spatial data, we have generated the first comprehensive spatial single cell reference atlas of the mouse retina, a resource to the community and an essential step toward gaining a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of retinal function.

                Long-lasting pain stimuli can trigger maladaptive changes in the spinal cord, reminiscent of plasticity associated with memory formation. Metabolic coupling between astrocytes and neurons has been implicated in neuronal plasticity and memory formation in the CNS, but neither its involvement in pathological pain nor in spinal plasticity has been tested. Here, we report a novel form of neuroglia signaling involving spinal astrocytic glycogen dynamics triggered by persistent noxious stimulation via upregulation of the metabolic signaling molecule PTG exclusively in spinal astrocytes. PTG drove glycogen build-up in astrocytes, and blunting glycogen accumulation and turnover by Ptg gene deletion reduced pain-related behaviors and promoted faster recovery by shortening pain maintenance. Furthermore, mechanistic analyses revealed that glycogen dynamics is a critically required process for maintenance of pain by facilitating neuronal plasticity in spinal lamina 1 neurons. Finally, metabolic analysis indicated that glycolysis and lactate transfer between astrocytes and neurons fuels spinal neuron hyperexcitability. Spinal glycogen-metabolic cascades therefore hold therapeutic potential to alleviate pathological pain.

                N-terminal phosphorylation at residues T3 and S13 is believed to have important beneficial implications for the biological and pathological properties of mutant huntingtin, where IKBKB was identified as a candidate regulator of huntingtin N-terminal phosphorylation. The paucity of mechanistic information on IKK pathways, together with the lack of sensitive methods to quantify endogenous huntingtin phosphorylation, prevented detailed study of the role of IKBKB in Huntington's disease. Using novel ultrasensitive assays, we demonstrate that IKBKB can regulate endogenous S13 huntingtin phosphorylation in a manner dependent on its kinase activity and known regulators. We found that the ability of IKBKB to phosphorylate endogenous huntingtin S13 is mediated through a non-canonical IRF3-mediated IKK-pathway, distinct from the established involvement of IKBKB in mutant huntingtin's pathological mechanisms mediated via the canonical pathway. Furthermore, increased huntingtin S13 phosphorylation by IKBKB resulted in decreased aggregation of mutant huntingtin in cells, again dependent on its kinase activity. These findings point to a non-canonical IKK-pathway linking S13 huntingtin phosphorylation to the pathological properties of mutant huntingtin aggregation, thought to be significant to Huntington's disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain activation by a VR-based motor imagery andobservation task: An fMRI study</a></h4>

              
                Training motor imagery (MI) and motor observation (MO) tasks is being intensively exploited to promote brain plasticity in the context of post-stroke rehabilitation strategies. The desired brain plasticity mechanisms may benefit from the use of closed-loop neurofeedback, embedded in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) to provide an alternative non-muscular channel. These can be further augmented through embodied feedback delivered through virtual reality (VR). Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map brain activation elicited by a VR-based MI-MO BCI task called NeuRow and compared with a conventional non-VR, and MI-only, task based on the Graz BCI paradigm. We found that, in healthy adults, NeuRow elicits stronger brain activation when compared to the Graz task, as well as to an overt motor execution task, recruiting large portions of the parietal and occipital cortices in addition to the motor and premotor cortices. In particular, NeuRow activates the mirror neuron system (MNS), associated with action observation, as well as visual areas related with visual attention and motion processing. We studied a cohort of healthy adults including younger and older subgroups, and found no significant age-related effects in the measured brain activity. Overall, our findings suggest that the virtual representation of the arms in a bimanual MI-MO task engage the brain beyond conventional MI tasks, even in older adults, which we propose could be explored for effective neurorehabilitation protocols.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spontaneous and multifaceted ATP release from astrocytes at the scale of hundreds of synapses</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes participate in information processing by releasing neuroactive substances termed gliotransmitters, including ATP. Individual astrocytes come into contact with thousands of synapses with their ramified structure, but the spatiotemporal dynamics of ATP gliotransmission remain unclear, especially in physiological brain tissue. Using a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor, GRABATP1.0, we discovered that extracellular ATP increased locally and transiently in absence of stimuli in neuron-glia co-cultures, cortical slices, and the anesthetized mouse brain. Spontaneous ATP release events were tetrodotoxin-insensitive but suppressed by gliotoxin, fluorocitrate, and typically spread over 50--250 {micro}m2 area at concentrations capable of activating purinergic receptors. Besides, most ATP events did not coincide with Ca2+ transients. Clustering analysis revealed that these events followed multiple distinct kinetics, and blockade of exocytosis only decreased a minor group of slow events. Overall, astrocytes spontaneously release ATP through multiple mechanisms, mainly in non-vesicular and Ca2+-independent manners, thus potentially regulating hundreds of synapses all together.

                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis type 6 (ALS6) is a familial subtype of ALS linked to Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) gene mutation. FUS mutations lead to decreased global protein synthesis, but the mechanism that drives this has not been established. Here, we used ALS6 patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSCs) to study the effect of the ALS6 FUSR521H mutation on the translation machinery in motor neurons (MNs). We find, in agreement with findings of others, that protein synthesis is decreased in ALS6 MNs. Furthermore, ALS6 MNs are more sensitive to oxidative stress and display reduced expression of TGF-{beta} and mTORC gene pathways when stressed. Finally, we show that IFN{gamma} treatment reduces apoptosis of ALS6 MNs exposed to oxidative stress and partially restores the translation rates in ALS6 MNs. Overall, these findings suggest that a functional IFN{gamma} response is important for FUS-mediated protein synthesis, possibly by FUS nuclear translocation in ALS6.

                Mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene are the second most common known cause of ALS. SOD1 variants express high phenotypic variability and over 200 have been reported in people with ALS. Investigating how different SOD1 variants affect the protein dynamics might help in understanding their pathogenic mechanism and explaining their heterogeneous clinical presentation. It was previously proposed that variants can be broadly classified in two groups, "wild-type like" (WTL) and "metal binding region" (MBR) variants, based on their structural location and biophysical properties. MBR variants are associated with a loss of SOD1 enzymatic activity. In this study we used molecular dynamics and large clinical datasets to characterise the differences in the structural and dynamic behaviour of WTL and MBR variants with respect to the wild-type SOD1, and how such differences influence the ALS clinical phenotype. Our study identified marked structural differences, some of which are observed in both variant groups, while others are group specific. Moreover, applying graph theory to a network representation of the proteins, we identified differences in the intramolecular contacts of the two classes of variants. Finally, collecting clinical data of approximately 500 SOD1 ALS patients carrying variants from both classes, we showed that the survival time of patients carrying an MBR variant is generally longer (~6 years median difference, p < 0.001) with respect to patients with a WTL variant. In conclusion, our study highlights key differences in the dynamic behaviour of the WTL and MBR SOD1 variants, and wild-type SOD1 at an atomic and molecular level. We identified interesting structural features that could be further investigated to explain the associated phenotypic variability. Our results support the hypothesis of a decoupling between mechanisms of onset and progression of SOD1 ALS, and an involvement of loss-of-function of SOD1 with the disease progression.

                Auditory perception can benefit from stimuli in non-auditory sensory modalities, as for example in lip-reading. Compared with such visual influences, tactile influences are still poorly understood. It has been shown that single tactile pulses can enhance the perception of auditory stimuli depending on their relative timing, but whether and how such brief auditory enhancements can be stretched in time with more sustained, phase-specific periodic tactile stimulation is still unclear. To address this question, we presented tactile stimulation that fluctuated coherently and continuously at 4Hz with an auditory noise (either in-phase or anti-phase) and assessed its effect on the cortical processing and perception of an auditory signal embedded in that noise. Scalp-electroencephalography recordings revealed an enhancing effect of in-phase tactile stimulation on cortical responses phase-locked to the noise and a suppressive effect of anti-phase tactile stimulation on responses evoked by the auditory signal. Although these effects appeared to follow well-known principles of multisensory integration of discrete audio-tactile events, they were not accompanied by corresponding effects on behavioral measures of auditory signal perception. Our results indicate that continuous periodic tactile stimulation can enhance cortical processing of acoustically-induced fluctuations and mask cortical responses to an ongoing auditory signal. They further suggest that such sustained cortical effects can be insufficient for inducing sustained bottom-up auditory benefits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Long-term effects of THC exposure on reward learning and motivated behavior in adolescent and adult male rats</a></h4>

              
                Rationale: The endocannabinoid system makes critical contributions to reward processing, motivation, and behavioral control. Repeated exposure to THC or other cannabinoid drugs can cause persistent adaptions in the endocannabinoid system and associated neural circuitry. It remains unclear how such treatments affect the way rewards are processed and pursued. Objective and methods: We examined if repeated THC exposure (5 mg/kg/day for 14 days) during adolescence or adulthood led to long-term changes in rats' capacity to flexibly encode and use action-outcome associations for goal-directed decision making. Effects on hedonic feeding and progressive ratio responding were also assessed. Results: THC exposure had no effect on rats' ability to flexibly select actions following reward devaluation. However, instrumental contingency degradation learning, which involves avoiding an action that is unnecessary for reward delivery, was augmented in rats with a history of adult but not adolescent THC exposure. THC-exposed rats also displayed more vigorous instrumental behavior in this study, suggesting a motivational enhancement. A separate experiment found that while THC exposure had no effect on hedonic feeding behavior, it increased rats' willingness to work for food on a progressive ratio schedule, an effect that was more pronounced when THC was administered to adults. Adolescent and adult THC exposure had opposing effects on the CB1-receptor dependence of progressive ratio performance, decreasing and increasing sensitivity to rimonabant-induced behavioral suppression, respectively. Conclusions: Our findings reveal that exposure to a translationally relevant THC exposure regimen induces long-lasting, age-dependent alterations in cognitive and motivational processes that regulate the pursuit of rewards.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prior expectation enhances sensorimotor behavior by modulating population tuning and subspace activity in the sensory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Prior knowledge facilitates our perception and goal-directed behaviors in the dynamic world, particularly when sensory input is lacking or noisy. However, the neural mechanisms underlying how prior expectation improves sensory-motor behaviors remain unknown. Herein, we examined neural activity in the middle temporal visual area (MT) while monkeys perform a smooth pursuit eye movement task with the prior expectation of the visual target's motion direction. We found that prior expectation discriminately reduced the MT neural responses depending on their preferred directions, only when the sensory evidence was weak. This response reduction effectively sharpens neural population direction tuning. Furthermore, the state-space analysis showed the task-specific prior expectation signals in population activity. In-silico simulations with a realistic MT population demonstrated that the sharpening of the tuning fully explained the biases and variabilities in smooth pursuit, suggesting neural computations in the sensory area alone can underpin the integration of prior knowledge and sensory evidence.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Microdissection and culturing of adult lateral entorhinal cortex layer II neurons from APP/PS1 Alzheimer model mice</a></h4>

              
                Background: Primary neuronal cultures enable cell-biological studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD), albeit typically non-neuron-specific. The first cortical neurons affected in AD reside in layer II of the lateralmost part of the entorhinal cortex, and they undergo early accumulation of intracellular amyloid-{beta}, form subsequent tau pathology, and start degenerating pre-symptomatically. These vulnerable entorhinal neurons uniquely express the glycoprotein reelin and provide selective inputs to the hippocampal memory system. Gaining a more direct access to study these neurons is therefore highly relevant. New method: We demonstrate a methodological approach for microdissection and long-term culturing of adult lateral entorhinal layer II-neurons from AD-model mice. Results: We maintain adult microdissected lateralmost entorhinal layer II-neurons beyond two months in culture. We show that they express neuronal markers, and that they are electrophysiologically active by 15 days in vitro and continuing beyond 2 months. Comparison with existing methods: Primary neurons are typically harvested from embryonic or early postnatal brains because such neurons are easier to culture compared to adult neurons. Methods to culture adult primary neurons have been reported, however, to our knowledge, culturing of adult entorhinal subregion-specific primary neurons from AD-model animals has not been reported. Conclusions: Our methodological approach offers a window to study initial pathological changes in the AD disease-cascade. This includes the study of proteinopathy, single-neuron changes, and network-level dysfunction.

                Background: Widescale evidence points to the involvement of glia and immune pathways in the progression of Alzheimers disease (AD). AD-associated iPSC-derived glial cells show a diverse range of AD-related phenotypic states encompassing cytokine/chemokine release, phagocytosis and morphological profiles, but to date studies are limited to cells derived from PSEN1, APOE and APP mutations or sporadic patients. The aim of the current study was to successfully differentiate iPSC-derived microglia and astrocytes from patients harbouring an AD-causative PSEN2 (N141I) mutation and characterise the inflammatory and morphological profile of these cells. Methods: iPSCs from three healthy control individuals and three familial AD patients harbouring a heterozygous PSEN2 (N141I) mutation were used to derive astrocytes and microglia-like cells and cell identity and morphology were characterised through immunofluorescent microscopy. Cellular characterisation involved the stimulation of these cells by LPS and A{beta}42 and analysis of cytokine/chemokine release was conducted through ELISAs and multi-cytokine arrays. The phagocytic capacity of these cells was then indexed by the uptake of fluorescently labelled fibrillar A{beta}42. Results: AD-derived astrocytes and microglia-like cells exhibited an atrophied and less complex morphological appearance than healthy controls. AD-derived astrocytes showed increased basal expression of GFAP, S100{beta} ; and increased secretion and phagocytosis of A{beta}42 while AD-derived microglia-like cells showed decreased IL-8 secretion compared to healthy controls. Upon immunological challenge AD-derived astrocytes and microglia-like cells show exaggerated secretion of the pro-inflammatory IL-6, CXCL1, ICAM-1 and IL-8 from astrocytes and IL-18 and MIF from microglia. Conclusion: Our study showed, for the first time, the differentiation and characterisation of iPSC-derived astrocytes and microglia-like cells harbouring a PSEN2 (N141I) mutation. PSEN2 (N141I)-mutant astrocytes and microglia-like cells presented with a primed phenotype characterised by reduced morphological complexity, exaggerated pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and altered A{beta}42 production and phagocytosis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Elucidation of Amyloid-Beta's Gambit in Oligomerisation:Truncated Aβ fragments of residues Aβ1-23, Aβ1-24 and Aβ1-25 rapidly seed to form SDS-stable, low molecular weight Aβ oligomers that impair synaptic plasticity.</a></h4>

              
                In Alzheimer's disease (AD), Amyloid-beta (A{beta}) oligomers are considered an appealing therapeutic- and diagnostic target. However, to date, the molecular mechanisms associated with the pathological accumulation or structure of A{beta} oligomers remains an enigma to the scientific community. Here we demonstrate the strong seeding properties of unique A{beta} fragment signatures and show that the truncated A{beta}peptides of residues A{beta}1-23, A{beta}1-24 and A{beta}1-25, rapidly seed to form small, SDS-PAGE stable assemblies of ~5kDa to ~14kDa molecular mass range. Mass spectrometry analysis of SDS-PAGE fractionated and gel extracted oligomers revealed that the truncated A{beta} isoforms of residues 1-23 to 1-25 form stable entities with low molecular weight (LMW) oligomers, which strongly resemble the regularly reported A{beta} entities of putative dimeric or trimeric assemblies found in human post-mortem AD and Tg mouse brain extracts. Furthermore, electrophysiological recordings in the mouse hippocampus indicate that LMW A{beta} assemblies formed by fragments A{beta}1-23 to A{beta}1-25 significantly impair long-term-potentiation (LTP) in the absence of full-length A{beta}1-42. Extensive antibody screening highlights the important observation, that the LMW A{beta} assemblies formed by these truncated A{beta} peptides escape immuno-detection using conventional, conformation specific antibodies but, more importantly, the clinical antibody aducanumab. Our novel findings suggest that there are new A{beta} target loopholes which can be exploited for the development of therapeutic antibodies with binding properties against stable target hotspots present in A{beta} oligomers. We provide here a first example of a new class of monoclonal antibody with unique binding properties against LMW A{beta} oligomers, in the absence of binding to large fibrillar A{beta} assemblies, or dense amyloid plaques. Our research supports a novel, unparalleled approach for targeting early, pathological A{beta} species during the insidious phase of AD and prior to the appearance of large oligomeric or protofibrilar assemblies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A scoping review on the use of consumer-grade EEG devices for research</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND: Commercial electroencephalography (EEG) devices have become increasingly available over the last decade. These devices have been used in a wide variety of fields ranging from engineering to cognitive neuroscience. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to chart peer-review articles that used currently available consumer-grade EEG devices to collect neural data. We provide an overview of the research conducted with these relatively more affordable and user-friendly devices. We also inform future research by exploring the current and potential scope of consumer-grade EEG. METHODS: We followed a five-stage methodological framework for a scoping review that included a systematic search using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. We searched the following electronic databases: PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore. We charted study data according to application (BCI, experimental research, validation, signal processing, and clinical) and location of use as indexed by the first author's country. RESULTS: We identified 916 studies that used data recorded with consumer-grade EEG: 531 were reported in journal articles and 385 in conference papers. Emotiv devices were most used, followed by the NeuroSky MindWave, OpenBCI, interaXon Muse, and MyndPlay Mindband. The most common use was for brain-computer interfaces, followed by experimental research, signal processing, validation, and clinical purposes. CONCLUSIONS: Consumer-grade EEG has proven to be a useful tool for neuroscientific research and will likely continue to be used well into the future. Our study provides a comprehensive review of their application, as well as future directions for researchers who wish to use these devices.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">EEG is better left alone</a></h4>

              
                Automated preprocessing methods are critically needed to process the large publicly-available EEG databases, but the optimal approach remains unknown because we lack data quality metrics to compare them. Here, we designed a simple yet robust EEG data quality metric assessing the percentage of significant channels between two experimental conditions within a 100 ms post-stimulus time range. Because of volume conduction in EEG, given no noise, most brain-evoked related potentials (ERP) should be visible on every single channel. Using three publicly available collections of EEG data, we showed that, with the exceptions of high-pass filtering and bad channel interpolation, automated data corrections had no effect on or significantly decreased the percentage of significant channels. Referencing and advanced baseline removal methods were significantly detrimental to performance. Rejecting bad data segments or trials could not compensate for the loss in statistical power. Automated Independent Component Analysis rejection of eyes and muscles failed to increase performance reliably. We compared optimized pipelines for preprocessing EEG data maximizing ERP significance using the leading open-source EEG software: EEGLAB, FieldTrip, MNE, and Brainstorm. Only one pipeline performed significantly better than high-pass filtering the data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cell-surface targeting of fluorophores in Drosophila for rapid neuroanatomy visualization</a></h4>

              
                Visualizing neuronal anatomy often requires labor-intensive immunohistochemistry on fixed and dissected brains. To facilitate rapid anatomical staining in live brains, we used genetically targeted membrane tethers that covalently link fluorescent dyes for in vivo neuronal labeling. We generated a series of extracellularly trafficked small molecule tethering proteins, HaloTag-CD41 and SNAPf-CD4, which directly label transgene expressing cells with commercially available ligand substituted fluorescent dyes. We created stable transgenic Drosophila reporter lines which express extracellular HaloTag-CD4 and SNAPf-CD4 with LexA and Gal4 drivers. Expressing these enzymes in live Drosophila brains, we labeled the expression patterns of various Gal4 driver lines recapitulating histological staining in live brain tissue. Pan-neural expression of SNAPf-CD4 enabled registration of live brains to an existing template for anatomical comparisons. We predict that these extracellular platforms will not only become a valuable complement to existing anatomical methods but will also prove useful for future genetic targeting of other small molecule probes, drugs, and actuators.

	<p>The aim of this article was to present an important perspective on reading skill development. The perspective &amp;amp;lsquo;READ&amp;amp;rsquo; builds on the phonics approach which has been found to be most important in relation to reading achievement i.e., to teach children to break the reading code. In addition, READ builds on theories within learning and skill development. The Ericsson concept of &amp;amp;lsquo;deliberate practice&amp;amp;rsquo; refer to baseline measurements that provide a basis for follow-up and deliberate practice. The concept of &amp;amp;lsquo;flow&amp;amp;rsquo; is also of great importance where challenges are always in relation to the skills. It means that each child will be able to experience &amp;amp;lsquo;flow&amp;amp;rsquo; where mastery is the key word, feeling I CAN! When mastery is experienced, the dopamine hormone gives the feeling of reward. Stimuli, experience, and repetition is also a key word in the &amp;amp;lsquo;training hour&amp;amp;rsquo; where children get the possibility to strengthen the neural network that is used for specific skills which are trained. In this respect, the letter-sound knowledge is trained until the child has broken the reading code. The results from the first year in the school in Vestmannaeyjar in Iceland indicates that all the children were able to break the reading code or read simple words. In addition, 96% of the children were able to read sentences, and 88% where able to read text. These promising results are discussed in relation to Ericsson&amp;amp;rsquo;s and Csikszentmihalyi&amp;amp;rsquo;s important theories.</p>

	<p>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to have the potential to improve the motor recovery of the affected upper limbs in patients with stroke, and recently, several optimized tDCS methods have been proposed to magnify its effectiveness. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of personalized tDCS using brain MRI-based electrical field simulation and optimization, to enhance motor recovery of the upper limbs in the patients. This trial is a double-blind, randomized controlled trial in the subacute to chronic rehabilitation phase. Forty-two adult stroke patients with unilateral upper limb involvement will be randomly allocated to three groups: (1) personalized tDCS with MRI-based electrical field simulation and optimized stimulation, (2) conventional tDCS with bihemispheric stimulation of the primary motor cortex, and (3) sham tDCS. All three groups will undergo 10 intervention sessions with 30 min of 2-mA intensity stimulation, during a regular upper limb rehabilitation program over two weeks. The primary outcome measure for the motor recovery of the upper limb impairment is the Fugl&amp;amp;ndash;Meyer assessment for the upper extremity score at the end of the intervention, and the secondary measures include changes in the motor evoked potentials, the frequency power and coherence of the electroencephalography, performance in activities of daily living, and adverse events with a 1-month follow-up assessment. The primary outcome will be analyzed on the intention-to-treat principle. There is a paucity of studies regarding the effectiveness of personalized and optimized tDCS that considers individual brain lesions and electrical field characteristics in the real world. No feasibility or pivotal studies have been performed in stroke patients using brain MRI, to determine a lesion-specific tDCS simulation and optimization that considers obstacles in the segmentation and analysis of the affected brain tissue, such as ischemic and hemorrhagic lesions. This trial will contribute to addressing the effectiveness and safety of personalized tDCS, using brain MRI-based electrical field simulation and optimization, to enhance the motor recovery of the upper limbs in patients with stroke.</p>

	<p>Epilepsy is the second most common disease of the nervous system. Because of its high disability rate and the long course of the disease, it is a worldwide medical problem and social public health problem. Therefore, the timely detection and treatment of epilepsy are very important. Currently, medical professionals use their own diagnostic experience to identify seizures by visual inspection of the electroencephalogram (EEG). Not only does it require a lot of time and effort, but the process is also very cumbersome. Machine learning-based methods have recently been proposed for epilepsy detection, which can help clinicians make rapid and correct diagnoses. However, these methods often require extracting the features of EEG signals before using the data. In addition, the selection of features often requires domain knowledge, and feature types also have a significant impact on the performance of the classifier. In this paper, a one-dimensional depthwise separable convolutional neural network and long short-term memory networks (1D DSCNN-LSTMs) model is proposed to identify epileptic seizures by autonomously extracting the features of raw EEG. On the UCI dataset, the performance of the proposed 1D DSCNN-LSTMs model is verified by cross-validation and time complexity comparison. Compared with other previous models, the experimental results show that the highest recognition rates of binary and quintuple classification are 99.57% and 81.30%, respectively. It can be concluded that the 1D DSCNN-LSTMs model proposed in this paper is an effective method to identify seizures based on EEG signals.</p>

	<p>The animal thromboembolic model of ischemia perfectly mimics human ischemic stroke which remains the leading cause of disability and mortality in humans. The development of new treatment strategies was therefore imperative. The purpose of this study is to improve the thromboembolic stroke model in rats in order to design experiments that use motor tests, and are in accordance with the 3R principles to prevent complications and maintain the same size of the infarct repeatedly. Tail vein dye application, a protective skull mask and a stress minimization protocol were used as additional modifications to the animal stroke model. These modifications significantly minimized the pain and stress severity of the procedures in this model. In our experimental group of Long-Evans rats, a photo-induced stroke was caused by the application of a photosensitive dye (Rose Bengal) activated with white-light irradiation, thus eliminating the need to perform a craniotomy. The animals&amp;amp;rsquo; neurological status was evaluated using a runway elevated test. Histological examination of the brain tissue was performed at 12, 24 and 48 h, and seven days post-stroke. Tissue examination revealed necrotic foci in the cortex and the subcortical regions of the ipsilateral hemisphere in all experimental groups. Changes in the area, width and depth of the necrotic focus were observed over time. All the experimental groups showed motor disturbances after stroke survival. In the proposed model, photochemically-induced stroke caused long-term motor deficits, showed high reproducibility and low mortality rates. Consequently, the animals could participate in motor tests which are particularly suitable for assessing the efficacy of neuro-regenerative therapies, while remaining in line with the latest trends in animal experimental design.</p>

     alt="Bulbar projecting subcortical GABAergic neurons send collateral branches extensively and selectively to primary olfactory cortical regions"/>
<p>Olfactory bulb projecting subcortical GABAergic neurons arising from the horizontal diagonal band also send collateral branches extensively to primary olfactory cortical regions. Thus, bulbar GABAergic projections may simultaneously modulate bulb and primary olfactory cortex through these extensive collateral branches.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Circuit operations of the olfactory bulb are modulated by higher order projections from multiple regions, many of which are themselves targets of bulbar output. Multiple glutamatergic regions project to the olfactory bulb, including the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON), prefrontal cortex (PFC), piriform cortex (PC), entorhinal cortex (EC), and tenia tecta (TT). In contrast, only one region provides GABAergic projections to the bulb. These GABA neurons are located in the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca extending posteriorly through the magnocellular preoptic nucleus to the nucleus of the lateral olfactory bulb. However, it was unclear whether bulbar projecting GABAergic neurons collaterallize projecting to other brain regions. To address this, we mapped collateral projections from bulbar projecting GABAergic neurons using intersectional strategies of viral and traditional tract tracers. This approach revealed bulbar projecting GABAergic neurons show remarkable specificity targeting other primary olfactory cortical regions exhibiting abundant collateral projections into the accessory olfactory bulb, AON, PFC, PC, and TT. The only "nonolfactory" region receiving collateral projections was sparse connectivity to the medial prefrontal orbital cortex. This suggests that basal forebrain inhibitory feedback also modulates glutamatergic feedback areas that are themselves prominent bulbar projection regions. Thus, inhibitory feedback may be simultaneously modulating both synaptic processing of olfactory information in the bulb and associational processing of olfactory information from primary olfactory cortex. We hypothesize that these olfactory GABAergic feedback neurons are a regulator of the entire olfactory system.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A circuit from the locus coeruleus to the anterior cingulate cortex modulates offspring interactions in mice</a></h4>

              
                Social sensitivity to other individuals in distress is crucial for survival. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a structure involved in making behavioral choices and is influenced by observed pain or distress. Nevertheless, our understanding of the neural circuitry underlying this sensitivity is incomplete. Here, we reveal unexpected sex-dependent activation of ACC when parental mice respond to distressed pups by returning them to the nest ('pup retrieval'). We observe sex differences in the interactions between excitatory and inhibitory ACC neurons during parental care, and inactivation of ACC excitatory neurons increased pup neglect. Locus coeruleus (LC) releases noradrenaline in ACC during pup retrieval, and inactivation of the LC-ACC pathway disrupts parental care. We conclude that ACC maintains sex-dependent sensitivity to pup distress under LC modulation. We propose that ACC's involvement in parenting presents an opportunity to identify neural circuits that support sensitivity to the emotional distress of others.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Integrated proteomics reveals the landscape of autophagy degradation in human neurons and autophagy receptors regulating neuronal activity</a></h4>

              
                Autophagy is a catabolic and self-degradative process crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Malfunctional autophagy is implicated in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the exact role and targets of autophagy in human neurons remain elusive. Here we reported a systematic investigation of neuronal autophagy targets through integrated proteomics. Deep proteomic profiling of multiple autophagy-deficient lines of human induced neurons, mouse brains, and LC3-interactome uncovers a role of neuronal autophagy in targeting primarily endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, endosome, Golgi apparatus, synaptic vesicle (SV) proteins, and cAMP-PKA pathway, for degradation. Tubular ER and specific SV proteins are significant autophagy cargos in the axons. Functional validation identified calumenin as an ER resident autophagy receptor and illuminated a role of autophagy in regulating PKA and neuronal activity through AKAP11-mediated degradation. Our study thus reveals the landscape of autophagy degradation in human neurons and offers molecular insight into mechanisms of neurological disorders linked to autophagy deficiency.

	<p>Recent scientific evidence supports the idea that foot plantar stimulation increases the functional connectivity of brain regions involved in visuo-spatial and sensory-motor integration. In this before&amp;amp;ndash;after, non-randomised intervention study we assessed the change in several gait and postural parameters using inertial sensor measurements after acute plantar stimulation using custom 3D-printed insoles. The pilot study was performed on 22 institutionalised, older individuals with a high comorbidity burden who either walked autonomously or with the help of a cane. The intensity of the effects in the first mechanical plantar stimulation session (at one week) strongly predicted a change in the 180&amp;amp;deg; turn duration (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) and the standard deviation of the step duration (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) during the timed up-and-go test. Based on these effects, researchers also predicted decreases in some postural parameters such as the root mean square of displacement on the anterior&amp;amp;ndash;posterior axis (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Thus, these preliminary findings provide a strong rationale for performing controlled clinical trials with larger samples to investigate the efficacy and mechanisms of mechanical plantar stimulation in frail elderly individuals.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to explore changes in the white matter microstructure in herpes zoster (HZ) and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) patients and to estimate the correlation of these changes with clinical data. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were collected from 33 HZ patients, 32 PHN patients, and 35 well-matched healthy controls (HCs). Subsequently, these data were analyzed by automated fiber quantification (AFQ) to accurately locate alterations in the white matter microstructure. Compared with HCs, HZ and PHN patients both showed a wide range of changes in the diffusion properties of fiber tracts. HZ patients exhibited changes primarily in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), whereas PHN patients predominantly exhibited changes in the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. The bilateral SLF and the left corticospinal tract were altered in the PHN patients compared with HZ patients. In addition, PHN patients showed a trend toward more expansive white matter alterations compared with those observed in HZ patients; additionally, in PHN patients, changes in the left cingulum cingulate were significantly correlated with changes in emotion and the duration of disease. These findings may help to elucidate the transformation from HZ to PHN and provide new ideas regarding the reasons for intractable neuropathic pain in PHN.</p>

	<p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a key modulator of neuroplasticity and has an important role in determining the susceptibility to severe psychiatric disorder with a significant neurodevelopmental component such as major psychoses. Indeed, a potential association between BDNF serum levels and schizophrenia (SCZ) and schizoaffective disorder (SAD) has been tested in diverse studies and a considerable amount of them found reduced BDNF levels in these disorders. Here, we aimed at testing the association of BDNF serum levels with several demographic, clinical, and psychometric measures in 105 patients with SCZ and SAD, assessing the moderating effect of genetic variants within the BDNF gene. We also verified whether peripheral BDNF levels differed between patients with SCZ and SAD. Our findings revealed that BDNF serum levels are significantly lower in patients affected by SCZ and SAD presenting more severe depressive symptomatology. This finding awaits replication in future independent studies and points to BDNF as a possible prognostic indicator in major psychoses.</p>

	<p>Alcohol is one of the most commonly used illicit substances among pregnant women. Clinical and experimental studies have revealed that prenatal alcohol exposure affects fetal brain development and ultimately results in the persistent impairment of the offspring&amp;amp;rsquo;s cognitive functions. Despite this, the rate of alcohol use among pregnant women has been progressively increasing. Various aspects of human and animal behavior, including learning and memory, are dependent on complex interactions between multiple mechanisms, such as receptor function, mitochondrial function, and protein kinase activation, which are especially vulnerable to alterations during the developmental period. Thus, the exploration of the mechanisms that are altered in response to prenatal alcohol exposure is necessary to develop an understanding of how homeostatic imbalance and various long-term neurobehavioral impairments manifest following alcohol abuse during pregnancy. There is evidence that prenatal alcohol exposure results in vast alterations in mechanisms such as long-term potentiation, mitochondrial function, and protein kinase activation in the brain of offspring. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are very few recent reviews that focus on the cognitive effects of prenatal alcohol exposure and the associated mechanisms. Therefore, in this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive summary of the recently reported alterations to various mechanisms following alcohol exposure during pregnancy, and to draw potential associations with behavioral changes in affected offspring.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Emerging mitochondrial‐mediated mechanisms involved in oligodendrocyte development</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating glia of the central nervous system and are generated after oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) transition into pre-oligodendrocytes and then into myelinating oligodendrocytes. Myelin is essential for proper signal transmission within the nervous system and axonal metabolic support. Although the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that support the differentiation, survival, integration, and subsequent myelination of appropriate axons have been well investigated, little is known about how mitochondria-related pathways such as mitochondrial dynamics, bioenergetics, and apoptosis finely tune these developmental events. Previous findings suggest that changes to mitochondrial morphology act as an upstream regulatory mechanism of neural stem cell (NSC) fate decisions. Whether a similar mechanism is engaged during OPC differentiation has yet to be elucidated. Maintenance of mitochondrial dynamics is vital for regulating cellular bioenergetics, functional mitochondrial networks, and the ability of cells to distribute mitochondria to subcellular locations, such as the growing processes of oligodendrocytes. Myelination is an energy-consuming event, thus, understanding the interplay between mitochondrial dynamics, metabolism, and apoptosis will provide further insight into mechanisms that mediate oligodendrocyte development in healthy and disease states. Here we will provide a concise overview of oligodendrocyte development and discuss the potential contribution of mitochondrial mitochondrial-mediated mechanisms to oligodendrocyte bioenergetics and development.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Task Demands Differentiate Regional Depth-Dependent Activity Profiles Within the Ventral Visual Pathway</a></h4>

              
                FMRI has become a key tool for human neuroscience. At ultra-high field (=> 7 Tesla) it is possible to acquire images with submillimeter spatial precision, which allows examinations of mesoscale functional organization. Studying the brain at this scale does not come without its challenges, however. To tackle some of these challenges, we propose an approach that builds upon task modulations to identical visual stimuli and the simultaneous imaging of distal areas of varying complexity across the cortical hierarchy. Specifically, we record BOLD responses elicited by face stimuli during a stimulus relevant and a stimulus irrelevant task across cortical depths in V1, Occipital Face (OFA) and Fusiform Face area (FFA). We observed that task-related top-down modulations were larger in the inner compared to the outer layers of V1; and in the outer compared to the inner layers in the FFA. Our findings are consistent with animal reports of feedback exchange between deeper and superficial layers and with the notion of apical dendritic amplification as a key mechanism of conscious perception. Our approach showcases the potential of laminar-fMRI to explore large scale network activity and represents a promising step towards characterizing laminar functional profiles in humans for complex, cognitively meaningful, and socially relevant stimuli such as faces.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evaluating methods for measuring background connectivity in slow event-related functional MRI designs</a></h4>

              
                Resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) is widely used for measuring functional interactions between brain regions, significantly contributing to our understanding of large-scale brain networks and brain-behavior relationships. Furthermore, idiosyncratic patterns of resting-state connections can be leveraged to identify individuals and predict individual differences in clinical symptoms, cognitive abilities, and other individual factors. Idiosyncratic connectivity patters are thought to persist across task states, suggesting task-based fMRI can be similarly leveraged for individual differences analyses. Here, we tested the degree to which functional interactions occurring in the background of a task during slow event-related fMRI parallel or differ from those captured during resting-state fMRI. We compared two approaches for removing task-evoked activity from task-based fMRI: (1) applying a low-pass filter to remove task-related frequencies in the signal, or (2) extracting residuals from a general linear model (GLM) that accounts for task-evoked responses. We found that the organization of large-scale cortical networks and individual's idiosyncratic connectivity patterns are preserved during task-based fMRI. In contrast, individual differences in connection strength can vary more substantially between rest and task. Compared to low-pass filtering, background connectivity obtained from GLM residuals produced idiosyncratic connectivity patterns and individual differences in connection strength that more resembled rest. However, all background connectivity measures were highly similar when derived from the low-pass filtered signal or GLM residuals, indicating that both methods are suitable for measuring background connectivity. Together, our results highlight new avenues for the analysis of task-based fMRI datasets and the utility of each background connectivity method.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Intrusion of pathological synergies does not explain impaired 3D arm movements in subacute stroke</a></h4>

              
                It has long been of interest what the contribution of pathological synergies is to abnormal motor control of the arm after stroke. The flexor synergy is defined as unwanted co-activation of flexion at the shoulder and elbow joints. Here we used a video-based, marker-less 3D pose-estimation kinematic model to examine two reaching tasks with different requirements for elbow flexion. Twenty-eight sub-acute (2-12 weeks) post-stroke subjects and sixteen healthy controls performed both a cup to mouth task, requiring shoulder and elbow flexion (within flexor synergy), and a reaching task, requiring shoulder flexion and elbow extension (outside of flexor synergy). Using kinematic analysis of the hand and of elbow/shoulder joint angles, we assessed both overall task performance and intrusion of pathological synergies. Motor impairment, strength and spasticity were measured using established clinical scales. Performance in both tasks was impaired to a similar degree in the patients compared to controls. This lack of performance difference for the in- vs. out-of-flexor synergy tasks was consistent with our finding of no evidence for intrusion of a flexor synergy in the reaching task. Specifically, for the reaching task there was no difference between patients and controls either in time spent within-movement in flexor synergy or in the correlation between shoulder and elbow angles when the shoulder was flexing. A regression analysis indicated that the only significant predictor of poor task performance was degree of weakness. Notably, even though we found no kinematic evidence for post-stroke intrusive flexor synergies, the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), which was devised to quantify post-stroke synergies, was markedly abnormal. This seeming contradiction is resolved by the observation that abnormal coupling at the shoulder and elbow can occur due to weakness alone, and it is this "synergy mimic" that leads to a low FMA score. The finding that FMA can be abnormal for two qualitatively distinct forms of impaired inter-joint coordination has implications for the interpretation of longitudinal studies that use this single measure. In the sub-acute stage of stroke, intrusion of abnormal synergies is not the reason for impaired reaching.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Divisively normalized neuronal processing of uncertain visual feedback for visuomotor learning</a></h4>

              
                When encountering a visual error during a reaching movement, the motor system improves the motor command for the subsequent trial. The degree of improvement is well-known to be degraded with visual error uncertainty, which is considered evidence that the motor system optimally estimates the error. However, it remains unclear how such statistical computation is accomplished. Here, we propose an alternative motor learning scheme implemented with a divisive normalization (DN) mechanism. This scheme assumes that when an uncertain visual error is provided by multiple cursors, the motor system processes the error conveyed by each cursor and integrates the information using DN. The DN scheme can reproduce the patterns of learning response when 1, 2, or 3 cursors are concurrently displayed and predict how the increase in the visual error uncertainty degrades the learning response. Our proposed scheme provides a novel view of how the motor learning system updates the motor command according to visual error information.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Alpha suppression during prehension indicates neural motor drive inhibition</a></h4>

              
                Changes in alpha band activity (8-12 Hz) have been shown to indicate the inhibition of engagement of brain regions during cognitive tasks, reflecting real-time cognitive load. Despite this, its feasibility to be used in a more dynamic environment with ongoing motor corrections has not been studied. This research used electroencephalography (EEG) to explore how different brain regions are engaged during a simple grasp and lift task where unexpected changes to the properties of the object are introduced. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show alpha activity changes related to motor error correction occur only in motor-related areas (i.e. central areas), but not in error processing areas (ie. fronto-parietal network). This suggests that oscillations over motor areas could reflect inhibition of motor drive related to motor error correction, thus being a potential cortical electrophysiological biomarker for the process, and not solely as a proxy for cognitive demands. This observation is particularly relevant in scenarios where these signals are used to evaluate high cognitive demands co-occurring with high levels of motor errors and corrections, such as prosthesis use. The establishment of electrophysiological biomarkers of mental resource allocation during movement and cognition can help identify indicators of mental workload and motor drive, which may be useful for improving brain-machine interfaces.

                Many visual tasks involve looking for specific object features. But we also often solve generic tasks where we look for a specific property, such as finding an odd item, deciding if two items are same, or if an object has symmetry. How do we solve such tasks? Building on simple neural rules, we show that displays with repeating elements can be distinguished from heterogeneous displays using a property we denote visual homogeneity. In behavior, visual homogeneity predicted response times on visual search and symmetry tasks. Brain imaging during these tasks revealed that visual homogeneity in both tasks is highly localized to a region in the object-selective cortex. Thus, a novel image property, visual homogeneity, is encoded in a localized brain region, to solve generic visual tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A cortical circuit for orchestrating oromanual food manipulation</a></h4>

              
                Cooperative forelimb and mouth movements during eating contribute to diet selection among vertebrates including the oromanual manipulatory skills in rodents and primates. Whereas spinal and brainstem circuits implement forelimb and orofacial actions, whether there is a specialized cortical circuit that flexibly assembles these to achieve cross-body and oromanual coordination for skilled manipulation remains unclear. Here we discover a cortical region and its cell-type-specific circuitry that orchestrates body postures and oromanual coordination for food manipulation in mice. An optogenetic screen of cortical areas and projection neuron types identified a rostral forelimb-orofacial area (RFO), wherein activation of pyramidal tract (PTFezf2) and intratelencephalic (ITPlxnD1) neurons induced concurrent posture, forelimb and orofacial eating-like movements. In a pasta-eating behavior, RFO PTFezf2 and ITPlxnD1 activity were closely correlated with picking up the pasta, adopting a sitting posture, oromanual manipulation, and hand-assisted biting. RFO inactivation and inhibition of RFO PTsFezf2 and ITsPlxnD1 impaired posture and oromanual coordination, leading to deficient pasta manipulation and biting. RFO is reciprocally connected to forelimb and orofacial sensorimotor areas as well as insular and visceral areas. Within this network, ITsPlxnD1 project bilaterally to the entire network and the ventrolateral striatum and PTsFezf2 project to multiple subcortical areas associated with forelimb and orofacial control. These results suggest that ITsPlxnD1 select and coordinate the feeding program involving multiple body parts and PTsFezf2 implement the fine details of movements. Our study reveals a neural circuit basis of hand-mouth coordination for object manipulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Higher-order thalamic nuclei facilitate the generalization and maintenance of spike-and-wave discharges in absence seizures</a></h4>

              
                Spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs), generated by the cortico-thalamo-cortical (CTC) network, are pathological, large amplitude oscillations and the hallmark of absence seizures (ASs). SWDs begin in a cortical initiation network in both humans and animal models, including the Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS), where it is located in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). The behavioral manifestation of an AS occurs when SWDs spread from the cortical initiation site to the whole brain, however, the mechanisms behind this rapid propagation remain unclear. Here we investigated these processes beyond the principal CTC network, in higher-order (HO) thalamic nuclei (lateral posterior (LP) and posterior (PO) nuclei) since their diffuse connectivity and known facilitation of intracortical communications make these nuclei key candidates to support SWD generation and maintenance. In freely moving GAERS, multi-site LFP in LP, PO and multiple cortical regions revealed a novel feature of SWDs: during SWDs there are short periods (named SWD-breaks) when cortical regions far from S1, such the primary visual cortex (V1), become transiently unsynchronized from the ongoing EEG rhythm. Inactivation of HO nuclei with local muscimol injections or optogenetic perturbation of HO nuclei activity increased the occurrence of SWD-breaks and the former intervention also increased the SWD propagation-time from S1. The neural underpinnings of these findings were explored further by silicon probe recordings from single units of PO which uncovered two previously unknown groups of excitatory neurons based on their burst firing dynamics at SWD onset. Moreover, a switch from tonic to burst firing at SWD onset was shown to be an important feature since it was much less prominent for non-generalized events, i.e. SWDs that remained local to S1. Additionally, one group of neurons showed a reverse of this switch during SWD-breaks, demonstrating the importance of this firing pattern throughout the SWD. In summary, these results support the view that multiple HO thalamic nuclei are utilized at SWD onset and contribute to cortical synchrony throughout the paroxysmal discharge.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The MHC class II transactivator affects local and systemic immune responses in an α-synuclein seeded rat model for Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by intraneuronal inclusions of alpha-synuclein (-Syn), a strong neuroinflammatory component and neurodegeneration. Human genetic association studies have shown that variants affecting quantity and quality of major histocompatibility complex II (MHCII) have implications in PD susceptibility and it was recently shown that PD patients have -Syn specific T lymphocytes in circulation. The class II transactivator (Ciita) is the major regulator of MHCII expression and reduced Ciita expression has been shown to increase -Syn induced neurodegeneration and pathology in vivo. Here we show, using flow cytometry in an -Syn overexpression model combined with -Syn pre-formed fibrils (PFF), that congenic rats with naturally occurring differences in Ciita expression have altered local and peripheral immune populations. Lower Ciita levels are associated with increased percentages of microglia and circulating myeloid cells being MHCII+ but with lower levels of MHCII on individual cells. Additionally, lower Ciita levels was associated to higher TNF levels in serum, trends of higher CD86 levels in circulating myeloid population and a lower CD4/CD8 T lymphocyte ratio. Taken together, these results indicate that Ciita regulates serum TNF levels and baseline immune populations which could mediate an increased susceptibility to PD-like pathology.

	<p>(1) Objective: Resting-state fMRI studies have indicated that juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) could cause widespread functional connectivity disruptions between the cerebrum and cerebellum. However, the directed influences or effective connectivities (ECs) between these brain regions are poorly understood. In the current study, we aimed to evaluate the ECs between the cerebrum and cerebellum in patients with new-onset JME. (2) Methods: Thirty-four new-onset JME patients and thirty-four age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy controls (HCs) were included in this study. We compared the degree centrality (DC) between the two groups to identify intergroup differences in whole-brain functional connectivity. Then, we used a Granger causality analysis (GCA) to explore JME-caused changes in EC between cerebrum regions and cerebellum regions. Furthermore, we applied a correlation analysis to identify associations between aberrant EC and disease severity in patients with JME. (3) Results: Compared to HCs, patients with JME showed significantly increased DC in the left cerebellum posterior lobe (CePL.L), the right inferior temporal gyrus (ITG.R) and the right superior frontal gyrus (SFG.R), and decreased DC in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG.L) and the left superior temporal gyrus (STG.L). The patients also showed unidirectionally increased ECs from cerebellum regions to the cerebrum regions, including from the CePL.L to the right precuneus (PreCU.R), from the left cerebellum anterior lobe (CeAL.L) to the ITG.R, from the right cerebellum posterior lobe (CePL.R) to the IFG.L, and from the left inferior semi-lunar lobule of the cerebellum (CeISL.L) to the SFG.R. Additionally, the EC from the CeISL.L to the SFG.R was negatively correlated with the disease severity. (4) Conclusions: JME patients showed unidirectional EC disruptions from the cerebellum to the cerebrum, and the negative correlation between EC and disease severity provides a new perspective for understanding the cerebro-cerebellar neural circuit mechanisms in JME.</p>

	<p>Although emotional expressions conveyed by the eye regions are processed efficiently, little is known regarding the relationship between emotional processing of isolated eye regions and temporal attention. In this study, we conducted three rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) experiments with varying task demands (emotion discrimination, eye detection, eyes ignored) related to the first target (T1) to investigate how the perception of emotional valence in the eye region (T1: happy, neutral, fearful) impacts the identification of a second target (T2: neutral houses). Event-related potential (ERP) findings indicated that fearful stimuli reliably increased N170 amplitude regardless of the emotional relevance of task demands. The P3 component exhibited enhanced responses to happy and fearful stimuli in the emotion discrimination task and to happy eye regions in the eye detection task. Analysis of T2-related ERPs within the attentional blink period revealed that T2 houses preceded by fearful and happy stimuli elicited larger N2 and P3 amplitudes than those preceded by neutral stimuli only in the emotion discrimination task. Together, these findings indicate that attention to affective content conveyed by the eyes can not only amplify the perceptual analysis of emotional eye regions but also facilitate the processing of a subsequent target.</p>

	<p>Relatively little research has examined sex differences among people affected by obesity. The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between negative emotions and eating behaviors, taking into account the role of biological sex. The final sample consists of 200 candidates for bariatric surgery, 62 males (31%) and 138 females (69%), aged from 18 to 60 years (M = 40.71; SD = 11.30). Participants were screened with the Binge Scale Questionnaire (BSQ) and individually evaluated with the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI) and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Correlations were calculated by splitting the sample by sex. Analyses of the relationship between negative emotions and eating behavior showed a large number of correlations in the sample of women and few correlations in men. The differences between women and men with obesity suggest the need for a different theoretical construct that explains the differentiated mechanisms of functioning and lays the foundations for specific therapeutic paths.</p>

	<p>Background: Pneumonia is common in patients with tracheostomy and dysphagia. However, the influence of dysphagia and tracheostomy on pneumonia in patients with stroke remains unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the risk factors related to pneumonia, and the association between dysphagia, tracheostomy and pneumonia in patients with stroke was investigated. Methods: Patients with stroke who experienced tracheostomy and dysphagia were included and divided into two groups based on record of pneumonia at discharge. Clinical manifestations and physical examination were used to diagnose pneumonia, whereas clinical swallowing examination, and videofluoroscopy swallowing studies (VFSS) were used to evaluate swallowing function. Results: There were significant differences between the pneumonia group and the no pneumonia group in total tracheostomy time (6.3 &amp;amp;plusmn; 5.9 vs. 4.3 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.7 months, p = 0.003), number of instances of ventilator support (0.41 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.49 vs. 0.18 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.38, p = 0.007), PAS score (5.2 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.92 vs. 4.3 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.79, p = 0.039), impaired or absent cough reflex (76.4 vs. 55.6%, p = 0.035), oropharyngeal phase dysfunction (60.6 vs. 40.8%, p = 0.047), length of hospital stay (36.0 &amp;amp;plusmn; 7.2 vs. 30.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 11.7 days, p = 0.025) and direct medical costs (15,702.21 &amp;amp;plusmn; 14,244.61 vs. 10,923.99 &amp;amp;plusmn; 7250.14 United States dollar [USD], p = 0.042). Multivariate logistic regression showed that the total tracheostomy time (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.966&amp;amp;ndash;12.922, p = 0.001), impaired or absent cough reflex (95% CI, 0.084&amp;amp;ndash;0.695, p = 0.008), and oropharyngeal phase dysfunction (95% CI, 1.087&amp;amp;ndash;8.148, p = 0.034) were risk factors for pneumonia. Spearman&amp;amp;rsquo;s correlation analysis demonstrated that PAS scores were significantly correlated with cough reflex dysfunction (r = 0.277, p = 0.03), oropharyngeal phase dysfunction (r = 0.318, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) and total tracheostomy time (r = 0.178, p = 0.045). The oropharyngeal phase dysfunction was significantly correlated with cough reflex (r = 0.549, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and UES opening (r = 0.643, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Conclusions: Tracheostomy and dysphagia increased the risk of pneumonia in patients with stroke. Total tracheostomy time, duration of ventilator support, degree of penetration and aspiration, and oropharyngeal phase dysfunction are risk factors. Given this, we also found that there may be a correlation between tracheostomy and dysphagia.</p>

	<p>Objective: This paper reports the clinical manifestation and auxiliary examination features of 15 Chinese patients with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) autoimmunity. Methods: From June 2016 to December 2019, patients suspected to have neurological autoimmune disease after having their serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tested for conventional neural antibodies were scanned for additional autoantibodies by immunohistochemistry. Samples that showed a characteristic immunoreactive pattern reminiscent of the GFAP of astrocytes were selected and confirmed by cell-based assay using cells-expressing human GFAP&amp;amp;alpha;. Results: A total of 15 patients (eight male and seven female) with a median age at onset of 53 years (range 28&amp;amp;ndash;72) were identified as GFAP-IgG-positive. Fourteen cases had GFAP-IgG detected in the CSF, while serum GFAP-IgG was detected in 11 cases. Eleven of the fifteen patients (73.3%) presented with an acute monophasic course, of which 10 (90.9%) had antecedent flu-like symptoms. The predominant phenotype was meningoencephalitis (46.7%), followed by meningoencephalomyelitis in 40% of the cases. The most common clinical features included long tract signs, brainstem symptoms, tremors, headaches, and psychiatric symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed the enhancement of the meninges, the surface of the brainstem, the cerebellum, and the spinal cord as predominant. Inflammatory CSF showed mild lymphocyte-predominant pleocytosis with a median of 51/&amp;amp;mu;L and elevated protein with a median of 87.5 mg/dL. Five patients had coexisting antibodies, including NMDAR-IgG in three patients and Yo and MOG-IgG in one patient each. One patient underwent a stereotactic brain biopsy, and the neuropathology diagnosis was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. One patient had ovarian teratoma. Eleven of the fifteen (73.3%) patients received both intravenous immunoglobulin and steroids. Among them, three patients also received immunosuppressive agents later. During a two-year follow-up, 9 of the 15 (60%) patients achieved complete clinical remission. Conclusions: The clinical presentation of GFAP astrocytopathy is heterogeneous. It can be characterized by an acute monophasic course and a chronic relapsing course. Tremors are a prominent clinical manifestation in patients with an acute monophasic course with GFAP-IgG antibodies only. Most patients responded well to immunotherapy. In patients with GFAP autoimmunity, presenting with a chronic relapsing course, one should actively search for immunogenic factors and the culprit antibodies. In the case of primary central nervous system lymphoma, GFAP autoimmunity does not always equate to autoimmune GFAP astrocytopathy.</p>

	<p>Background:Ceratonia siliqua L. (Carob tree) is a Mediterranean evergreen, well known for its medicinal properties. The different parts of Carob were proven to exert antidiabetic, antibacterial, antifungal, and antiproliferative effects. Hence, the present paper aims to validate the positive correlation between the high antioxidant activity of carob seed peels and the improvement of negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Materials &amp;amp;amp; Methods: The antioxidant activity was carried out using the &amp;amp;beta;-carotene test. Methionine and carob seed peels (CSP) extracts (50 and 100 mg/kg) were orally administrated to mice for a week. After administration, behavioral tests were assessed using the Y-maze, elevated plus maze, and forced swimming tests, as well as the novel object recognition task. Furthermore, the oxidative stress status was evaluated by analyzing the levels of the antioxidant enzymes: Superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and malondialdehyde levels (MDA). Results: Both extracts exhibited remarkable antioxidant activity and showed antibacterial effect against Gram-positive bacteria tested (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus) and against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gram-negative). Therefore, Escherichia coli was very resistant. The behavioral tests proved the efficacy of CSP in enhancing the cognitive impairment of animal models of schizophrenia. Hence, the stated correlation between oxidative stress and schizophrenia was confirmed by the increased SOD and GPx activities and the decreased MDA level. Conclusions: The present study gave further confirmation of the potential correlation between oxidative stress and the development of psychiatric disorders and highlighted the use of natural antioxidants, especially Ceratonia siliqua L. in the improvement of cognitive impairment in the dementia of schizophrenia.</p>

	<p>The GAITFAST study (gait recovery in patients after acute ischemic stroke) aims to compare the effects of treadmill-based robot-assisted gait training (RTGT) and therapist-assisted treadmill gait training (TTGT) added to conventional physical therapy in first-ever ischemic stroke patients. GAITFAST (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT04824482) was designed as a single-blind single-center prospective randomized clinical trial with two parallel groups and a primary endpoint of gait speed recovery up to 6 months after ischemic stroke. A total of 120 eligible and enrolled participants will be randomly allocated (1:1) in TTGT or RTGT. All enrolled patients will undergo a 2-week intensive inpatient rehabilitation including TTGT or RTGT followed by four clinical assessments (at the beginning of inpatient rehabilitation 8&amp;amp;ndash;15 days after stroke onset, after 2 weeks, and 3 and 6 months after the first assessment). Every clinical assessment will include the assessment of gait speed and walking dependency, fMRI activation measures, neurological and sensorimotor impairments, and gait biomechanics. In a random selection (1:2) of the 120 enrolled patients, multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data will be acquired and analyzed. This study will provide insight into the mechanisms behind poststroke gait behavioral changes resulting from intensive rehabilitation including assisted gait training (RTGT or TTGT) in early subacute IS patients.</p>

First, the notion of &amp;amp;lsquo;processing strategy&amp;amp;rsquo; or &amp;amp;lsquo;heuristics processing&amp;amp;rsquo; is considered followed by a discussion of structures of great morphosyntactic complexity that parsing systems seem to tackle by simply respecting complex grammatical laws, instead of by resorting to shortcuts. Then, grammatical illusions and what these can teach us about the processing of grammar are considered. It is argued that illusions allow us to discern a few explanatory principles that may redefine the way we see parser&amp;amp;ndash;grammar relations. Among these is the idea that how long illusions last in the online-to-offline transition depends in part on their &amp;amp;lsquo;templatability&amp;amp;rsquo;, that is, the ease with which they become gestaltic templates. Another key idea is that some apparent illusions are in fact nothing more than grammar contemplated at work as in slow motion.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Novel estimates reveal subnational heterogeneities in disease-relevant contact patterns in the United States</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Casey F. Breen, Ayesha S. Mahmud, Dennis M. Feehan</p>

Population contact patterns fundamentally determine the spread of directly transmitted airborne pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza. Reliable quantitative estimates of contact patterns are therefore critical to modeling and reducing the spread of directly transmitted infectious diseases and to assessing the effectiveness of interventions intended to limit risky contacts. While many countries have used surveys and contact diaries to collect national-level contact data, local-level estimates of age-specific contact patterns remain rare. Yet, these local-level data are critical since disease dynamics and public health policy typically vary by geography. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a flexible model that can estimate age-specific contact patterns at the subnational level by combining national-level interpersonal contact data with other locality-specific data sources using multilevel regression with poststratification (MRP). We estimate daily contact matrices for all 50 US states and Washington DC from April 2020 to May 2021 using national contact data from the US. Our results reveal important state-level heterogeneities in levels and trends of contacts across the US over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, with implications for the spread of respiratory diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Stability and learning in excitatory synapses by nonlinear inhibitory plasticity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christoph Miehl, Julijana Gjorgjieva</p>

Synaptic changes are hypothesized to underlie learning and memory formation in the brain. But Hebbian synaptic plasticity of excitatory synapses on its own is unstable, leading to either unlimited growth of synaptic strengths or silencing of neuronal activity without additional homeostatic mechanisms. To control excitatory synaptic strengths, we propose a novel form of synaptic plasticity at inhibitory synapses. Using computational modeling, we suggest two key features of inhibitory plasticity, dominance of inhibition over excitation and a nonlinear dependence on the firing rate of postsynaptic excitatory neurons whereby inhibitory synaptic strengths change with the same sign (potentiate or depress) as excitatory synaptic strengths. We demonstrate that the stable synaptic strengths realized by this novel inhibitory plasticity model affects excitatory/inhibitory weight ratios in agreement with experimental results. Applying a disinhibitory signal can gate plasticity and lead to the generation of receptive fields and strong bidirectional connectivity in a recurrent network. Hence, a novel form of nonlinear inhibitory plasticity can simultaneously stabilize excitatory synaptic strengths and enable learning upon disinhibition.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A phylogenetic approach to inferring the order in which mutations arise during cancer progression</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yuan Gao, Jeff Gaither, Julia Chifman, Laura Kubatko</p>

Although the role of evolutionary process in cancer progression is widely accepted, increasing attention is being given to the evolutionary mechanisms that can lead to differences in clinical outcome. Recent studies suggest that the temporal order in which somatic mutations accumulate during cancer progression is important. Single-cell sequencing (SCS) provides a unique opportunity to examine the effect that the mutation order has on cancer progression and treatment effect. However, the error rates associated with single-cell sequencing are known to be high, which greatly complicates the task. We propose a novel method for inferring the order in which somatic mutations arise within an individual tumor using noisy data from single-cell sequencing. Our method incorporates models at two levels in that the evolutionary process of somatic mutation within the tumor is modeled along with the technical errors that arise from the single-cell sequencing data collection process. Through analyses of simulations across a wide range of realistic scenarios, we show that our method substantially outperforms existing approaches for identifying mutation order. Most importantly, our method provides a unique means to capture and quantify the uncertainty in the inferred mutation order along a given phylogeny. We illustrate our method by analyzing data from colorectal and prostate cancer patients, in which our method strengthens previously reported mutation orders. Our work is an important step towards producing meaningful prediction of mutation order with high accuracy and measuring the uncertainty of predicted mutation order in cancer patients, with the potential to lead to new insights about the evolutionary trajectories of cancer.

                <p>Cerebral cortical encephalitis (CCE) is a recently described myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) phenotype. In this observational retrospective study, we characterized 19 CCE patients (6.7% of our MOGAD cohort). Headache (n = 15, 79%), seizures (n = 13, 68%), and encephalopathy (n = 12, 63%) were frequent. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed unilateral (n = 12, 63%) or bilateral (n = 7, 37%) cortical T2 hyperintensity and leptomeningeal enhancement (n = 17, 89%). N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor autoantibodies coexisted in 2 of 15 tested (13%). CCE pathology (n = 2) showed extensive subpial cortical demyelination (n = 2), microglial reactivity (n = 2), and inflammatory infiltrates (perivascular, n = 1; meningeal, n = 1). Most received high-dose steroids (n = 17, 89%), and all improved, but 3 had CCE relapses. This study highlights the CCE spectrum and provides insight into its pathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">A Managed Care System with Telemedicine Support for Neurological Emergencies</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Telemedicine is frequently used to provide remote neurological expertise for acute stroke workup and was associated with better functional outcomes when combined with a stroke unit system-of-care. We investigated whether such system-of-care yields additional benefits when implemented on top of neurological competence already available onsite.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Quality improvement measures were implemented within a “hub-and-spoke” teleneurology network in 11 hospitals already provided with onsite or telestroke expertise. Measures included dedicated units for neurological emergencies, standardization of procedures, multiprofessional training, and quality-of-care monitoring. Intervention effects were investigated in a controlled study enrolling patients insured at 3 participating statutory health insurances diagnosed with acute stroke or other neurological emergencies. Outcomes during the intervention period between November 2017 and February 2020 were compared with those pre-intervention between October 2014 and March 2017. To control for temporal trends, we compared outcomes of patients with respective diagnoses in 11 hospitals of the same region. Primary outcome was the composite of up-to-90-day death, new disability with the need of ambulatory or nursing home care, expressed by adjusted hazard ratio (aHR).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 1,418 patients post-implementation (55% female, mean age 76.7 ± 12.8 year) and 2,306 patients pre-implementation (56%, 75.8 ± 13.0 year, respectively). The primary outcome occurred in 479/1,418 (33.8%) patients post-implementation and in 829/2,306 (35.9%) pre-implementation. The aHR for the primary outcome was 0.89 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.79–0.99, <i>p</i> = 0.04) with no improvement seen in non-participating hospitals between post- versus pre-implementation periods (aHR 1.04; 95% CI: 0.95–1.15).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Implementation of a multicomponent system-of-care was associated with a lower risk of poor outcomes. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Atrial Fibrillation Risk Assessment after Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Approximately 20% of strokes are embolic strokes of undetermined source (ESUS). Undetected atrial fibrillation (AF) remains an important cause. Yet, oral anticoagulation in unselected ESUS patients failed in secondary stroke prevention. Guidance on effective AF detection is lacking. Here, we introduce a novel, non-invasive AF risk assessment after ESUS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Catch-Up ESUS is an investigator-initiated, observational cohort study conducted between 2018 and 2019 at the Munich University Hospital. Besides clinical characteristics, patients received ≥72 h digital electrocardiogram recordings to generate the rhythm irregularity burden. Uni- and multivariable regression models predicted the primary endpoint of incident AF, ascertained by standardized follow-up including implantable cardiac monitors. Predictors included the novel rhythm irregularity burden constructed from digital electrocardiogram recordings. We independently validated our model in ESUS patients from the University Hospital Tübingen, Germany.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 297 ESUS patients were followed for 15.6 ± 7.6 months. Incident AF (46 patients, 15.4%) occurred after a median of 105 days (25th to 75th percentile 31–33 days). Secondary outcomes were recurrent stroke in 7.7% and death in 6.1%. Multivariable-adjusted analyses identified the rhythm irregularity burden as the strongest AF-predictor (hazard ratio 3.12, 95% confidence interval 1.62–5.80, <i>p</i> &lt; 0001) while accounting for the known risk factors age, CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc-Score, and NT-proBNP. Independent validation confirmed the rhythm irregularity burden as the most significant AF-predictor (hazard ratio 2.20, 95% confidence interval 1.45–3.33, <i>p</i> &lt; 0001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The novel, non-invasive, electrocardiogram-based rhythm irregularity burden may help adjudicating AF risk after ESUS, and subsequently guide AF-detection after ESUS. Clinical trials need to clarify if high-AF risk patients benefit from tailored secondary stroke prevention. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Entry of the antipsychotic drug, olanzapine, into the developing rat brain in mono- and combination therapies [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Olanzapine is used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in women of childbearing age. Continuation of psychotropic medications throughout pregnancy and lactation is often required as cessation could be dangerous for both mother and child. However, there is a lack of information on the transfer of these drugs into the developing brain. Methods: Sprague Dawley rats at three developmental ages: embryonic day E19, postnatal day P4 and non-pregnant adult females were administered unlabelled or radiolabelled (3H) olanzapine (0.15 mg/kg) either as monotherapy or in combination with each of seven other common medications. Similar injections were administered to pregnant E19 females to investigate placental transfer. Olanzapine in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain was measured by liquid scintillation counting after a single dose (acute) or following 5 days of treatment (prolonged). Results: Olanzapine entry into brain and CSF was not age-dependent. Prolonged olanzapine treatment reduced placental transfer from 53% to 46% (p<0.05). Co-administration of digoxin or lamotrigine with olanzapine increased its entry into the fetal brain, whereas paracetamol decreased its entry into the CSF. Placental transfer of olanzapine was increased by co-treatment with cimetidine and digoxin, whereas co-treatment with lamotrigine, paracetamol or valproate led to a substantial decrease. Repeated co-treatment of digoxin and olanzapine increased olanzapine transfer into the brain and CSF, but not across the placenta. Overall entry of olanzapine from maternally administered drugs into the fetal brain was higher after combination therapy with cimetidine and digoxin. Conclusions: Co-administration of olanzapine with some commonly used drugs affected its entry into the fetus and its developing brain to a greater extent than in adults. It appears that protection of the fetal brain for these drugs primarily comes from the placenta rather than from the fetal brain barriers. Results suggest that drug combinations should be used with caution particularly during pregnancy.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Significance of visual scene‐based learning in the hippocampal systems across mammalian species</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus and its associated cortical regions in the medial temporal lobe play essential roles when animals form a cognitive map and use it to achieve their goals. As the nature of map-making involves sampling different local views of the environment and putting them together in a spatially cohesive way, visual scenes are essential ingredients in the formative process of cognitive maps. Visual scenes also serve as important cues during information retrieval from the cognitive map. Research in humans has shown that there are regions in the brain that selectively process scenes and that the hippocampus is involved in scene-based memory tasks. The neurophysiological correlates of scene-based information processing in the hippocampus have been reported as “spatial view cells” in nonhuman primates. Like primates, it is widely accepted that rodents also use visual scenes in their background for spatial navigation and other kinds of problems. However, in rodents, it is not until recently that researchers examined the neural correlates of the hippocampus from the perspective of visual scene-based information processing. With the advent of virtual reality (VR) systems, it has been demonstrated that place cells in the hippocampus exhibit remarkably similar firing correlates in the VR environment compared with that of the real-world environment. Despite some limitations, the new trend of studying hippocampal functions in a visually controlled environment has the potential to allow investigation of the input–output relationships of network functions and experimental testing of traditional computational predictions more rigorously by providing well-defined visual stimuli. As scenes are essential for navigation and episodic memory in humans, further investigation of the rodents' hippocampal systems in scene-based tasks will provide a critical functional link across different mammalian species.</p>
