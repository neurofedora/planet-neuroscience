                arXiv:2410.07503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the Hopfield model as a simplified framework to explore both the memory deficits and the biochemical processes characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. By simulating neuronal death and synaptic degradation through increasing the number of stored patterns and introducing noise into the synaptic weights, we demonstrate hallmark symptoms of dementia, including memory loss, confusion, and delayed retrieval times. As the network's capacity is exceeded, retrieval errors increase, mirroring the cognitive confusion observed in Alzheimer's patients. Additionally, we simulate the impact of synaptic degradation by varying the sparsity of the weight matrix, showing impaired memory recall and reduced retrieval success as noise levels increase. Furthermore, we extend our model to connect memory loss with biochemical processes linked to Alzheimer's. By simulating the role of reduced insulin sensitivity over time, we show how it can trigger increased calcium influx into mitochondria, leading to misfolded proteins and the formation of amyloid plaques. These findings, modeled over time, suggest that both neuronal degradation and metabolic factors contribute to the progressive decline seen in Alzheimer's disease. Our work offers a computational framework for understanding the dual impact of synaptic and metabolic dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases.

                arXiv:2410.07189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the novel Dual Stream Graph-Transformer Fusion (DS-GTF) architecture designed specifically for classifying task-based Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. In the spatial stream, inputs are initially represented as graphs, which are then passed through graph attention networks (GAT) to extract spatial patterns. Two methods, TopK and Thresholded Adjacency are introduced for initializing the adjacency matrix used in the GAT. In the temporal stream, the Transformer Encoder receives concatenated windowed input MEG data and learns new temporal representations. The learned temporal and spatial representations from both streams are fused before reaching the output layer. Experimental results demonstrate an enhancement in classification performance and a reduction in standard deviation across multiple test subjects compared to other examined models.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07199">Towards Explainable Graph Neural Networks for Neurological Evaluation on EEG Signals</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.07199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After an acute stroke, accurately estimating stroke severity is crucial for healthcare professionals to effectively manage patient's treatment. Graph theory methods have shown that brain connectivity undergoes frequency-dependent reorganization post-stroke, adapting to new conditions. Traditional methods often rely on handcrafted features that may not capture the complexities of clinical phenomena. In this study, we propose a novel approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict stroke severity, as measured by the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS). We analyzed electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from 71 patients at the time of hospitalization. For each patient, we generated five graphs weighted by Lagged Linear Coherence (LLC) between signals from distinct Brodmann Areas, covering $\delta$ (2-4 Hz), $\theta$ (4-8 Hz), $\alpha_1$ (8-10.5 Hz), $\alpha_2$ (10.5-13 Hz), and $\beta_1$ (13-20 Hz) frequency bands. To emphasize key neurological connections and maintain sparsity, we applied a sparsification process based on structural and functional brain network properties. We then trained a graph attention model to predict the NIHSS. By examining its attention coefficients, our model reveals insights into brain reconfiguration, providing clinicians with a valuable tool for diagnosis, personalized treatment, and early intervention in neurorehabilitation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08025">The Computational Complexity of Circuit Discovery for Inner Interpretability</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.08025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many proposed applications of neural networks in machine learning, cognitive/brain science, and society hinge on the feasibility of inner interpretability via circuit discovery. This calls for empirical and theoretical explorations of viable algorithmic options. Despite advances in the design and testing of heuristics, there are concerns about their scalability and faithfulness at a time when we lack understanding of the complexity properties of the problems they are deployed to solve. To address this, we study circuit discovery with classical and parameterized computational complexity theory: (1) we describe a conceptual scaffolding to reason about circuit finding queries in terms of affordances for description, explanation, prediction and control; (2) we formalize a comprehensive set of queries that capture mechanistic explanation, and propose a formal framework for their analysis; (3) we use it to settle the complexity of many query variants and relaxations of practical interest on multi-layer perceptrons (part of, e.g., transformers). Our findings reveal a challenging complexity landscape. Many queries are intractable (NP-hard, $\Sigma^p_2$-hard), remain fixed-parameter intractable (W[1]-hard) when constraining model/circuit features (e.g., depth), and are inapproximable under additive, multiplicative, and probabilistic approximation schemes. To navigate this landscape, we prove there exist transformations to tackle some of these hard problems (NP- vs. $\Sigma^p_2$-complete) with better-understood heuristics, and prove the tractability (PTIME) or fixed-parameter tractability (FPT) of more modest queries which retain useful affordances. This framework allows us to understand the scope and limits of interpretability queries, explore viable options, and compare their resource demands among existing and future architectures.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16865">An Investigation of Conformal Isometry Hypothesis for Grid Cells</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2405.16865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the conformal isometry hypothesis as a potential explanation for hexagonal periodic patterns in grid cell response maps. The hypothesis posits that grid cell activity forms a high-dimensional vector in neural space, encoding the agent's position in 2D physical space. As the agent moves, this vector rotates within a 2D manifold in the neural space, driven by a recurrent neural network. The conformal hypothesis suggests that this neural manifold is a conformally isometric embedding of physical space, where local displacements in neural space are proportional to those in physical space. In this paper, we conduct numerical experiments to show that this hypothesis leads to the hexagon periodic patterns of grid cells, agnostic to the choice of transformation models. Furthermore, we present a theoretical understanding that hexagon patterns emerge by minimizing our loss function because hexagon flat torus exhibits minimal deviation from local conformal isometry. In addition, we propose a conformal modulation of the agent's input velocity, enabling the recurrent neural network of grid cells to satisfy the conformal isometry hypothesis automatically.

Recent neuroscience research revealed a bodily form of self-consciousness, including the sense of agency (SoA) and the sense of body ownership (SoO) that are based on the integration of multisensory bodily inputs and motor signals. However, the relation between SoA and/or SoO with ANC is not known. Here, we used immersive virtual reality technology and motion tracking and investigated the potential association of SoA/SoO with ANC. For this, we exposed participants to different levels of visuomotor and perspectival congruency, known to modulate SoA and SoO, during the encoding of virtual scenes and collected ANC ratings 1 week after the encoding session. In a total of 74 healthy participants, we successfully induced systematic changes in SoA and SoO during encoding and found that ANC depended on the level of SoA experienced during encoding. Moreover, ANC was positively associated with SoA, but only for the scene encoded with preserved visuomotor and perspectival congruency, and such SoA&ndash;ANC coupling was absent for SoO and control questions. Collectively, these data provide behavioral evidence in a novel paradigm that links a key subjective component of bodily self-consciousness during encoding, SoA, to the subjective reliving of those encoded events from one's past, ANC.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/10/ENEURO.0314-24.2024?rss=1">Role of the Nucleus Accumbens in Signaled Avoidance Actions</a></h4>

              
                <p>Animals, humans included, navigate their environments guided by sensory cues, responding adaptively to potential dangers and rewards. Avoidance behaviors serve as adaptive strategies in the face of signaled threats, but the neural mechanisms orchestrating these behaviors remain elusive. Current circuit models of avoidance behaviors indicate that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in the ventral striatum plays a key role in signaled avoidance behaviors, but the nature of this engagement is unclear. Evolving perspectives propose the NAc as a pivotal hub for action selection, integrating cognitive and affective information to heighten the efficiency of both appetitive and aversive motivated behaviors. To unravel the engagement of the NAc during active and passive avoidance, we used calcium imaging fiber photometry to examine NAc GABAergic neuron activity in <I>ad libitum</I> moving mice performing avoidance behaviors. We then probed the functional significance of NAc neurons using optogenetics and genetically targeted or electrolytic lesions. We found that NAc neurons code contraversive orienting movements and avoidance actions. However, direct optogenetic inhibition or lesions of NAc neurons did not impair active or passive avoidance behaviors, challenging the notion of their purported pivotal role in adaptive avoidance. The findings emphasize that while the NAc encodes avoidance movements, it is not required for avoidance behaviors, highlighting the distinction between behavior encoding or representation and mediation or generation.</p>

                Introduction In recent years, the number of cardiac surgeries has been on the rise. Several predictive models have been developed to assess the risk of mortality for these patients. EuroSCORE II, a widely used model, demonstrates good discrimination and calibration for the European population, but its accuracy may vary in the Indonesian population. The purpose of this study was to develop a scoring model tailored to Indonesian population, which may have better accuracy in assessing in-hospital mortality risk among adult cardiac surgery patients. Method A retrospective study was conducted using medical records of adult cardiac surgery patients from four participating hospitals. Potential risk factors were included as variables and analyzed using bivariate and multivariable logistic regression with the L-backward method. Bootstrapping was applied to enhance the model’s validity. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were created for each model, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to assess discrimination ability, while the Hosmer-Lemeshow test was used to evaluate calibration. Results We extracted data from 4,875 patients, with a mean age of 50.41 years, and most patients were men (63.1%). The majority of patients were in NYHA class I-II. The in-hospital mortality rate was 6.5%. From 62 potential variables, 13 variables were included in the final model. Our new model demonstrated strong discrimination and calibration (AUC 0.7564; Hosmer-Lemeshow p = 0.9510). Conclusion The newly developed scoring model exhibited good discrimination and calibration, making it a promising tool for predicting in-hospital mortality in adult cardiac surgery patients in Indonesia.

                Background The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has underscored the need for resilient health systems. However, Ghana does not seem to achieve commensurate results, suggesting potential gaps in critical interventions. This study examines these gaps by drawing on global experiences to guide Ghana's preparedness for future emergencies. Methods A scoping review based on the synthesis of published journal articles and grey literature was used to gather relevant evidence to address the study’s objective. Peer-reviewed literature searches were conducted in databases, including Medline, Scopus, and Health Sources, supplemented by searches on organizational websites to identify grey literature. We adopted the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) framework to explore how health systems responded to the COVID-19 pandemic globally and draw lessons for strengthening Ghana's health system resilience. We analyzed policy responses in three main areas: pandemic preparedness, crisis management, and response and recovery. Results Ten strategies emerged from the study as critical in strengthening health system resilience against future pandemics. These strategies include whole-of-government engagement, financing for preparedness, community engagement and trust, robust surveillance systems, emergency medical care, diverse workforce development, digital health integration, critical health infrastructure, well-planned commodities/products, and social capital. Each strategy plays a vital role in enhancing preparedness, response, and recovery efforts, highlighting the multifaceted approach needed to mitigate the impact of future pandemics on health systems. Conclusions The identified strategies align with the attributes of a resilient healthcare system. By adopting these strategies, Ghana can build a resilient healthcare system that effectively addresses future challenges, guided by global insights and experiences.

                Background Various studies across different settings have validated Days Alive and Out of Hospital (DAOH) as a valuable outcome for clinical research in surgery and other fields. However, there is no clear consensus on the definitions and methods used to handle and report DAOH in perioperative care studies. Objective We aim to identify, describe, and summarize the available research on DAOH to understand how it is being conceptualized and utilized in clinical studies on perioperative care. Methods We will conduct a scoping review to analyze and synthesize the existing studies using DAOH to measure clinical results on perioperative care. We will search MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov and CENTRAL. Screening, eligibility, inclusion and data extraction processes will be performed by two reviewers, with a third reviewer solving disagreements. We will present our results descriptively. Conclusions We expect to provide a comprehensive overview of how DAOH is conceptualized and utilized in clinical studies on perioperative care, with particular attention to methodological approaches and the role of electronic health-care records (EHRs) among the different regions.

                <p>by Giacomo Barzon, Ettore Ambrosini, Antonino Vallesi, Samir Suweis</p>

The ability to solve complex tasks relies on the adaptive changes occurring in the spatio-temporal organization of brain activity under different conditions. Altered flexibility in these dynamics can lead to impaired cognitive performance, manifesting for instance as difficulties in attention regulation, distraction inhibition, and behavioral adaptation. Such impairments result in decreased efficiency and increased effort in accomplishing goal-directed tasks. Therefore, developing quantitative measures that can directly assess the effort involved in these transitions using neural data is of paramount importance. In this study, we propose a framework to associate cognitive effort during the performance of tasks with electroencephalography (EEG) activation patterns. The methodology relies on the identification of discrete dynamical states (EEG microstates) and optimal transport theory. To validate the effectiveness of this framework, we apply it to a dataset collected during a spatial version of the Stroop task, a cognitive test in which participants respond to one aspect of a stimulus while ignoring another, often conflicting, aspect. The Stroop task is a cognitive test where participants must respond to one aspect of a stimulus while ignoring another, often conflicting, aspect. Our findings reveal an increased cost linked to cognitive effort, thus confirming the framework’s effectiveness in capturing and quantifying cognitive transitions. By utilizing a fully data-driven method, this research opens up fresh perspectives for physiologically describing cognitive effort within the brain.

                <p>by Marta Sampaio, Miguel Rocha, Oscar Dias</p>

<i>Vitis vinifera</i>, also known as grapevine, is widely cultivated and commercialized, particularly to produce wine. As wine quality is directly linked to fruit quality, studying grapevine metabolism is important to understand the processes underlying grape composition. Genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs) have been used for the study of plant metabolism and advances have been made, allowing the integration of omics datasets with GSMMs. On the other hand, Machine learning (ML) has been used to analyze and integrate omics data, and while the combination of ML with GSMMs has shown promising results, it is still scarcely used to study plants. Here, the first GSSM of <i>V</i>. <i>vinifera</i> was reconstructed and validated, comprising 7199 genes, 5399 reactions, and 5141 metabolites across 8 compartments. Tissue-specific models for the stem, leaf, and berry of the Cabernet Sauvignon cultivar were generated from the original model, through the integration of RNA-Seq data. These models have been merged into diel multi-tissue models to study the interactions between tissues at light and dark phases. The potential of combining ML with GSMMs was explored by using ML to analyze the fluxomics data generated by green and mature grape GSMMs and provide insights regarding the metabolism of grapes at different developmental stages. Therefore, the models developed in this work are useful tools to explore different aspects of grapevine metabolism and understand the factors influencing grape quality.

                <p>by George Gabriel, Faisal Mushtaq, J. Ryan Morehead</p>

From tying one’s shoelaces to driving a car, complex skills involving the coordination of multiple muscles are common in everyday life; yet relatively little is known about how these skills are learned. Recent studies have shown that new sensorimotor skills involving re-mapping familiar body movements to unfamiliar outputs cannot be learned by adjusting pre-existing controllers, and that new task-specific controllers must instead be learned “de novo”. To date, however, few studies have investigated de novo learning in scenarios requiring continuous and coordinated control of relatively unpractised body movements. In this study, we used a myoelectric interface to investigate how a novel controller is learned when the task involves an unpractised combination of relatively untrained continuous muscle contractions. Over five sessions on five consecutive days, participants learned to trace a series of trajectories using a computer cursor controlled by the activation of two muscles. The timing of the generated cursor trajectory and its shape relative to the target improved for conditions trained with post-trial visual feedback. Improvements in timing transferred to all untrained conditions, but improvements in shape transferred less robustly to untrained conditions requiring the trained order of muscle activation. All muscle outputs in the final session could already be generated during the first session, suggesting that participants learned the new task by improving the selection of existing motor commands. These results suggest that the novel controllers acquired during de novo learning can, in some circumstances, be constructed from components of existing controllers.

                <p>by Alexis Bénichou, Jean-Baptiste Masson, Christian L. Vestergaard</p>

Physical and functional constraints on biological networks lead to complex topological patterns across multiple scales in their organization. A particular type of higher-order network feature that has received considerable interest is network motifs, defined as statistically regular subgraphs. These may implement fundamental logical and computational circuits and are referred to as “building blocks of complex networks”. Their well-defined structures and small sizes also enable the testing of their functions in synthetic and natural biological experiments. Here, we develop a framework for motif mining based on lossless network compression using subgraph contractions. This provides an alternative definition of motif significance which allows us to compare different motifs and select the collectively most significant set of motifs as well as other prominent network features in terms of their combined compression of the network. Our approach inherently accounts for multiple testing and correlations between subgraphs and does not rely on <i>a priori</i> specification of an appropriate null model. It thus overcomes common problems in hypothesis testing-based motif analysis and guarantees robust statistical inference. We validate our methodology on numerical data and then apply it on synaptic-resolution biological neural networks, as a medium for comparative connectomics, by evaluating their respective compressibility and characterize their inferred circuit motifs.

                <p>by Colby Fronk, Jaewoong Yun, Prashant Singh, Linda Petzold</p>

Symbolic regression with polynomial neural networks and polynomial neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are two recent and powerful approaches for equation recovery of many science and engineering problems. However, these methods provide point estimates for the model parameters and are currently unable to accommodate noisy data. We address this challenge by developing and validating the following Bayesian inference methods: the Laplace approximation, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods, and variational inference. We have found the Laplace approximation to be the best method for this class of problems. Our work can be easily extended to the broader class of symbolic neural networks to which the polynomial neural network belongs.

                <p>by Amanda Craine, Adarsh Krishnamurthy, Christopher T. Villongco, Kevin Vincent, David E. Krummen, Sanjiv M. Narayan, Roy C. P. Kerckhoffs, Jeffrey H. Omens, Francisco Contijoch, Andrew D. McCulloch</p>

In patients with dyssynchronous heart failure (DHF), cardiac conduction abnormalities cause the regional distribution of myocardial work to be non-homogeneous. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) using an implantable, programmed biventricular pacemaker/defibrillator, can improve the synchrony of contraction between the right and left ventricles in DHF, resulting in reduced morbidity and mortality and increased quality of life. Since regional work depends on wall stress, which cannot be measured in patients, we used computational methods to investigate regional work distributions and their changes after CRT. We used three-dimensional multi-scale patient-specific computational models parameterized by anatomic, functional, hemodynamic, and electrophysiological measurements in eight patients with heart failure and left bundle branch block (LBBB) who received CRT. To increase clinical translatability, we also explored whether streamlined computational methods provide accurate estimates of regional myocardial work.
We found that CRT increased global myocardial work efficiency with significant improvements in non-responders. Reverse ventricular remodeling after CRT was greatest in patients with the highest heterogeneity of regional work at baseline, however the efficacy of CRT was not related to the decrease in overall work heterogeneity or to the reduction in late-activated regions of high myocardial work. Rather, decreases in early-activated regions of myocardium performing negative myocardial work following CRT best explained patient variations in reverse remodeling. These findings were also observed when regional myocardial work was estimated using ventricular pressure as a surrogate for myocardial stress and changes in endocardial surface area as a surrogate for strain. These new findings suggest that CRT promotes reverse ventricular remodeling in human dyssynchronous heart failure by increasing regional myocardial work in early-activated regions of the ventricles, where dyssynchrony is specifically associated with hypoperfusion, late systolic stretch, and altered metabolic activity and that measurement of these changes can be performed using streamlined approaches.

<p>Concluding Schema: Taken together with our previous reports, histaminergic neurons originating from the ventral tuberomammillary nucleus (VTM) project to the olfactory bulb (OB) without much branching prior to the OB. Their axons (orange lines) extended to the granule cell layer (GCL), the internal plexiform layer (IPL), the mitral cell layer (MCL), the external plexiform layer (EPL), the glomerular layer (GL), and the olfactory nerve layer (ONL) in the OB. The maximal density of histaminergic axions is observed in the GL, followed by the ONL and GCL. The glomerulus is enlarged to show a schematic diagram for synaptic transmission. The <span class="smallCaps">l</span>-histidine decarboxylase–immunoreactive (HDC-ir) profiles received asymmetrical synapses (red arrows) from olfactory nerves (ON) and indicate synapses (green arrow) containing pleomorphic vesicles with postsynaptic densities to nonolfactory nerve elements (non-ON), thus forming serial synapses. It also receives asymmetric transmission (red arrow) from a profile that appears to be mitral/tufted (M/T) cell.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Odor information is modulated by centrifugal inputs from other brain regions to the olfactory bulb (OB). Neurons containing monoamines, such as serotonin, acetylcholine, and noradrenaline, are well known as centrifugal inputs; however, the role of histamine, which is also present in the OB, is not well understood. In this study, we examined the histaminergic neurons projecting from the hypothalamus to the OB. We used an antibody against histidine decarboxylase (HDC), a synthesizing enzyme of histamine, to identify histaminergic neurons and assess their localization within the OB and the ultrastructure of their fibers and synapses using multiple immunostaining laser microscopy, ultra-high voltage electron microscopy (EM), and EM to confirm their relationships with other neurons. To further identify the origin nucleus of the histaminergic neurons projecting to the OB, we injected the retrograde tracer FluoroGold and analyzed the pathway to the OB anterogradely. HDC-immunoreactive (-ir) fibers were abundant in the olfactory nerve (ON) layer compared to other monoamines. HDC-ir neurons received asymmetrical synapses from ONs and formed synapses containing pleomorphic vesicles with variable postsynaptic densities to non-ON elements, thus forming serial synapses. We also confirmed that histaminergic neurons project from the rostral ventral tuberomammillary nucleus to the granule cell layer of the OB and, for the first time, successfully visualized their axons from the hypothalamus to the OB. These findings indicate that histamine may regulate odor discrimination in the OB, suggesting a regulatory relationship between hypothalamic function and olfaction. We thus elucidate morphological mechanisms with tuberomammillary nucleus–derived histaminergic neurons involved in olfactory information.</p>

<p>Expression of dopamine receptors (<i>Drd1</i>, <i>Drd2</i>, <i>Drd3—</i>green) was quantified via RNAScope in HVC, Area X, and the periaqueductal gray (PAG) of testosterone treated canaries, along with colocalization of <i>VGlut2</i> (orange), <i>Gad2</i> (red), and <i>Egr1</i> (pink).

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Highly sensitive in situ hybridization procedures (RNAScope) were used to quantify the expression of three dopamine receptors (Drd1, Drd2, and Drd3) in two song control nuclei (HVC and the Area X of the basal ganglia) that are known to receive dopaminergic inputs and in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) of male and female canaries. Both sexes were treated with testosterone to ensure they would sing actively. We also determined the excitatory versus inhibitory phenotype of the cells expressing these receptors as well as their activation following a period of song production. The three receptor types were identified in each brain area, with the exception of Drd3 in Area X. The density of cells expressing each receptor varied as a function of receptor type and brain area. Surprisingly few sex differences were detected; they do not seem to explain the sex differences in testosterone-induced song. Overall, the density of Drd-positive cells was much lower in PAG than in the two song control nuclei. In HVC, the majority of cells expressing the three receptor subtypes were VGlut2-positive, whereas colocalization with Vglut2 occurred in few cells in Area X and in an intermediate proportion of cells in PAG. The number of inhibitory cells expressing dopamine receptors was limited. Most dopaminoceptive cells in Area X did not express either excitatory or inhibitory markers. Finally, cellular activation during singing behavior, as measured by the expression of Egr1, was observed in cells expressing each of the three dopamine receptor subtypes, except Drd3 in the PAG.</p>

                Background Low back pain (LBP), the primary cause of disability, is the most common musculoskeletal disorder globally and the primary cause of disability. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies are inconclusive and less sensitive for identifying and classifying patients with LBP. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the role of artificial intelligence (AI) models in the prediction of LBP using T2 weighted MRI image of the lumbar spine. Methods This was a prospective case-control study. A total of 200 MRI patients (100 cases and controls each) referred for lumbar spine and whole spine screening were included. The scans were performed using 3.0 Tesla MRI (United Imaging Healthcare). T2 weighted images of the lumbar spine were segmented to extract radiomic features. Machine learning (ML) models, such as random forest, decision tree, logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors, adaboost, and deep learning methods (DL), such as ResNet and GoogleNet, were used, and performance measures were calculated. Results Our study showed that Random forest and AdaBoost are the most reliable ML models for predicting LBP. Random forest showed high performance with area under curve (AUC) values from 0.83 to 0.88 across all lumbar vertebrae and L2-L3, L3-L4, and L4-L5 intervertebral discs (IVDs), with AUCs of 0.88 the highest at L5-S1 IVD (0.92). Adaboost demonstrated high performance at the L2-L5 vertebrae with AUC values of 0.82 to 0.90, with the highest AUC (0.97) at the L5-S1 IVD. Among the DL models, GoogleNet outperformed the other models at 30 epochs with an accuracy of 0.85, followed by ResNet 18 (30 epochs) with an accuracy of 0.84. Conclusion The study demonstrated that ML and DL models can effectively predict LBP from MRI T2 weighted image of the lumbar spine. ML and DL models could also enhance the diagnostic accuracy of LBP, potentially leading to better patient management and outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1187/v1?src=rss">Re-conceptualization of the learning environment as a dynamic system [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                In Japanese language education, the term "learning environment" is used in various contexts. This paper investigates the term "learning environment" in previous studies and notes that traditional learning environments have been characterized as "morphological characteristics learning environments" focusing on static learners. However, since learning environments involve a dynamic, reciprocal relationship where learners and their surroundings interact and evolve, the paper advocates for a re-conceptualization of "experiential-ecological learning environments" that captures this dynamic nature. Furthermore, to enrich the experiential-ecological learning environment for learners, the presence of learning environment engineers and the meaningful valuing of environmental enrichments is essential. Lastly, the paper emphasizes that by combining various individual learning experiences, it is possible to create a sustainable and richer learning environment.

                Across species, navigation is crucial for finding both resources and shelter. In vertebrates, the hippocampus supports memory-guided goal-directed navigation, whereas in arthropods the central complex supports similar functions. A growing literature is revealing similarities and differences in the organization and function of these brain regions. We review current knowledge about how each structure supports goal-directed navigation by building internal representations of the position or orientation of an animal in space, and of the location or direction of potential goals. We describe input pathways to each structure – medial and lateral entorhinal cortex in vertebrates, and columnar and tangential neurons in insects – that primarily encode spatial and non-spatial information, respectively. Finally, we highlight similarities and differences in spatial encoding across clades and suggest experimental approaches to compare coding principles and behavioral capabilities across species. Such a comparative approach can provide new insights into the neural basis of spatial navigation and neural computation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97201">Resting natural killer cells promote the progress of colon cancer liver metastasis by elevating tumor-derived stem cell factor</a></h4>

              
                The abundance and biological contribution of natural killer (NK) cells in cancer are controversial. Here, we aim to uncover clinical relevance and cellular roles of NK cells in colon cancer liver metastasis (CCLM). Here, we integrated single-cell RNA-sequencing, spatial transcriptomics (ST), and bulk RNA-sequencing datasets to investigate NK cells’ biological properties and functions in the microenvironment of primary and liver metastatic tumors. Results were validated through an in vitro co-culture experiment based on bioinformatics analysis. Useing single-cell RNA-sequencing and ST, we mapped the immune cellular landscape of colon cancer and well-matched liver metastatic cancer. We discovered that GZMK+ resting NK cells increased significantly in tumor tissues and were enriched in the tumor regions of both diseases. After combining bulk RNA and clinical data, we observed that these NK cell subsets contributed to a worse prognosis. Meanwhile, KIR2DL4+ activated NK cells exhibited the opposite position and relevance. Pseudotime cell trajectory analysis revealed the evolution of activated to resting NK cells. In vitro experiments further confirmed that tumor-cell-co-cultured NK cells exhibited a decidual-like status, as evidenced by remarkable increasing CD9 expression. Functional experiments finally revealed that NK cells exhibited tumor-activating characteristics by promoting the dissociation of SCF (stem cell factor) on the tumor cells membrane depending on cell-to-cell interaction, as the supernatant of the co-culture system enhanced tumor progression. In summary, our findings revealed resting NK cells exhibited a clinical relevance with CCLM, which may be exploited for novel strategies to improve therapeutic outcomes for patients with CCLM.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98300">Benchmarking reveals superiority of deep learning variant callers on bacterial nanopore sequence data</a></h4>

              
                Variant calling is fundamental in bacterial genomics, underpinning the identification of disease transmission clusters, the construction of phylogenetic trees, and antimicrobial resistance detection. This study presents a comprehensive benchmarking of variant calling accuracy in bacterial genomes using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing data. We evaluated three ONT basecalling models and both simplex (single-strand) and duplex (dual-strand) read types across 14 diverse bacterial species. Our findings reveal that deep learning-based variant callers, particularly Clair3 and DeepVariant, significantly outperform traditional methods and even exceed the accuracy of Illumina sequencing, especially when applied to ONT’s super-high accuracy model. ONT’s superior performance is attributed to its ability to overcome Illumina’s errors, which often arise from difficulties in aligning reads in repetitive and variant-dense genomic regions. Moreover, the use of high-performing variant callers with ONT’s super-high accuracy data mitigates ONT’s traditional errors in homopolymers. We also investigated the impact of read depth on variant calling, demonstrating that 10× depth of ONT super-accuracy data can achieve precision and recall comparable to, or better than, full-depth Illumina sequencing. These results underscore the potential of ONT sequencing, combined with advanced variant calling algorithms, to replace traditional short-read sequencing methods in bacterial genomics, particularly in resource-limited settings.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96831">Astrogliosis and neuroinflammation underlie scoliosis upon cilia dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                Cilia defects lead to scoliosis in zebrafish, but the underlying pathogenic mechanisms are poorly understood and may diverge depending on the mutated gene. Here, we dissected the mechanisms of scoliosis onset in a zebrafish mutant for the <i>rpgrip1l</i> gene encoding a ciliary transition zone protein. <i>rpgrip1l</i> mutant fish developed scoliosis with near-total penetrance but asynchronous onset in juveniles. Taking advantage of this asynchrony, we found that curvature onset was preceded by ventricle dilations and was concomitant to the perturbation of Reissner fiber polymerization and to the loss of multiciliated tufts around the subcommissural organ. Rescue experiments showed that Rpgrip1l was exclusively required in <i>foxj1a</i>-expressing cells to prevent axis curvature. Genetic interactions investigations ruled out Urp1/2 levels as a main driver of scoliosis in <i>rpgrip1</i> mutants. Transcriptomic and proteomic studies identified neuroinflammation associated with increased Annexin levels as a potential mechanism of scoliosis development in <i>rpgrip1l</i> juveniles. Investigating the cell types associated with <i>annexin2</i> over-expression, we uncovered astrogliosis, arising in glial cells surrounding the diencephalic and rhombencephalic ventricles just before scoliosis onset and increasing with time in severity. Anti-inflammatory drug treatment reduced scoliosis penetrance and severity and this correlated with reduced astrogliosis and macrophage/microglia enrichment around the diencephalic ventricle. Mutation of the <i>cep290</i> gene encoding another transition zone protein also associated astrogliosis with scoliosis. Thus, we propose astrogliosis induced by perturbed ventricular homeostasis and associated with immune cell activation as a novel pathogenic mechanism of zebrafish scoliosis caused by cilia dysfunction.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95160">Sensory-memory interactions via modular structure explain errors in visual working memory</a></h4>

              
                Errors in stimulus estimation reveal how stimulus representation changes during cognitive processes. Repulsive bias and minimum variance observed near cardinal axes are well-known error patterns typically associated with visual orientation perception. Recent experiments suggest that these errors continuously evolve during working memory, posing a challenge that neither static sensory models nor traditional memory models can address. Here, we demonstrate that these evolving errors, maintaining characteristic shapes, require network interaction between two distinct modules. Each module fulfills efficient sensory encoding and memory maintenance, which cannot be achieved simultaneously in a single-module network. The sensory module exhibits heterogeneous tuning with strong inhibitory modulation reflecting natural orientation statistics. While the memory module, operating alone, supports homogeneous representation via continuous attractor dynamics, the fully connected network forms discrete attractors with moderate drift speed and nonuniform diffusion processes. Together, our work underscores the significance of sensory-memory interaction in continuously shaping stimulus representation during working memory.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91304">Topological stress triggers persistent DNA lesions in ribosomal DNA with ensuing formation of PML-nucleolar compartment</a></h4>

              
                PML, a multifunctional protein, is crucial for forming PML-nuclear bodies involved in stress responses. Under specific conditions, PML associates with nucleolar caps formed after RNA polymerase I (RNAPI) inhibition, leading to PML-nucleolar associations (PNAs). This study investigates PNAs-inducing stimuli by exposing cells to various genotoxic stresses. We found that the most potent inducers of PNAs introduced topological stress and inhibited RNAPI. Doxorubicin, the most effective compound, induced double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the rDNA locus. PNAs co-localized with damaged rDNA, segregating it from active nucleoli. Cleaving the rDNA locus with I-PpoI confirmed rDNA damage as a genuine stimulus for PNAs. Inhibition of ATM, ATR kinases, and RAD51 reduced I-PpoI-induced PNAs, highlighting the importance of ATM/ATR-dependent nucleolar cap formation and homologous recombination (HR) in their triggering. I-PpoI-induced PNAs co-localized with rDNA DSBs positive for RPA32-pS33 but deficient in RAD51, indicating resected DNA unable to complete HR repair. Our findings suggest that PNAs form in response to persistent rDNA damage within the nucleolar cap, highlighting the interplay between PML/PNAs and rDNA alterations due to topological stress, RNAPI inhibition, and rDNA DSBs destined for HR. Cells with persistent PNAs undergo senescence, suggesting PNAs help avoid rDNA instability, with implications for tumorigenesis and aging.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95774">The conserved genetic program of male germ cells uncovers ancient regulators of human spermatogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Male germ cells share a common origin across animal species, therefore they likely retain a conserved genetic program that defines their cellular identity. However, the unique evolutionary dynamics of male germ cells coupled with their widespread leaky transcription pose significant obstacles to the identification of the core spermatogenic program. Through network analysis of the spermatocyte transcriptome of vertebrate and invertebrate species, we describe the conserved evolutionary origin of metazoan male germ cells at the molecular level. We estimate the average functional requirement of a metazoan male germ cell to correspond to the expression of approximately 10,000 protein-coding genes, a third of which defines a genetic scaffold of deeply conserved genes that has been retained throughout evolution. Such scaffold contains a set of 79 functional associations between 104 gene expression regulators that represent a core component of the conserved genetic program of metazoan spermatogenesis. By genetically interfering with the acquisition and maintenance of male germ cell identity, we uncover 161 previously unknown spermatogenesis genes and three new potential genetic causes of human infertility. These findings emphasize the importance of evolutionary history on human reproductive disease and establish a cross-species analytical pipeline that can be repurposed to other cell types and pathologies.

">Sounds and Sights in Sequence Learning: Can Accessory Auditory Cues Enhance Motor Task Performance?</a></h4>

              
                Motor sequence learning, or the ability to learn and remember sequences of actions, such as the sequence of actions required to tie one's shoelaces, is ubiquitous to everyday life. Contemporary research on motor sequence learning has largely been unimodal, ignoring the possibility that our nervous system might benefit from sensory inputs form multiple modalities. In this study, we investigated the properties of motor sequence learning in response to auditory-visual stimui. We found that sequence learning with auditory-visual stimuli showed a hallmark feature of traditional unimodal sequence learning tasks: sensitivity to stimulus timing, where lengthier interstimulus intervals of 500 ms improved sequence learning compared to briefer interstimulus intervals of 200 ms. Consistent with previous findings, we also found that auditory-visual stimuli improved learning compared to a unimodal visual-only condition. Furthermore, the informativeness of the auditory stimuli was important, as auditory stimuli which predicted the location of visual cues improved sequence learning compared to uninformative auditory stimuli which did not predict the location of the visual cues. Our findings suggest a potential utility of leveraging audio-visual stimuli in sequence learning interventions to enhance skill acquisition in education and rehabilitation contexts.

">Endogenous tagging of Munc13-1 with a SNAP tag as a tool for monitoring synapse nanoarchitecture</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic function is governed by highly regulated protein machineries, whose abundance and spatial localization change continually. Studies to determine the dynamic changes in synaptic proteins nanoarchitecture typically rely on immunolabeling, or on the expression of fluorescent proteins. The former employs chemical fluorophores and signal amplification, but re-quires fixation. The latter disturbs the cells minimally, but uses suboptimal fluorophores. Self-labeling tags have been introduced to combine the advantages of these approaches, and here we introduce a knock-in mouse line where the essential synaptic protein Munc13-1 is endogenously fused to the self-labeling SNAP tag. We demonstrate efficient Munc13-1-SNAP labeling in fixed neurons and brain sections by various SNAP dyes, as well as by a novel bright and far-red compound, SBG-SiR-d12, which we introduce here. SBG-SiR-d12 is designed as a membrane impermeable dye, but we repurposed it to stain cytosolic Munc13-1-SNAP in permeabilized, fixed cells and tissue, where we find it outperforms other dyes as evaluated by both conventional and super-resolution microscopy. Finally, we show that Munc13-1-SNAP can also be monitored by live cell imaging. We conclude that the Munc13-1SNAP mouse line is a useful tool for the analysis of Munc13-1 nanoarchitectural dynamics in synapses, with a potential for wide adoption.

">Temporal dynamics and readout latency in perception and iconic memory</a></h4>

              
                Following the offset of complex visual stimuli, rich stimulus information remains briefly available to the observer, reflecting a rapidly decaying iconic memory trace. Traditionally, iconic memory decay is assumed to begin with stimulus offset. Instead, here we found that available information begins decaying already when cues are presented in the final stage of stimulus presentation. Using closely spaced ('micro-timed') readout cues and a theoretical model of information availability, we observed that a cue has to be presented around 10-30 milliseconds before stimulus offset in order to access the full sensory information. We suggest that this does not reflect an early loss in sensory encoding, but instead it is a consequence of a latency in the processing of the cue which postpones the readout of the sensory representation by 10-30 milliseconds. Our analysis also shows that spatial proximity of items in complex arrays impacts sensory representation during both perceptual encoding and initial memory decay. Overall, these results provide a theoretical and empirical characterization of the readout from visual representations, and offer a detailed insight into the transition from perception into iconic memory.

">Thalamic Roles in Conscious Perception Revealed by Low-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Neuromodulation</a></h4>

              
                The neural basis of conscious perception remains incompletely understood. While cortical mechanisms of conscious content have been extensively investigated, the role of subcortical structures, including the thalamus, remains less explored. We aim to elucidate the causal contributions of different thalamic regions to conscious perception using transcranial low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) neuromodulation. We hypothesize that modulating different thalamic regions would result in distinct perceptual outcomes. We apply LIFU in human volunteers to investigate region-specific and sonication parameter-dependent effects. We target anterior (transmodal-dominant) and posterior (unimodal-dominant) thalamic regions, further divided into ventral and dorsal regions, while participants perform a near-threshold visual perception task. Task performance is evaluated using Signal Detection Theory metrics. We find that the high duty cycle stimulation of the ventral anterior thalamus enhanced object recognition sensitivity. We also observe a general (i.e., region-independent) effect of LIFU on decision bias (i.e., a tendency toward a particular response) and object categorization accuracy. Specifically, high duty cycle stimulation decreases categorization accuracy, whereas low duty cycle shifts decision bias towards a more conservative stance. In conclusion, our results provide causal insight into the functional organization of the thalamus in shaping human visual experience and highlight the unique role of the transmodal-dominant ventral anterior thalamus.

	<p>Background. The left and right temporoparietal junctions (TPJs) are two brain areas involved in several brain networks, largely studied for their diverse roles, from attentional orientation to theory of mind and, recently, predictive processing. In predictive processing, one crucial concept is prior precision, that is, the reliability of the predictions of incoming stimuli. This has been linked with modulations of alpha power as measured with electrophysiological techniques, but TPJs have seldom been studied in this framework. Methods. The present article investigates, using magnetoencephalography, whether spontaneous oscillations in pre-stimulus alpha power in the left and right TPJs can modulate brain responses during a linguistic task that requires predictive processing in literal and non-literal sentences. Results. Overall, results show that pre-stimulus alpha power in the rTPJ was associated with post-stimulus responses only in the left superior temporal gyrus, while lTPJ pre-stimulus alpha power was associated with post-stimulus activity in Broca&amp;amp;rsquo;s area, left middle temporal gyrus, and left superior temporal gyrus. Conclusions. We conclude that both the right and left TPJs have a role in linguistic prediction, involving a network of core language regions, with differences across brain areas and linguistic conditions that can be parsimoniously explained in the context of predictive processing.</p>

	<p>Objective: Research about the impact of acute stress on inhibitory control remains a contentious topic, with no consensus reached thus far. This study aims to investigate the effects of acute stress on an individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s inhibitory control abilities and to elucidate the underlying neural mechanisms by analyzing resting state electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Methods: We recruited 32 male college students through participant recruitment information to undergo within-subject experiments under stress and non-stress conditions. Physiological indicators (cortisol and heart rate), self-report questionnaires, and behavioral data from the Stroop task were collected before, during, and after the experiment. Additionally, a five-minute eyes closed resting state EEG data collection was conducted during the Stroop task before. Results: (1) Acute stress led to a reduction in the conflict effect during the participants&amp;amp;rsquo; Stroop task in individuals. (2) Stress resulted in an increase in the power of the beta in the resting state EEG. (3) Acute stress caused an increase in the duration of class D and an increase in the transition probabilities from classes C and B to class D in the microstates of the resting state EEG. (4) Acute stress leads to an increase in beta power values in individuals&amp;amp;rsquo; resting state EEGs, which is significantly negatively correlated with the reduction of the conflict effect in the Stroop task under stress. Conclusions: Acute stress can enhance individuals&amp;amp;rsquo; attentional level, thereby promoting inhibitory control performance.</p>

                <p>Abnormal neuronal morphological features, such as dendrite branching, axonal branching, and spine density, are thought to contribute to the symptoms of depression and anxiety. However, the role and molecular mechanisms of aberrant neuronal morphology in the regulation of mood disorders remain poorly characterized. Here, we show that neuritin, an activity-dependent protein, regulates the axonal morphology of serotonin neurons. Male <I>neuritin</I> knock-out (KO) mice harbored impaired axonal branches of serotonin neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex and basolateral region of the amygdala (BLA), and male <I>neuritin</I> KO mice exhibited depressive and anxiety-like behaviors. We also observed that the expression of neuritin was decreased by unpredictable chronic stress in the male mouse brain and that decreased expression of neuritin was associated with reduced axonal branching of serotonin neurons in the brain and with depressive and anxiety behaviors in mice. Furthermore, the stress-mediated impairments in axonal branching and depressive behaviors were reversed by the overexpression of neuritin in the BLA. The ability of neuritin to increase axonal branching in serotonin neurons involves fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling, and neuritin contributes to FGF-2-mediated axonal branching regulation in vitro. Finally, the oral administration of an FGF inhibitor reduced the axonal branching of serotonin neurons in the brain and caused depressive and anxiety behaviors in male mice. Our results support the involvement of neuritin in models of stress-induced depression and suggest that neuronal morphological plasticity may play a role in controlling animal behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/41/e0350242024?rss=1">Brief and Diverse Excitotoxic Insults Increase the Neuronal Nuclear Membrane Permeability in the Neonatal Brain, Resulting in Neuronal Dysfunction and Cell Death</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuronal cytotoxic edema is implicated in neuronal injury and death, yet mitigating brain edema with osmotic and surgical interventions yields poor clinical outcomes. Importantly, neuronal swelling and its downstream consequences during early brain development remain poorly investigated, and new treatment approaches are needed. We explored Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent downstream effects after neuronal cytotoxic edema caused by diverse injuries in mice of both sexes using multiphoton Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in vivo [Postnatal Day (P)12&ndash;17] and in acute brain slices (P8&ndash;12). After different excitotoxic insults, cytosolic GCaMP6s translocated into the nucleus after a few minutes in a subpopulation of neurons, persisting for hours. We used an automated morphology-detection algorithm to detect neuronal soma and quantified the nuclear translocation of GCaMP6s as the nuclear to cytosolic intensity (<I>N</I>/<I>C</I> ratio). Elevated neuronal <I>N</I>/<I>C</I> ratios occurred concurrently with persistent elevation in Ca<sup>2+</sup> loads and could also occur independently from neuronal swelling. Electron microscopy revealed that the nuclear translocation was associated with the increased nuclear pore size. The nuclear accumulation of GCaMP6s in neurons led to neocortical circuit dysfunction, mitochondrial pathology, and increased cell death. Inhibiting calpains, a family of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated proteases, prevented elevated <I>N</I>/<I>C</I> ratios and neuronal swelling. In summary, in the developing brain, we identified a calpain-dependent alteration of nuclear transport in a subpopulation of neurons after disease-relevant insults leading to long-term circuit dysfunction and cell death. The nuclear translocation of GCaMP6 and other cytosolic proteins after acute excitotoxicity can be an early biomarker of brain injury in the developing brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/41/e0591242024?rss=1">{gamma}1 GABAA Receptors in Spinal Nociceptive Circuits</a></h4>

              
                <p>GABAergic neurons and GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs) are critical elements of almost all neuronal circuits. Most GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs of the CNS are heteropentameric ion channels composed of two &alpha;, two &beta;, and one  subunits. These receptors serve as important drug targets for benzodiazepine (BDZ) site agonists, which potentiate the action of GABA at GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs. Most GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R classifications rely on the heterogeneity of the &alpha; subunit (&alpha;1&ndash;&alpha;6) included in the receptor complex. Heterogeneity of the  subunits (1&ndash;3), which mediate synaptic clustering of GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs and contribute, together with &alpha; subunits, to the benzodiazepine (BDZ) binding site, has gained less attention, mainly because 2 subunits greatly outnumber the other  subunits in most brain regions. Here, we have investigated a potential role of non-2 GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs in neural circuits of the spinal dorsal horn, a key site of nociceptive processing. Female and male mice were studied. We demonstrate that besides 2 subunits, 1 subunits are significantly expressed in the spinal dorsal horn, especially in its superficial layers. Unlike global 2 subunit deletion, which is lethal, spinal cord-specific loss of 2 subunits was well tolerated. GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R clustering in the superficial dorsal horn remained largely unaffected and antihyperalgesic actions of HZ-166, a nonsedative BDZ site agonist, were partially retained. Our results thus suggest that the superficial dorsal horn harbors functionally relevant amounts of 1 subunits that support the synaptic clustering of GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs in this site. They further suggest that 1 containing GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs contribute to the spinal control of nociceptive information flow.</p>

                <p>Serotonin modulates diverse phenotypes and functions including depressive, aggressive, impulsive, and feeding behaviors, all of which have reward-related components. To date, research has focused on understanding these effects by measuring and manipulating dorsal raphe serotonin neurons and using single-receptor approaches. These studies have led to a better understanding of the heterogeneity of serotonin actions on behavior; however, they leave open many questions about the timing and location of serotonin's actions modulating the neural circuits that drive these behaviors. Recent advances in genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors, including the GPCR activation-based sensor for serotonin (GRAB-5-HT), enable the measurement of serotonin release in mice on a timescale compatible with a single rewarding event without corelease confounds. Given substantial evidence from slice electrophysiology experiments showing that serotonin influences neural activity of the striatal circuitry, and the known role of the dorsal medial striatal (DMS) in reward-directed behavior, we focused on understanding the parameters and timing that govern serotonin release in the DMS in the context of reward consumption, external reward value, internal state, and cued reward. Overall, we found that serotonin release is associated with each of these and encodes reward anticipation, value, approach, and consumption in the DMS.</p>

                <p>Emerging research in nonhuman animals implicates cerebellar projections to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in appetitive behaviors, but these circuits have not been characterized in humans. Here, we mapped cerebello-VTA white matter connectivity in a cohort of men and women using probabilistic tractography on diffusion imaging data from the Human Connectome Project. We uncovered the topographical organization of these connections by separately tracking from parcels of cerebellar lobule VI, crus I/II, vermis, paravermis, and cerebrocerebellum. Results revealed that connections between the cerebellum and VTA predominantly originate in the right cerebellar hemisphere, interposed nucleus, and paravermal cortex and terminate mostly ipsilaterally. Paravermal crus I sends the most connections to the VTA compared with other lobules. We discovered a mediolateral gradient of connectivity, such that the medial cerebellum has the highest connectivity with the VTA. Individual differences in microstructure were associated with measures of negative affect and social functioning. By splitting the tracts into quarters, we found that the socioaffective effects were driven by the third quarter of the tract, corresponding to the point at which the fibers leave the deep nuclei. Taken together, we produced detailed maps of cerebello-VTA structural connectivity for the first time in humans and established their relevance for trait differences in socioaffective regulation.</p>

                <p>Recent visual experience heavily influences our visual perception, but how neuronal activity is reshaped to alter and improve perceptual discrimination remains unknown. We recorded from populations of neurons in visual cortical area V4 while two male rhesus macaque monkeys performed a natural image change detection task under different experience conditions. We found that maximizing the recent experience with a particular image led to an improvement in the ability to detect a change in that image. This improvement was associated with decreased neural responses to the image, consistent with neuronal changes previously seen in studies of adaptation and expectation. We found that the magnitude of behavioral improvement was correlated with the magnitude of response suppression. Furthermore, this suppression of activity led to an increase in signal separation, providing evidence that a reduction in activity can improve stimulus encoding. Within populations of neurons, greater recent experience was associated with decreased trial-to-trial shared variability, indicating that a reduction in variability is a key means by which experience influences perception. Taken together, the results of our study contribute to an understanding of how recent visual experience can shape our perception and behavior through modulating activity patterns in the mid-level visual cortex.</p>

                <p>Targeting altered expression and/or activity of GABA (-aminobutyric acid) transporters (GATs) provide therapeutic benefit for age-related impairments, including cognitive dysfunction. However, the mechanisms underlying the transcriptional regulation of GATs are unknown. In the present study, we demonstrated that the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) upregulates GAT1 and GAT3 expression in the brain, which resulted in cognitive dysfunction. Genetic and pharmacological intervention of STING suppressed the expression of both GAT1 and GAT3, increased the ambient GABA concentration, and therefore, enhanced tonic GABA<SUB>A</SUB> inhibition of principal hippocampal neurons, resulting in spatial learning and working memory deficits in mice in a type I interferon-independent manner. Stimulation of the STING-&gt;GAT pathway efficiently restored cognitive dysfunction in STING-deficient mice models. Our study uncovered for the first time that the STING signaling pathway regulates GAT expression in a cell autonomous manner and therefore could be a novel target for GABAergic cognitive deficits.</p>

                <p>&alpha;-Neurexins are essential and highly expressed presynaptic cell-adhesion molecules that are frequently linked to neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Despite their importance, how the elaborate extracellular sequences of &alpha;-neurexins contribute to synapse function is poorly understood. We recently characterized the presynaptic gain-of-function phenotype caused by a missense mutation in an evolutionarily conserved extracellular sequence of neurexin-3&alpha; (A687T) that we identified in a patient diagnosed with profound intellectual disability and epilepsy. The striking A687T gain-of-function mutation on neurexin-3&alpha; prompted us to systematically test using mutants whether the presynaptic gain-of-function phenotype is a consequence of the addition of side-chain bulk (i.e., A687V) or polar/hydrophilic properties (i.e., A687S). We used multidisciplinary approaches in mixed-sex primary hippocampal cultures to assess the impact of the neurexin-3&alpha;<sup>A687</sup> residue on synapse morphology, function and ligand binding. Unexpectedly, neither A687V nor A687S recapitulated the neurexin-3&alpha; A687T phenotype. Instead, distinct from A687T, molecular replacement with A687S significantly enhanced postsynaptic properties exclusively at excitatory synapses and selectively increased binding to neuroligin-1 and neuroligin-3 without changing binding to neuroligin-2 or LRRTM2. Importantly, we provide the first experimental evidence supporting the notion that the position A687 of neurexin-3&alpha; and the N-terminal sequences of neuroligins may contribute to the stability of &alpha;-neurexin&ndash;neuroligin-1 trans-synaptic interactions and that these interactions may specifically regulate the postsynaptic strength of excitatory synapses.</p>

                <p>As evidence mounts that the cardiac-sympathetic nervous system reacts to challenging cognitive settings, we ask if these responses are epiphenomenal companions or if there is evidence suggesting a more intertwined role of this system with cognitive function. Healthy male and female human participants performed an approach-avoidance paradigm, trading off monetary reward for painful electric shock, while we recorded simultaneous electroencephalographic and cardiac-sympathetic signals. Participants were reward sensitive but also experienced approach-avoidance "conflict" when the subjective appeal of the reward was near equivalent to the revulsion of the cost. Drift-diffusion model parameters suggested that participants managed conflict in part by integrating larger volumes of evidence into choices (wider decision boundaries). Late alpha-band (neural) dynamics were consistent with widening decision boundaries serving to combat reward sensitivity and spread attention more fairly to all dimensions of available information. Independently, wider boundaries were also associated with cardiac "contractility" (an index of sympathetically mediated positive inotropy). We also saw evidence of conflict-specific "collaboration" between the neural and cardiac-sympathetic signals. In states of high conflict, the alignment (i.e., product) of alpha dynamics and contractility were associated with a further widening of the boundary, independent of either signal's singular association. Cross-trial coherence analyses provided additional evidence that the autonomic systems controlling cardiac-sympathetics might influence the assessment of information streams during conflict by disrupting or overriding reward processing. We conclude that cardiac-sympathetic control might play a critical role, in collaboration with cognitive processes, during the approach-avoidance conflict in humans.</p>

                <p>During adolescence, cannabis experimentation is common, and its association with interindividual variations in brain maturation well studied. Cellular and molecular underpinnings of these system-level relationships are, however, unclear. We thus conducted a three-step study. First, we exposed adolescent male mice to -9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or a synthetic cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2 (WIN) and assessed differentially expressed genes (DEGs), spine numbers, and dendritic complexity in their frontal cortex. Second, in human (male) adolescents, we examined group differences in cortical thickness in 34 brain regions, using magnetic resonance imaging, between those who experimented with cannabis before age 16 (<I>n</I> = 140) and those who did not (<I>n</I> = 327). Finally, we correlated spatially these group differences with gene expression of human homologs of mouse-identified DEGs. The spatial expression of 13 THC-related human homologs of DEGs correlated with cannabis-related variations in cortical thickness, and virtual histology revealed coexpression patterns of these 13 genes with cell-specific markers of astrocytes, microglia, and a type of pyramidal cells enriched in dendrite-regulating genes. Similarly, the spatial expression of 18 WIN-related human homologs of DEGs correlated with group differences in cortical thickness and showed coexpression patterns with the same three cell types. Gene ontology analysis indicated that 37 THC-related human homologs are enriched in neuron projection development, while 33 WIN-related homologs are enriched in processes associated with learning and memory. In mice, we observed spine loss and lower dendritic complexity in pyramidal cells of THC-exposed animals (vs controls). Experimentation with cannabis during adolescence may influence cortical thickness by impacting glutamatergic synapses and dendritic arborization.</p>

                <p>Decision bias influences estimates of the absolute visual threshold. However, most psychophysical estimates of the murine absolute visual threshold have not taken bias into account. Here we developed a one-alternative forced choice (1AFC) assay to assess the decision bias of mice at the absolute visual threshold via the theory of signal detection and compared our approach with the more conventional high-threshold theoretic approach. In the 1AFC assay, mice of both sexes were trained to signal whether they detected a flash stimulus. We directly measured both hit and false alarm rates, which were used to estimate <I>d'</I>. Using the theory of signal detection, we obtained absolute thresholds by interpolating the intensity where <I>d' </I>= 1 from <I>d'</I>-psychometric functions. This gave bias-independent estimates of the absolute visual threshold which ranged over sixfold, averaging ~1 R* in 1,000 rods (<I>n</I> = 7 mice). To obtain high-threshold theoretic estimates of the absolute visual threshold from the same mice, we estimated threshold intensities from the frequency of seeing curves, corrected for guessing. This gave us thresholds that were strongly correlated with decision bias, ranging over 13-fold and averaged ~1 R* in 2,500 rods. We conclude that the theory of signal detection uses false alarms to overcome decision bias and narrow the range of threshold estimates in mice, providing a powerful tool for understanding detection behavior near absolute visual threshold.</p>

                <p>Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a significant global health issue. Despite historically higher rates among men, AUD prevalence and negative alcohol-related outcomes in women are rising. Loneliness in humans has been associated with increased alcohol use, and traditional rodent drinking models involve single housing, presenting challenges for studying social enrichment. We developed LIQ PARTI (Lick Instance Quantifier with Poly-Animal RFID Tracking Integration), an open-source tool to examine home cage continuous access two-bottle choice drinking behavior in a group-housed setting, investigating the influence of sex and social isolation on ethanol consumption and bout microstructure in C57Bl/6J mice. LIQ PARTI, based on our previously developed single-housed LIQ HD system, accurately tracks drinking behavior using capacitive-based sensors and RFID technology. Group-housed female mice exhibited higher ethanol preference than males, while males displayed a unique undulating pattern of ethanol preference linked to cage changes, suggesting a potential stress or novelty-related response. Chronic ethanol intake distinctly altered bout microstructure between male and female mice, highlighting sex and social environmental influences on drinking behavior. Social isolation with the LIQ HD system amplified fluid intake and ethanol preference in both sexes, accompanied by sex- and fluid-dependent changes in bout microstructure. However, these effects largely reversed upon resocialization, indicating the plasticity of these behaviors in response to social context. Utilizing a novel group-housed home cage lickometer device, our findings illustrate the critical interplay of sex and housing conditions in voluntary alcohol drinking behaviors in C57Bl/6J mice, facilitating nuanced insights into the potential contributions to AUD etiology.</p>

                Background Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) were used or are being used in the manufacturing of products, including consumer-use products. The resulting environmental contamination has led to widespread human exposure. This review aimed to scope the characteristics of evidence covered and applied methodology of evidence to understand -- regardless of any results on the association of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and PFAS -- if a new systematic review would be justified. Methods We systematically identified reports investigating associations of PFAS with GDM following a pre-specified and pre-registered PECO framework and protocol. Results The previous systematic reviews included 8-11 reports and either conducted meta-analyses stratified by comparator, analyzed results based on only high and low exposure categories, or pooled results across comparators. Included 20 reports presented data on 24 PFAS with PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFNA, and PFDA being examined in almost all. The comparators employed were heterogeneous across the reports. Conclusions Because data from at least one new report on GDM is available since the previous systematic reviews and heterogeneous comparators, an updated systematic review using SWiM could add value to the literature.

                Objective To determine whether economic factors are crucial in empowering women, guiding them towards growth and development opportunities, achieving empowerment, and contributing to two sustainable development goals of the 2030 development agenda: ending poverty and achieving gender equality. Methodology The research was foundational, with a phenomenological and hermeneutic design. The applied technique was in-depth interviews with 12 women who had started a business within the last five years in a region of Peru. Results It is evident that economic factors are decisive in business experiences and decisions, highlighting the necessity of having contingency funds to prevent operational impacts. Through entrepreneurship, women achieved economic independence, enabling them to support their families and impacting their empowerment. It concludes that to promote economic opportunity equality, addressing financing needs, encouraging economic independence, strengthening family empowerment, improving customer management, and facilitating access to government funds are essential. Conclusions The narrative of the participants provides a solid foundation for designing specific policies and support programs that boost the economic empowerment of women entrepreneurs and encourage their active participation in the business sphere.

                Introduction Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) is characterized by seizures that are difficult to control for a long time and affect development in children who are previously normal or delayed. Therefore, children with DEE should be diagnosed promptly because certain types of the disease respond well to specific medications. In developing countries with limited universal coverage for whole exome sequencing (WES), identifying key clinical features in this patient group will help us make more accurate selections for investigations. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of WES and its common clinical features in children with epileptic encephalopathy. Methods Ten volunteers aged 0-15 years were diagnosed with epilepsy with two or more symptoms of drug-resistant epilepsy, developmental delays, and abnormal nervous system/or dysmorphic features, and their electroencephalogram (EEG) showed abnormal background or specific patterns of epileptiform discharges. These were subjected to WES for the standard > 400 genes in the epilepsy panel. Results The established diagnosis was 4/10. Two known pathogenic variants, SCN2A and PCDH19. Two novel pathological variants, CHD2 and SCN1A. These are drug-resistant epilepsy, which is initially difficult to control and cannot stop antiseizure medications. Out of the 2/4 had moderate to severe intellectual disability. 3/4 had generalized epileptiform discharge activities. Conclusions This study showed a similar detection rate to that of a previous WES study. All the patients had difficult-to-treat epilepsy. For those who have not found abnormalities with the same clinical symptoms, further examinations using other methods should be conducted.

                <p>by Joshua G. Schraiber, Michael D. Edge, Matt Pennell</p>

In both statistical genetics and phylogenetics, a major goal is to identify correlations between genetic loci or other aspects of the phenotype or environment and a focal trait. In these 2 fields, there are sophisticated but disparate statistical traditions aimed at these tasks. The disconnect between their respective approaches is becoming untenable as questions in medicine, conservation biology, and evolutionary biology increasingly rely on integrating data from within and among species, and once-clear conceptual divisions are becoming increasingly blurred. To help bridge this divide, we lay out a general model describing the covariance between the genetic contributions to the quantitative phenotypes of different individuals. Taking this approach shows that standard models in both statistical genetics (e.g., genome-wide association studies; GWAS) and phylogenetic comparative biology (e.g., phylogenetic regression) can be interpreted as special cases of this more general quantitative-genetic model. The fact that these models share the same core architecture means that we can build a unified understanding of the strengths and limitations of different methods for controlling for genetic structure when testing for associations. We develop intuition for why and when spurious correlations may occur analytically and conduct population-genetic and phylogenetic simulations of quantitative traits. The structural similarity of problems in statistical genetics and phylogenetics enables us to take methodological advances from one field and apply them in the other. We demonstrate by showing how a standard GWAS technique—including both the genetic relatedness matrix (GRM) as well as its leading eigenvectors, corresponding to the principal components of the genotype matrix, in a regression model—can mitigate spurious correlations in phylogenetic analyses. As a case study, we re-examine an analysis testing for coevolution of expression levels between genes across a fungal phylogeny and show that including eigenvectors of the covariance matrix as covariates decreases the false positive rate while simultaneously increasing the true positive rate. More generally, this work provides a foundation for more integrative approaches for understanding the genetic architecture of phenotypes and how evolutionary processes shape it.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The introduction of disease-modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS) has led to a deceleration of disease course over the years. Although decreased relapse rate constitutes a factor, the role of relapse-associated worsening (RAW) and progression independent of relapse activity (PIRA) in MS course deceleration is still unclear.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We retrospectively examined long-term Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) progression in patients referred to the MS Center of Montichiari (Italy) and diagnosed with relapsing–remitting MS from 1980 to 2022. To isolate PIRA, we deducted all EDSS changes associated with relapses from overall EDSS change. We compared the relative contribution of PIRA and RAW to EDSS progression in patients diagnosed in different periods using mixed-effects models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 1,405 patients were included in the study, of whom 231 were diagnosed in 1980–1996 (pre-treatment era), 577 in 1997–2008 (injectable disease-modifying therapy era), and 597 after 2008 (oral drugs, monoclonal antibodies, and anti-CD20 era). Across ages, both PIRA and RAW were reduced in patients diagnosed in more recent periods as compared with earlier periods. The average contribution of PIRA to overall EDSS progression was already predominant in patients diagnosed in 1980–1996 (78%) and in 1997–2008 (76%), but it was significantly increased (<i>p</i> = 0.0009) in patients diagnosed in later years (87%).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The deceleration of MS course observed throughout the years is determined not only by fewer RAW events, but also by a reduction in PIRA. However, the shift toward a mostly relapse-independent progression highlights the importance of evaluating new therapies based on their effect on PIRA. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background The utility of synthetic data in benchmark studies depends on its ability to closely mimic real-world conditions and to reproduce results obtained from experimental data. Here, we evaluate the performance of differential abundance tests for 16S metagenomic data. Building on the benchmark study by Nearing et al. (1), who assessed 14 differential abundance tests using 38 experimental datasets in a case-control design, we validate their findings by generating synthetic datasets that mimics the experimental data. We will employ statistical tests to rigorously assess the similarity between synthetic and experimental data and to validate the conclusions on the performance of these tests drawn by Nearing et al. (1). This protocol adheres to the SPIRIT guidelines and is, to our knowledge, the first of its kind in computational benchmark studies. Methods We replicate Nearing et al.’s (1) methodology, incorporating synthetic data simulated using two distinct tools, mirroring each of the 38 experimental datasets. Equivalence tests will be conducted on 43 data characteristics comparing synthetic and experimental data, complemented by principal component analysis for overall similarity assessment. The 14 differential abundance tests will be applied to both synthetic and experimental datasets, evaluating the consistency of significant feature identification and the number of significant features per tool. Correlation analysis and multiple regression will explore how differences between synthetic and experimental data characteristics may affect the results. Conclusions Synthetic data enables the validation of findings through controlled experiments. We assess how well synthetic data replicates experimental data, validate previous findings and delineate the strengths and limitations of synthetic data in benchmark studies. Moreover, to our knowledge this is the first computational benchmark study to systematically incorporate synthetic data for validating differential abundance methods while strictly adhering to a pre-specified study protocol following SPIRIT guidelines, contributing significantly to transparency, reproducibility, and unbiased research.

                Abstract* Background Increased expression of signal peptide-CUB-EGF domain-containing protein 3 (SCUBE3) and Transforming Growth Factor-β1 (TGF-β1) has been thought to influence the fibrosis process in many tissues. However, increased expression of these two factors has never been assessed in pleural fibrosis. Pleural fibrosis is a disease that usually results from various infectious processes, such as empyema. Fibrosis formation is recently known to be prevented by Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), which is the most potent active substance found in Gambir (Uncaria gambir Roxb) leaves. Thus, further research is needed to determine the potential of EGCG to inhibit the process of pleural fibrosis caused by empyema. Methods An in vitro experimental study with post test-only controlled group was conducted on the pleural tissue of all patients who underwent decortication surgery due to empyema at Dr. M. Djamil Hospital, Padang, Indonesia between March 1st and April 30, 2024. Case samples were obtained by consecutive sampling, and three patients who met the inclusion criteria were obtained. Pleural tissue in each patient was then divided into several groups based on the treatment, namely the control group, 50 μg EGCG administration group, and 100 μg EGCG administration group. We used to determine SCUBE3 and TGF-β1 genes expression. Data were tested using ANOVA and Least Significant Difference (LSD) tests. Results There were significant differences in the SCUBE3 and TGF-β1 genes expression of 50 μg and 100 μg EGCG administration groups and the control groups in the 2 × 2 cm sample preparation (p=0.002) (p=0.014, respectively). Significant differences in TGF-β1 expression were also found between the groups treated with EGCG 50 μg and 100 μg and the control group in the 1 × 1 cm preparation (p=0.019). Conclusion EGCG can potentially decrease SCUBE3 and TGF-β1 expression in patients with pleural empyema.

                Background This study critically examines the dynamics of corruption within Ethiopia’s dam construction projects, focusing on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD the Gilgel Gibe series, and Genale Dawa. The research highlights how weak management practices, insufficient oversight, and centralized decision-making, resulting in contribute to inflated costs, project delays, and compromised construction quality. A comprehensive understanding of these issues is crucial for addressing the challenges that impede Ethiopia’s infrastructure development. Methods A qualitative research approach was employed, integrating both primary and secondary data sources. The study utilized four theoretical frameworks—Principal-Agent Theory, Rent-Seeking Theory, Institutional Theory, and Neo-Patrimonialism—to analyze the structural and behavioral factors enabling corruption in Ethiopia’s dam construction projects. Results The study found that corruption is largely driven by weak management practices, insufficient oversight, and centralized decision-making. These factors contribute to inflated project costs, significant delays, and compromised construction quality. The lack of transparency and inadequate monitoring exacerbate these issues, leading to inefficient resource use and undermining the projects’ intended benefits. Economic impacts include increased public debt and strained financial resources. Socially, corruption erodes public trust and adversely affects the communities involved. The findings also highlight how information asymmetry and misaligned incentives contribute to corruption, with weak governance structures and informal networks further exacerbating the problem. These issues lead to cost overruns, increased debt, and diminished public confidence, which negatively impacts development outcomes. Conclusions While corruption in Ethiopia’s dam construction projects poses significant challenges, it is not insurmountable. Strengthening legal and regulatory frameworks, enhancing institutional capacity, promoting community participation, and leveraging international cooperation are crucial for mitigating these risks. Recommendations include implementing e-procurement systems, establishing independent oversight bodies, and promoting transparency to ensure these mega projects achieve their intended economic and social benefits.

                The year 2023 marked the ten-year anniversary of Chinese President Xi Jinping inaugurating the ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) during his state visit to Kazakhstan. This article discusses China’s approach towards Central Asian countries under the BRI and their responses. While China has evidently profited from expanding connectivity along the ancient silk road and meeting its strategic interests, it is essential to understand whether Central Asian states have equally benefited from this initiative. Furthermore, the concern of debt-trap diplomacy has been prevalent in low-income countries where BRI has been operational. In this context, the article seeks to locate Central Asia in BRI, evaluating its impact on the region to determine if the BRI is a win-win for both the parties involved as touted by China. This article argues that despite differing interests and concerns about potential debt-traps, the BRI has been largely beneficial for both China and Central Asia given that BRI investments and projects remain crucial for the growth and development of these states and the region.

                Background Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Enterococcus faecalis are pathogenic bacteria of the oral cavity that cause various diseases such as periodontitis and endodontics. These bacteria are easily resistant to antibiotics. Photodynamic inactivation (PDI) is a method of inactivating microorganisms that utilizes light to activate a photosensitizer agent (PS) that produces reactive oxygen species causing cell lysis. Methods This study used the PDI method with a 405 nm diode laser at various energy density with the addition PS curcumin or chlorophyll Alfalfa, as much as 1.6 mg/ml on A. actinomycetemcomitans and E. faecalis bacteria. Results The study on E. faecalis bacteria showed that the energy density diode laser irradiation of 1.59 J/cm² gave the percentage of E. faecalis bacteria death 36.7% without PS, 69.30% with the addition of chlorophyll Medicago sativa L and 89.42% with the addition of curcumin. Meanwhile, the bacteria A. actinomycetemcomitans showed that the energy density diode laser irradiation of 1.59 J/cm² gave the percentage of bacterial death 35.81% without PS, 64.39% with the addition of chlorophyll Medicago sativa L and 89.82% with the addition of curcumin. PS was critical to the success of the PDI. Conclusions The addition of PS curcumin increased the effectiveness of reducing bacteria E. faecalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans compared to chlorophyll Medicago sativa L.

                Background New methods for processing ‘touch’ or trace biological samples is an ongoing priority for forensic caseworking laboratories. These samples often contain materials from multiple individuals in varying quantities and/or degrees of degradation. Rapid characterization of cellular material before DNA profiling can allow laboratories to screen samples for the presence of multiple contributors or the amount of biological material present. Methods This dataset contains autofluorescence and morphological profiles of epidermal cell populations analyzed using Imaging Flow Cytometry. The epidermal samples were aged for varying amounts of time prior to analysis. Multiple samples from the same individual were also collected to assess profile variations within and across the contributors. Conclusions This data set may be used to investigate variability in epidermal cell populations from different individuals and potential forensic signatures contained within the non-genetic components that comprise touch biological evidence.

                We developed a new time-calibrated tree incorporating primarily endemic along with some cryptic Ryukyu islands cicada data, following the recent publication of global cicada data by Marshall et al. (2018), Łukasik et al. (2018), Simon et al. (2019), Price et al. (2019), and Hill et al. (2021).  A total of 352 specimens were analyzed using BEAST v1. X software with a relaxed clock model. Fossil calibrations as old as Triassic were adopted largely following Johnson et al. (2018) and Moulds (2018), and a Quaternary geological event calibration was adopted following Osozawa et al. (2012, 2021b) and input into BEAST v1. X. Our timetree suggests that Tettigarctidae had a cicada basal lineage as old as 200.63 Ma, with Derotettiginae the next oldest lineage at 99.2 Ma. Tibicininae is a sister of the remaining subfamilies of Tettigomyiinae, Cicadettinae, and Cicadidae, and their species level differentiation and radiation began at 40.57 Ma. The Cicadinae clade consists of specific tribes with paraphyletic relationship, and the vicariance and adaptive radiation generated many cryptic species in each tribe. We estimated base substitution rate as a function of age, and the result strongly indicates an exponential increase of base substitution rate in recent geologic time. The consequent increase in cicada biodiversity, including generation of cryptic species in the Ryukyu Islands and surroundings, may have been driven by the generation and spreading of C4 grasses and coeval Quaternary climate change.

     alt="Fish That Fish for Fish—A Peculiar Location of “Fishing Motoneurons” in the Striated Frogfish Antennarius striatus"/>
<p>The first dorsal fin of frogfish is used to attract fish as prey and not involved in swimming. Motoneurons for the first dorsal fin (fishing motoneurons) are distributed in the dorsolateral zone of ventral horn, while those for the second, third, and fourth dorsal fins of frogfish, and first dorsal fin of filefish are present in the ventrolateral zone. Fishing motoneurons presumably assume this peculiar position in concert with the evolution of fishing behavior by the first dorsal fin. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In lophiform teleosts, the first dorsal fin has evolved as a specialized structure called the “illicium” equipped with the esca, which is a modified skin flap used to attract small fish for predation. The motor control system of the illicium, however, remained unknown. The present study investigated the innervation of muscles for the illicium and morphology of motoneurons innervating them in the striated frogfish <i>Antennarius striatus</i>. We found that the dorsal ramus of occipital nerve innervates the muscles. Motoneurons for the illicium are present in the dorsolateral zone of ventral horn at the medullo-spinal boundary level, forming a cluster somewhat distinct from other motoneurons of the ventral horn. Motoneurons for the second to fourth dorsal fins and pectoral fin were located in the ventrolateral and ventromedial zones of ventral horn, respectively, whereas those of the dorsal trunk muscle in the dorsomedial zone of ventral horn. Motoneurons for the first dorsal spine of white-spotted pygmy filefish were also investigated for species comparison and were found to locate in the ventrolateral zone of ventral horn, similarly to the motoneurons for the second to fourth dorsal fins of the frogfish. These results suggest that motoneurons for the illicium have become segregated from other motoneurons to be situated in an unusual dorsal position for a motoneuron pool of a dorsal fin, in concert with the evolution of specialized “fishing behavior” performed by the illicium.</p>

<p>This study shows CART-expressing elements in the brain, spinal cord, and retina of a gecko, <i>Hemidactylus leschenaultii</i>. Two putative bioactive CART peptides in this gecko showed several similarities with the avian and mammalian CART. Arcuate nucleus CART neurons were organized into two distinct subdivisions, but only those in the dorsal part responded to NPY via Y<sub>1</sub>-receptor agonist treatment. Conserved neuroanatomy and interaction with NPY suggest CART as an essential molecule and a regulator of energy balance in <i>H. leschenaultii</i>. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Neuropeptide cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) is widely expressed in the brains of teleosts, amphibians, birds, and mammals and has emerged as a conserved regulator of energy balance across these vertebrate phyla. However, as yet, there is no information on CART in the reptilian brain. We characterized the cDNA encoding CART and mapped CART-containing elements in the brain of gecko, <i>Hemidactylus leschenaultii</i> (<i>hl</i>) using a specific anti-CART antiserum. We report a 683-bp <i>hlcart</i> transcript containing a 336-bp open reading frame, which encodes a putative 111-amino acid hl-preproCART. The 89-amino acid hl-proCART generated from hl-preproCART produced two putative bioactive hl-CART-peptides. These bioactive CART-peptides were &gt; 93% similar with those in rats/humans. Although reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detected <i>hlcart</i>-transcript in the brain, CART-containing neurons/fibers were widely distributed in the telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, rhombencephalon, spinal cord, and retina. The mitral cells in olfactory bulb, neurons in the paraventricular, periventricular, arcuate (Arc), Edinger–Westphal, and brainstem nuclei were intensely CART-positive. In view of antagonistic roles of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and CART in energy balance in the framework of mammalian hypothalamus, we probed CART–NPY interaction in the hypothalamus of <i>H. leschenaultii</i>. Double immunofluorescence showed a dense NPY-innervation of Arc CART neurons. <i>Ex vivo</i> hypothalamic slices treated with NPY/NPY-Y<sub>1</sub>-receptor agonist significantly reduced <i>hlcart</i>-mRNA levels in the Arc-containing tissues and CART-ir in the dorsal-Arc. However, CART-ir in ventral-Arc was unaffected. NPY via Y<sub>1</sub>-receptors may regulate energy balance by inhibiting dArc CART neurons. This study on CART in a reptilian brain fills the current void in literature and underscores the conserved feature of the neuropeptide across the entire vertebrate phyla.</p>

Top: an algorithm of the analysis of the neurochemical labeling on the spinal cord slices using NeuN-staining and a ration between the number of motor neurons and non-motor neurons in DA and W rats. Bottom: a ratio between an area of the gray matter and white matter in DA and W rats; and a ratio between the number of neurons expressing parvalbumin (PV) and calbindin (CB) in regions of interest (ROI) in DA and W rats.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Rat strains differ in physiology, behavior, and recovery after central nervous system injury. To assess these differences, we compared the gross and local anatomy and neuromorphology of the lumbar spinal cord of the Wistar and Dark Agouti (DA) strains. The key findings include (i) distinct spatial relationships between vertebrae and spinal segments in the two strains; (ii) Wistar rats have larger volumes of spinal cord gray and white matter; (iii) DA rats have smaller total neuronal populations, thus indicating an expectation of smaller local neuronal populations; (iv) this expectation was confirmed for interneurons expressing calbindin 28 kDa. But contrary to expectations, (v) DA rats had more numerous populations of the interneurons expressing parvalbumin and a population of α-motoneurons. Consequently, these strains displayed divergent ratios in specific spinal neuronal populations. Researchers should consider these inter-strain differences when comparing data across different strains.</p>

                Cellular senescence is a cell state characterized by resistance to apoptosis and stable cell cycle arrest. Senescence was first observed in mitotic cells in vitro. Recent evidence from in vivo studies and human tissue indicates that postmitotic cells, including neurons, may also become senescent. The quiescent cell state of neurons and inconsistent descriptions of neuronal senescence across studies, however, have caused confusion in this burgeoning field. We summarize evidence demonstrating that exit from G0 quiescence may protect neurons against apoptosis and predispose them toward senescence. Additionally, we propose the term ‘neurescent’ for senescent neurons and introduce the cell state, GX, to describe cell cycle arrest achieved by passing through G0 quiescence. Criteria are provided to identify neurescent cells, distinguish them from G0 quiescent neurons, and compare neurescent phenotypes with classic replicative senescence.

                Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), a collection of small proteins with important roles in classical innate immunity, have been extensively studied in multiple organisms, particularly in Drosophila melanogaster. Advances in CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing have allowed individual AMP functions to be dissected, revealing specific and selective roles in host defense. Recent findings have also revealed many unexpected contributions of endogenous AMPs to neuronal functions and neurodegenerative diseases, and have shed light on the intersections between innate immunity and neurobiology. We explore the intricate relationships between AMPs and sleep regulation, memory formation, as well as traumatic brain injury and several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Understanding the diverse functions of AMPs opens new avenues for neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative disease research and potential therapeutic development.

                The diverse etiologies of the genetic neurodegenerative disorder known as primary familial brain calcification have dimmed hopes for curative therapies. However, two new papers in Neuron provide a reason for optimism by identifying mechanisms involved in brain phosphate transport and a promising target for restoring phosphate balance in the brain.

                Visual perception requires aligned feedforward and feedback processing, yet the role of experience remains unclear. The study by Dias et al. in this issue of Neuron shows that the retinotopic organization of orientation-tuned feedback from higher to primary visual cortex is learned in mice.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88813">Negative cell cycle regulation by calcineurin is necessary for proper beta cell regeneration in zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Stimulation of pancreatic beta cell regeneration could be a therapeutic lead to treat diabetes. Unlike humans, the zebrafish can efficiently regenerate beta cells, notably from ductal pancreatic progenitors. To gain insight into the molecular pathways involved in this process, we established the transcriptomic profile of the ductal cells after beta cell ablation in the adult zebrafish. These data highlighted the protein phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) as a new potential modulator of beta cell regeneration. We showed that CaN overexpression abolished the regenerative response, leading to glycemia dysregulation. On the opposite, CaN inhibition increased ductal cell proliferation and subsequent beta cell regeneration. Interestingly, the enhanced proliferation of the progenitors was paradoxically coupled with their exhaustion. This suggests that the proliferating progenitors are next entering in differentiation. CaN appears as a guardian which prevents an excessive progenitor proliferation to preserve the pool of progenitors. Altogether, our findings reveal CaN as a key player in the balance between proliferation and differentiation to enable a proper beta cell regeneration.

                Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing (ATAC-Seq) is a widely used technique to explore gene regulatory mechanisms. For most ATAC-Seq data from healthy and diseased tissues such as tumors, chromatin accessibility measurement represents a mixed signal from multiple cell types. In this work, we derive reliable chromatin accessibility marker peaks and reference profiles for most non-malignant cell types frequently observed in the microenvironment of human tumors. We then integrate these data into the EPIC deconvolution framework (Racle et al., 2017) to quantify cell-type heterogeneity in bulk ATAC-Seq data. Our EPIC-ATAC tool accurately predicts non-malignant and malignant cell fractions in tumor samples. When applied to a human breast cancer cohort, EPIC-ATAC accurately infers the immune contexture of the main breast cancer subtypes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98363">Pathogenic Huntingtin aggregates alter actin organization and cellular stiffness resulting in stalled clathrin mediated endocytosis</a></h4>

              
                Aggregation of mutant forms of Huntingtin is the underlying feature of neurodegeneration observed in Huntington's disorder. In addition to neurons, cellular processes in non-neuronal cell types are also shown to be affected. Cells expressing neurodegeneration-associated mutant proteins show altered uptake of ligands, suggestive of impaired endocytosis, in a manner as yet unknown. Using live cell imaging, we show that clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is affected in <i>Drosophila</i> hemocytes and mammalian cells containing Huntingtin aggregates. This is also accompanied by alterations in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton resulting in increased cellular stiffness. Further, we find that Huntingtin aggregates sequester actin and actin-modifying proteins. Overexpression of Hip1 or Arp3 (actin-interacting proteins) could restore CME and cellular stiffness in cells containing Huntingtin aggregates. Neurodegeneration driven by pathogenic Huntingtin was also rescued upon overexpression of either Hip1 or Arp3 in <i>Drosophila</i>. Examination of other pathogenic aggregates revealed that TDP-43 also displayed defective CME, altered actin organization and increased stiffness, similar to pathogenic Huntingtin. Together, our results point to an intimate connection between dysfunctional CME, actin misorganization and increased cellular stiffness caused by alteration in the local intracellular environment by pathogenic aggregates.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98949">Transcriptional responses in a mouse model of silicone wire embolization induced acute retinal artery ischemia and reperfusion</a></h4>

              
                Acute retinal ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion injury are the primary causes of retinal neural cell death and vision loss in retinal artery occlusion (RAO). The absence of an accurate mouse model for simulating the retinal ischemic process has hindered progress in developing neuroprotective agents for RAO. We developed a unilateral pterygopalatine ophthalmic artery occlusion (UPOAO) mouse model using silicone wire embolization combined with carotid artery ligation. The survival of retinal ganglion cells and visual function were evaluated to determine the duration of ischemia. Immunofluorescence staining, optical coherence tomography, and haematoxylin and eosin staining were utilized to assess changes in major neural cell classes and retinal structure degeneration at two reperfusion durations. Transcriptomics was employed to investigate alterations in the pathological process of UPOAO following ischemia and reperfusion, highlighting transcriptomic differences between UPOAO and other retinal ischemia-reperfusion models. The UPOAO model successfully replicated the acute interruption of retinal blood supply observed in RAO. 60 min of Ischemia led to significant loss of major retinal neural cells and visual function impairment. Notable thinning of the inner retinal layer, especially the ganglion cell layer, was evident post-UPOAO. Temporal transcriptome analysis revealed various pathophysiological processes related to immune cell migration, oxidative stress, and immune inflammation during the non-reperfusion and reperfusion periods. A pronounced increase in microglia within the retina and peripheral leukocytes accessing the retina was observed during reperfusion periods. Comparison of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the UPOAO and high intraocular pressure models revealed specific enrichments in lipid and steroid metabolism-related genes in the UPOAO model. The UPOAO model emerges as a novel tool for screening pathogenic genes and promoting further therapeutic research in RAO.

">Motifs of human hippocampal and cortical high frequency oscillations structure processing and memory of naturalistic stimuli</a></h4>

              
                The discrete events of our narrative experience are organized by the neural substrate that underlies episodic memory. This narrative process is segmented into discrete units by event boundaries. This permits a replay process that acts to consolidate each event into a narrative memory. High frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a potential mechanism for synchronizing neural activity during these processes. Here, we use intracranial recordings from participants viewing and freely recalling a naturalistic stimulus. We show that hippocampal HFOs increase following event boundaries and that coincident hippocampal-cortical HFOs (co-HFOs) occur in cortical regions previously shown to underlie event segmentation (inferior parietal, precuneus, lateral occipital, inferior frontal cortices). We also show that event-specific patterns of co-HFOs that occur during event viewing re-occur following the subsequent three event boundaries (in decaying fashion) and also during recall. This is consistent with models that support replay as a mechanism for memory consolidation. Hence, HFOs may coordinate activity across brain regions serving widespread event segmentation, encode naturalistic memory, and bind representations to assemble memory of a coherent, continuous experience.

                MID1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase of the tripartite motif (TRIM) subfamily of RING-containing protein. MID1 is involved in many basic biological processes, especially during embryonic development. Mutation, truncation or complete deletion of MID1 gene is the cause of Opitz G/BBB syndrome (OS). OS is a rare genetic disease of nervous system, which is characterized by midline structural development defects during embryogenesis, including structural brain abnormalities, developmental retardation and mental retardation. Although the function of MID1 has been studied for many years, the effect and mechanism of complete deletion of MID1 gene on OS nervous system still need to be further explored. Here we find that Mid1 gene is necessary for the normal development of hippocampus (HPC), and Mid1 gene knockout (Mid1-/y) mice showed a significant decrease in alpha rhythm in HPC and abnormal synchronization of gamma rhythm in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus (PFC-HPC), showing decreased synaptic plasticity and learning and memory dysfunction.

">Loss of Flower/FLWR-1 induces an increase in neuronal excitability and causes defective recycling of synaptic vesicles</a></h4>

              
                The Flower protein is proposed to couple synaptic vesicle fusion to recycling in different model organisms. It is supposed to trigger activity-dependent bulk endocytosis by conducting Ca2+ at endocytic sites. However, this mode of action is debated. Here, we investigate the role of the nematode homolog (FLWR-1) in neurotransmission in Caenorhabditis elegans. Our results confirm that FLWR-1 facilitates the recycling of synaptic vesicles at the neuromuscular junction. Ultrastructural analysis of synaptic boutons after hyperstimulation surprisingly reveals an accumulation of endosomal structures in flwr-1 mutants. These findings do not support a role of FLWR-1 in the formation of bulk endosomes but rather a function in their breakdown following cleavage from the plasma membrane. Unexpectedly, loss of FLWR-1 conveys increased neuronal excitability which causes an excitation-inhibition imbalance. Finally, we obtained evidence that this increased transmission at the neuromuscular junction might be caused by deregulation of MCA-3, the nematode homolog of the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA).

">Perinatal Reduction of Genetically Aberrant Neurons from Human Cerebral Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Since human neurons are postmitotic and long-lived, the regulation of their genomic content is crucial. Normal neuronal function is uniquely dependent on gene dosage, with diverse genome copy number alterations (CNA) associated with neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions. In this study, we evaluated the landscape of CNA arising in normal human brains, focusing on prenatal and perinatal ages. We surveyed ~5,897 CNA in >1,200 single neurons from human postmortem brain of individuals without a neurological diagnosis, ranging in age from gestational week (GW) 14 to 90 years old. Using Tn5-based single-cell whole-genome amplification (scWGA) and informatic advances to validate CNAs in single neurons, we determined that a striking proportion of neurons (up to 45%) in human prenatal cortex showed aberrant genomes, characterized by large-scale CNAs in multiple chromosomes, which reduces significantly during the perinatal period (p<0.1). Furthermore, we identified micronuclei in the developing cortex, reflecting genetic instability reminiscent of that described in early embryonic development. The scale of CNA appeared to alter the trajectory of neuronal elimination, as subchromosomal CNAs were more slowly eliminated, over the course of a lifetime. CNAs were depleted for dosage-sensitive genes and genes involved in neurodevelopmental disorders (p<.05), and thus represent genomic quality control mechanisms that eliminate selectively those neurons with CNA involving critical genes. Perinatal elimination of defective neuronal genomes may in turn reflect a developmental landmark essential for normal cognitive function.

">Electrophysiological decoding captures the temporal trajectory of face categorization in infants</a></h4>

              
                The adult human brain rapidly distinguishes between faces at around 170 milliseconds after stimulus onset. In the developing brain, however, the time course of face discrimination is poorly understood. To shed light on this issue, we presented human and nonhuman primate faces to five to thirteen-month-old infants in an event-related electroencephalography experiment. Using time-resolved decoding based on logistic regression we detected above-chance discrimination of human faces from nonhuman faces in a time window starting at around 200 milliseconds, originating from occipito-temporal electrodes. There was no evidence, however, for above-chance discrimination of individual human or individual nonhuman faces. Moreover, using neural network-based decoding, we delivered the proof of principle that face categorization but not individuation can be detected even at the level of single participants. These results indicate that rapid face categorization emerges already in preverbal infants.

">Computational neurodevelopment: infant decision-making in changing environments</a></h4>

              
                In recognition of the fact that most psychiatric conditions have neurodevelopmental origins, there is an increasing interest in applying the methodological and conceptual approaches from computational psychiatry to developmental cohorts. However, the challenge of acquiring and modelling behavioural responses in very young infants has thus far proven difficult to overcome. To address this we developed a novel gaze-contingent, cued-reversal paradigm that allowed 6-10 month old infants to make overt behavioural responses to assess learning of expectations and updating of behaviour in response to change. We then fit computational models to infant behaviour and, for the first time, were able to validate the winning model to the same standards as would be expected of adults (e.g. good parameter recoverability, model identifiability and simulated behavioural responses). Similar to prior findings in adults, model-based prediction error measures correlated with post-switch increases in pupil size; consistent with noradrenaline's hypothesised role in learning about change. Data-driven clustering based on model parameters revealed two infant behavioural subtypes hidden within the data; one with a perseverating profile and the other with a more exploratory decision-making pattern. This approach sheds new light on the classic finding that all infants under 12 months tend to perseverate. Crucially, there were no significant differences in age between the clusters, but differences in terms of adaptive skills and temperament measured via gold-standard developmental assessments. These results prime the field for infant computational psychiatry, demonstrating that we can reliably fit models to infant data and that the parameters from such models can identify subgroups with distinct cognitive profiles that are superior to those derived from the behavioural data alone.

	<p>Background: Advances in diagnostic procedures have led to an increasing rate of diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis or paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (AE/PNS) among patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)-like manifestations. Methods: In this narrative review, we first discuss the clinical characteristics of AE/PNS in comparison to those of PSP, followed by a discussion of diagnosis and treatment. Results: The antibodies involved in these conditions include anti-IgLON5, -Ma2, and -Ri antibodies, each of which has a characteristic clinical presentation. The steps in the diagnosis of AE/PNS in patients with PSP-like manifestations include (i) suspicion of AE/PNS based on clinical presentations atypical of PSP and (ii) antibody detection measures. Methods used to identify antibodies include a combination of tissue-based assays and confirmatory tests. The primary confirmatory tests include cell-based assays and immunoblotting. Treatments can be divided into immunotherapy and tumor therapies, the former of which includes acute and maintenance therapies. Conclusions: One of the major challenges of diagnosis is that existing reports on PSP-like patients with AE/PNS include only case reports, with the majority discussing antibodies other than anti-IgLON5 antibody. As such, more patients need to be evaluated to establish the relationship between antibodies and PSP-like manifestations.</p>

                <p>by Yi Luo, Terry Lohrenz, Ellen A. Lumpkin, P. Read Montague, Kenneth T. Kishida</p>

Expectations shape our perception, profoundly influencing how we interpret the world. Positive expectations about sensory stimuli can alleviate distress and reduce pain (e.g., placebo effect), while negative expectations may heighten anxiety and exacerbate pain (e.g., nocebo effect). To investigate the impact of the (an)hedonic aspect of expectations on subjective experiences, we measured neurobehavioral responses to the taste of hot sauce among participants with heterogeneous taste preferences. By identifying participants who “liked” versus those who strongly “disliked” spicy flavors and by providing contextual cues about the spiciness of the sauce to be tasted, we dissociated the effects of positive and negative expectations from sensory stimuli (i.e., visual and gustatory stimuli), which were the same across all participants. Our results indicate that positive expectations lead to modulations in the intensity of subjective experience. These modulations were accompanied by increased activity in brain regions previously linked to information integration and the placebo effect, including the anterior insula, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, as well as a predefined “pleasure signature.” In contrast, negative expectations decreased hedonic experience and increased neural activity in the previously validated “Neurological Pain Signature” network. These findings demonstrate that hedonic aspects of one’s expectations asymmetrically shape how the brain processes sensory input and associated behavioral reports of one’s subjective experiences of intensity, pleasure, and pain. Our results suggest a dissociable impact of hedonic information: positive expectations facilitate higher-level information integration and reward processing, while negative expectations prime lower-level nociceptive and affective processes. This study demonstrates the powerful role of hedonic expectations in shaping subjective reality and suggests potential avenues for consumer and therapeutic interventions targeting expectation-driven neural processes.

                <p>by Ana María Triana, Juha Salmi, Nicholas Mark Edward Alexander Hayward, Jari Saramäki, Enrico Glerean</p>

Our behavior and mental states are constantly shaped by our environment and experiences. However, little is known about the response of brain functional connectivity to environmental, physiological, and behavioral changes on different timescales, from days to months. This gives rise to an urgent need for longitudinal studies that collect high-frequency data. To this end, for a single subject, we collected 133 days of behavioral data with smartphones and wearables and performed 30 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans measuring attention, memory, resting state, and the effects of naturalistic stimuli. We find traces of past behavior and physiology in brain connectivity that extend up as far as 15 days. While sleep and physical activity relate to brain connectivity during cognitively demanding tasks, heart rate variability and respiration rate are more relevant for resting-state connectivity and movie-watching. This unique data set is openly accessible, offering an exceptional opportunity for further discoveries. Our results demonstrate that we should not study brain connectivity in isolation, but rather acknowledge its interdependence with the dynamics of the environment, changes in lifestyle, and short-term fluctuations such as transient illnesses or restless sleep. These results reflect a prolonged and sustained relationship between external factors and neural processes. Overall, precision mapping designs such as the one employed here can help to better understand intraindividual variability, which may explain some of the observed heterogeneity in fMRI findings. The integration of brain connectivity, physiology data and environmental cues will propel future environmental neuroscience research and support precision healthcare.

                Background Mucormycosis is a life-threatening fungal infection. Rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM) and pulmonary mucormycosis (PM) are the most common presentations. This systematic review focuses on the management of PM. Although the mortality from PM has improved over the last few decades, it is still high, at 49.8% (Muthu, Agarwal, et al., 2021). Objective The objective is to identify and map the management of PM. Design This review is designed for knowledge synthesis, with a systematic approach to identifying, synthesizing, and mapping treatment protocols for the management of PM. Methods This systematic review provides a clear, reproducible methodology. It is reported in accordance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). Inclusion criteria were defined: peer-reviewed journal articles published in English from 2018 to 2023 relating to treatment protocols for PM, where the full text of the article was available. Exclusion criteria were also defined - articles that focus on limited treatment regimens, such as the use of amphotericin B only, or topics not relevant to the research question, such as fungal infections and pulmonary diseases unrelated to mucormycosis. Results The results span six years, from 2018 to 2023, with 355 articles identified. After removing duplicates, 227 papers remained. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, with 202 articles excluded as a result. The remaining 19 articles were deemed relevant. In addition, seven relevant articles were identified via citation tracking and two articles identified by hand search. Thus, a total of 28 articles thus reviewed. The management of PM was mapped in tabular and diagrammatic form. Conclusion The results indicate that early diagnosis, early and aggressive surgery, and effective antifungals may improve survival. There is a shift away from using Am-B and a clear preference for L-AmB as a first-line antifungal. Posaconazole and Isavuconazole are the drugs of choice for stepdown, maintenance, and salvage therapy, and as alternative therapies. The control of co-morbidities is a crucial aspect of treatment. Cytokines and hyperbaric oxygen may be beneficial. The therapeutic value of iron chelators, zinc, and nebulized amphotericin B (NAB) merit further study.

                Despite the growing interest in social prescribing the diversification of health and social care strategies to support the well-being of patients has remained entrenched with a focus on the hospital setting within the Middle East. The United Arab Emirates has commenced progressing community mental health care to lead changes in how care and treatment are delivered within the United Arab Emirates. The authors adopted the use of the framework of Arksey and O’Malley (2005) to provide a systematic approach to searching the literature and creating a comprehensive foundation to guide the review. This scoping review provides a better understanding of the compatibility, content and outcomes of a selection of health models whilst also allowing further clarification before empirical studies. The scoping review findings will inform the proposed use of social prescribing as an actionable approach to create a focus on the need to include and empower the social determinants of mental health. This article proposes an evidence-based health strategy that supports and enhances recent additions to national legislation on the inclusion of the Mental Health Law within the United Arab Emirates to meditate and prevent inequities in addressing the mental health needs of citizens and residents within the nation’s diverse communities.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23643?af=R">Adult Neurogenesis and the Initiation of Social Aggression in Male Mice</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The hippocampus is important for social behavior and exhibits unusual structural plasticity in the form of continued production of new granule neurons throughout adulthood, but it is unclear how adult neurogenesis contributes to social interactions. In the present study, we suppressed neurogenesis using a pharmacogenetic mouse model and examined social investigation and aggression in adult male mice to investigate the role of hippocampal adult-born neurons in the expression of aggressive behavior. In simultaneous choice tests with stimulus mice placed in corrals, mice with complete suppression of adult neurogenesis in adulthood (TK mice) exhibited normal social investigation behaviors, indicating that new neurons are not required for social interest, social memory, or detection of and response to social olfactory signals. However, mice with suppressed neurogenesis displayed decreased offensive and defensive aggression in a resident-intruder paradigm, and less resistance in a social dominance test, relative to neurogenesis-intact controls, when paired with weight and strain-matched (CD-1) mice. During aggression tests, TK mice were frequently attacked by the CD-1 intruder mice, which never occurred with WTs, and normal CD-1 male mice investigated TK mice less than controls when corralled in the social investigation test. Importantly, TK mice showed normal aggression toward prey (crickets) and smaller, nonaggressive (olfactory bulbectomized) C57BL/6J intruders, suggesting that mice lacking adult neurogenesis do not avoid aggressive social interactions if they are much larger than their opponent and will clearly win. Taken together, our findings show that adult hippocampal neurogenesis plays an important role in the instigation of intermale aggression, possibly by weighting a cost–benefit analysis against confrontation in cases where the outcome of the fight is not clear.</p>

                Zhang et al. show that STAMBPL1 reduces lysosome degradation of EGFR by binding to STAM1 and facilitates RNA splicing of EGFR by deubiquitinating TOE1. The EGFR-MYC axis promotes the transcription of STAMBPL1 and RNA splicing of EGFR. Inhibition of STAMBPL1 attenuates liver tumorigenesis and improves the antitumor activity of lenvatinib.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96190">A modified BPaL regimen for tuberculosis treatment replaces linezolid with inhaled spectinamides</a></h4>

              
                The Nix-TB clinical trial evaluated a new 6 month regimen containing three oral drugs; bedaquiline (B), pretomanid (Pa), and linezolid (L) (BPaL regimen) for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB). This regimen achieved remarkable results as almost 90% of the multidrug-resistant or extensively drug-resistant TB participants were cured but many patients also developed severe adverse events (AEs). The AEs were associated with the long-term administration of the protein synthesis inhibitor linezolid. Spectinamide 1599 is also a protein synthesis inhibitor of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> with an excellent safety profile, but it lacks oral bioavailability. Here, we propose to replace L in the BPaL regimen with spectinamide (S) administered via inhalation and we demonstrate that inhaled spectinamide 1599, combined with BPa ––BPaS regimen––has similar efficacy to that of the BPaL regimen while simultaneously avoiding the L-associated AEs. The BPaL and BPaS regimens were compared in the BALB/c and C3HeB/FeJ murine chronic TB efficacy models. After 4-weeks of treatment, both regimens promoted equivalent bactericidal effects in both TB murine models. However, treatment with BPaL resulted in significant weight loss and the complete blood count suggested the development of anemia. These effects were not similarly observed in mice treated with BPaS. BPaL and BPa, but not the BPaS treatment, also decreased myeloid to erythroid ratio suggesting the S in the BPaS regimen was able to recover this effect. Moreover, the BPaL also increased concentration of proinflammatory cytokines in bone marrow compared to mice receiving BPaS regimen. These combined data suggest that inhaled spectinamide 1599 combined with BPa is an effective TB regimen without L-associated AEs.
