              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08831">Path to Intelligence: Measuring Similarity between Human Brain and Large Language Model Beyond Language Task</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.08831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated human-like abilities in language-based tasks. While language is a defining feature of human intelligence, it emerges from more fundamental neurophysical processes rather than constituting the basis of intelligence itself. In this work, we study the similarity between LLM internal states and human brain activity in a sensory-motor task rooted in anticipatory and visuospatial behavior. These abilities are essential for cognitive performance that constitute human intelligence. We translate the sensory-motor task into natural language in order to replicate the process for LLMs. We extract hidden states from pre-trained LLMs at key time steps and compare them to human intracranial EEG signals. Our results reveal that LLM-derived reactions can be linearly mapped onto human neural activity. These findings suggest that LLMs, with a simple natural language translation to make them understand temporal-relevant tasks, can approximate human neurophysical behavior in experiments involving sensory stimulants. In all, our contribution is two-fold: (1) We demonstrate similarity between LLM and human brain activity beyond language-based tasks. (2) We demonstrate that with such similarity, LLMs could help us understand human brains by enabling us to study topics in neuroscience that are otherwise challenging to tackle.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09213">A novel cost-effective fabrication of a flexible neural probe for brain signal recording</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.09213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel, flexible, and implantable neural probe using a cost-effective microfabrication process based on a thin polyimide film. Polyimide film, known as Kapton, serves as a flexible substrate for microelectrodes, conductive tracks, and contact pads of the probe, which are made from a thin film of gold (Au). SU-8 is used to cover the corresponding tracks for electrical isolation and to increase the stiffness of the probe for better implantation. To evaluate the performance of the fabricated probe, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and artificial neural signal recording have been used to characterize its properties. The microelectrode dimensions have been carefully chosen to provide low impedance characteristics, which are necessary for acquiring local field potential (LFP) signals. The in vivo LFP data have been obtained from a male zebra finch presented with auditory stimuli. By properly filtering the extracellular recordings and analyzing the data, the obtained results have been validated by comparing them with the signals acquired with a commercial neural electrode. Due to the use of Kapton, SU-8, and Au materials with non-toxic and adaptable properties in the body environment, the fabricated neural probe is considered a promising biocompatible implantable neural probe that may pave the way for the fabrication of other neural implantable devices with commercial aims.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09152">LITcoder: A General-Purpose Library for Building and Comparing Encoding Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.09152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce LITcoder, an open-source library for building and benchmarking neural encoding models. Designed as a flexible backend, LITcoder provides standardized tools for aligning continuous stimuli (e.g., text and speech) with brain data, transforming stimuli into representational features, mapping those features onto brain data, and evaluating the predictive performance of the resulting model on held-out data. The library implements a modular pipeline covering a wide array of methodological design choices, so researchers can easily compose, compare, and extend encoding models without reinventing core infrastructure. Such choices include brain datasets, brain regions, stimulus feature (both neural-net-based and control, such as word rate), downsampling approaches, and many others. In addition, the library provides built-in logging, plotting, and seamless integration with experiment tracking platforms such as Weights & Biases (W&B). We demonstrate the scalability and versatility of our framework by fitting a range of encoding models to three story listening datasets: LeBel et al. (2023), Narratives, and Little Prince. We also explore the methodological choices critical for building encoding models for continuous fMRI data, illustrating the importance of accounting for all tokens in a TR scan (as opposed to just taking the last one, even when contextualized), incorporating hemodynamic lag effects, using train-test splits that minimize information leakage, and accounting for head motion effects on encoding model predictivity. Overall, LITcoder lowers technical barriers to encoding model implementation, facilitates systematic comparisons across models and datasets, fosters methodological rigor, and accelerates the development of high-quality high-performance predictive models of brain activity.

                arXiv:2505.10444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for inferring entropy production (EP) in high-dimensional stochastic systems, including many-body systems and non-Markovian systems with long memory. Standard techniques for estimating EP become intractable in such systems due to computational and statistical limitations. We infer trajectory-level EP and lower bounds on average EP by exploiting a nonequilibrium analogue of the Maximum Entropy principle, along with convex duality. Our approach uses only samples of trajectory observables, such as spatiotemporal correlations. It does not require reconstruction of high-dimensional probability distributions or rate matrices, nor impose any special assumptions such as discrete states or multipartite dynamics. In addition, it may be used to compute a hierarchical decomposition of EP, reflecting contributions from different interaction orders, and it has an intuitive physical interpretation as a "thermodynamic uncertainty relation." We demonstrate its numerical performance on a disordered nonequilibrium spin model with 1000 spins and a large neural spike-train dataset.

                arXiv:2509.08986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous purportedly improved metaheuristics claim superior performance based on equivalent function evaluations (FEs), yet often conceal additional computational burdens in more intensive iterations, preprocessing stages, or hyperparameter tuning. This paper posits that wall-clock time, rather than solely FEs, should serve as the principal budgetary constraint for equitable comparisons. We formalize a fixed-time, restart-fair benchmarking protocol wherein each algorithm is allotted an identical wall-clock time budget per problem instance, permitting unrestricted utilization of restarts, early termination criteria, and internal adaptive mechanisms. We advocate for the adoption of anytime performance curves, expected running time (ERT) metrics, and performance profiles that employ time as the cost measure, all aimed at predefined targets. Furthermore, we introduce a concise, reproducible checklist to standardize reporting practices and mitigate undisclosed computational overheads. This approach fosters more credible and practically relevant evaluations of metaheuristic algorithms.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09529">A modified RIME algorithm with covariance learning and diversity enhancement for numerical optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.09529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metaheuristics are widely applied for their ability to provide more efficient solutions. The RIME algorithm is a recently proposed physical-based metaheuristic algorithm with certain advantages. However, it suffers from rapid loss of population diversity during optimization and is prone to fall into local optima, leading to unbalanced exploitation and exploration. To address the shortcomings of RIME, this paper proposes a modified RIME with covariance learning and diversity enhancement (MRIME-CD). The algorithm applies three strategies to improve the optimization capability. First, a covariance learning strategy is introduced in the soft-rime search stage to increase the population diversity and balance the over-exploitation ability of RIME through the bootstrapping effect of dominant populations. Second, in order to moderate the tendency of RIME population to approach the optimal individual in the early search stage, an average bootstrapping strategy is introduced into the hard-rime puncture mechanism, which guides the population search through the weighted position of the dominant populations, thus enhancing the global search ability of RIME in the early stage. Finally, a new stagnation indicator is proposed, and a stochastic covariance learning strategy is used to update the stagnant individuals in the population when the algorithm gets stagnant, thus enhancing the ability to jump out of the local optimal solution. The proposed MRIME-CD algorithm is subjected to a series of validations on the CEC2017 test set, the CEC2022 test set, and the experimental results are analyzed using the Friedman test, the Wilcoxon rank sum test, and the Kruskal Wallis test. The results show that MRIME-CD can effectively improve the performance of basic RIME and has obvious superiorities in terms of solution accuracy, convergence speed and stability.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09552">An improved educational competition optimizer with multi-covariance learning operators for global optimization problems</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.09552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The educational competition optimizer is a recently introduced metaheuristic algorithm inspired by human behavior, originating from the dynamics of educational competition within society. Nonetheless, ECO faces constraints due to an imbalance between exploitation and exploration, rendering it susceptible to local optima and demonstrating restricted effectiveness in addressing complex optimization problems. To address these limitations, this study presents an enhanced educational competition optimizer (IECO-MCO) utilizing multi-covariance learning operators. In IECO, three distinct covariance learning operators are introduced to improve the performance of ECO. Each operator effectively balances exploitation and exploration while preventing premature convergence of the population. The effectiveness of IECO is assessed through benchmark functions derived from the CEC 2017 and CEC 2022 test suites, and its performance is compared with various basic and improved algorithms across different categories. The results demonstrate that IECO-MCO surpasses the basic ECO and other competing algorithms in convergence speed, stability, and the capability to avoid local optima. Furthermore, statistical analyses, including the Friedman test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test, are conducted to validate the superiority of IECO-MCO over the compared algorithms. Compared with the basic algorithm (improved algorithm), IECO-MCO achieved an average ranking of 2.213 (2.488) on the CE2017 and CEC2022 test suites. Additionally, the practical applicability of the proposed IECO-MCO algorithm is verified by solving constrained optimization problems. The experimental outcomes demonstrate the superior performance of IECO-MCO in tackling intricate optimization problems, underscoring its robustness and practical effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

                arXiv:2508.16884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has prevailed in computer vision tasks due to its strong long-range dependency modelling ability. \textcolor{blue}{However, its large model size and weak local feature modeling ability hinder its application in real scenarios. To balance computation efficiency and performance in downstream vision tasks, we propose an efficient ViT model with sparse attention (dubbed SAEViT) and convolution blocks. Specifically, a Sparsely Aggregated Attention (SAA) module has been proposed to perform adaptive sparse sampling and recover the feature map via deconvolution operation,} which significantly reduces the computational complexity of attention operations. In addition, a Channel-Interactive Feed-Forward Network (CIFFN) layer is developed to enhance inter-channel information exchange through feature decomposition and redistribution, which mitigates the redundancy in traditional feed-forward networks (FFN). Finally, a hierarchical pyramid structure with embedded depth-wise separable convolutional blocks (DWSConv) is devised to further strengthen convolutional features. Extensive experiments on mainstream datasets show that SAEViT achieves Top-1 accuracies of 76.3\% and 79.6\% on the ImageNet-1K classification task with only 0.8 GFLOPs and 1.3 GFLOPs, respectively, demonstrating a lightweight solution for fundamental vision tasks.

">Resolving the estrogen paradox in hereditary retinal degeneration: Esr1 activation suppresses Tnf-α signaling as a photoreceptor self-protection mechanism</a></h4>

              
                Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited retinal degenerative disorder characterized by progressive photoreceptor loss and irreversible blindness. Increasing evidence implicates neuroinflammation as a contributor to photoreceptor degeneration extending beyond the initial genetic insult. Although estrogen has been reported to exert anti-inflammatory effects in the central nervous system, its role in RP remains controversial, with some studies suggesting a paradoxical exacerbation of retinal pathology. To address this discrepancy, we identify estrogen receptor alpha (Esr1) as a central immunoregulatory hub in RP. Transcriptomic analyses of rd1 and rd10 revealed upregulation of estrogen-responsive and inflammatory pathways, with Esr1 expression markedly elevated during degeneration. TUNEL assays demonstrated that systemic estradiol (E2) exerted divergent effects, protective in rd1 yet deleterious in rd10, whereas selective pharmacological activation of Esr1 with propyl pyrazole triol (PPT) consistently reduced photoreceptor death, preserved dark-adapted ERG responses, and downregulated inflammatory mediators including Tnf-, Cx3cl1/Cx3cr1, Cd68, and Iba1. Mechanistically, Esr1 activation repressed microglial Tnf transcription and disrupted a self-sustaining Cx3cl1/Cx3cr1-Tnf- signaling loop driving microglial recruitment, activation and neurotoxicity in the outer nuclear layer (ONL). Targeted interventions confirmed tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (Tnfr1) as the principal mediator of Tnf-induced photoreceptor death: selective inhibition with R7050 conferred superior protection compared with broad-spectrum Tnf- inhibitors (etanercept, infliximab). Cx3cr1 blockade likewise suppressed microglial activation and improved visual outcomes. Collectively, our findings establish Esr1 activation as not merely an external intervention but the amplification of an intrinsic self-protective program, positioning Esr1, Tnfr1, and Cx3cr1 as actionable therapeutic targets to suppress neuroinflammation and preserve vision in RP and related retinal disorders.

                Background Neuroblastoma is a malignant childhood cancer with significant inter- and intrapatient heterogeneity arising from the abnormal differentiation of neural crest cells into sympathetic neurons. The lack of actionable mutations limits therapeutic options, highlighting the need to better understand the molecular mechanisms that drive this differentiation. Although RNA velocity has provided some insights, modeling regulatory relationships is limited. Methods To address this, we applied our integrated gene regulatory network (GRNs) inference (CARDAMOM) and simulation (HARISSA) tools using a published single-cell RNAseq dataset from human sympathoadrenal differentiation. Results Our analysis identified a 97-gene GRN that drives the transition from Schwann cell precursors to chromaffin cells and sympathoblasts, highlighting dynamic interactions such as self-reinforcing loops and toggle switches. The simulation of that GRN was able to reproduce very satisfactorily the experimentally observed gene expression distributions. Conclusions Altogether, these findings demonstrate the utility of our GRN model framework for inferring GRN structure, even in the absence of a time-resolved dataset.

                Background Malnutrition impairs immune function and vaccine responses, particularly in low-income settings. This can lead to reduced seroconversion rates and compromised herd immunity in children. Nutritional interventions have been proposed to enhance vaccine immunogenicity, yet evidence remains scattered and context specific. Objective This systematic review assesses the impact of nutritional interventions—especially vitamin A, zinc supplementation, and protein-energy rehabilitation—on serological responses to routine childhood vaccines among malnourished children in low- and middle-income countries. Methods Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and WHO Global Health Library for studies published between 2000 and 2024. Eligible studies included randomized trials, cohort studies, and systematic reviews reporting on nutritional supplementation and vaccine seroconversion outcomes in malnourished children. Narrative reviews and retracted articles (e.g., Chandra RK) were excluded. Results From 3,245 records, 29 studies met the inclusion criteria. Vitamin A supplementation improved measles vaccine seroconversion by 35%, especially among deficient children. Zinc enhanced responses to oral vaccines (rotavirus and OPV) by 20%. Protein-energy rehabilitation significantly increased seroconversion rates for BCG and measles vaccines, particularly in children recovering from severe acute malnutrition. Evidence for iron supplementation and inactivated vaccines remained inconsistent. Conclusion Nutritional interventions can improve vaccine immunogenicity among malnourished children. Vaccination should not be delayed in malnourished children; instead, integrated strategies combining immunization and nutrition services should be prioritized to address immunity gaps in vulnerable populations.

Cancer remains a major contributor to global mortality, constituting a significant and escalating threat to human health. Anticancer peptides (ACPs) have emerged as promising therapeutic agents due to their specific mechanisms of action, pronounced tumor-targeting capability, and low toxicity. Nevertheless, traditional approaches for ACP identification are constrained by their reliance on shallow, hand-crafted sequence features, which fail to capture deeper semantic and structural characteristics. Moreover, such models exhibit limited robustness and interpretability when confronted with practical challenges such as severe class imbalance. To address these limitations, this study proposes HyperACP, an innovative framework for ACP recognition that integrates deep representation learning, adaptive sampling, and mechanistic interpretability. The framework leverages the ESMC protein language model to extract comprehensive sequence features and employs a novel adaptive algorithm, ANBS, to mitigate class imbalance at the decision boundary. For enhanced model transparency, SHAP-Res is incorporated to elucidate the contributions of individual residues to the final predictions. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that HyperACP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets and validation protocols—including 10-fold cross-validation and independent test sets—according to metrics such as Accuracy (ACC), Sensitivity (SN), Specificity (SP), Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), and Area Under the Curve (AUC). Furthermore, the model yields biologically interpretable results, pinpointing key residues (K, L, F, G) known to play pivotal roles in anticancer activity. These findings provide not only a robust predictive tool (available at www.hyperacp.com) but also novel insights into the structure-function relationships underlying ACPs.

                <p>by Sarah M. Burbach, Bryan Briney</p>

There is growing interest in pre-training antibody language models (AbLMs) with a mixture of unpaired and natively paired sequences, seeking to combine the proven benefits of training with natively paired sequences with the massive scale of unpaired antibody sequence datasets. However, given the novelty of this strategy, the field lacks a systematic evaluation of data processing methods and training strategies that maximize the benefits of mixed training data while accommodating the significant imbalance in the size of existing paired and unpaired datasets. Here, we introduce a method of curriculum learning for AbLMs, which facilitates a gradual transition from unpaired to paired sequences during training. We optimize this method and compare it to other data sampling strategies for AbLMs, including a constant mix and a fine-tuning approach. We observe that the curriculum and constant approaches show improved performance compared to the fine-tuning approach in large-scale models, likely due to their ability to prevent catastrophic forgetting and slow overfitting. Finally, we show that a 650M-parameter curriculum model, CurrAb, outperforms existing mixed AbLMs in downstream residue prediction and classification tasks.

Shotgun metagenomic sequencing can determine both the taxonomic and functional content of microbiomes. However, functional classification for metagenomic reads remains highly challenging as protein mapping tools require substantial computational resources and yield ambiguous classifications when short reads map to homologous proteins originating from different bacteria. Here we introduce <i>k</i>Mermaid for the purpose of uniquely mapping bacterial short reads to taxa-agnostic clusters of homologous proteins, which can then be used for downstream analysis tasks such as read quantification and pathway or global functional analysis. Using a nested hash map containing amino acid <i>k</i>-mer profiles as a model for protein assignment, <i>k</i>Mermaid achieves the sensitivity of popular existing protein mapping tools while remaining highly resource efficient. We evaluate <i>k</i>Mermaid on simulated data and data from human fecal samples as well as demonstrate the utility of <i>k</i>Mermaid for classifying reads originating from new, unseen proteins. <i>k</i>Mermaid allows for highly accurate, unambiguous and ultrafast metagenomic read assignment into protein clusters, with a fixed memory usage, and can easily be employed on a typical computer.

                <p>by Yen-Ju Chen, Zitang Sun, Shin’ya Nishida</p>

Perceptual organization in the human visual system involves neural mechanisms that spatially group and segment image areas based on local feature similarities, such as the temporal correlation of luminance changes. Successful segmentation models in computer vision, including graph-based algorithms and vision transformer, leverage similarity computations across all elements in an image, suggest that effective similarity-based grouping should rely on a global computational process. However, whether human vision employs a similarly global computation remains unclear due to the absence of appropriate methods for manipulating similarity matrices across multiple elements within a stimulus. To investigate how “temporal similarity structures” influence human visual segmentation, we developed a stimulus generation algorithm based on Vision Transformer. This algorithm independently controls within-area and cross-area similarities by adjusting the temporal correlation of luminance, color, and spatial phase attributes. To assess human segmentation performance with these generated texture stimuli, participants completed a temporal two-alternative forced-choice task, identifying which of two intervals contained a segmentable texture. The results showed that segmentation performance is significantly influenced by the configuration of both within- and cross-correlation across the elements, regardless of attribute type. Furthermore, human performance is closely aligned with predictions from a graph-based computational model, suggesting that human texture segmentation can be approximated by a global computational process that optimally integrates pairwise similarities across multiple elements.

Retinal Hemangioblastoma (RH) is the most frequent manifestation of the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL), a rare disease associated with the germline mutation of the von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL). An emblematic feature of RH is the high vascularity, which is explained by the overexpression of angiogenic factors (AFs) arising from the pVHL impairment. The introduction of Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) allowed observing this feature with exceptional detail. Here, we combine OCTA images and a mechanistic model to investigate tumor growth and vascular development in a patient-specific way. We derived our model from the agreed pathology for RH and focused on the earliest stages of tumor-induced angiogenesis. Our simulations closely resemble the medical images, supporting the capability of our model to simulate vascular patterning in actual patients. Our results also suggest that angiogenesis in RH occurs upon reaching a critical dimension (around 200 μm), followed by the rapid formation of stable vascular networks. These findings open a new perspective on the crucial role of time in antiangiogenic therapy in RH, which has resulted in ineffective control. Indeed, it might be that when RH is diagnosed, angiogenesis is already too advanced to be effectively targeted with any effective means. Moreover, our simulations suggest that vascularization in RH is not a continuous process but an inconstant development with long, stable phases and rapid episodes of vascular sprouting.

Sphingolipid and ganglioside metabolic pathways are crucial components of cell signaling, having established roles in cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. However, regulatory mechanisms controlling sphingolipid and ganglioside biosynthesis in mammalian cells are less known. Here, we show that RICTOR, the regulatory subunit of mTORC2, regulates the synthesis of sphingolipids and gangliosides in human luminal breast cancer-specific MCF-7 and BT-474 cells through transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms. We observe that RICTOR regulates glucosylceramide levels by modulating the expression of UDP-Glucose Ceramide Glucosyl transferase (UGCG). We identify Zinc Finger protein X-linked (ZFX) as a RICTOR-responsive transcription factor whose recruitment to the <i>UGCG</i> promoter is regulated by DNA methyltransferase 1 and histone demethylase (KDM5A), which are known AKT substrates. We further demonstrate that RICTOR regulates the synthesis of GD3 gangliosides through ZFX and UGCG, and triggers the activation of the EGFR signaling pathway, thereby promoting tumor growth. In line with our findings in human cell culture and mouse models, we observe an elevated expression of RICTOR, ZFX, and UGCG in Indian luminal breast cancer tissues and in TCGA and METABRIC datasets. Together, we establish a key regulatory circuit, RICTOR-AKT-ZFX-UGCG-Ganglioside-EGFR-AKT, and elucidate its contribution to breast cancer progression.

                Objectives The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted significant weaknesses in health security systems, even in high-income countries (HICs), underscoring the necessity for a more nuanced understanding of their distinct strengths and vulnerabilities. Existing research often offers broad evaluations and fails to capture the complex internal dynamics of health-security performance. This study seeks to fill this gap by identifying the latent factors that define health security capacities in HICs and clustering countries based on these factors. Methods A multistage analytical framework was employed based on the 2017–2021 Global Health Security Index (GHSI) dataset. Initially, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with varimax rotation was applied to the 37 GHSI indicators to reduce dimensionality and reveal latent structures within the data. This process identified nine principal components for the subsequent analysis. Subsequently, K-means clustering was utilized under three methodological scenarios: using countries’ average scores across the nine extracted components, based on 13 high-loading indicators from the first principal component, and using aggregated scores across the six original GHSI categories. This design facilitated a comprehensive comparison of the clustering outcomes across different data representations. Results Analysis found nine components that together explained 74.50% of the total differences, with the first component—"Foundational Capacity, Regulations, Resilience, and Prevention-Detection Systems"—making up 37.62% of that total. Together, the first three components explained 51.81% of the total variance. Clustering across all three scenarios categorized high-income countries into four levels, revealing significant disparities. Nauru, the Cook Islands, and Palau consistently ranked lowest, highlighting critical gaps in foundational capacities and systemic readiness despite their high-income status. This study shows that wealth alone does not ensure preparedness, revealing distinct performance patterns and weaknesses across countries. Conclusion The findings underscore the need for tailored policies, multi-method evaluations, and sustained global cooperation to enhance resilience and guide investments in national and global health security.

                Background Malaria continues to impose a significant mortality and morbidity burden, particularly among young African children. Children under two years of age account for one-third of the estimated 597,000 annual global malaria deaths. Perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC) is a strategy recommended by the World Health Organization to reduce malaria in this high-risk age group. However, uptake remains low in many endemic countries. Given the limited resources available for health and the stagnation of malaria budgets over the last decade, it is important for policymakers to understand the costs and cost-effectiveness of PMC to support future decision making. Methods We describe the design of an economic evaluation of PMC in Benin, Cameroon, and Côte d’Ivoire, where it is being implemented at scale by the ministries of health through the Essential Programme of Immunization (EPI) with support from Population Services International. We will take a disaggregated societal perspective, collecting data on resources provided for PMC by 45 health facilities across 12 districts in these three countries, higher levels of the health services, donor-supported activities, and households. This study will assess the financial and economic costs per dose of PMC and calculate the incremental cost per malaria case averted and per disability-adjusted life-year averted by PMC compared to the usual standard of care. We will model the costs and effects of scaling up PMC to other regions in the three countries where PMC is deemed suitable. Discussion This economic evaluation aims to provide robust evidence from three countries, each implementing different PMC delivery models, regarding whether, where, and under what circumstances investing in PMC may represent an efficient and equitable use of scarce resources. We expect these findings to be valuable for the governments of Benin, Cameroon, and Côte d’Ivoire and other countries and international donors in designing the optimal mix of malaria control interventions.

                Background The functions of pavement-markings are to safely and smoothly guide drivers and vehicles along a road-lane, alert drivers not to leave the lane, and provide traffic information. These functions are directly related to the safety and economy of passengers and vehicles on roads. The visibility of pavement-markings is linked to surface damage during the daytime and is significantly affected by luminance at night. Therefore, damage and luminance should be considered key-factors for maintenance and should be measured in detail. In Seoul, mobile equipment such as image-scanners and damage-detectors has been used to measure damage conditions, and a luminance measurement vehicle has been introduced to observe reflected light intensity from road-markings. The mobile measurement methods are respectively utilized due to their objective difference of the measurement. However, measurement discrepancies in temporal, locational, and environmental conditions can lead to considerable errors. Moreover, a standardized maintenance index is currently lacking for planning repair work in Seoul. In that regards, one objective of this research was to develop a retroreflectivity prediction model using a vehicle that detects pavement and marking damage. Method The model enables the prediction of retroreflectivity without additional measurement equipment. Another objective was to develop degradation models based on the age of pavement-markings and to evaluate their performance for maintenance and budget planning. Results As a result, a regression model was determined to be the optimal predictive model for retroreflectivity. A logarithmic model was selected to predict retroreflectivity degradation. Additionally, the Seoul-Road-Marking-Index was developed. Conclusion The developed models are expected to assist in establishing maintenance plans, formulating budgets, and determining repair work, as well as developing relevant regulations and standards in Seoul.

                Introduction Understanding the fundamental basics of cardiology remains a persistent challenge for students. Traditional methods often fail to present these concepts clearly. To address this educational gap, we developed CardioLearn, an interactive application designed to facilitate active learning in cardiology. The tool integrates anatomical visualisation, temporal simulations, and clinically oriented problem-solving exercises, offering a learner-centred approach to support conceptual understanding and application. Methods CardioLearn is an open-source, web-based application developed in R utilising the Shiny framework, along with the shinythemes and other packages. The platform comprises four interactive modules: a Cardiac Cycle Explorer, featuring an annotated Wiggers diagram to visualise pressure-volume relationships; a Quiz Module for self-assessment of the fundamentals of cardiology; a 3D Heart Model that highlights left atrial dynamics in response to user-controlled left ventricular function parameters; and a Clinical Cases module presenting scenario-based exercises to support diagnostic reasoning skills. Results CardioLearn features a user-friendly interface, guiding users through four distinct modules. The Cardiac Cycle module enables phase-by-phase exploration of the cardiac cycle, with each phase visually highlighted on a Wiggers diagram accompanied by descriptive annotations. The Quiz Module reinforces active recall through multiple-choice questions, providing feedback to support knowledge retention. The 3D Heart Model displays a visualisation of the left atrium in which users can manipulate left ventricular function parameters and left atrial phase to conceptualise changes in atrial size, blood flow, and valve dynamics. The Clinical Cases module presents structured scenarios that integrate key diagnostic elements, encouraging the application of cardiology principles to real-world clinical scenarios. Conclusion CardioLearn is an accessible, interactive educational tool designed to supplement the traditional medical student curriculum. It converges visual, conceptual and applied learning modalities, improving understanding and engagement among medical students. CardioLearn addresses a pertinent educational gap in the knowledge of core cardiology concepts using an active, learner-centred approach.

                Background Changes in the structural and physicochemical properties of pea starch could be significantly affected by germination treatment, which can provide a theoretical basis for promoting the use of this starch in the food industry. Methods This work aims to evaluate the effect of germination time on the structural, thermal, rheological and functional properties of pea starches to determine their potential in the production of fermented beverages. The physicochemical changes during the germination process of peas and native and germinated starch granules were evaluated. Results For germination critical time was 0.985 days, with 95% of germinated grains. The starch grains did not undergo any morphological change during the germination process as seen in the scanning electron microscopy images, indicating the absence of the α and ß - amylases responsible for the starch splitting. The X-ray patterns revealed that the crystalline structures of pea starch with and without germination were unchanged and contained by hexagonal and orthorhombic glucopyranose crystals. The viscosity profiles of the starches do not show significant changes; the most representative change is the increase in the gelatinization onset temperature of the paste from germinated starches compared to native starch. The functional properties of starches showed generally low values, with statistically significant differences between water absorption index, water solubility index, and starch swelling power and germination time. Conclusions In general terms, it can be concluded that pea starch does not undergo significant changes in its physicochemical and functional integrity with respect to the grain germination process.

                Agentic Artificial Intelligence systems, characterized by autonomous reasoning, memory augmentation, and adaptive planning, are rapidly reshaping technological landscapes. Unlike traditional AI or large language models, agentic AI integrates decision-making with persistent execution, enabling complex interactions across dynamic environments. However, this evolution introduces novel security risks, governance challenges, and ethical considerations that current frameworks inadequately address. This survey provides a cross-layer review of agentic AI, encompassing architectural paradigms, threat taxonomies, and governance strategies. It consolidates findings from adjacent domains such as cybersecurity, AI safety, multi-agent coordination, and ethics, offering a holistic understanding of vulnerabilities and mitigation approaches. We integrate insights from recent advances in defense architectures and governance innovations, highlighting the limitations of static policies in addressing dynamically evolving threats. Real-world deployments from industrial automation to military and policy applications reveal both successful integrations and notable failures, underscoring the urgency of resilient oversight mechanisms. Furthermore, we identify critical research gaps in benchmarking, memory integrity, adversarial defense, and normative embedding, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to develop adaptive, accountable, and transparent systems. This review serves as a narrative synthesis rather than a systematic literature review, aiming to bridge technical, governance, and ethical perspectives. By integrating cross-disciplinary findings, it lays the foundation for future research on securing, aligning, and governing agentic AI in real-world contexts. Ultimately, this work calls for cooperative innovation to ensure that agentic AI evolves as a trustworthy, accountable, and beneficial technology.

                The purpose of this paper is to report on a practical project to develop teaching materials for use in primary school home economics education, undertaken jointly by the authors and two local companies in Fukui Prefecture, Japan (Plus Jack Inc. and Technowarp Co., Ltd.). This report highlights international trends and demands in Risk Reduction and Resilience Education (from the UN’s Sendai Framework for Disaster Reduction 2015-2030 and the Global Alliance for Disaster Risk Reduction and Resilience in the Education Sector, specifically the Comprehensive School Safety Framework 2022-2030), and how these dovetail neatly with trends and demands in Japan (from government laws and documents, including the Course of Study for home economics). These frameworks constitute the theory on which the practical project was premised and then enacted, especially in terms of (1) fostering social capital that leads to enhanced resilience, and (2) passing on the lessons learnt from previous disasters, all through close collaboration with local companies. Thus, the value of developing home economics teaching materials in collaboration with local businesses is elucidated. This paper details the process and progress of this collaborative project to create the teaching materials, including piloting them in experiments, first with university students and then with primary school students themselves. As a result of the project, the ‘yoji-yoji’ retroreflective straps and the disaster prevention whistle ‘Infinity’ were developed as teaching materials for primary school home economics lessons. Beyond that, though, both teaching materials are intended to be used on a daily basis as disaster prevention tools/resources to protect children even after the end of the study. Future research will aim to develop further primary school home economics lessons using these and other teaching materials and evaluate the effectiveness of such teaching materials through thorough ongoing practical classroom research.

                Background The C1 vertebra (atlas) plays a crucial role in craniovertebral biomechanical function and spinal stabilization. Although morphometric studies of the C1 vertebra have been conducted in several countries, data regarding the Indonesian population remains limited. Morphometric variations related to age and sex have important implications for surgical strategy design, particularly in the placement of lateral mass screws used for stabilizing the atlantoaxial region. Methods This study utilized data from 337 cervical CT scans obtained from patients without structural abnormalities of the C1 vertebra in Indonesia between 2019 and 2024. Morphometric analysis was performed using RadiAnt, HOROS, and U-lite software, focusing on measurements of length, diameter, and angles of the C1 vertebra in the axial and sagittal planes. The study subjects were divided based on age and sex groups to compare morphometric differences. Results Significant differences were found in C1 vertebra morphometry based on age and sex. In the male population, the optimal lateral mass screw length ranged from 25.83 mm to 31.95 mm, while in the female population, it ranged from 24.64 mm to 30.11 mm. The safe zone trajectory angle in males ranged from 47.89° in the axial plane and 46.51° in females, with sagittal angles of 45.78° in males and 43.73° in females. The maximum diameter in males ranged from 5.09 mm and 4.89 mm in females. Conclusion This study reveals significant morphometric variations of the C1 vertebra in the Indonesian population based on age and sex. These findings have clinical implications for adjusting surgical techniques, particularly in selecting the size and angle of lateral mass screws for spinal stabilization. This study makes an important contribution to filling the gap in C1 morphometric data for the Indonesian population and can serve as a guide for developing safer and more effective surgical protocols.

                Landry et al. show that short-term high-fat diet reduces hippocampal glucose availability, driving CCK-IN hyperactivity and memory deficits. Normalizing aberrant PKM2 or CCK-IN activity subsequently protects againstobesity-related cognitive impairments. This study reveals a metabolic-neuronal mechanism linking diet to cognition and highlights potential targets for preventing diet-associated cognitive decline.

                Fluorescence lifetime photometry at high temporal resolution (FLIPR) reports absolute fast and slow neuronal signals across time, brain regions, animals, and behavioral contexts. FLIPR, combined with the new dopamine sensor dLight3.8, allows for the simultaneous measurement of fast and slow changes in dopamine in freely moving mice.

                Liu et al. show that HBP inhibition via GFAT1 knockout suppresses colorectal tumor growth and enhances CD8+ T cell infiltration. Mechanistically, GFAT1 induces integrin glycosylation, FAK activation, and eEF1A2 upregulation, enhancing PD-L1 expression through regulation of transcription elongation processes. Pharmacological HBP inhibition boosts immune checkpoint blockade efficacy in vivo.

Deletion of GSK3 in mature Tregs enhanced the anti-tumoral immune response.

                Here, Chan et al. show that eukaryotic ribosomes—widely viewed as conserved drug targets—are in fact dissimilar across eukaryotes due to variable sequences of their drug-binding residues. This finding highlights the unappreciated divergence of ribosomes from different clades of eukaryotes, suggesting lineage-dependent sensitivity of ribosomes to drugs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90679">Cellular characterization of the mouse collecting lymphatic vessels reveals that lymphatic muscle cells are the innate pacemaker cells</a></h4>

              
                Collecting lymphatic vessels (cLVs) exhibit spontaneous contractions with a pressure-dependent frequency, but the identity of the lymphatic pacemaker cell is still debated. Here, we combined immunofluorescence and scRNAseq analyses with electrophysiological methods to examine the cellular constituents of the mouse cLV wall and assess whether any cell type exhibited morphological and functional processes characteristic of pacemaker cells. We employed inducible Cre mouse models to target-specific cell populations including CkitCreER<sup>T2</sup> to target interstitial cells of Cajal-like cells, PdgfrβCreER<sup>T2</sup> to target pericyte-like cells; PdgfrαCreER<sup>TM</sup> to target CD34<sup>+</sup> adventitial cells; and Myh11CreER<sup>T2</sup> to target lymphatic muscle cells (LMCs) directly. These inducible Cre lines were crossed to the fluorescent reporter <i>Rosa26<sup>mTmG</sup></i>, the genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor GCaMP6f, and the light-activated cation channel rhodopsin2 (ChR2). Only LMCs consistently, but heterogeneously, displayed spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> events during the diastolic period of the contraction cycle, and whose frequency was modulated in a pressure-dependent manner. Further, optogenetic depolarization with ChR2 induced propagated contractions only in LMCs. Membrane potential recordings in LMCs demonstrated that the rate of diastolic depolarization significantly correlated with contraction frequency. These findings support the conclusion that LMCs, or a subset of LMCs, are responsible for mouse cLV pacemaking.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102324">Dissecting infant leukemia developmental origins with a hemogenic gastruloid model</a></h4>

              
                Current in vitro models of developmental blood formation lack spatio-temporal accuracy and weakly replicate successive waves of hematopoiesis. Herein, we describe a mouse embryonic stem cell (SC)-derived 3D hemogenic gastruloid (haemGx) that captures multi-wave blood formation, progenitor specification from hemogenic endothelium (HE), and generates hematopoietic progenitors capable of short-term engraftment of immunodeficient mice upon maturation in an in vivo niche. We took advantage of the haemGx model to interrogate the origins of infant acute myeloid leukemia (infAML). We focused on MNX1-driven leukemia, representing the commonest genetic abnormality unique to the infant group. Enforced MNX1 expression in haemGx promotes the expansion and in vitro transformation of yolk sac-like erythroid-myeloid progenitors at the HE-to-hematopoietic transition to faithfully recapitulate patient transcriptional signatures. By combining phenotypic, functional, and transcriptional profiling, including at the single-cell level, we establish the haemGx as a useful new model for the study of normal and leukemic embryonic hematopoiesis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105613">Structural evolution of nitrogenase over 3 billion years</a></h4>

              
                Previously, we identified the only dinitrogen reduction mechanism known to date as an ancient feature conserved from nitrogenase ancestors, which we directly tested by resurrecting and integrating synthetic ancestral nitrogenases into the genome of <i>Azotobacter vinelandii</i> (Garcia et al., 2023), a genetically tractable, nitrogen-fixing model bacterium. Here, we extend this paleomolecular approach to investigate the structural evolution of nitrogenase over billions of years of evolution by combining phylogenetics, ancestral sequence reconstruction, protein crystallography, and deep-learning based predictions. This study reveals that nitrogenase, while maintaining a conserved multimeric core, evolved novel modular features aligned with major environmental transitions, suggesting that subtle distal changes and transient regulatory adaptations were key to its long-term persistence and to shaping protein evolution over geologic time. The framework established here provides a foundation for identifying structural constraints that governed ancient proteins and for situating their sequences and structures within phylogenetic and environmental contexts across time.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105496">Molecular architecture of thylakoid membranes within intact spinach chloroplasts</a></h4>

              
                Thylakoid membranes coordinate the light reactions of photosynthesis across multiple scales, coupling the architecture of an elaborate membrane network to the spatial organization of individual protein complexes embedded within this network. Previously, we used in situ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to reveal the native thylakoid architecture of the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> (Engel et al., 2015) and then map the molecular organization of these thylakoids with single-molecule precision (Wietrzynski et al., 2020). However, it remains to be shown how generalizable this green algal blueprint is to the thylakoids of vascular plants, which possess distinct membrane architecture subdivided into grana stacks interconnected by non-stacked stromal lamellae. Here, we continue our cryo-ET investigation to reveal the molecular architecture of thylakoids within intact chloroplasts isolated from spinach (<i>Spinacia oleracea</i>). We visualize the fine ultrastructural details of grana membranes, as well as interactions between thylakoids and plastoglobules. We apply AI-based computational approaches (Lamm et al., 2024) to quantify the organization of photosynthetic complexes within the plane of the thylakoid membrane and across adjacent stacked membranes. Our analysis reveals that the molecular organization of thylakoid membranes in vascular plants and green algae is strikingly similar. We find that PSII organization is non-crystalline and has uniform concentration both within the membrane plane and across stacked grana membranes. Similar to <i>C. reinhardtii</i>, we observe strict lateral heterogeneity of PSII and PSI at the boundary between appressed and non-appressed thylakoid domains, with no evidence for a distinct grana margin region where these complexes have been proposed to intermix. Based on these measurements, we support a simple two-domain model for the molecular organization of thylakoid membranes in both green algae and plants.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104222">Dynamic estimation of the attentional field from visual cortical activity</a></h4>

              
                Navigating around the world, we must adaptively allocate attention to our surroundings based on anticipated future stimuli and events. This allocation of spatial attention boosts visuocortical representations at attended locations and locally enhances perception. Indeed, spatial attention has often been analogized to a ‘spotlight’ shining on the item of relevance. Although the neural underpinnings of the locus of this attentional spotlight have been relatively well studied, less is known about the size of the spotlight: to what extent can the attentional field be broadened and narrowed in accordance with behavioral demands? In this study, we developed a paradigm for dynamically estimating the locus and spread of covert spatial attention, inferred from visuocortical activity using fMRI in humans. We measured BOLD activity in response to an annulus while participants (four female, four male) used covert visual attention to determine whether more numbers or letters were present in a cued region of the annulus. Importantly, the width of the cued area was systematically varied, calling for different sizes of the attentional spotlight. The deployment of attention was associated with an increase in BOLD activity in corresponding retinotopic regions of visual areas V1–V3. By modeling the visuocortical attentional modulation, we could reliably recover the cued location, as well as a broadening of the attentional modulation with wider attentional cues. This modeling approach offers a useful window into the dynamics of attention and spatial uncertainty.

                Automated analysis of the biomedical literature (<i>literature mining</i>) offers a rich source of insights. However, such analysis requires collecting a large number of articles and extracting and processing their content. This task is often prohibitively difficult and time-consuming. Here, we provide tools to easily collect, process, and annotate the biomedical literature. In particular, <a href="https://neuroquery.github.io/pubget/pubget.html">https://neuroquery.github.io/pubget/pubget.html</a> is an efficient and reliable command-line tool for downloading articles in bulk from PubMed Central, extracting their contents and metadata into convenient formats, and extracting and analyzing information such as stereotactic brain coordinates. <a href="https://jeromedockes.github.io/labelbuddy/labelbuddy/current/">https://jeromedockes.github.io/labelbuddy/labelbuddy/current/</a> is a lightweight local application for annotating text, which facilitates the extraction of complex information or the creation of ground-truth labels to validate automated information extraction methods. Further, we describe repositories where researchers can share their analysis code and their manual annotations in a format that facilitates reuse. These resources can help streamline text mining and meta-science projects and make text mining of the biomedical literature more accessible, effective, and reproducible. We describe a typical workflow based on these tools and illustrate it with several example projects.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107742">Xcr1+ type 1 conventional dendritic cells are essential mediators for atherosclerosis progression</a></h4>

              
                Atherosclerosis is characterized by lipid accumulation within plaques, leading to foam cell formation and an inflammatory response within the aortic lesions. Lipid disorders have been extensively investigated, however, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that trigger the inflammatory response in atherosclerotic plaques remain far from being fully understood. Xcr1<sup>+</sup> cDC1 cells are newly identified antigen-presenting cells in activating immune cells. However, the role of cDC1 cells in atherosclerosis development remains highly controversial. We first confirmed the presence of cDC1 within human atherosclerotic plaques and discovered a significant association between the increasing cDC1 numbers and atherosclerosis progression in mice. Subsequently, we established <i>Xcr1<sup>Cre-Gfp</sup> Rosa26<sup>LSL-DTA</sup> Apoe<sup>–/–</sup></i> mice, a novel and complex genetic model, in which cDC1 was constitutively depleted in vivo during atherosclerosis development. Intriguingly, we observed a notable reduction in atherosclerotic lesions in hyperlipidemic mice, alongside suppressed T cell activation of both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> subsets in the aortic plaques. Notably, aortic macrophages and serum lipid levels were not significantly changed in the cDC1-depleted mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed heterogeneity of Xcr1<sup>+</sup> cDC1 cells across the aorta and lymphoid organs under hyperlipidemic conditions. As Xcr1 is the sole receptor for Xcl1, we next explored to target Xcr1<sup>+</sup> cDC1 cells via Xcl1 by establishing <i>Xcl1<sup>–/–</sup>Apoe<sup>–/–</sup></i> mice. <i>Xcl1<sup>–/–</sup>Apoe<sup>–/–</sup></i> mice exhibited decreased atherosclerotic plaque formation and reduced aortic cDC1 accumulation, indicating that Xcl1 contributes to cDC1-mediated atherosclerotic lesion development. Our results reveal crucial roles of cDC1 in atherosclerosis progression and provide insights into the development of immunotherapies by targeting cDC1 through Xcl1.

">Characterization of the central sulcus pli-de-passage fronto-parietal moyen in > 1000 human brains</a></h4>

              
                The pli-de-passage fronto-parietal moyen (PPfpm), a deep cerebral fold of the human brain, presents as a common though small elevation at the central sulcus (CS) fundus where it connects the pre- and postcentral gyri at the level of the sensorimotor hand area. Given the PPfpm's location, single case-reports of its association with the functional sensorimotor hand area, and evidence linking it to the somato-cognitive action network, it holds potential as an anatomical landmark for the sensorimotor region. To characterize the macroscopic morphology of the PPfpm and evaluate its relevance as a reliable and easily detectable anatomical landmark, methods for observer-independent characterization of cortical sulci and structures were adapted and developed to investigate the PPfpm in a large dataset. For 1112 subjects from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult S1200 Release, CS depth profiles were computed from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, and an algorithm was developed to automatically extract the PPfpm from these depth profiles. Based on the extraction of two key features approximating the PPfpm at its peak height (PPfpm-I) and its lateral end (PPfpm-II), a principal description of the PPfpm's position and extent as influenced by hemisphere and sex was conducted. Analyses revealed the PPfpm as a near-universal cerebral fold in the adult human brain, consistently located at mid-height within the CS with a strong association to the CS sulcal pits. Though commonly of a small extent, the PPfpm can be reliably identified in CS depth profiles and in structural MRI data. By providing a systematic, modern macroanatomical characterization of the PPfpm in a large cohort with rigorous quality control, the present study demonstrates the potential of the PPfpm to serve as a robust anatomical landmark for the sensorimotor hand area of the human brain.

">Infant Brains Tick at 4Hz - Resonance Properties of the Developing Visual System</a></h4>

              
                Neural rhythms of the infant brain are not well understood. Testing the rhythmic properties of the adult visual system with periodic or broadband visual stimulation elicited neural resonance phenomena at ~10Hz alpha rhythm. Here, we extend this approach to reveal the inherent rhythmic properties of the infant brain. Eight-month-olds (N = 42) were presented with visual stimuli flickering at discrete frequencies (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, and 30Hz) and broadband (i.e., aperiodic) stimulation, while recording a high-density electroencephalogram (EEG). As predicted, infants' visual system entrained to the harmonics of the periodic stimulation frequencies (first to third). In addition, a 4Hz rhythm emerged independent of stimulation frequency. Critically, the impulse response function (IRF) of the broadband sequence revealed a perceptual echo of visual information at 4Hz. This echo lasted for about 1 second (i.e. four cycles), extended into frontal sensors, and selectively resonated the 4Hz component of the input signal. In a complementary adult assessment, we confirm an alpha response upon periodic and broadband stimulation in the present paradigm for the mature visual system. To conclude, perturbing the infant visual system elicited a neural response and resonant activity at the 4Hz theta rhythm, which contrasts with the 10Hz alpha rhythm found in the adult visual system. Neural processing dynamics are thus essential to understand early brain development in full.

">Cerebellar growth is associated with domain-specific cerebral maturation and socio-linguistic behavioral outcomes</a></h4>

              
                The cerebellum's involvement in cognitive functions is increasingly recognized, yet its developmental contribution to cognition remains poorly understood. The cerebellum undergoes rapid development in early life, paralleling major cognitive and behavioral changes. Although clinical studies have linked early cerebellar disruptions to profound developmental deficits, it remains largely unclear how typical cerebellar maturation supports the development of cognitive functions and how it interacts with broader brain development. Here, we apply a normative modeling framework to map cerebellar volumetric growth from infancy to young adulthood (N = 751; ages 1-21 years). Using lobular and functional cerebellar parcellations, we comprehensively characterize typical cerebellar development and examine how it aligns with cerebral development and behavioral outcomes. Across parcellations, posterior higher association areas consistently show steeper growth trajectories than anterior sensorimotor areas. Cerebellar and cerebral areas with similar functional roles demonstrate coordinated maturation, and volumetric growth in the posterior cerebellum relates to individual differences in socio-linguistic behaviors. These findings establish a comprehensive reference for typical cerebellar development, highlight cerebellar co-maturation with the cerebral cortex, and underscore the cerebellum's role in supporting emerging higher cognitive functions.

">A common neural architecture for encoding finger movements</a></h4>

              
                Finger tapping is widely used to investigate sensorimotor brain responses, yet it remains unclear whether shared neural codes for complex finger movements exist across individuals, given the highly individual-specific topography of the sensorimotor cortex. We combined spherical searchlight Procrustes hyperalignment on 7-Tesla fMRI data with between-subject classification to investigate the existence of a shared latent neural architecture encoding sequential finger movements in the human sensorimotor cortex. Our model afforded above-chance level accuracy in both the contralateral and ipsilateral areas, suggesting that such a high-dimensional neural information space exists, is traceable, and spreads over the sensorimotor cortex. Critically, these high-dimensional neural codes were identified without task-specific training and cannot be attributed to error-related activity. These findings establish universal organizational principles of motor sequence encoding and pave the way for personalized neurotechnologies, scalable brain-computer interfaces, and cross-subject models for motor learning and rehabilitation.

">Alpha-synuclein overexpression reduces neural activity within a basal ganglia vocal nucleus in a zebra finch model</a></h4>

              
                Vocal motor impairments, including changes in pitch, loudness, and timing are prevalent in Parkinsons Disease (PD) and a target for early intervention and treatment, yet the neural mechanisms underlying these impairments are not understood, motivating work in animal models. The adult male zebra finch songbird is uniquely poised for these studies given vocally-dedicated brain nuclei and a quantifiable output (birdsong). Our prior publication revealed that injection of an adeno-associated virus (AAV5) expressing the human (h) alpha-synuclein (hSNCA, a-syn) gene into basal ganglia vocal nucleus Area X results in higher levels of insoluble a-syn protein and changes reminiscent of human PD including softer, shorter, and reduced number of vocalizations compared to AAV5 controls. Here, we test the hypothesis that AAV-hSNCA overexpression reduces the firing rate of specific neuronal sub-types in Area X using in vivo recordings in anesthetized finches. Five classes of neurons were differentiated in AAV-treated finches based on waveform width (narrow vs. wide) and firing rates (low vs. fast). Wide-waveform/low-rate activity is a consistent feature of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs), a dominant cell type in Area X and in mammalian basal ganglia. Reduced firing rates and enhanced post-peak rebound were detected in the AAV-hSNCA group for putative MSN neurons compared to AAV controls. No differences in firing rate nor waveform shape were detected for the narrow waveform neurons. Our findings provide the first characterization of early a-syn-driven neural activity changes in vocal control neurocircuitry.

">Intrinsic interval timing, not temporal prediction, underlies ramping dynamics in visual and parietal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Neural activity following regular sensory events can reflect either elapsed time since the previous event (temporal signaling) or temporal predictions and prediction errors about the next event (temporal predictive processing). These mechanisms are often confounded, yet dissociating them is essential for understanding neural circuit computations. We addressed this by performing two-photon calcium imaging from distinct cell types (excitatory, VIP and SST) in layer 2/3 of visual and posterior parietal cortex (PPC), while awake mice passively viewed audio-visual stimuli under temporal contexts with different inter-stimulus interval (ISI) distributions. Computational modeling revealed distinct functional clusters of neurons, including stimulus-activated (ramp-down) and stimulus-inhibited (ramp-up) categories, with distinct kinetics and area/cell-type biases. Importantly, all functional clusters were invariant to temporal predictability, shifted immediately when temporal statistics changed, and were identical between naive and experienced mice. Population decoding revealed that clusters with heterogeneous kinetics differed in how well they represented interval information, such that together they tiled elapsed time and produced a distributed, learning-independent population code for time. These results provide strong evidence against temporal predictive processing in V1/PPC under passive conditions and instead demonstrate intrinsic coding of interval timing, redefining the mechanistic origin of ramping and omission-related activity in sensory cortex. We discuss how these dynamics align with stimulus-reset attractor frameworks, and propose that temporal predictive processing is more likely implemented in other circuits or recruited in V1/PPC during task-engaged behavior.

">Unpredictable circadian rhythm disruption in Wistar rats: biological and behavioural changes reflecting bipolar disorder pathophysiology</a></h4>

              
                Circadian disturbances are implicated in dysregulation of arousal and general neurobiological function, contributing to conditions such as bipolar disorder (BD). However, the behavioural and biological consequences of circadian disruption on arousal dysfunction remain poorly quantified. Here, we developed a novel unpredictable circadian disruption (UCD) protocol - consisting of unpredictable exposure to light and sound - to investigate its impact on locomotor activity and its association with metabolic, inflammatory, stress, and circadian markers in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Forty-eight Wistar rats were exposed to UCD or control conditions, with or without corticosterone administration, for five weeks. Body weight was tracked throughout the study. Locomotor activity was assessed over the final two weeks (nine sessions) in an open-field arena. Real-time PCR was used to quantify NAc gene expression of inflammatory, metabolic, stress, and circadian markers, while liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) measured neurotransmitter and central carbon metabolite concentrations. UCD animals exhibited initial hyperactivity at three weeks, followed by hypoactivity at four weeks. UCD was associated with increased NAc expression of inflammatory, stress, and circadian markers. Male UCD animals showed significant weight gain, an effect reversed in females. UCD also induced increases in NAc insulin resistance markers and reductions in central carbon metabolites, indicating disrupted striatal glucose metabolism. These findings highlight the central effects of circadian disruption on locomotor behaviour, stress, and immunometabolic signalling, offering mechanistic insights into arousal dysfunction in BD.

">Enabling wider access to human molecular neuroscience research in pain: A simple preservation method for human dorsal root ganglion neurons in Hibernate A media</a></h4>

              
                The use of human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) from organ donors opens the door for research into the molecular biology and physiology of human nociceptors; however, there are barriers to working with this tissue including logistical difficulties and limited access. We present an approach using Hibernate media to temporarily store either whole DRGs or dissociated DRG neurons prior to culturing and functional testing. Dissociation of DRGs following temporary storage (4-16hrs) in Hibernate media resulted in similar neuronal and immune cell yield as acutely dissociated DRGs. Neurons derived from DRGs stored in Hibernate media prior to dissociation exhibited similar electrophysiological properties and capsaicin responses as acutely dissociated DRG neurons. Similarly, neurons from acutely dissociated DRGs stored in Hibernate media (>24hrs) and shipped to geographically distant laboratories produced neuronal cultures displaying comparable electrophysiological properties as acutely cultured neurons. This approach overcomes insurmountable logistical burdens and increases access to freshly recovered human DRGs.

">NeuronID: An automatic toolkit for identifying neurons in two-photon calcium imaging data</a></h4>

              
                Two-photon calcium imaging has emerged as a powerful technique for monitoring neuronal activity in neuroscience; however, its data processing remains challenging. Here, we introduce NeuronID, an automatic toolkit designed to process two-photon calcium imaging data. The NeuronID toolkit features a modular architecture that includes motion correction, noise reduction, segmentation of neuronal components, and extraction of neuronal signals. Notably, the NeuronID toolkit offers an optimized strategy for segmenting neuronal components, which systematically integrates morphological boundary identification, cross-correlation analysis between pixels, and evaluation of neuronal signal quality. Compared to existing tools or manual annotation by experts, the NeuronID toolkit reduces the likelihood of over-segmentation while achieving near-human accuracy. Overall, this study provides a standardized analytical tool for processing two-photon calcium imaging data.

">Individual olfactory channels shape distinct parameters of sleep architecture</a></h4>

              
                Across the animal kingdom, olfactory dysfunction and anosmia have been associated with disruptions in sleep. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, various studies have demonstrated that broadly inhibiting olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) similarly disrupts sleep/wake cycles, suggesting that baseline ORN signaling is an integral component of olfactory modulation of sleep. However, due to the diversity of ORNs and combinatorial nature of olfactory processing, many of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which ORNs modulate sleep remain unclear. In this study, we addressed this gap of knowledge by characterizing the contributions of different ensembles of ORNs, individual ORN types, and a known modulator of ORNs on baseline sleep architecture. We find that the activity of distinct ORN types are important for day and nighttime sleep and heterogeneously shape parameters of sleep architecture. Importantly, the effects of ORN signaling on sleep are adjusted across mating status, suggesting that distinct ORN types are recruited within the context of sleep depending on the demands of the animal. Furthermore, the effects of ORN signaling on sleep are in part shaped by heterogeneous serotonin (5-HT) receptor expression. Together, this work identifies cellular and molecular pathways bridging olfaction and sleep, and helps establish a circuit model that can be used to further characterize the behavioral consequences of sensory dysfunction.

">NMDA Receptor Kinetics Drive Distinct Routes to Chaotic Firing in Pyramidal Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal firing patterns emerge from complex interactions between intrinsic membrane properties and synaptic receptor dynamics. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors critically shape calcium influx and synaptic plasticity through their voltage-dependent Mg2+ block and prolonged activation kinetics. We developed a Hodgkin-Huxley-type computational model incorporating NMDA, AMPA, and GABA receptor kinetics to investigate how NMDA receptor closing rates (beta_NMDA) and glutamatergic stimulation frequency control neuronal dynamics. Systematic analysis of 2,942,093 inter-spike intervals across 1,961 parameter combinations revealed two mechanistically distinct pathways to firing irregularity. Pathway 1 involves rapid NMDA deactivation (beta_NMDA > 0.06 ms-1) at elevated stimulation frequencies, producing deterministic chaos with compromised information encoding (entropy: 1.441 bits, mutual information: 0.185 bits). Pathway 2 results from slow NMDA deactivation (beta_NMDA < 0.02 ms-1) under weak drive, creating irregularity through prolonged receptor activation and sustained calcium influx (entropy: 1.347 bits). An optimal kinetic window emerged at beta_NMDA = 0.028 ms-1, maximizing information transfer (0.275 bits) while maintaining stable dynamics. Entropy-Lyapunov correlation analysis confirmed deterministic chaos (r = 0.150, p < 0.001). Frequency-dependent chaos onset thresholds demonstrated systematic erosion from 0.000 ms-1 at low frequencies to 0.150 ms-1 at high frequencies. GABAergic inhibition provided frequency-selective stabilization, expanding stable parameter space by 34.2% while preserving gamma oscillations. CaMKII phosphorylation analysis revealed that prolonged NMDA activation maintains elevated phosphorylation levels (8.7 +/- 0.3 x 10-21 M vs. 1.8 +/- 0.1 x 10-23 M for normal kinetics), creating conditions for pathological long-term potentiation. These findings establish NMDA receptor kinetics as fundamental controllers of cortical excitability and information processing. The dual-pathway framework provides mechanistic insights into addiction-related memory formation, where prolonged NMDA activation enables pathological plasticity, and visual processing disorders, where altered kinetics disrupt retinal function and cortical oscillatory balance. The identification of optimal kinetic windows and frequency-selective GABA modulation suggests therapeutic strategies targeting kinetically-specific interventions for neuropsychiatric disorders involving NMDA dysfunction.

">Neural coding for tactile motion: Scanning speed or temporal frequency?</a></h4>

              
                Humans effortlessly perceive the speed of an object moving across their fingers, but how the brain encodes this information, especially across the hierarchical stages in the primary somatosensory cortex, remains unclear. This study thus investigated coding schemes, including rate and temporal codes, for tactile motion speed in macaque S1 areas 3b, 1, and 2. Extracellular electrophysiology recorded single-unit activities when a rotating sinusoidal grating ball of a fixed spatial period (wavelength of 1, 2, or 4 mm) was presented on the fingerpad at various speeds (20-320 mm/s). The results showed that the rate code was commonly employed to differentiate the stimulus scanning speed, spatial period, and scanning direction across S1 regions. In contrast, the temporal code was used to faithfully represent the stimulus temporal frequency, which was defined as the speed divided by the spatial period. Notably, area 3b had a wider range of frequency responses than did areas 1 and 2. These findings demonstrate that S1 uses both rate and temporal codes to encode distinct aspects of tactile motion. Future research should investigate how temporal patterns in S1 neuronal activity are potentially transformed and utilized in downstream somatosensory areas to form tactile motion perception and guide perceptual decisions.

">A low-cost and open-source olfactometer to precisely deliver single odours and odour mixtures</a></h4>

              
                Olfaction has historically been the neglected sense, despite its profound influence on human emotion and memory, and its critical importance for animal behaviours including foraging, mating, and parenting. Perhaps contributing to this neglect is the fact that olfactory research has been hindered by technical challenges inherent to odour delivery: unlike visual or auditory stimuli, odorants must be vaporized, transported, and actively cleared, requiring specialized equipment and creating temporal delays and contamination risks. While commercial olfactometers provide reliable solutions for odour delivery, they are expensive and, due to proprietary software, difficult to customize. Existing custom designs, though excellent, may also be costly and/or require access to engineering workshops. To widen access to controlled odour delivery and hopefully encourage more labs to undertake olfactory research, we developed a low-cost, fully open-source olfactometer system requiring no specialized workshops or extensive engineering expertise. Our design prioritizes affordability, accessibility, and versatility while maintaining temporal precision and stimulus control and supporting diverse applications from rodent behavioural studies to human psychophysical investigations. In this methods article, which includes design specifications and assembly instructions as well as validation data, we aim to lower barriers to olfactory research and enable more laboratories to explore this fundamental sensory modality.

">Perfect imperfections: seeking molecular and cellular asymmetries in the mouse brain</a></h4>

              
                Although perfect symmetry is a mathematical ideal, many Bilateria exhibit left-right asymmetries of body, brain and behavior that are adaptive 1-3. In the human brain, various aspects of cognition are lateralized, including language 4 and handedness 5, which rely on left hemisphere dominance in most people. Brain hemispheric specialization can support parallel processing, neural efficiency, and action selection 3,6, while atypical structural or functional asymmetries are often found in neuropsychiatric disorders 7-10. Mice may be useful models for studying brain asymmetry because they show hemispheric differences of structure 11,12 and neurophysiology 13, but the extent to which molecular and cellular differences are involved remains unknown. We applied spatial transcriptomics with single molecule resolution to coronal sections from 31 adult mouse brains, to assess left-right differences of gene expression and cell types. Sections were chosen to capture the hippocampus and auditory cortex, as these two regions have shown the most prior evidence for functional asymmetry 13-15. In the hippocampus, Crhr1 (Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptor 1) was more highly expressed in the pyramidal layers of CA1, CA3 and the dentate gyrus of the left hemisphere compared to the right. In the auditory cortex, three principal components capturing transcriptomic variation showed hemispheric differences, including prominent contributions from genes that have shown associations with human brain asymmetry. Overall cellular density and cell type proportions generally showed no significant hemispheric differences, with Car3 cortical excitatory neurons showing the most laterality. The transcriptional left-right differences that we found may relate to functional asymmetries for learning, memory and hearing.

">Forebrain-specific loss of erythropoietin provokes compensatory upregulation of different EPO receptors</a></h4>

              
                The procognitive growth factor erythropoietin (EPO) and its canonical receptor, EPOR, have long been recognized to be expressed by most cell types in the brain. Cognitive domains, improved by injections of exogenous EPO or by endogenous, hypoxia-stimulated EPO, include important forebrain functions, namely attention, working memory, drive, and executive performance. To gain mechanistic insight into the involvement of forebrain-expressed EPO, we deleted EPO in mice using as specific cre-driver Emx1. Here, we report that these mutant mice act comparably to their wildtype littermates in a comprehensive behavioral test battery. Importantly, we find that the transcripts of both EPOR and a novel, brain-expressed EPO receptor, EphB4, respond to EPO deletion with compensatory upregulation. EphB4 expression in brain and its increase upon forebrain erasure of EPOR are confirmed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The augmented expression of both EPOR and EphB4 and their regulatory intercorrelation may explain why EmxEPO mutants show an even superior performance in the most challenging working memory task. Using the previously published single-nuclei-RNA-seq dataset, we further confirm the suggested compensatory mechanism, wherein EPO loss or reduction drives elevated EPOR expression, adding another layer to the intricate regulation of EPO signaling in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Collectively, these data may explain the lack of behavioral and negative cognitive consequences upon forebrain-wide EPO elimination.

">stk32a links sleep homeostasis to suppression of sensory and motor systems</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is regulated by a homeostatic process and associated with an increased arousal threshold, but the genetic and neuronal mechanisms that implement these essential features of sleep remain poorly understood. To address these fundamental questions, we performed a zebrafish genetic screen informed by human genome-wide association studies. We found that mutation of serine/threonine kinase 32a (stk32a) results in increased sleep and impaired sleep homeostasis in both zebrafish and mice, and that stk32a acts downstream of neurotensin signaling and the serotonergic raphe in zebrafish. stk32a mutation reduces phosphorylation of neurofilament proteins, which are co-expressed with stk32a in neurons that regulate motor activity and in lateral line hair cells that detect environmental stimuli, and ablating these cells phenocopies stk32a mutation. Neurotensin signaling inhibits specific sensory and motor populations, and blocks stimulus-evoked responses of neurons that relay sensory information from hair cells to the brain. Our work thus shows that stk32a is an evolutionarily conserved sleep regulator that links neuropeptidergic and neuromodulatory systems to homeostatic sleep drive and changes in arousal threshold, which are implemented through suppression of specific sensory and motor systems.

">MAVeRiC-AD: Mixture-of-experts Agentic Vision-Language Ensemble for Robust MRI Classification of Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Robust classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from structural T1-weighted MRI (T1w) images remains an unmet clinical need, especially when data is acquired at multiple sites that differ in scanning protocols and population demographics. In this paper, we present MAVeRiC-AD (Mixture-of-experts Agent-guided Vision-Language Ensemble for Robust Imaging-based classification of Alzheimer's Disease), an agentic framework that dynamically utilizes the optimal inferencing tool for radiological queries to provide relevant answers to the user. In our framework, we tested three specialized models encoded as callable tools: (1) CNN-AD, a 3D DenseNet trained on T1w intensities only; (2) MOE-VLM, a vision-language model that jointly models the T1w with subject-specific demographics (age, sex, site) via a mixture-of-experts (MoE) projection head; (3) Retrieval engine, a similarity-search module that contextualizes a patient against others from the site and reports % prevalence of AD. A light-weight agent analyzes the user request and then routes the input (image, or image + text) to the appropriate tool, aggregates responses and returns the tool response augmented with its confidence derived from conformal prediction. Experiments were conducted using T1w images from the ADNI (N=4,098) and OASIS-3 (N=600) datasets. Single-site training baselines achieved ROC-AUC = 0.79 (CNN) and 0.82 (VLM) on ADNI. When trained jointly on both sites, MOE-VLM surpassed both image-only and standard vision-language models with ROC-AUC = 0.90 on ADNI and 0.81 on OASIS. MAVeRiC-AD demonstrates that agentic orchestration of complementary expert deep models, coupled with explicit demographic conditioning for multi-site data can improve robustness and interpretability of AD image analysis pipelines and serves as a blueprint for scalable, trustworthy clinical AI assistants.

">No effect of continuous transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation on the P3 and the P600 in an oddball and sentence comprehension task</a></h4>

              
                The ERP components P3 and P600 have been proposed to reflect phasic activity of the locus coeruleus norepinephrine (LC/NE) system in response to deviant and task-relevant stimuli across cognitive domains. Yet, causal evidence for this link remains limited. Here, we used continuous transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), a non-invasive method proposed to modulate LC/NE activity, to test whether these components are indeed sensitive to noradrenergic manipulation. Forty participants completed both an active visual oddball task and a sentence processing task including both syntactic and semantic violations, while receiving continuous taVNS at the cymba conchae in one session and sham stimulation at the earlobe in another session. We observed robust P3 and P600 effects. Crucially though, taVNS had no effect on P3 or P600 amplitude. The physiological NE markers salivary alpha amylase level and baseline pupil size were also unaffected by the stimulation, suggesting that the taVNS protocol and/or task may not have been sufficient to successfully engage the norepinephrine system. Beyond the stimulation, however, exploratory analyses revealed correlations between the syntactic P600 and both the P3 and salivary alpha amylase levels, supporting the idea that the P600 might be related to both the P3 and NE. Overall, our findings do not allow for theoretical implications concerning a potential causal link between the two components and NE but highlight the need for more standardized taVNS protocols.

">Intravital Two-Photon Imaging of Touch Sensory Axon Morphology in Mouse Skin</a></h4>

              
                Low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) are somatosensory neurons that detect innocuous light touch stimuli such as vibration, hair deflection, and pressure. They form subtype-specific terminals in the periphery and project axons centrally to the spinal cord to transmit tactile information. Current understanding about LTMR development and organization comes from fixed-tissue studies that cannot reveal the dynamic and temporal processes of neuronal wiring and remodeling. Here, we demonstrate a two-photon imaging method for visualizing LTMR axon morphology in the mouse right forepaw during development and in young adults. Two-photon microscopy can achieve high-resolution imaging within intact skin, allowing repeated imaging of the same axon terminals over postnatal timepoints. These approaches provide an in vivo system for studying the cellular mechanisms that regulate LTMR patterning and plasticity. Its application to longitudinal analyses will enable the observation of the assembly of touch circuits and their repair following injury. This technique may provide essential information about somatosensory axon structure and function in the skin.

">Comparative single-cell multiomic analysis reveals evolutionarily conserved and species-specific cellular mechanisms mediating natural retinal aging.</a></h4>

              
                Biological age is a major risk factor in the development of common degenerative retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma. To systematically characterize molecular mechanisms underlying retinal aging, we performed integrated single-cell RNA- and ATAC-Seq analyses of the retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) across the natural lifespan in zebrafish, mice, and humans. By profiling gene expression and chromatin accessibility, we identified extensive cell type- and species-specific aging-dependent changes, with a much smaller number of broadly expressed and conserved genes that include regulators of inflammation and autophagy. We constructed predictive aging clocks for retinal cell types and observed dynamic, reversible shifts in cellular age following acute injury. Spatial transcriptomic analysis revealed region-specific aging signatures and proximity effects, with Muller glia exhibiting pro-rejuvenating influences on neighboring neurons. Targeted Muller glia-specific induction of Yamanaka factors reduced molecular age in rod photoreceptors and bipolar cells without altering glial age. Our findings define conserved and divergent regulatory and signaling pathways mediating retinal aging, highlighting Muller glia as potential therapeutic targets for combating age-associated retinal dystrophies.

">Improving the utility and accuracy of wearable light loggers and optical radiation dosimeters through auxiliary data, quality assurance, and quality control</a></h4>

              
                In chronobiology and circadian health-related fields, wearable light loggers and optical radiation dosimeters are increasingly used to capture personal light exposure, but their data often lack essential contextual information (e.g. non-wear periods, sleep, activity or environmental conditions) and can be compromised by wearer compliance and technical issues. To address these challenges, we conducted a mixed-methods study (21 expert interviews; n=16 survey respondents) to iteratively develop auxiliary data and quality-control strategies that enhance the utility and accuracy of wearable light data. We derived an auxiliary data framework spanning six domains - wear/non-wear logging, sleep monitoring, light-source context, participant behaviour, user experience, and environmental light levels - to systematically augment wearable recordings. Survey respondents showed overwhelming consensus on the value of auxiliary data (mean importance 4.0 out of 5). In particular, tracking sleep and wear time was rated as the most critical augmentation. To facilitate implementation, we provide concrete tools - notably the open-source R package LightLogR - for streamlined integration of wearable and auxiliary data and for facilitation of quality assurance. Our findings indicate that combining contextual logs with rigorous quality assurance and quality control markedly improves the reliability of field-collected light exposure data. These recommendations and tools will help researchers in chronobiology, wearable technologies, and health to maximise data quality and interpretability in real-world light-exposure studies.

">Local infrared stimulation modulates spontaneous cortical slow wave dynamics in anesthetized rats</a></h4>

              
                Cortical slow waves are hallmark oscillations of deep sleep and certain anesthetic conditions, yet the neurobiological mechanisms controlling their dynamics remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigated the effects of local near-infrared (NIR) stimulation on slow-wave activity in ketamine/xylazine-anesthetized rats. Using a silicon-based multimodal optrode, we simultaneously delivered NIR light and recorded local field potentials (LFPs) and multi-unit activity (MUA) across cortical layers in the primary somatosensory (S1Tr) and parietal association (PtA) cortices. NIR stimulation induced local tissue heating, resulting in reproducible and reversible changes in the properties of slow waves. Specifically, up-state durations were shortened, down-states prolonged, and MUA amplitudes during up-states increased, with steeper slopes at state transitions, indicative of enhanced neuronal synchronization. LFP amplitude and spectral changes varied across cortical regions: PtA exhibited increased slow wave (0.5 - 2 Hz) and high delta (2 - 4 Hz) band activity, while S1Tr showed a trend toward reduction. Our findings demonstrate that local infrared stimulation can reliably modulate cortical slow-wave dynamics, likely through temperature-mediated changes in neuronal excitability. This approach provides a minimally invasive method for precise, local manipulation of cortical network activity and offers new insights into the biophysical regulation of slow oscillations.

">Nicotine in E-Cigarette Aerosol Reduces GABA Neuron Migration via the α7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor</a></h4>

              
                Prenatal nicotine exposure is linked to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, yet e-cigarette use during pregnancy continues to rise due to aggressive marketing efforts and misconceptions of safety. We investigated the effect of prenatal e-cigarette aerosol exposure on the migration of GABA neurons, a developmental process critical for the establishment of cerebral cortical circuitry. Pregnant mice were exposed to nicotine-containing aerosol (e cigarette), nicotine-free aerosol (e-liquid) or room air (control) daily beginning 2 weeks before conception and continuing until gestational day 14. E-cigarette, but not e-liquid, aerosol significantly reduced GABA neuron density in the dorsal cerebral wall at rostral forebrain level and within the marginal zone, reflecting region-specific vulnerabilities. In vitro explant cultures revealed that nicotine dose-dependently reduced neuronal migration, and this effect was mimicked by a selective 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist. Blocking the 7 nAChR using a selective antagonist attenuated the effects of nicotine on neuronal migration. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized vulnerability of GABA neuron migration to e-cigarette aerosol and identify 7 nAChR activation as a mechanism for nicotine-induced impairment of GABA neuron migration. Moreover, the findings highlight the need for translational efforts to update clinical guidance and public policy regarding e-cigarette use during pregnancy.

">Temporal dynamics of CNS cholesterol esters correlate with demyelination and remyelination</a></h4>

              
                Elevated cholesterol ester levels have been observed in the CNS of patients with neurological diseases, yet the source of cholesterol ester accumulation and whether it is directly linked to demyelination remains undefined. This study investigates the temporal dynamics of cholesterol esters using the Plp1-iCKO-Myrf mouse model, which features distinct phases of demyelination and remyelination. Our findings reveal that cholesterol ester levels increased with demyelination in both the brain and the spinal cord. In the brain, cholesterol esters declined to normal levels during remyelination, whereas cholesterol esters remained elevated in the spinal cord, which had limited remyelination. Expression of both acetyl-CoA-acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1) and lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) were elevated during demyelination, suggesting the potential involvement of both proteins in the formation of cholesterol esters. Co-localization studies revealed that ACAT1 is predominantly expressed by microglia and LCAT is predominantly expressed by astrocytes during demyelination highlighting the active roles of glia cells in cholesterol ester metabolism. In addition, we showed that administering the remyelinating drug, Sob-AM2, effectively reduced the level of cholesterol ester accumulation in the brain during demyelination underscoring the potential that manipulating cholesterol ester regulatory pathways may offer for restoring cholesterol homeostasis and promoting remyelination in demyelinating diseases.

">Confidence judgements from fused multisensory percepts</a></h4>

              
                Distinguishing between reliable and unreliable internal sensory representations is crucial for a successful interaction with the environment. Precise estimates of the uncertainty of sensory representations are critical to optimally integrate multiple sensory modalities and produce a coherent interpretation of the world. However, once a multisensory percept is produced, it is not yet known whether humans still have access to the uncertainty of each sensory modality. Here, we asked human participants to perform a series of temporal bisection tasks, in either unimodal visual or auditory conditions, or in bimodal audiovisual conditions where vision and audition could be congruent or not. The validity of their temporal bisection was assessed by asking participants to choose which of two consecutive decisions they felt more confident of being correct, focussing only on the visual modality. We found that once multisensory information is integrated, participants could no longer access the unisensory information to evaluate the validity of their decisions. Comparing three generative models of confidence, we show that confidence judgments are fooled by the fused bimodal percept. These results highlight that some critical information is lost between perceptual and metaperceptual stages of processing in the human brain.

">Scaling Personalized TMS: A Scalp-Based MRI-guided Alternative to Neuronavigation</a></h4>

              
                Background: Personalized transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has shown promise in treating psychiatric and neurological disorders, but its accessibility is limited by reliance on costly and complex neuronavigation systems, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings. Objective: To develop and validate a scalp-based alternative to neuronavigation for personalized TMS targeting. Methods: We developed a Continuous Proportional Coordinate (CPC) system-based approach for personalized TMS targeting and validated its performance through three operators across ten participants, using individualized DLPFC-SGC targets as an example. The validation framework included targeting consistency assessment, reproducibility evaluation, and cross-cortical generalizability analysis. Results: The CPC-based approach demonstrated comparable performance to neuronavigation, achieving 99.4% of its electric field strength (74.80 vs. 75.14 V/m; r=0.962) and 93.9% of DLPFC-SGC functional connectivity (-0.216 vs. -0.230; r=0.949), with high inter-operator reliability (ICC[&ge;]0.903). Reproducibility analysis showed strong correlation between sessions (r=0.948-0.957) with high reliability. Further simulations across 1,125 uniformly distributed cortical targets supported generalizability of this approach, with stable electric field preservation (99.07{+/-}1.54%) across different brain regions. Conclusions: The CPC-based approach offers a practical alternative to neuronavigation, maintaining targeting accuracy and providing a more accessible option for personalized TMS implementation.

">Subanesthetic ketamine administration decreases deviance detection responses at the cellular, populational and mesoscale connectivity levels</a></h4>

              
                In the neocortex, neuronal processing of sensory events is significantly influenced by context. For instance, responses in sensory cortices are suppressed to repetitive stimuli, a phenomenon termed stimulus-specific adaptation. However, in a context in which that same stimulus is novel, or deviates from expectations, neuronal responses are enhanced. Mismatch negativity (MMN), the electroencephalography waveform reflecting rule violations, is a well-established biomarker for auditory deviant detection. MMN has been shown to depend on intact NMDA receptor signaling across species; nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms are still not completely elucidated at the neural and mesoscale levels. Using multi-electrode array recordings in awake mice, we identified a specific biphasic spiking response in a subpopulation of A1 neurons elicited by deviant, but not standard, sounds, whereby the second peak is abolished by acute subanesthetic injection of ketamine, a partial non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist. We further showed that the posterior parietal cortex, a critical hub for multisensory integration and sensorimotor coordination, responds to unexpected and deviant, but not repetitive, sounds, and this response is dependent upon intact NMDA receptor-mediated signaling. Finally, to explore the effects of ketamine on inter-cortical communication during deviance detection, we performed Granger Causality and Weighted Phase Lag Index (WPLI) analyses during the presentation of deviant and standard sounds. This analysis showed a unidirectional functional connectivity from A1 to PPC during deviant detection, which is impaired by subanesthetic ketamine administration. By investigating how ketamine modulates neural and inter-regional communication, our findings provide novel insights into the NMDA receptor-dependent mechanisms underlying the processing of novelty and regularity in auditory stimuli.

">Next-generation hybridization chain reaction tools with enhanced sensitivities to detect challenging targets</a></h4>

              
                Compared to traditional enzyme-based in situ amplification methods, Hybridization Chain Reaction v3.0 (HCR v3.0) offers high specificity for spatial RNA visualization but lacks the sensitivity needed for short or low-abundance targets, especially in thick tissue with high autofluorescence. We describe next-generation HCR detection methods that combine the specificity of HCR v3.0 with enzyme-based signal amplification through catalysis (HCR-Cat) or immunostaining (HCR-Immuno, HCR-Multi). These methods enhance sensitivity for robust spatial detection of both short and low-abundance targets, work well in challenging tissue environments, and enable broad utility across basic research and translational applications. These methods allow spatial detection of challenging targets that are poorly-accessible using HCR v3.0, as well as quantitative analysis of single transcripts even when targeting short RNAs with a limited number of probes.

                <p>After stroke, microglia and hematogenous macrophages, together referred to as M, clear dead cells and cellular debris in the infarcted brain through phagocytosis as an essential part of the recovery process. However, the phagocytic capability of M declines with age. Furthermore, aged M become overactivated in response to stroke, enhancing secondary brain injury. In this study, we demonstrated that by reversing the age-related dysfunctions in M through activating the retinoid X receptor (RXR), the recovery after stroke in the aged brain could be improved. Using RNA-sequencing, we compared the transcriptomes between M isolated from the brains of young and aged male mice. We observed higher levels of proinflammatory genes and lower levels of phagocytosis-facilitating genes (<I>Cd206</I> and <I>Cd36</I>) expressed by aged M. Meanwhile, the treatment with RXR agonist bexarotene (BEX) reversed the signature genes of microglia aging in the aged M. With the in vivo phagocytosis model, we showed that BEX enhanced the phagocytic ability of aged M. Using the MCAo stroke model and male and female mice, we established that BEX improved sensorimotor and cognitive recovery after MCAo in a myeloid-RXR&alpha;&ndash;specific and myeloid-RXR&alpha;&ndash;dependent manner. In conclusion, we showed that activating RXR&alpha; partially restores age-related M dysfunctions and that RXR&alpha; deficiency in M limits the therapeutic effect of RXR in improving poststroke recovery in the aged brain.</p>

                <p>Prediction errors (PEs) can enhance memory for preceding events. While such PE-related memory enhancements are critical for understanding adaptive memory, their underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Using electroencephalography (EEG) and neuro-navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in combination with multivariate pattern analysis, this preregistered study aimed to elucidate the brain mechanisms underlying PE effects on memory. Specifically, we tested whether PEs trigger a neural reactivation of the preceding stimulus and whether the PE-induced effects on memory depend on the specific neural state before the PE. We also examined whether inhibitory TMS over the superior parietal cortex (SPC) reduces PE effects on memory. A total of 118 participants (male and female) received inhibitory theta-burst or sham stimulation over the SPC before completing an incidental encoding-fear learning task. In this task, participants learned trial-unique stimuli and predicted whether these would be followed by an electric shock, while EEG was recorded. Recognition memory was tested 24&nbsp;h later. Our findings show that signed PEs enhance subsequent memory, depending on theta and alpha oscillations as well as neural category reactivation shortly before the PE. Moreover, this memory enhancement was associated with post-PE theta but not with PE-driven category reinstatement. Theta-burst stimulation over the SPC led to a more conservative mnemonic response bias but left the PE effect on memory unaffected. Together, our findings reveal that PE effects on memory formation are influenced by neural states and representations surrounding the PE, providing new insights into the neural mechanisms of adaptive memory formation.</p>

                <p>The lateral septum (LS) is anatomically positioned to play a critical role in directing information from the hippocampus and cortex to downstream subcortical structures, such as the hypothalamus. Early anatomical tracing studies investigated the organization of hippocampal inputs to the LS and its hypothalamic outputs to begin to understand how its structure might relate to its function. These studies also characterized the cellular anatomy of the LS and the organization of molecular markers within it. However, little is known about the organization of nonhypothalamic projection populations within the LS and what types of input these different projection populations receive. We used retrograde tracing to determine the organization of LS projections to six brain regions that mediate various social behaviors in male mice, specifically, the basolateral amygdala (BLA), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), nucleus accumbens (NAc), periaqueductal gray (PAG), ventromedial hypothalamus (vmH), and ventral tegmental area (VTA). We found that these projection populations occupy discrete anatomical compartments within the LS. We then used a monosynaptic rabies tracing strategy in male mice to map brainwide inputs to these six discrete LS projection populations and examine how different brain regions innervate them. We identified unique region-dependent patterns of inputs to individual LS projection populations. In particular, we observed differences in cortical, hippocampal, and thalamic innervation of the six different LS projection populations, while the hypothalamic inputs were largely similar across projection populations. Thus, this study provides insight into the anatomical connectivity that may underlie the functional heterogeneity of the LS.</p>

                <p>Human and nonhuman primate studies suggest that timing and tempo of cortical development varies neuroanatomically along a sensorimotor-to-association (S&ndash;A) axis. Prior human studies have reported a principal S&ndash;A axis across various modalities but largely rely on cross-sectional samples with wide age ranges. Here, we investigate developmental changes and individual variability therein along the S&ndash;A axis between the ages of 9&ndash;13&nbsp;years using a large, longitudinal sample (<I>N</I> = 2,487&ndash;3,747; 46&ndash;50% female) from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (ABCD Study). This work assesses multiple aspects of neurodevelopment indexed by changes in cortical thickness, cortical microarchitecture, and resting-state low&ndash;frequency oscillations. First, we evaluated S&ndash;A organization in age-related changes and then computed individual-level S&ndash;A alignment in brain changes and assessing differences therein due to age, sex, and puberty. Age-related brain changes aligned linearly and quadratically with the S&ndash;A axis. Yet, these patterns of cortical development were overshadowed by considerable individual variability in S&ndash;A alignment. Even within individuals, there was little correspondence between S&ndash;A patterning across the different aspects of neurodevelopment investigated (i.e., cortical morphology, microarchitecture, function). Some of the individual variation in developmental patterning of cortical morphology and microarchitecture was explained by age, sex, and pubertal development. Altogether, this work contextualizes prior findings that regional age differences do progress along an S&ndash;A axis at a group level while highlighting broad variation in developmental change between individuals and between aspects of cortical development, in part due to sex and puberty.</p>

                <p>To build an understanding of our world, we make inferences about the connections between our actions, experiences, and the environment. This process, state inference, requires an agent to guess the current state of the world given a set of observations. During value-based decision-making, a growing body of evidence implicates the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the hippocampus (HPC) in the process of contextualizing information and identifying links between stimuli, actions, and outcomes. However, the neural mechanisms driving these processes in primates remain unknown. To investigate how OFC and HPC contribute to state inference, we recorded simultaneously from both regions while two male monkeys (<I>Macaca mulatta</I>) performed a probabilistic reversal learning task, where reward contingencies could be captured by two task states. Using population-level decoding, we found neural representations of task state in both OFC and HPC that remained stable within each trial but strengthened with learning as monkeys adapted to reversals. Subjects also appeared to use their understanding of task structure to anticipate reversals, evidenced by anticipatory neural representations of the upcoming task state.</p>

                <p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ventral capsule and ventral striatum (VC/VS) is an effective therapy for treatment-resistant obsessive&ndash;compulsive disorder (trOCD). DBS initiation often produces acute improvements in mood and energy. These acute behavioral changes, which we refer to as "approach behaviors," include increased social engagement and talkativeness. We investigated the relationship between stimulation amplitude, spectral power in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), and speech rate in one male patient with trOCD implanted with bilateral VC/VS DBS leads and subdural electrodes adjacent to the orbitofrontal cortex and vlPFC. Several times over the first 24&nbsp;weeks of therapy, we conducted experiments where we recorded data during epochs of high-amplitude or zero-/low-amplitude stimulation. We found that both the speech rate and vlPFC power in a high beta frequency band (31 &plusmn; 1.5&nbsp;Hz, 1/<I>f</I> activity removed) increased during high-amplitude as compared with low-amplitude periods. The speech rate correlated with vlPFC high beta power. These effects were more consistent across time points in the left hemisphere than the right. At Week 24, we performed an experiment where stimulation was held constant, while the patient was asked to speak or remain silent. We showed that the presence or absence of speech was not sufficient to increase the vlPFC high beta power, suggesting stimulation is a key driver of the observed neurobehavioral phenomenon. Our results suggest vlPFC high beta power is a biomarker for approach behaviors associated with VC/VS DBS.</p>

                <p>The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is important for higher-order cognitive functions, emotional responses, and monitoring internal states. ACC dysfunction has been implicated in an array of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders which have a bidirectional relationship with the metabolic disorder Type 2 diabetes (T2D). T2D is a chronic disease characterized by hyperglycemia, loss of insulin signaling, neuroinflammation, and increased morbidity and mortality chances. To better understand the functional effects of T2D on ACC information processing, we delivered an intermittent, low-dose streptozotocin (STZ) protocol to rats (all male due to female insensitivity to STZ) which led to lasting hyperglycemia and recorded single neurons during a delayed alternation task. We observed changes in spatial and reward processing in spite of no differences in overall behavioral accuracy, though we did find hyperglycemic animals spent less time at the reward site. Hyperglycemic animal (<I>n</I> = 5) ACC neurons had higher spatial information scores and changes in the allotment of spatial coding assets. Specifically, the hyperglycemic group had greatest spatial information during the reward approach, while in controls (<I>n</I> = 3) it was uniformly distributed. We found that state space separation and decoding accuracy were greater in control ensembles at the reward location. Furthermore, control hippocampal theta phase-locked cells had the strongest reward coding, and this effect was absent in hyperglycemic animals, leading to a muted reward location representation, despite increased reward approach coding. T2D inferred a nuanced and layered effect on ACC activity, leading to reward coding deficits, a reduced post-reinforcement pause, and a differential change in spatial coding properties.</p>

                <p>Multiple brain regions need to coordinate activity to support cognitive flexibility and behavioral adaptation. Neural activity in both the hippocampus (HPC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is known to represent the spatial context and is sensitive to reward and rule alterations. Midbrain dopamine (DA) activity is key to reward-seeking behavior and learning. There is abundant evidence that midbrain DA modulates HPC and PFC activity. However, it remains underexplored how these networks engage dynamically and coordinate temporally when animals adjust their behavior according to changing reward contingencies. In particular, is there any relationship between DA reward prediction change during rule switching and rule representation changes in mPFC and CA1? We addressed these questions using simultaneous recordings of neuronal population activity from the hippocampal area CA1, mPFC, and ventral tegmental area (VTA) in male TH-Cre rats performing two spatial working memory tasks with frequent rule switches in blocks of trials. CA1 and mPFC ensembles showed rule-specific activity both during maze running and at reward locations, with mPFC rule coding more consistent across animals compared with CA1. Optogenetically tagged VTA DA neuron firing activity responded to and predicted reward outcome. We found that the correct prediction in DA emerged gradually over trials after rule switching in coordination with transitions in mPFC and CA1 ensemble representations of the current rule after a rule switch, followed by behavioral adaptation to the correct rule sequence. Therefore, our study demonstrates a crucial temporal coordination between the rule representation in mPFC/CA1, the dopamine reward signal, and behavioral strategy.</p>

                <p>Working memory updating is an important executive process. Here, we study the single-neuron mechanisms involved in updating versus protecting memory from distractors in the macaque prefrontal cortex. We recorded single-neuron activity from the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) and prearcuate cortex (PAC) while male monkeys performed a task that required them to update their memory of target locations while ignoring distractors. Our findings revealed that neurons in the PAC signaled updated memory locations ~100&nbsp;ms after stimulus onset, significantly faster than the ~400&nbsp;ms observed in the LPFC. Additionally, PAC neurons exhibited longer encoding of distractor information. Population decoding analyses further indicated that distractor information was maintained in orthogonal subspaces from target information in both regions, minimizing interference. These results demonstrate the distinct temporal dynamics in memory updating processes between the PAC and LPFC and highlight the interplay between robust memory maintenance and updating, suggesting that local neural mechanisms may contribute to these processes.</p>

                <p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an emerging treatment for otherwise treatment-refractory psychiatric disorders. It can produce remarkable clinical results in expert hands, but has not fared as well in controlled, multisite trials. That difficulty with scaling up arises in part because DBS&rsquo; mechanisms are poorly understood, meaning that it is difficult to objectively identify patients likely to respond and/or to customize stimulation to match individual patients&rsquo; needs. In the first part of this review, we overview converging anatomic and physiological evidence that psychiatric DBS acts by modulating distributed networks centered on the prefrontal cortex (PFC). We discuss potential physiological mechanisms of that modulation, including mixed excitatory/inhibitory effects, changes in local field potential oscillations, and neuroplastic changes. A major challenge is that mechanistic data from humans are limited and sometimes contradictory, in part because these studies can only be conducted at low <I>N</I> with limited technical replication. Animal models may overcome that challenge, but are challenging themselves because psychiatric disorders are not fully recapitulated in animal models and are defined primarily by self-reports that are unavailable in nonverbal model species. Thus, in the second part, we review paths to more reliable animal models of psychiatric DBS, including putative disease models and models based on cognitive and decision-making impairments. The latter class includes traditional cognitive assays and newer approaches based on computational modeling, both of which also implicate PFC-centric networks. Taken together, these approaches may yield new insights into DBS&rsquo; mechanisms that can in turn improve its scalability and clinical reliability.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/37/e2197242025?rss=1">Robustness of Working Memory to Prefrontal Cortex Microstimulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Delay period activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) has been linked to the maintenance and control of sensory information in working memory. The stability of working memory-related signals found in such delay period activity is believed to support robust memory-guided behavior during sensory perturbations, such as distractors. Here, we directly probed dlPFC's delay period activity with a diverse set of activity perturbations and measured their consequences on neural activity and behavior. We applied patterned microstimulation to the dlPFC of two male rhesus macaques implanted with multielectrode arrays by electrically stimulating different electrodes in the array while they performed a memory-guided saccade task. We found that the microstimulation perturbations affected spatial working memory-related signals in individual dlPFC neurons. However, task performance remained largely unaffected. These apparently contradictory observations could be understood by examining different dimensions of the dlPFC population activity. In dimensions where working memory-related signals naturally evolved over time, microstimulation impacted neural activity. In contrast, in dimensions containing working memory-related signals that were stable over time, microstimulation minimally impacted neural activity. This dissociation could explain how working memory-related information may be stably maintained in dlPFC despite the activity changes induced by microstimulation. Thus, working memory processes are robust to a variety of activity perturbations in the dlPFC.</p>

                <p>Pathological levels of beta amyloid (A&beta;) lead to disruption and elimination of synapses in brain as the result of direct neurotoxicity as well as neuroinflammation. The synaptic impact of beta amyloid includes altered morphology and reduced number of dendritic spines at excitatory synapses, evident in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. Here, we assessed the ability of an identified neuroprotective peptide, YEVHHQ, derived from the N-terminal domain of A&beta;, known as the A&beta;Core, to protect against A&beta;-induced alterations in dendritic spines. Our approach involved both 2D and 3D imaging of spine morphology in hippocampal neuron cultures from mice of either sex, with the 3D imaging focusing on the postsynaptic density (PSD), as its morphology is tightly correlated with synaptic strength, and presynaptic terminal morphology and density to assess the impact on both sides of the synapse. We present evidence for uniform prevention by the A&beta;Core of A&beta;-induced reductions in spine cross-sectional size and density as well as PSD surface area and volume. In addition, the A&beta;Core alone increased the presynaptic terminal volume in parallel to the reversal of A&beta;-induced changes in spine and PSD size. Together, these results provide support for reversal of structural changes underlying the functional reversal by the A&beta;Core of A&beta;-induced impairment of synaptic dynamics.</p>

                <p>Given the observed interaction and reports of oxytocin, &mu;-opioid receptor, or -opioid receptor expression in brain regions important to emotion regulation (i.e., the central amygdala), we hypothesized that oxytocin (<I>oxtr</I>), &mu;-opioid (<I>oprm1</I>), and -opioid (<I>oprk1</I>) receptor mRNA were colocalized to the same cells in the central amygdala. RNAscope in situ hybridization performed on fresh-frozen coronal brain sections was used to label cells containing <I>oxtr</I>, <I>oprm1</I>, and/or <I>oprk1</I>. The coronal sections were imaged using a 40<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> objective (widefield fluorescence) on a Leica Thunder fluorescent microscope, and the images were processed using open-source ImageJ/Fiji software and analyzed using the Imaris software. The central amygdala was identified using Paxinos and Watson's <I>The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates</I> (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B50">Paxinos and Franklin, 2019</cross-ref>). Eight distinct cell populations were enumerated (i.e., <I>oxtr</I>-only, <I>oprm1</I>-only, <I>oprk1</I>-only, <I>oxtr</I> + <I>oprm1</I>-only, <I>oxtr</I> + <I>oprk1</I>-only, <I>oprm1</I> + <I>oprk1</I>-only, <I>oxtr</I> + <I>oprm1</I> + <I>oprk1</I>, and nontranscript cells). Our findings demonstrated that 47% of cells in the central amygdala express <I>oxtr</I> with <I>oprm1</I> and/or <I>oprk1</I>. Of the <I>oxtr</I>-expressing cells, 38% colocalized only <I>oprm1</I>, and 56% of <I>oxtr</I>-expressing cells colocalized both <I>oprm1</I> and <I>oprk1</I>. However, 53% of <I>oprm1</I>-expressing cells colocalized <I>oxtr</I>, and 61% of <I>oprk1</I>-expressiong cells colocalized <I>oxtr</I>. These findings suggest that opioid and oxytocin receptors can function at the cellular level through morphological interactions. Future work will examine the physiological basis for the interaction between opioid and oxytocin receptors using transgenic behavior and electrophysiological assays.</p>

                Background Previous studies compared the cardiorenal efficacy of these two types of SGLT2 inhibitors; however, the findings are inconsistent and do not reflect the population of Type 2 diabetic Mellitus (T2DM) patients in Indonesia, which ranks fifth globally in diabetes prevalence. This study aims to evaluate the effects and safety of dapagliflozin and empagliflozin on cardiorenal risk factors in T2DM Indonesian patients over a 12-month. Methods This study utilized a multicenter retrospective cohort to evaluate diverse cardiorenal risk factors, encompassing glycemic control, blood pressure, lipid profile, body weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), calculated 10-year Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) risk, and estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), alongside the safety profile of SGLT2is. Paired data analysis, comparative analysis between groups, and linear regression were conducted to adjust the confounding. Results Both groups exhibited enhancements in HbA1c, Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG), Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), and Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C). Improvements in BMI, Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP), triglycerides, ASCVD risk, and High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C) were only seen in the dapagliflozin group. Although dapagliflozin was associated with greater reductions in body weight and BMI, these differences were not statistically significant after adjustment for confounding factors. No significant differences were observed in the average alteration of HbA1c, FPG, SBP, DBP, LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides, total cholesterol, eGFR, and ASCVD risk values. A comparable safety profile was found between groups. Conclusion Dapagliflozin and Empagliflozin provide similar advantages in reducing cardiorenal risk and safety after 12 months of treatment in Indonesian patients with T2DM.

                The increasing prevalence of vector-borne diseases like West Nile virus (WNV) highlights the critical need for predictive modeling tools that can guide public health decision-making, particularly given the absence of effective vaccines. We developed a modular computational framework that simulates and analyzes WNV transmission dynamics through compartmental models capturing the intricate ecological interactions among avian hosts, mosquito vectors, and human populations. Our system integrates epidemiological parameters with customizable intervention mechanisms, facilitating the assessment of scenario-specific mitigation approaches. Distinguishing itself from conventional static models, this framework enables users to model dynamic, time-sensitive interventions including targeted mosquito control and strategic bird population management—the two principal containment strategies currently employed against WNV. Using simulations that reflect realistic outbreak scenarios, we evaluated how varying intervention intensities and implementation timings affect epi- demic progression. Our findings reveal that early implemented, dual-target strategies addressing both vector populations and avian reservoirs can substantially reduce transmission dynamics and minimize human exposure risk. This framework serves as a comprehensive decision-support platform for policymakers and vector control agencies, delivering mechanistic insights into the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions against zoonotic pathogens within complex ecological systems. The tool’s modular design and scenario-testing capabilities make it particularly valuable for proactive outbreak preparedness and evidence-based intervention planning.

                Background The management of giant bile duct stones, especially those impacted in the common hepatic duct, poses substantial clinical challenges. Generally, large stones are managed with methods such as Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or direct choledochoscopy, which are limited by the size of the stones that can be effectively treated. Endoscopy lithotripsy using ureteroscopy (URS), typically used for kidney stones, shows promise for breaking down these large impacted bile duct stone. Case Report A 60-year-old female presented with intermittent right upper quadrant abdominal pain lasting two months, jaundice appearing three weeks before admission, dark urine, and clay-colored stools. Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) diagnosed her with obstructive jaundice due to multiple giant stones in the common hepatic duct (CHD) and common bile duct (CBD) with distal CBD stenosis. Following a cholecystectomy and CBD exploration—which revealed dilation from the common bile duct to the right and left hepatic ducts—a choledochotomy was performed. Multiple stones were found in the CBD and a giant, impacted stone in the CHD. Stone removal was achieved using URS lithotripsy, which fragmented the stones, allowing for evacuation. The largest stone measured approximately 4 cm. A side-to-side choledochoduodenostomy bypass was then performed from the CBD to the duodenum. The patient was discharged on post-operative day five in good condition and by day 14 post-operation, no jaundice or significant symptoms. Conclusion This case underscores the benefits of adapting endoscopy lithotripsy for biliary system use, particularly for challenging cases involving impacted giant stones in less accessible locations of the biliary tract.

                Introduction Emergency caesarean sections are challenging life-threatening scenarios that involve multidisciplinary teams to ensure favorable outcomes. Most operation theatres (OT), especially in developing countries, tend to be shared with multiple surgical departments. Emergency caesarean section in such setups require preparation of the theatre with drugs and extra equipment in a short period of time, The goals of resuscitation in obstetric emergencies remain like any other medical emergencies with the distinction of focussing on the resuscitation and safety or ensuring minimum adversities to two lives. Stress, time constraints and human errors in a high-risk scenario are liable to lead to oversights and missed “critical” steps in ensuring “safe” pre-anaesthesia setup. The present study aimed to determine the efficacy of a validated anaesthesia safety checklist in reducing missed critical steps in pre-anaesthesia setup in simulated settings. Methods This prospective observational study was conducted in the Department of Anaesthesiology of a tertiary care center after obtaining approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee, and the study was registered with CTRI (057174). A curated anaesthesia safety checklist on pre-anaesthesia setup for class 1 emergency caesarean section was designed and validated by senior anaesthetists. The checklist was categorized into mandatory and desirable presence in the operating theatre. 25 anaesthesia residents selected at random in simulated settings and after obtaining informed consent from them, were asked to prepare the OT for an emergency caesarean section with and without the checklist. The incidence of missed steps was also assessed. The chi-squared test was used to assess statistical significance. Results Use of checklist showed significant improvements in the compliance to “mandatory” aspects of OT preparedness in technical aspects as well as presence of a critical drugs. “Desirable” attributes also showed significant improvements in the compliance. Conclusions The use of validated checklists as guides in simulated learning scenarios reduces the incidence of missing critical aspects of OT preparedness for emergency caesarean sections.

                Background This study aimed to document the occurrence of the Egyptian fruit bat Rousettus aegyptiacus in King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Royal Nature Reserve (KSRNR), Hail region, Saudi Arabia, where its presence had not previously been confirmed. Methods Field surveys were conducted in the Hail region, and direct observations were documented using photographic evidence. Bats roosting in a natural crevice were photographed and assessed for colony size. Results More than 50 individuals, including adults and juveniles, were observed roosting in a rock crevice. The photographic documentation confirms the presence of a stable colony of R. aegyptiacus in this area, extending the known distribution of the species into a previously unrecorded region of Saudi Arabia. Conclusions These findings provide the first photographic record of R. aegyptiacus in KSRNR and highlight the species’ ecological adaptation to arid habitats. The results emphasize the need for targeted surveys and long-term monitoring to better understand the distribution and conservation of this species in desert environments.

                Background Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) is a progressive neurovascular-degenerative condition without specific treatment that causes lacunar stroke, most intracerebral haemorrhage, vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) and several neuropsychiatric conditions. Objectives To conduct a rapid multi-stage scoping review to identify licensed interventions that could be repurposed for testing in cSVD at phase-3. Methods First, we screened preclinical studies of potential relevance to cSVD and used a drug dictionary to identify studies of potential interventions. Separately, we screened clinical studies of relevance to cSVD and VCI. Following merging, we removed drugs that were unsuitable or impractical to assess long-term in the UK. We then performed mini-meta-analyses for shortlisted interventions assessing effects on cognition and scored these for their relevance to cSVD. Results The preclinical review created a long-list of 1,757 deduplicated interventions. Those that were available in the UK, not expensive or impractical to administer long-term were merged with 62 interventions identified from 75 relevant clinical studies to create a medium-list of 52 interventions. Focussed literature review short-listed ten interventions for review by an Independent Scientific Advisory Group; they ranked three as most suitable for immediate testing: metformin, tadalafil and isosorbide mononitrate. Conclusion This rapid review identified three interventions that are suitable for testing in a late phase-3 (platform) trial involving patients with cSVD. The approach could be improved with partial automation, text mining and generative pre-trained transformer approaches which would help manage the large data volumes. Further, our data-driven approach could be combined with genetic or other mechanistic methods to further de-risk future trials.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-898/v1?src=rss">Quantitative Evidence of Perceived Organizational Support and Employee Job Satisfaction of Teachers in Government-Aided Primary Schools in Bushenyi District, Uganda [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This study explores the relationship between perceived organizational support and employee job satisfaction, focusing on how rewards, recognition, and training influence teachers’ experiences in their roles. The study aimed to achieve three main goals: to assess the level of job satisfaction among teachers in government-aided primary schools in Bushenyi District, to examine how rewards, recognition, and training impact teachers’ job satisfaction and to identify practical strategies that schools can adopt to enhance organizational support and improve teacher satisfaction using a descriptive cross-sectional survey design. A total of 56 teachers make up the total population, and a sample size of 38 respondents was drawn using Cochran’s formula. Data were collected from teachers across 13 government-aided primary schools in Bushenyi District using a questionnaire. A simple random sampling was used to select the respondents. The validity and reliability of research instruments were tested using the content validity index and Cronbach’s alpha, which yielded 0.82. The quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The findings revealed that 47.4% of the teachers held diplomas, while 28.9% had bachelor’s degrees. A significant majority (84.2%) had more than five years of teaching experience, indicating a stable but potentially stagnant workforce. Teachers expressed dissatisfaction with their rewards and recognition, with only a small percentage reporting regular acknowledgment of their efforts. Training programs were found to be inconsistent, with many teachers citing a lack of advanced and relevant training opportunities. The study concludes that perceived organizational support is a critical factor in enhancing teacher job satisfaction. Key elements such as fair rewards, consistent recognition, and relevant training significantly influence teachers’ motivation and satisfaction levels. However, these elements are often lacking or inconsistently provided in government-aided primary schools. To address these gaps, the study recommends implementing transparent reward systems, regular recognition programs, and continuous professional development opportunities.

                Objective This systematic literature review aimed to study the relationship between CML and hearing loss. Database review Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematological malignancy associated with high levels of white blood cells (WBCs). Changes in otolaryngology are observed in CML. Methodology This systematic literature review of the literature was conducted by searching the MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, WPRIM, LILAC Sand SciELO databases. Studies published between 2013 and 2023 including available in scientific papers as randomized control trials (RCTs), clinical trials, observational studies such as case-control, cross-sectional and cohort studies, whether retrospective or prospective, as well as review studies, case reports, and case series, that met inclusion criteria were included. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist was used to evaluate the quality of studies. Results Of the 142 identified articles, 13 were included for final evaluation with a total sample size of 75 cases diagnosed with CML with hearing defect. CML patients with WBCs above 250 x 109/L, mean WBC level associated with hearing loss of 554x 109/L, were at higher risk of ototoxicity. Males accounted for 85% of cases; with a mean age of 38.9 years. Hearing loss as the first manifestation of CML was among 61.5% of cases, it was bilateral in 83.3% of cases, and in 90% of cases were irreversible defect, with proportion of reversible vs irreversible cases is 1:10. Conclusion Acute sudden hearing loss has been associated with high levels of WBC in patients with CML. Neither aggressive leukoreduction nor leukapheresis has positive effect on the reversibility of the hearing loss.

                Background Cannabis use is associated with an increased risk of Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD). Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has been shown as an effective intervention for CUD in High-Income Countries, but its implementation may be limited in Low- and Middle-Income Countries due to cultural differences. Cultural adaptation of CBT may enhance its appropriateness, acceptability, and feasibility in diverse populations where cannabis use is prevalent with limited treatment options. Methods and Analysis This study follows a multi-method approach. The first phase will involve focus group discussions and In-depth Interviews to explore cultural beliefs, treatment preferences, and contextual barriers. Findings will inform three co-adaptation workshops with patients, caregivers, clinicians, and community stakeholders. These workshops will guide the development of a culturally adapted CBT (CA-CBT) manual. The manual will be piloted in a pre-post feasibility study. The study will assess acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of the intervention using indicators such as recruitment, retention, adherence, and patient engagement. Preliminary outcomes on cannabis use frequency and dependence severity will also be examined. Qualitative data will be analyzed through framework and thematic analysis, whereas quantitative data will be evaluated using descriptive and inferential statistical methods. Ethical approval has been obtained from institutional review boards in Khyber Medical University, Pakistan and the Keele University, United Kingdom. Significance of the Study The study contributes to the literature by documenting a systematic process for adapting CBT for CUD in Pakistan, where access to structured psychological treatments is limited and treatment needs remain unmet. It explains how interviews, focus groups, stakeholder involvement, and feasibility testing will shape the adaptation. The study offers practical guidance for researchers and practitioners developing culturally relevant interventions for substance use in low-resource contexts.

                Background Cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with late-stage coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), causing multiple organ failure and death. According to prior research, fraxin, and quercetin have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimicrobial, and antiviral properties. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the anti-cytokine storm activity of fraxin and quercetin, their combination, and the molecular mechanism behind this activity in Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 cells. Methods LPS-induced macrophage cells were treated with fraxin, quercetin, or their combinations at various doses. Cytotoxicity and cytokine release were evaluated, and gene expression analyses were performed. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to quantify the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin 1 beta (IL1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and RT-PCR was used to measure the gene expression of PPAR-γ and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) concerning GAPDH as a reference gene. Results The results revealed a slight decrease in cell viability only when higher concentrations were applied to the cells. Fraxin, quercetin, and their combination reduced the generation of proinflammatory cytokines. The combination (fraxin + quercetin (FQ)) reduced the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α by 56.2%, 58.5%, and 70.6% respectively, compared to the LPS-only control; pretreatment of cells with farxin, quercetin, and their combination resulted in significant inhibition of TLR-4 gene expression by 89%, 82%, and 93% respectively, compared to the control (P˂ 0.05); FQ upregulated PPAR-γ expression up to 60-fold compared to the control, while fraxin and quercetin increased PPAR-γ by 17.6 and 8.6-folds, respectively. Conclusions Based on these findings, fraxin, quercetin, and their combination were able to mitigate cytokine release and improve the levels of gene expression involved in their pathways, making these agents and their combination candidates for further investigation in in vivo settings to expand knowledge about their kinetics and dynamics.

                Confounding can significantly distort the findings of studies examining cause-and-effect relationships, especially in etiological research. To mitigate this issue, researchers must carefully assess potential confounding variables that may relate to both the exposure and outcome but are not directly influenced by the exposure itself. It is essential that these variables truly impact the outcome rather than simply being correlated with the exposure to avoid false associations. Strengthening confidence in the actual relationship between exposure and outcome requires an understanding of biological mechanisms and the application of various methods to adjust for confounders. The oversight of confounding often arises from inappropriate statistical tests and the aggregation of data across multiple studies. This scoping review article discusses the challenges posed by confounding and presents machine learning approaches for effective control in health science research. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) serve as causal graph tools to identify potential confounding variables in health research. By mapping presumed relationships between variables, DAGs enable researchers to estimate causal effects more accurately. While traditional methods such as randomization, matching, and stratification remain effective for controlling confounding, newer techniques like latent variable modeling with negative controls and machine learning methods such as LASSO, Ridge regression, and random forests offer enhanced flexibility and adaptability.

                Background Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a highly effective tool for the detection of prostate cancer (PCa). Diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) is a sensitive technique that depends on the b value and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value for the diagnosis of PCa. The main objective of this study was to determine the optimal b-value and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value in DW-MRI for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Methods A prospective study including 26 male participants were conducted. MRI examinations were performed with T2 fat saturation sequences, and Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) sequences with b-values (800, 1000, 1500, and 2000 mm2/s) were used, and the corresponding ADC maps were calculated. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were conducted. Results According to the present study, a b-value of 0,1500 mm2/s exhibited the highest Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Signal Intensity Ratio (SIR), and Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR). Area Under the Curve (AUC) for 0,1500 mm2/s was 0.80, indicating a high diagnostic accuracy for prostate cancer. Conclusion DWI with a b-value of 1500 mm2/s provides good diagnostic accuracy for differential diagnosis of prostate lesions. DWI is a crucial sequence in multiparametric MRI of the prostate and offers detailed information that enhances the accuracy of prostate cancer diagnosis and management.

                Background Polypharmacy, or taking multiple medications simultaneously, is a common occurrence in the elderly population, increasing the risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and drug-drug interactions (DDIs) requiring the intricate management of multiple comorbid conditions. Pharmacogenomics, the study of genetic differences affecting drug metabolism and response, can offer hope of more tailored medication regimens and enhanced therapeutic response. Aim The aim of this study is to create pharmacogenomic profiles of elderly patients in order to determine patient-specific genetic variation contributing to drug response, ultimately influencing the efficacy of drug therapy and increasing the potential risk of ADRs. Method A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 50 geriatric patients aged 60 years or older receiving multi-drug therapy. Saliva samples were collected and genotyped using the Infinium™ Global Screening Array v3.0 BeadChip. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with drug response were identified using the PharmGKB database. SNPs with significant clinical relevance were analysed, and pharmacogenomic profiles were visualized to assess risks for ADRs and altered drug efficacy. Results Out of 1,243 SNPs analysed per individual, 561 SNPs with two risk alleles were identified. Fifteen SNPs were present in over 90% of participants, with significant variants observed in genes such as CYP2C9 (associated with warfarin metabolism), TPMT (linked to methotrexate dosing), and SLCO1B3 (associated with docetaxel toxicity). More than 50% of participants had two or more risk alleles, highlighting their predisposition to ADRs and altered drug metabolism. Conclusion The findings of this study emphasize the transformative potential of pharmacogenomics for rationalizing drug therapy among elderly patients, especially when they are susceptible to polypharmacy. Through identification of major genetic differences such as CYP2C9, TPMT and other pharmacogenes the study underlines the requirement for individualized pharmacotherapy based on distinct genetic profiles.

                Background Radiation therapy (RT) for central nervous system (CNS) malignancies can result in neurocognitive decline, affecting quality of life. While hippocampal-sparing approaches are well documented, limited data exist on the impact of radiation dose to other cognitive structures. This prospective study evaluates domain-specific cognitive changes following RT and explores correlations with radiation dose to key brain regions. Methodology Twenty-five patients with primary CNS tumours undergoing focal radiotherapy, with or without concurrent chemotherapy, were enrolled. Neurocognitive function was assessed using the Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination III (ACE-III) tool, pre- and six months post-treatment. Radiation dose-volume histogram (DVH) data were analyzed for structures including the hippocampus, amygdala, cerebellum, and corpus callosum. Patients were stratified based on ACE-III score decline (≥3 points vs. <3 points), and dose-response correlations were examined. Results A statistically significant decline in mean ACE-III scores was observed post-treatment (pre: 89.48 ± 6.84 vs. post: 87.91 ± 6.29, p = 0.007). Attention, language, and fluency were the most affected domains. Patients with cognitive decline received higher radiation doses to all examined structures, with the corpus callosum showing the strongest association (mean dose in decline group: 35.91 Gy vs. 30.70 Gy; p = 0.440). However, no dose-response relationship reached statistical significance. Conclusion This study highlights early, domain-specific neurocognitive decline following focal RT for CNS tumours, with attention and language being most vulnerable. Corpus callosum dose emerged as a key correlate. These findings suggest the need to broaden neuroprotection strategies beyond the hippocampus and emphasize the value of incorporating routine neurocognitive assessment.

                Background this study was to evaluate the fracture resistance and elastic modulus of modified 3D-printed resins containing zirconium dioxide nanoparticles (ZNPs) and silicon dioxide nanoparticles (SNPs). Methods Tooth-colored 3D-printed resin samples (ASIGA (AS)) and NextDent (ND)) were modified with silanized ZNPs and SNPs. Five groups (n=100) were prepared for each resin type, one without nanoparticles, and four groups (n=20 per group) with varying nanoparticles concentrations (0.5 wt. %ZNP, 1 wt.%ZNP, 0.5 wt.%SNP, and 1 wt.%SNP). Half of the specimens (110 samples) were subjected to thermal aging (TA; 5000 cycles). The fracture resistance and elastic modulus were evaluated, followed by Fourier-transform infrared and scanning electron microscopy analyses. An analysis of variance and Tukey’s post-hoc test were applied for data analysis. Results Incorporating SNPs and ZNPs into the ND material significantly improved the fracture resistance compared to that of the control group, with 1 wt.%SNP showing the highest resistance (1405.9±128.4 MPa) and 0.5 wt.%ZNP the lowest (1047.5±100.6 MPa). However, the elastic modulus decreased notably with these additions, with the ND control group (3097.5±115.9 MPa) exhibiting the highest elastic modulus and ZNP groups (1772.0±128.8 MPa) exhibiting the lowest. For the AS material, similar enhancements in fracture resistance occurred; however, reductions in the elastic modulus were more significant in the ND material. For the AS material, SNP and ZNP addition improved fracture resistance relative to that of the control group. Post-TA, the elastic modulus significantly decreased in both the ND and AS materials (p < 0.05). Compared to the ND material, the increase in fracture resistance was less pronounced in the AS material. Conclusion The addition of ZNPs and SNPs increased the fracture resistances of both materials. TA significantly reduced the fracture resistance and elastic modulus in most NP-incorporated groups. The AS material may be recommended owing to its high fracture resistance during testing.

                Background As education is key in stimulating all round development of any nation, every child has a right to education. Teachers are called upon to understand how different factor; both internal and external to the school may influence the academic achievement of learners so as to apply appropriate interventions for the best of the learners. Thus, this article presents a dataset to investigate the influence of learner-based factors on learners’ academic achievement in government aided secondary schools in Bushenyi District. Sharing of datasets shows transparency, gives room for replication of findings, and permits comparison with other independent data sets. Methods Data in this study was collected from seven government-aided secondary schools in Bushenyi district, Western Uganda for the first author’s masters research project in educational management pursued at Kampala International University Western Campus (KIUWC). The data presented is quantitative and was collected using a cross-sectional survey design in that collection of data was at a single point in time. Two categories of participants were involved: (a) 333 learners who completed a learner’s questionnaire, (b) 42 teachers who completed a teacher’s questionnaire. The proposal of the study was cleared ethically by the Research Ethics Committee of Kampala International University Western Campus. Thereafter, written consent was sought from the participants. The selection of the schools and participants was by simple random sampling. The collection of data took place in the month of April, 2025. Data description This dataset is in the form of raw data saved as two sets in MS Excel 2016 on https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/m4hx9vc8sj/1. The first set contains data relating to learners’ responses entitled “Responses from learners” and the second file contains data from teachers entitled “Responses from teachers”. The files containing the mentioned data are quite similar in that each file has two sheets: the first sheet gives the raw data and the second sheet gives the explanation of variable codes Conclusion Providing a dataset related to our study is of great significance in that it informs policy makers such as the Ministry of Education and Sports officials and other education officers about how specific factors related to learners influence their academic achievement and this can guide in the development of training programs for teachers and the implementation of educational policies that promote equity in schools.

Predictive coding (PC) proposes that our brains work as an inference machine, generating an internal model of the world and minimizing predictions errors (i.e., differences between external sensory evidence and internal prediction signals). Theoretical models of PC often rely on high-level approaches, and therefore implementations detailing which neurons or pathways are used to compute prediction errors or adapt the internal representations, as well as their level of agreement with biological circuitry, are currently missing. Here we propose a computational model of PC, which integrates a neuroanatomically informed hierarchy of two cortical areas with a simplified laminar organization and cell-type-specific connectivity between excitatory, PV, SST and VIP cells. Our model efficiently performs PC, even in the presence of external and internal noise, by forming latent representations of naturalistic visual input (MNIST, fashion-MNIST and grayscale CIFAR-10) via Hebbian learning and using them to predict sensory input by minimizing prediction errors. The model assumes that both positive and negative prediction errors are computed by stereotypical excitatory-PV-SST-VIP circuits with the same structure but different incoming input. During sensory inference, neural oscillatory activity emerges in the system due to interactions between representation and prediction error microcircuits, with optogenetics-inspired inactivation protocols revealing a differentiated role of PV, SST and VIP cell types in such dynamics. Finally, our model shows anomalous responses to deviant stimuli within series of same-image presentations, in agreement with experimental results on mismatch negativity and oddball paradigms. We argue that our model constitutes an important step to better understand the circuits mediating PC in real cortical networks.

Biology has been transformed by the rapid development of computing and the concurrent rise of data-rich approaches such as, omics or high-resolution imaging. However, there is a persistent computational skills gap in the biomedical research workforce. Inherent limitations of classroom teaching and institutional core support highlight the need for accessible ways for researchers to explore developments in computational biology. An analysis of the Scripps Research Genomics Core revealed increases in the total number and diversity of experiments: the share of experiments other than bulk RNA- or DNA-sequencing increased from 34% to 60% within 10 years, requiring more tailored computational analyses. These challenges were tackled by forming a volunteer-led affinity group of approximately 300 academic biomedical researchers interested in computational biology, referred to as the Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (CBB) affinity group. This adaptive group has provided continuing education and networking opportunities through seminars, workshops, and coding sessions while evolving along with the needs of its members. A survey of CBB’s impact confirmed the group’s events increased the members’ exposure to computational biology educational and research events (79% respondents) and networking opportunities (61% respondents). Thus, volunteer-led affinity groups may be a viable complement to traditional institutional resources for enhancing the application of computing in biomedical research.

                <p>by Kristi Lin-Rahardja, Jessica Scarborough, Jacob G. Scott</p>
Gene signatures predictive of chemotherapeutic response have the potential to extend the reach of precision medicine by allowing oncologists to optimize treatment for individuals. Most published predictive signatures are only capable of predicting response for individual drugs, but most chemotherapy regimens utilize combinations of different agents. We propose a unified framework, called the chemogram, that uses predictive signatures to rank the relative predicted sensitivity of different drugs for individual tumors. Using this approach, providers could efficiently screen against many therapeutics to optimize chemotherapy at any time, whether it be for a treatment-naive tumor or a chemo-resistant tumor requiring a new treatment strategy. To demonstrate the utility of the chemogram, we used predictive signatures (extracted from a previously established method) in our framework to rank predicted sensitivity among drugs within cell lines. We then compared the rank order of predicted and observed response against each drug. Across most cancer types, chemogram-generated predictions were more accurate than predictions made by randomly generated gene signatures, signatures extracted from differential expression alone, and was comparable to another established method of drug response prediction. Our framework demonstrates the ability of transcriptomic signatures to not only predict chemotherapeutic response, but also correctly assign rankings of drug sensitivity on an individual basis. Additionally, scaling the chemogram to include more drugs does not compromise accuracy.

                <p>by Hunter L. Colegrove, Raymond J. Monnat, Alison F. Feder</p>

Fanconi Anemia (FA) is a heritable syndrome characterized by DNA damage repair deficits, frequent malformations and a significantly elevated risk of bone marrow failure, leukemia, and mucosal head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy can prevent marrow failure and lower leukemia risk, but mucosal gene therapy to lower HNSCC risk remains untested. Major knowledge gaps include an incomplete understanding of how rapidly gene-corrected cellular lineages could spread through the oral epithelium, and which delivery parameters are critical for ensuring efficient gene correction. To answer these questions, we extended an agent-based model of the oral epithelium to include the delivery of gene correction <i>in situ</i> to FA cells and the competitive dynamics between cellular lineages with and without gene correction. We found that only gene-corrected lineages with substantial proliferative advantages (probability of resisting displacement out of the basal layer ≥0.1) could spread on clinically relevant timelines, and that these lineages were initially at high risk of loss in the generations following correction. Delivering gene correction to many cells minimizes the risk of loss, while delivery to many distinct locations within a tissue maximizes the rate of spread. To determine the impact of mucosal gene therapy in preventing the clonal expansion of pre-cancerous mutations, we compared the expected burden of <i>TP53</i> mutations in simulated tissue sections with and without gene correction. We found that when FA cells have elevated genome instability or a <i>TP53</i>-dependent proliferative advantage, gene correction can substantially reduce the accumulation of pro-tumorigenic mutations. This model illustrates the power of computational frameworks to identify critical determinants of therapeutic success to enable experimental optimization and support novel and effective gene therapy applications.

                <p>by Amany Azevedo Amin, Andrew Philippides, Paul Graham</p>

Individually foraging ants use egocentric views as a dominant navigation strategy for learning and retracing routes. Evidence suggests that route retracing can be achieved by algorithms which use views as ‘visual compasses’, where individuals choose the heading that leads to the most familiar visual scene when compared to route memories. However, such a mechanism does not naturally lead to route approach, and alternative strategies are required to enable convergence when off-route and for correcting on-route divergence. In this work we investigate how behaviour incorporated into visual compass like route learning and recapitulation strategies might enable convergence to a learned route and its destination. Without alterations to the basic form of the initial learning route, the most successful recapitulation method comes from a ‘cast and surge’ approach, a mechanism seen across arthropods for olfactory navigation. In this strategy casts form a ‘zig-zagged’ or oscillatory search in space for familiar views, and surges exploit visual familiarity gradients. We also find that performance improves if the learned route consists of an oscillatory motor mechanism with learning gated to occur when the agent approaches the central axis of the oscillation. Furthermore, such oscillations combined with the cast and surge method additively enhance performance, showing that it benefits to incorporate oscillatory behaviour in both learning and recapitulation. As destination reaching is the primary goal of navigation, we show that a suitably sized goal-orientated learning walk might suffice, but that the scale of this is dependent on the degree of divergence, and thus depends on route length and the route learning and recapitulation strategies used. Finally we show that view familiarity can modulate on-the-spot scans performed by an agent, providing a better reflection of ant behaviour. Overall, our results show that the visual compass can provide a basis for robust visual navigation, so long as it is considered holistically with the details of basic motor and sensory-motor patterns of ants undertaking route learning and recapitulation.

                <p>by Zhaojie Chai, Guansheng Li, Papa Alioune Ndour, Philippe Connes, Pierre A. Buffet, Melanie Franco, George Em Karniadakis</p>

Gaucher Disease (GD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency in the enzyme glucocerebrosidase, leading to the accumulation of glucosylceramide in various cells, including red blood cells (RBCs). This accumulation results in altered biomechanical properties and rheological behavior of RBCs, which may play an important role in blood rheology and the development of bone infarcts, avascular necrosis (AVN) and other bone diseases associated with GD. In this study, dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations are employed to investigate the biomechanics and rheology of blood and RBCs in GD under various flow conditions. The model incorporates the unique characteristics of GD RBCs, such as decreased deformability and increased aggregation properties, and aims to capture the resulting changes in RBC biophysics and blood viscosity. This study is the first to explore the Young’s modulus and aggregation parameters of GD RBCs by validating simulations with confocal imaging and experimental RBC disaggregation thresholds. Through <i>in silico</i> simulations, we examine the impact of hematocrit, RBC disaggregation threshold, and cell stiffness on blood viscosity in GD. The results reveal three distinct domains of GD blood viscosity based on shear rate: the aggregation domain, where the RBC disaggregation threshold predominantly influences blood viscosity; the transition area, where both RBC aggregation and stiffness impact on blood viscosity; and the stiffness domain, where the stiffness of RBCs emerges as the primary determinant of blood viscosity. By analyzing RBC mechanical properties and blood viscosity in relation to bone disease, we find that the RBC aggregation properties, deformability, and blood viscosity, may contribute to its onset. These findings enhance our understanding of how changes in RBC properties impact on blood viscosity and may affect bone health, offering a partial explanation for the bone complications observed in GD patients.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78003?af=R">Predictive Value of Plasma Biomarkers in Tau‐PET Transitions</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to determine the predictive value of amyloid-positron emission tomography (PET) versus the plasma ratio of phosphorylated tau at threonine 217 (p-tau217) to non-phosphorylated tau217 (%p-tau217) for tau-PET transitions (T− to T+). The added value of combining plasma amyloid-β 42 and amyloid-β 40 (Aβ42/40) and %p-tau217 into an amyloid probability score (APS2) was also assessed.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) participants had plasma markers measured at via mass spectrometry (MS), an amyloid-PET scan, and a tau-PET (meta-temporal region of interest [ROI]) negative scan (standardized uptake value ratio [SUVR] &lt;1.29) at the index (baseline) date, along with one or more follow-up tau-PET scans. The BioFINDER-2 cohort was used for validation. Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, and apolipoprotein (<i>APOE</i>) ε4 were used to assess predictors, with scaling to the interquartile range (IQR) for comparability of hazard ratios (HR).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 255 tau-PET negative MCSA participants (median age: 71.9 years), 37 converted to tau-PET positive (median follow-up time: 3.81 years). Higher %p-tau217 (HR: 1.52 [95% CI: 1.28–1.80]), amyloid-PET centiloid (HR: 1.47 [95% CI: 1.20–1.79]), and APS2 (HR: 1.62 [95% CI: 1.22–2.16]) predicted tau-PET conversion. However, Aβ42/40 (HR: 0.94 [95% CI: 0.54–1.66]) was not associated with tau-PET conversion. In the BioFINDER-2 cohort (605 tau-negative, median age: 70.2), 33 converted to tau-positive (median follow-up time: 2 years), with higher %p-tau217 (HR: 1.80 [95% CI: 1.50–2.17]), amyloid-PET centiloid (HR: 2.29 [95% CI: 1.77–2.97]), and lower Aβ42/40 (HR: 2.38 [95% CI: 1.17–4.83]) predicting conversion.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In two cohorts, %p-tau217 was associated with tau-PET conversion, comparable to amyloid-PET. APS2 also predicted conversion in the MCSA cohort, whereas Aβ42/40 predicted conversion in the BioFINDER-2 cohort, which had more individuals with cognitive impairment.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Impaired ability to induce stepping after incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) can limit the efficacy of locomotor training, often leaving patients wheelchair-bound. The cuneiform nucleus (CNF), a key mesencephalic locomotor control center, modulates the activity of spinal locomotor centers via the reticulospinal tract. Even with severe corticospinal damage, the widely distributed reticulospinal fibers frequently cross the lesion, and lumbosacral spinal locomotor centers remain responsive. Unilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the CNF (CNF-DBS) can increase modulatory input to sublesional locomotor centers and was shown to induce stepping and promote locomotor recovery in rodent models of severe incomplete SCI. Given the evolutionarily conserved CNF-reticulospinal system, we hypothesize that CNF-DBS can augment training and improve gait in humans with incomplete SCI above the lumbosacral levels.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Aiming at bench-to-bedside translation, we investigate CNF-DBS in non-ambulatory patients (<a target="_blank"
   title="Link to external resource"
   href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</a>, NCT03053791). Here, we present the first 2 individuals with chronic tetraplegia who underwent 6 months of locomotor training supported by unilateral CNF-DBS, with regular follow-up assessments of adverse and therapeutic effects performed without and with stimulation.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The walking distance covered during the 6-Minute Walking Test (6MWT) after 6 months compared to baseline served as the primary study end point, which was reached by patient 1 in the off-condition and by patient 2 in the off- and the on-condition. No serious adverse events occurred.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We show that the CNF-DBS was well tolerated and had therapeutic potential in the first 2 patients, and discuss the lessons learnt with resulting implementations for the next patients. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-242/v2?src=rss">How walkable are our cities for older adults? Mediation of comfort, convenience, and aesthetics [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study investigates the mediating role of comfort (CMT), convenience (CNV), and aesthetics (AST) in the relationship between the enablers of an age-friendly built environment for walkability and outcomes such as increased physical activity level (IPL), increased socialization (ISL), and improved quality of life (IQL) in older adults. The research emphasizes the importance of creating age-friendly environments to support the well-being and quality of life of older adults, with implications for urban planners and policymakers to promote sustainable and inclusive design. Methods The research follows a positivist paradigm using a quantitative approach and survey strategy with a cross-sectional design. A sample of 333 older adults was selected using the convenience sampling technique, and data were gathered through a self-administered questionnaire. Results Findings from hypothesis testing indicate that, among the enablers, age-friendly urban design policies are the most significant construct, positively impacting all three mediating variables. Aesthetics was found to have a significant positive effect on increased physical activity level and increased socialization, while comfort and convenience significantly influenced increased physical activity level and improved quality of life, respectively. Conclusion These results suggest implications for urban planners and policymakers to enhance the contribution of built environment for walkability toward increased physical activity level, increased socialization, and improved quality of life for older adults. The research offers valuable insights for academics and practitioners, emphasizing the importance of sustainable design while ensuring inclusivity to promote the well-being and quality of life of older adults.
