              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Potential use of absorbance scanning in differentiating tumor microenvironment compositions from endoscopic biopsy of colorectal cancer patients. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The microtumor environment is an area where tumor cells are surrounded by several cells such as immune cells, stromal cells and endothelial cells as well as blood and lymphatic vessels. It is known that various cytokines and growth factors are released by various cells surrounding the tumor and affect the growth of tumor cells. Differences in chemical composition in the microtumor environment can be detected using spectrometry. The aim of this study was to examine the potential of scanning absorbance spectrometry in differentiating cells based on the chemical composition of endoscopic biopsies of colorectal cancer patients. Methods: An endoscopic biopsy of the patient from Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Jakarta was collected and homogenized in phosphate buffer saline using TissueLyser. Scanning absorbance was performed using a UV-VIS spectrophotometer. The results of scanning absorbance were then processed using principal component analysis (PCA) in Orange Data-Mining version 3.28.0 software and the results were represented in a scatter plot diagram. Results: Based on the results of the analysis using PCA, three patients were identified in different quadrant regions, crc006 and crc011 obtained from patients with the differentiation status located close together while crc009 and undifferentiated were located far apart. Conclusion: This indicates the potential of scanning absorbance in differentiating the chemical composition of the tumor microenvironment from patient biopsies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The causal model of health literacy and health behavior for obesity prevention among primary school students in Bangkok, Thailand [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The aim of the study was to develop a research instrument to study the levels of health literacy for obesity prevention (HLFOP), as well as health behavior for obesity prevention (HBFOP). In addition, we investigated the causal model between health literacy and health behavior for obesity prevention among primary school students in Bangkok, Thailand. Methods: A cross-sectional study among 600 participants who were primary school students (aged 9-13 years) was conducted. The participants were selected from schools in all parts of Bangkok using multi-stage random sampling technique. The research instrument to assess HLFOP and HBFOP, constructed by the researchers, were utilized for data collection. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, and structural equation model through linear structural relationship. Results: We found that HBFOP was directly influenced by heath literacy in the category of Critical Literacy with an effect size of 0.65 (p < 0.01), and was indirectly influenced in the category of Basic Literacy and Interactive Literacy through Critical Literacy with effect sizes of 0.46 and 0.58 (p<0.01), respectively. The model was consistent with the empirical data, with Chi-Square=13.68, df=7, p=0.05721, RMSEA (root mean square error of approximation)= 0.040,  SRMR (standardized root mean square residual)= 0.017 NFI (normal fit index)=0.99, GFI (goodness of fit index)=0.99, and AGFI (adjusted goodness of fit index)=0.97. Conclusions: HLFOP was influential on HBFOP in primary school students in the Bangkok Metropolis. The categories that were particularly influential were: 1) Basic Literacy: accessing health information skills; 2) Interactive Literacy: communication skills; and 3) Critical Literacy: media literacy and self-management skills.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Multivariate analysis and characterization of low impact crime in Mexico City [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Multivariate analysis is fast becoming a key instrument that can be used to address crimes or incidents. It may be helpful to assess government policies on crime prevention. Methods: To distinguish between the 25 official crime categories reported in Mexico City (Jan 2019 - Jun 2019), principal coordinates analysis was used to determine the quality of a characteristic in this context. This study used cluster analysis via K-means and Biplot based on time and location in terms of crime occurrence. Results: The results obtained from this preliminary analysis indicates that around 70% of crime occurrence is shown in the following boroughs: Cuauhtémoc, Iztapalapa, Gustavo A. Madero, Benito Juárez, Álvaro Obregón, Coyoacán, and Miguel Hidalgo. Conclusion: There are two factors that contribute to the difficulties in crime analysis in Mexico City, namely, the lack of people’s trust in authorities and the insufficiency of tools for data analysis. The latter is an integral part in achieving justice for the victims of crimes because it impedes the process of observing patterns and predicting the perpetrators’ next actions, which may help in solving a number of types of crimes. It is then imperative for law enforcement to utilize data analysis tools that aid in identifying crime patterns and trends, such that the occurrences of crime show a downward trend and consequentially increase the people’s trust in law enforcement agencies.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">PAK5 promotes RNA helicase DDX5 sumoylation and miRNA-10b processing in a kinase-dependent manner in breast cancer</a></h4>

              
                Li et al. show that PAK5 deletion suppresses mammary tumorigenesis in MMTV-PyVT transgenic mice, an effect that is related to the PAK5-DDX5-miR-10b pathway. Phosphorylation-dependent sumoylation of DDX5 by PAK5 enhances formation of a DDX5/Drosha/DGCR8 complex, thus promoting miR-10b processing posttranscriptionally, suggesting a potential therapeutic avenue for breast cancer treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Gene network modeling via TopNet reveals functional dependencies between diverse tumor-critical mediator genes</a></h4>

              
                Malignant cell transformation requires the cooperation of multiple oncogenic mutations. Here, we demonstrate that non-mutated genes function within a network of strong genetic interdependencies that are critical to the malignant state. Our network modeling methodology, TopNet, reveals a sparse topological gene network architecture, effectively pinpointing functionally relevant gene interactions.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Protein modifications throughout the lung cancer proteome unravel the cancer-specific regulation of glycolysis</a></h4>

              
                Duan et al. demonstrate extensive modifications of glycolytic enzymes in cancer and show that triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) Ser58 phosphorylation is significantly elevated in tumors. Blocking TPI Ser58 phosphorylation inhibits aerobic glycolysis, cancer cell growth, and metastasis. PRKACA directly phosphorylates TPI at Ser58, thereby enhancing glycolysis metabolism and tumor development.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">IFI16 inhibits DNA repair that potentiates type-I interferon-induced antitumor effects in triple negative breast cancer</a></h4>

              
                Ka et al. show that IFI16 inhibits DNA repair by binding to histone-evicted DNA at damaged DNA sites and thereby induces the accumulation of cytosolic DNA that promotes STING-induced type-I IFN signaling. IFI16 could be a key mediator in DNA-damage-induced antitumor immunity in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).

                Marek et al. show that histone deacetylases (HDACs) from trypanosomes diverge from human HDACs. Notably, T. cruzi HDACs tcDAC1 and tcDAC2 are essential. tcDAC2 has structural features unobserved in human HDACs that promote specific interactions with inhibitors. Thus, targeting atypical HDACs from pathogens can lead to anti-parasitic strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Mapping vestibular and visual contributions to angular head velocity tuning in the cortex</a></h4>

              
                Head motion signals are critical for spatial navigation and visual perception. Hennestad et al. develop a technique for rotating mice under a two-photon microscope and find neurons tuned to head rotation speed in many cortical areas. This tuning depends on vestibular and visual input in an area-dependent manner.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of zebrafish cranial neural crest reveals spatiotemporal regulation of lineage decisions during development</a></h4>

              
                Tatarakis et al. provide a single-cell transcriptomic timeline of cranial neural crest (NC) development in zebrafish and address long-standing questions surrounding the integration of NC cell migration and lineage specification. They find that lineages are specified mid-migration. These fate decisions correspond to shifts in Wnt signaling, and lineages rapidly segregate.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Brain connectivity inversely scales with developmental temperature in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Different developmental temperatures lead to differently wired brains and behavioral adaptation to the temperature at which a fly developed. Kiral et al. propose that evolution has selected for a Drosophila genome that can develop functional, but non-identical, brains through scalable synapse formation based on relative availability of synaptic partners.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Astroglial ER-mitochondria calcium transfer mediates endocannabinoid-dependent synaptic integration</a></h4>

              
                Serrat et al. demonstrate that mitochondria-associated CB1 (mtCB1) receptors determine endocannabinoid-dependent intracellular calcium signaling in astrocytes to promote synaptic integration. Upon endocannabinoid mobilization, mtCB1 receptors favor calcium transfer from ER to mitochondria through a specific molecular cascade involving the mitochondrial calcium uniporter, thereby shaping the dynamics of cytosolic calcium events.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">The balance of mitochondrial fission and fusion in cortical axons depends on the kinases SadA and SadB</a></h4>

              
                Di Meo et al. show that SadA/B kinases are required in cortical neurons for axon-specific mitochondrial dynamics. They regulate the balance of fission and fusion through the phosphorylation of tau downstream of Ankyrin B. The elongation of mitochondria after loss of SadA/B can be normalized by mild actin destabilization.

                Arguello et al. show that deletion of the mitochondrial protein ATAD3 in neurons leads to neuronal loss and death. The earliest phenotype is disruption of the mitochondrial inner membrane structure; OXPHOS complexes are affected later. ATAD3 is regularly spaced and has several interactors at the inner membrane, including CI subunits.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Hemodynamic molecular imaging of tumor-associated enzyme activity in the living brain</a></h4>

              
                Molecular imaging could have great utility for detecting, classifying, and guiding treatment of brain disorders, but existing probes offer limited capability for assessing relevant physiological parameters. Here, we describe a potent approach for noninvasive mapping of cancer-associated enzyme activity using a molecular sensor that acts on the vasculature, providing a diagnostic readout via local changes in hemodynamic image contrast. The sensor is targeted at the fibroblast activation protein (FAP), an extracellular dipeptidase and clinically relevant biomarker of brain tumor biology. Optimal FAP sensor variants were identified by screening a series of prototypes for responsiveness in a cell-based bioassay. The best variant was then applied for quantitative neuroimaging of FAP activity in rats, where it reveals nanomolar-scale FAP expression by xenografted cells. The activated probe also induces robust hemodynamic contrast in nonhuman primate brain. This work thus demonstrates a potentially translatable strategy for ultrasensitive functional imaging of molecular targets in neuromedicine.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">In silico-labeled ghost cytometry</a></h4>

              
                Characterization and isolation of a large population of cells are indispensable procedures in biological sciences. Flow cytometry is one of the standards that offers a method to characterize and isolate cells at high throughput. When performing flow cytometry, cells are molecularly stained with fluorescent labels to adopt biomolecular specificity which is essential for characterizing cells. However, molecular staining is costly and its chemical toxicity can cause side effects to the cells which becomes a critical issue when the cells are used downstream as medical products or for further analysis. Here, we introduce a high-throughput stain-free flow cytometry called in silico-labeled ghost cytometry which characterizes and sorts cells using machine-predicted labels. Instead of detecting molecular stains, we use machine learning to derive the molecular labels from compressive data obtained with diffractive and scattering imaging methods. By directly using the compressive ‘imaging’ data, our system can accurately assign the designated label to each cell in real time and perform sorting based on this judgment. With this method, we were able to distinguish different cell states, cell types derived from human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, and subtypes of peripheral white blood cells using only stain-free modalities. Our method will find applications in cell manufacturing for regenerative medicine as well as in cell-based medical diagnostic assays in which fluorescence labeling of the cells is undesirable.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evolutionary footprints of a cold relic in a rapidly warming world</a></h4>

              
                With accelerating global warming, understanding the evolutionary dynamics of plant adaptation to environmental change is increasingly urgent. Here we reveal the enigmatic history of the genus <i>Cochlearia </i>(Brassicaceae)<i>, </i>a Pleistocene relic that originated from a drought-adapted Mediterranean sister genus during the Miocene. <i>Cochlearia</i> rapidly diversified and adapted to circum-Arctic regions and other cold-characterized habitat types during the Pleistocene. This sudden change in ecological preferences was accompanied by a highly complex, reticulate polyploid evolution, which was apparently triggered by the impact of repeated Pleistocene glaciation cycles. Our results illustrate that two early diversified arctic-alpine diploid gene pools contributed differently to the evolution of this young polyploid genus now captured in a cold-adapted niche<i>.</i> Metabolomics revealed central carbon metabolism responses to cold in diverse species and ecotypes, likely due to continuous connections to cold habitats that may have facilitated widespread adaptation to alpine and subalpine habitats, and which we speculate were coopted from existing drought adaptations. Given the growing scientific interest in adaptive evolution of temperature-related traits, our results provide much-needed taxonomic and phylogenomic resolution of a model system as well as first insights into the origins of its adaptation to cold.

                Anion channelrhodopsin from <i>Guillardia theta</i> (<i>Gt</i>ACR1) has Asp234 (3.2 Å) and Glu68 (5.3 Å) near the protonated Schiff base. Here, we investigate mutant <i>Gt</i>ACR1s (e.g., E68Q/D234N) expressed in HEK293 cells. The influence of the acidic residues on the absorption wavelengths was also analyzed using a quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical approach. The calculated protonation pattern indicates that Asp234 is deprotonated and Glu68 is protonated in the original crystal structures. The D234E mutation and the E68Q/D234N mutation shorten and lengthen the measured and calculated absorption wavelengths, respectively, which suggests that Asp234 is deprotonated in the wild-type <i>Gt</i>ACR1. Molecular dynamics simulations show that upon mutation of deprotonated Asp234 to asparagine, deprotonated Glu68 reorients toward the Schiff base and the calculated absorption wavelength remains unchanged. The formation of the proton transfer pathway via Asp234 toward Glu68 and the disconnection of the anion conducting channel are likely a basis of the gating mechanism.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Determinants shaping the nanoscale architecture of the mouse rod outer segment</a></h4>

              
                The unique membrane organization of the rod outer segment (ROS), the specialized sensory cilium of rod photoreceptor cells, provides the foundation for phototransduction, the initial step in vision. ROS architecture is characterized by a stack of identically shaped and tightly packed membrane disks loaded with the visual receptor rhodopsin. A wide range of genetic aberrations have been reported to compromise ROS ultrastructure, impairing photoreceptor viability and function. Yet, the structural basis giving rise to the remarkably precise arrangement of ROS membrane stacks and the molecular mechanisms underlying genetically inherited diseases remain elusive. Here, cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) performed on native ROS at molecular resolution provides insights into key structural determinants of ROS membrane architecture. Our data confirm the existence of two previously observed molecular connectors/spacers which likely contribute to the nanometer-scale precise stacking of the ROS disks. We further provide evidence that the extreme radius of curvature at the disk rims is enforced by a continuous supramolecular assembly composed of peripherin-2 (PRPH2) and rod outer segment membrane protein 1 (ROM1) oligomers. We suggest that together these molecular assemblies constitute the structural basis of the highly specialized ROS functional architecture. Our Cryo-ET data provide novel quantitative and structural information on the molecular architecture in ROS and substantiate previous results on proposed mechanisms underlying pathologies of certain PRPH2 mutations leading to blindness.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mimicry can drive convergence in structural and light transmission features of transparent wings in Lepidoptera</a></h4>

              
                Müllerian mimicry is a positive interspecific interaction, whereby co-occurring defended prey species share a common aposematic signal. In Lepidoptera, aposematic species typically harbour conspicuous opaque wing colour patterns with convergent optical properties among co-mimetic species. Surprisingly, some aposematic mimetic species have partially transparent wings, raising the questions of whether optical properties of transparent patches are also convergent, and of how transparency is achieved. Here, we conducted a comparative study of wing optics, micro and nanostructures in neotropical mimetic clearwing Lepidoptera, using spectrophotometry and microscopy imaging. We show that transparency, as perceived by predators, is convergent among co-mimics in some mimicry rings. Underlying micro- and nanostructures are also sometimes convergent despite a large structural diversity. We reveal that while transparency is primarily produced by microstructure modifications, nanostructures largely influence light transmission, potentially enabling additional fine-tuning in transmission properties. This study shows that transparency might not only enable camouflage but can also be part of aposematic signals.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evolution of brilliant iridescent feather nanostructures</a></h4>

              
                The brilliant iridescent plumage of birds creates some of the most stunning color displays known in the natural world. Iridescent plumage colors are produced by nanostructures in feathers and have evolved in diverse birds. The building blocks of these structures—melanosomes (melanin-filled organelles)—come in a variety of forms, yet how these different forms contribute to color production across birds remains unclear. Here, we leverage evolutionary analyses, optical simulations, and reflectance spectrophotometry to uncover general principles that govern the production of brilliant iridescence. We find that a key feature that unites all melanosome forms in brilliant iridescent structures is thin melanin layers. Birds have achieved this in multiple ways: by decreasing the size of the melanosome directly, by hollowing out the interior, or by flattening the melanosome into a platelet. The evolution of thin melanin layers unlocks color-producing possibilities, more than doubling the range of colors that can be produced with a thick melanin layer and simultaneously increasing brightness. We discuss the implications of these findings for the evolution of iridescent structures in birds and propose two evolutionary paths to brilliant iridescence.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">New Caledonian crows keep ‘valuable’ hooked tools safer than basic non-hooked tools</a></h4>

              
                The temporary storage and re-use of tools can significantly enhance foraging efficiency. New Caledonian crows in one of our study populations use two types of stick tools – hooked and non-hooked – which differ in raw material, manufacture costs, and foraging performance. Using a large sample of wild-caught, temporarily captive New Caledonian crows, we investigated experimentally whether individuals prefer one tool type over the other when given a choice and whether they take better care of their preferred tools between successive episodes of use, safely storing them underfoot or in nearby holes. Crows strongly preferred hooked stick tools made from <i>Desmanthus virgatus</i> stems over non-hooked stick tools. Importantly, this preference was also reflected in subsequent tool-handling behaviour, with subjects keeping hooked stick tools safe more often than non-hooked stick tools sourced from leaf litter. These results suggest that crows ‘value’ hooked stick tools, which are both costlier to procure and more efficient to use, more than non-hooked stick tools. Results from a series of control treatments suggested that crows altered their tool ‘safekeeping’ behaviour in response to a combination of factors, including tool type and raw material. To our knowledge, our study is the first to use safekeeping behaviour as a proxy for assessing how non-human animals value different tool types, establishing a novel paradigm for productive cross-taxonomic comparisons.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">3D virtual histopathology of cardiac tissue from Covid-19 patients                    based on phase-contrast X-ray tomography</a></h4>

              
                We have used phase-contrast X-ray tomography to characterize the                    three-dimensional (3d) structure of cardiac tissue from patients who succumbed                    to Covid-19. By extending conventional histopathological examination by a third                    dimension, the delicate pathological changes of the vascular system of severe                    Covid-19 progressions can be analyzed, fully quantified and compared to other                    types of viral myocarditis and controls. To this end, cardiac samples with a                    cross section of 3:5mm were scanned at a laboratory setup as well as at a                    parallel beam setup at a synchrotron radiation facility. The vascular network                    was segmented by a deep learning architecture suitable for 3d datasets (V-net),                    trained by sparse manual annotations. Pathological alterations of vessels,                    concerning the variation of diameters and the amount of small holes, were                    observed, indicative of elevated occurrence of intussusceptive angiogenesis,                    also confirmed by high resolution cone beam X-ray tomography and scanning                    electron microscopy. Furthermore, we implemented a fully automated analysis of                    the tissue structure in form of shape measures based on the structure tensor.                    The corresponding distributions show that the histopathology of Covid-19 differs                    from both influenza and typical coxsackie virus myocarditis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Lower Aβ-PET signal in white matter lesions relates to higher extracellular free water in mixed small vessel disease and Alzheimer's pathology</a></h4>

              
                Background and Objectives: Positron emission tomography (PET) with amyloid-ligands recently gained interest for evaluating white matter (WM) pathology. Here, we investigated the neurobiological underpinnings of the amyloid-PET signal in the WM using free water (FW) diffusion MRI in a mixed cohort of small vessel disease (SVD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Methods: We included data from two large cohort imaging studies, including MITNEC-C6 with moderate-to-severe white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden and ADNI-2 with mild-to-moderate WMH burden, covering the spectrum of cognitively normal to dementia. Subjects underwent diffusion MRI, 18F-AV45 amyloid-PET, and cognitive testing. We calculated WM diffusion metrics including fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). In addition, we applied a bi-tensor diffusion MRI model that differentiates between extracellular (FW fraction) and tissue-specific (FW-adjusted FA) compartments of the WM. We tested associations of all diffusion metrics with 18F-AV45 SUVR in regions of WMH vs. normal-appearing WM (NAWM), and with cognition. We further performed partial-least-square analysis to investigate how the diffusion metrics as well as age, sex, education, WMH volume, and cortical 18F-AV45 SUVR covary with WM 18F-AV45 SUVR. Results: 18F-AV45 SUVR was significantly lower in regions of WMH compared to NAWM (t=25.08, P<0.0001, n=115 subjects). Within WMH, lower 18F-AV45 SUVR was associated with higher FW ({beta}=-0.36{+/-}0.13, P=0.005) and lower FA ({beta}=+0.24{+/-}0.12, P=0.046), but not with the tissue-specific metric FW-adjusted FA. Partial-least-square analysis further confirmed that FW had the most influence on 18F-AV45 SUVR in regions of WMH. In contrast, FW-adjusted FA had more influence on 18F-AV45 SUVR in NAWM. Last, correlation with cognitive impairment was higher for FW than FW-adjusted FA, both in regions of WMH (MMSE: {beta}FW=-0.40{+/-}0.13, P=0.003; {beta}FW-adjustedFA=0.14{+/-}0.09, P=0.11) and NAWM (MMSE: {beta}FW=-0.30{+/-}0.11, P=0.01; {beta}FW-adjustedFA=0.21{+/-}0.09, P=0.02. Conclusion: In a cohort representative of the more common AD population, reduced amyloid-PET uptake in WM lesions may largely reflect the appearance of extracellular FW, while changes in NAWM may associate with tissue-specific damage. Ultimately, our findings may support FW and amyloid-PET as markers of WM abnormalities in SVD and AD.

	<p>Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is the most common autoimmune encephalitis. To date, there has been no study on the relationship between antibody (Ab) titers and clinical phenotype. This study aims to clarify the relationship between cerebrospinal fluid Ab titers and clinical manifestations of anti-NMDAR encephalitis at onset. Seventy-six consecutive patients with a definite diagnosis were enrolled. The relationship between Ab titers and different onset symptoms including psychiatric symptoms, seizures, and memory deficits were analyzed. We further investigated the correlation between Ab titers and clinical severity as assessed by the modified Rankin scale (mRS) and the clinical assessment scale for autoimmune encephalitis (CASE), respectively. The Ab titers had a median value of 1:10 (range 1:1&amp;amp;ndash;1:100). There was no significant difference in titers among various clinical factors including gender and combination of tumor and other diseases (each p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Patients presenting with psychiatric symptoms at onset had higher titers than those with seizures (p = 0.008) and memory deficits (p = 0.003). The mRS scores revealed a significant but weak correlation with Ab titers (r = 0.243, p = 0.034), while CASE scores did not correlate with the titers (p = 0.125). Our findings indicated that the Ab titers were associated with the type of onset symptoms, with a higher level of patients with psychiatric symptoms. Regarding the clinical severity, the titers showed a weak correlation with the mRS, but no correlation with the CASE.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: A previous study has shown that cognitive training with neurofeedback (CT-NF) using down-regulation improves cognitive functions in young adults. Neurofeedback has two strategies for manipulating brain activity (down-regulation and upregulation). However, the benefit of CT-NF with the upregulation of cognitive functions is still unknown. In this study, we investigated whether the upregulation of CT-NF improves a wide range of cognitive functions compared to cognitive training alone. (2) Methods: In this double-blinded randomized control trial (RCT), 60 young adults were randomly assigned to one of three groups: CT-NF group, CT alone group, and an active control (ACT) group who played a puzzle game. Participants in the three groups used the same device (tablet PC and 2ch NIRS (near-infrared spectroscopy)) and performed the training game for 20 min every day for four weeks. We measured brain activity during training in all groups, but only CT-NFs received NF. We also measured a wide range of cognitive functions before and after the intervention period. (3) Results: The CT-NF groups showed superior beneficial effects on episodic memory, working memory, and attention compared to the CT alone and ACT groups. In addition, the CT-NF group showed an increase in brain activity during CT, which was associated with improvements in cognitive function. (4) Discussion: This study first demonstrated that the CT-NF using the upregulation strategy has beneficial effects on cognitive functions compared to the CT alone. Our results suggest that greater brain activities during CT would enhance a benefit from CT.</p>

	<p>We investigated whether treatment with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is known to protect spiral ganglion cells (SGCs), could also protect hair cells (HCs) and supporting cells (SCs) in the organ of Corti of a guinea pig model of sensorineural hearing loss. Hearing loss was induced by administration of kanamycin/furosemide and two BDNF treatments were performed: (1) by gelatin sponge (BDNF-GS) with acute cochlear implantation (CI), and (2) through a mini-osmotic pump (BDNF-OP) with chronic CI. Outer HCs (OHCs), inner HCs (IHCs), Border, Phalangeal, Pillar, Deiters&amp;amp;rsquo;, and Hensen&amp;amp;rsquo;s cells were counted. The BDNF-GS cochleas had significantly fewer OHCs compared to the untreated ones, while the IHC and SC numbers did not differ between treated and untreated cochleas. The BDNF-OP group showed similar cell numbers to the untreated group. SGC packing density was not correlated with the total number of SCs for either BDNF group. Our data suggest that: (1) BDNF does not prevent cell death in the organ of Corti, and that the protection of SGCs could result from a direct targeting by BDNF; (2) BDNF might induce a different function/activity of the remaining cells in the organ of Corti (independently from cell number).</p>

	<p>Background: Hydrocephalus among Severe Acquired Brain Injury (SABI) patients remains overlooked during rehabilitation. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was carried out of traumatic and non-traumatic SABI patients with hydrocephalus, consecutively admitted over 9 years in a tertiary referral specialized rehabilitation hospital. Patients were treated with ventriculoperitoneal shunt before or during inpatient rehabilitation and assessed using the Level of Cognitive Functioning Scale and Disability Rating Scale. Logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of post-surgical complications. Linear regression models were used to investigate predictors of hospital length of stay (LOS), disability, and cognitive function. Results: Of the 82 patients, 15 had post-surgical complications and 16 underwent cranioplasty. Shunt placement complication risk was higher when fixed vs. when programmable pressure valves were used. A total of 56.3% achieved functional improvement at discharge and 88.7% improved in cognitive function; of the 82 patients, 56% were discharged home. In multiple regression analyses, higher disability at discharge was related to cranioplasty and longer LOS, while poorer cognitive function was associated with cranioplasty. Increase in LOS was associated with increasing time to shunt and decreasing age. Conclusions: A significant improvement in cognitive and functional outcomes can be achieved. Cranioplasty increased LOS, and fixed pressure valves were related to poorer outcomes.</p>

	<p>Verbal fluency (VF) is an informative cognitive task. Lesion and functional imaging studies implicate distinct cerebral areas that support letter versus semantic fluency and the understanding of neural and cognitive mechanisms underlying task performance. Most lesion studies include chronic stroke patients. People with primary progressive aphasia (PPA) provide complementary evidence for lesion-deficit associations, as different brain areas are affected in stroke versus PPA. In the present study we sought to determine imaging, clinical and demographic correlates of VF in PPA. Thirty-five patients with PPA underwent an assessment with letter and category VF tasks, evaluation of clinical features and an MRI scan for volumetric analysis. We used stepwise regression models to determine which brain areas are associated with VF performance while acknowledging the independent contribution of clinical and demographic factors. Letter fluency was predominantly associated with language severity (R2 = 38%), and correlated with the volume of the left superior temporal regions (R2 = 12%) and the right dorsolateral prefrontal area (R2 = 5%). Semantic fluency was predominantly associated with dementia severity (R2 = 47%) and correlated with the volume of the left inferior temporal gyrus (R2 = 7%). No other variables were significantly associated with performance in the two VF tasks. We concluded that, independently of disease severity, letter fluency is significantly associated with the volume of frontal and temporal areas whereas semantic fluency is associated mainly with the volume of temporal areas. Furthermore, our findings indicated that clinical severity plays a critical role in explaining VF performance in PPA, compared to the other clinical and demographic factors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Performance Analysis of Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithm on systems of linear equations [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Problem solving and modelling in traditional substitution methods at large scale for systems using sets of simultaneous equations is time consuming. For such large scale global-optimization problem, Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm and Genetic Algorithm (GA) as meta-heuristics for random search technique perform faster. Therefore, this study applies the SA to solve the problem of linear equations and evaluates its performances against Genetic Algorithms (GAs), a population-based search meta-heuristic, which are widely used in Travelling Salesman problems (TSP), Noise reduction and many more. This paper presents comparison between performances of the SA and GA for solving real time scientific problems. The significance of this paper is to solve the certain real time systems with a set of simultaneous linear equations containing different unknown variable samples those were simulated in Matlab using two algorithms-SA and GA. In all of the experiments, the generated random initial solution sets and the random population of solution sets were used in the SA and GA respectively. The comparison and performances of the SA and GA were evaluated for the optimization to take place for providing sets of solutions on certain systems. The SA algorithm is superior to GA on the basis of experimentation done on the sets of simultaneous equations, with a lower fitness function evaluation count in MATLAB simulation. Since, complex non-linear systems of equations have not been the primary focus of this research, in future, performances of SA and GA using such equations will be addressed. Even though GA maintained a relatively lower number of average generations than SA, SA still managed to outperform GA with a reasonably lower fitness function evaluation count. Although SA sometimes converges slowly, still it is efficient for solving problems of simultaneous equations in this case. In terms of computational complexity, SA was far more superior to GAs.

                Background: Gamification is an innovative approach to engaging in activities that people believe as less interesting. Recycling has been an issue not taken aware by the people in environmental sustainability. There are substantial studies on recycling intention due to the continual growth of unethical and unsustainable waste disposal. Creative approaches to recycling awareness activities should be made to fulfil youths’ increasing interest in and demand for recycling. The main objective of this study is to explore the factors related to youths’ recycling intentions after experiencing a gamified online recycling learning activity, Edcraft Gamified Learning (EGL). Gamified recycling education is believed to be a practical and engaging approach for youths. Methods: 100 students participated in EGL, consisting of two levels of plastic crafting and recycling activities. They experienced online EGL at home between May and September in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic total lockdown in Malaysia, namely, Movement Control Order (MCO). 29 participants were selected to participate in five focus group discussions (FGDs) with five to eight participants per session to explore their opinions towards gamified learning, motivation and recycling intention. Results: This paper reports the findings of the FGDs. A codebook was developed based on the codes from the FGD feedback. The codes were rated by two raters, followed by an assessment of inter-rater reliability and thematic analysis. The findings emerged and were confirmed with four themes as factors that influence recycling intention. They are gameful experience, social influence, intrinsic motivation, and extrinsic motivation. Conclusion: The dependent variable, recycling intention, was connected to the four themes to verify the conceptual framework. One limitation of the study was the design of the EGL activity, which was only carried out over two days with two levels of gamified recycling education, as students had concurrent academic online classes during that period.

Methods: The experimental trial was conducted with two intervention groups, with each group receiving a dose of 7.5g/70kg body weight (BW)/day (low dose) and 15g/70kg BW/day (high dose) for 60 days. Respondents were randomized into intervention groups using simple randomization. Before and after the intervention, pre-test and post-test examinations were performed, factors examined included hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), lipid profile, blood pressure, eating intake with the SQ-FFQ (Semi Quantitative-Food Frequency Questionnaire) interview, body mass index (BMI), and physical activity using InternationalPhysical Activity Questionnaires-Short Form (IPAQ-SF). During the intervention, blood pressure and BMI data were taken before and after the study. Statistical analysis included descriptive tests, independent and paired T-tests, and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: Compared to the baseline, HbA1c, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides in the two groups did not improve significantly by 60 days. For lipid variables, a significant improvement in the cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (chol/HDL) ratios were observed when compared against the baseline for the two groups. When comparing the changes between groups, 7.5 g of CHAGURO showed a larger improvement in HDL-C (mean differences: 1.86 mg/dL; 95% CI: -0.86-4.59), compared to 15 g of CHAGURO (mean differences: -3.62 mg/dL; 95% CI: -7.53-0.28). A significant (p<0.05) decrease in the chol/HDL ratio was observed in the 7.5 g CHAGURO group (mean differences: -0.20 mg/dL; 95% CI: -0.39-(-0.01)). Conclusions: CHAGURO can be a functional food alternative to improve the condition of prediabetes people with dyslipidemia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Healing through faith: meeting a chaplain coupled with biblical readings could produce lymphocyte changes that correlate with brain activity (HEALING study) [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Faith and systems of beliefs are known to impact not only the emotional, but also the immunological state of believers in ways that we are just starting to understand. Moreover, clinical implications of previous studies are limited.  The aim of the “HEALING” (Hospital-based Ecumenical and Linguistic Immuno-NeuroloGic) Study was to examine immunological and neurological changes in hospitalized patients after meeting a chaplain coupled with biblical readings. Methods: Hospitalized patients were pre-screened to find those who were the most in need of an intervention. A passage from the Bible was read to them during a meeting with the chaplain at the bedside (n= 20) or in the chapel (n= 18). No meeting occurred in the randomized control group (n=19). Blood samples were taken 30 minutes prior, and 60 minutes after the meeting to measure white blood cells (WBC), interferon gamma (IFN-γ), immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgA, IgG, and complement 3 (C3). A subgroup of the visited patients was subjected to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), where they were played an audiotape of readings of the same passage from the Bible (n=21). Results: Lymphocyte counts increased more often after the more successful visits, but the immunological changes were not significant. Conversely, a significant (pfwe=0.003) correlation was revealed between changes in lymphocytes and activation of the angular gyrus (left BA39) during fMRI, a brain area involved in word recognition. Conclusions: Although limited by the sample size and cohort study design, the findings suggest the depth of psycho-immunological changes could depend on the degree to which the chaplains’ main message is understood.

                IIntroduction : Bronchiolitis is the leading cause of hospitalization in children. Estimate potentially preventable variables that impact the length of hospital stay are a priority to reduce the costs associated with this disease. This study aims to identify clinical variables associated with length of hospital stay of bronchiolitis in children in a tropical middle-income country Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in 417 infants with bronchiolitis in tertiary centers in Colombia. All medical records of all patients admitted throughto the emergency department were reviewed. To identify factors independently associated we use negative binomial regression model, to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) and adjust for potential confounding variables Results : The median of the length of hospital stay was 3.68 days, with a range of 0.774 days to 29 days, 138 (33.117%) of patients have a hospital stay of 5 or more days. After modeling and controlling for potential confounders age <6 months, comorbidities (CHD or neurological), BPD,  chest indrawing, Detection of RSV isolation, and C-reactive protein were independent predictors of LOS Conclusions : Our results show that in infants with bronchiolitis, Detection of RSV isolation, age <6 months, comorbidities (CHD or neurological), BPD,  chest indrawing, and C-reactive protein were independent predictors of LOS. As a potentially modifiable risk factor, efforts to reduce the probability of RSV infection can reduce the high medical cost associates with prolonged LOS in bronchiolitis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Systematic evaluation of NIPT aneuploidy detection software tools with clinically validated NIPT samples</a></h4>

Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) is a powerful screening method for fetal aneuploidy detection, relying on laboratory and computational analysis of cell-free DNA. Although several published computational NIPT analysis tools are available, no prior comprehensive, head-to-head accuracy comparison of the various tools has been published. Here, we compared the outcome accuracies obtained for clinically validated samples with five commonly used computational NIPT aneuploidy analysis tools (WisecondorX, NIPTeR, NIPTmer, RAPIDR, and GIPseq) across various sequencing depths (coverage) and fetal DNA fractions. The sample set included cases of fetal trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome), and trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome). We determined that all of the compared tools were considerably affected by lower sequencing depths, such that increasing proportions of undetected trisomy cases (false negatives) were observed as the sequencing depth decreased. We summarised our benchmarking results and highlighted the advantages and disadvantages of each computational NIPT software. To conclude, trisomy detection for lower coverage NIPT samples (e.g. 2.5M reads per sample) is technically possible but can, with some NIPT tools, produce troubling rates of inaccurate trisomy detection, especially in low-FF samples.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Internal state effects on behavioral shifts in freely behaving praying mantises (Tenodera sinensis)</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shanel C. Pickard, David J. Bertsch, Zoe Le Garrec, Roy E. Ritzmann, Roger D. Quinn, Nicholas S. Szczecinski</p>

How we interact with our environment largely depends on both the external cues presented by our surroundings and the internal state from within. Internal states are the ever-changing physiological conditions that communicate the immediate survival needs and motivate the animal to behaviorally fulfill them. Satiety level constitutes such a state, and therefore has a dynamic influence on the output behaviors of an animal. In predatory insects like the praying mantis, hunting tactics, grooming, and mating have been shown to change hierarchical organization of behaviors depending on satiety. Here, we analyze behavior sequences of freely hunting praying mantises (<i>Tenodera sinensis</i>) to explore potential differences in sequential patterning of behavior as a correlate of satiety. First, our data supports previous work that showed starved praying mantises were not just more often attentive to prey, but also more often attentive to <i>further</i> prey. This was indicated by the increased time fraction spent in attentive bouts such as prey monitoring, head turns (to track prey), translations (closing the distance to the prey), and more strike attempts. With increasing satiety, praying mantises showed reduced time in these behaviors and exhibited them primarily towards close-proximity prey. Furthermore, our data demonstrates that during states of starvation, the praying mantis exhibits a stereotyped pattern of behavior that is highly motivated by prey capture. As satiety increased, the sequenced behaviors became more variable, indicating a shift away from the necessity of prey capture to more fluid presentations of behavior assembly.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Revealing mechanisms of infectious disease spread through empirical contact networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Pratha Sah, Michael Otterstatter, Stephan T. Leu, Sivan Leviyang, Shweta Bansal</p>

The spread of pathogens fundamentally depends on the underlying contacts between individuals. Modeling the dynamics of infectious disease spread through contact networks, however, can be challenging due to limited knowledge of how an infectious disease spreads and its transmission rate. We developed a novel statistical tool, INoDS (Identifying contact Networks of infectious Disease Spread) that estimates the transmission rate of an infectious disease outbreak, establishes epidemiological relevance of a contact network in explaining the observed pattern of infectious disease spread and enables model comparison between different contact network hypotheses. We show that our tool is robust to incomplete data and can be easily applied to datasets where infection timings of individuals are unknown. We tested the reliability of INoDS using simulation experiments of disease spread on a synthetic contact network and find that it is robust to incomplete data and is reliable under different settings of network dynamics and disease contagiousness compared with previous approaches. We demonstrate the applicability of our method in two host-pathogen systems: <i>Crithidia bombi</i> in bumblebee colonies and Salmonella in wild Australian sleepy lizard populations. INoDS thus provides a novel and reliable statistical tool for identifying transmission pathways of infectious disease spread. In addition, application of INoDS extends to understanding the spread of novel or emerging infectious disease, an alternative approach to laboratory transmission experiments, and overcoming common data-collection constraints.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">CNNM proteins selectively bind to the TRPM7 channel to stimulate divalent cation entry into cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Zhiyong Bai, Jianlin Feng, Gijs A. C. Franken, Namariq Al’Saadi, Na Cai, Albert S. Yu, Liping Lou, Yuko Komiya, Joost G. J. Hoenderop, Jeroen H. F. de Baaij, Lixia Yue, Loren W. Runnels</p>

Magnesium is essential for cellular life, but how it is homeostatically controlled still remains poorly understood. Here, we report that members of CNNM family, which have been controversially implicated in both cellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> influx and efflux, selectively bind to the TRPM7 channel to stimulate divalent cation entry into cells. Coexpression of CNNMs with the channel markedly increased uptake of divalent cations, which is prevented by an inactivating mutation to the channel’s pore. Knockout (KO) of <i>Trpm7</i> in cells or application of the TRPM7 channel inhibitor NS8593 also interfered with CNNM-stimulated divalent cation uptake. Conversely, KO of <i>CNNM3</i> and <i>CNNM4</i> in HEK-293 cells significantly reduced TRPM7-mediated divalent cation entry, without affecting TRPM7 protein expression or its cell surface levels. Furthermore, we found that cellular overexpression of phosphatases of regenerating liver (PRLs), known CNNMs binding partners, stimulated TRPM7-dependent divalent cation entry and that CNNMs were required for this activity. Whole-cell electrophysiological recordings demonstrated that deletion of <i>CNNM3</i> and <i>CNNM4</i> from HEK-293 cells interfered with heterologously expressed and native TRPM7 channel function. We conclude that CNNMs employ the TRPM7 channel to mediate divalent cation influx and that CNNMs also possess separate TRPM7-independent Mg<sup>2+</sup> efflux activities that contribute to CNNMs’ control of cellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis.

This work addresses the need for new chemical matter in product development for control of pest insects and vector-borne diseases. We present a barcoding strategy that enables phenotypic screens of blood-feeding insects against small molecules in microtiter plate-based arrays and apply this to discovery of novel systemic insecticides and compounds that block malaria parasite development in the mosquito vector. Encoding of the blood meals was achieved through recombinant DNA-tagged <i>Asaia</i> bacteria that successfully colonised <i>Aedes</i> and <i>Anopheles</i> mosquitoes. An arrayed screen of a collection of pesticides showed that chemical classes of avermectins, phenylpyrazoles, and neonicotinoids were enriched for compounds with systemic adulticide activity against <i>Anopheles</i>. Using a luminescent <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> reporter strain, barcoded screens identified 48 drug-like transmission-blocking compounds from a 400-compound antimicrobial library. The approach significantly increases the throughput in phenotypic screening campaigns using adult insects and identifies novel candidate small molecules for disease control.

The hippocampal formation (HF) is well documented as having a feedforward, unidirectional circuit organization termed the trisynaptic pathway. This circuit organization exists along the septotemporal axis of the HF, but the circuit connectivity across septal to temporal regions is less well described. The emergence of viral genetic mapping techniques enhances our ability to determine the detailed complexity of HF circuitry. In earlier work, we mapped a subiculum (SUB) back projection to CA1 prompted by the discovery of theta wave back propagation from the SUB to CA1 and CA3. We reason that this circuitry may represent multiple extended noncanonical pathways involving the subicular complex and hippocampal subregions CA1 and CA3. In the present study, multiple retrograde viral tracing approaches produced robust mapping results, which supports this prediction. We find significant noncanonical synaptic inputs to dorsal hippocampal CA3 from ventral CA1 (vCA1), perirhinal cortex (Prh), and the subicular complex. Thus, CA1 inputs to CA3 run opposite the trisynaptic pathway and in a temporal to septal direction. Our retrograde viral tracing results are confirmed by anterograde-directed viral mapping of projections from input mapped regions to hippocampal dorsal CA3 (dCA3). We find that genetic inactivation of the projection of vCA1 to dCA3 impairs object-related spatial learning and memory but does not modulate anxiety-related behaviors. Our data provide a circuit foundation to explore novel functional roles contributed by these noncanonical hippocampal circuit connections to hippocampal circuit dynamics and learning and memory behaviors.

                Many important scientific discoveries require lengthy experimental processes of trial and error and could benefit from intelligent prioritization based on deep domain understanding. While exponential growth in the scientific literature makes it difficult to keep current in even a single domain, that same rapid growth in literature also presents an opportunity for automated extraction of knowledge via text mining. We have developed a web application implementation of the KinderMiner algorithm for proposing ranked associations between a list of target terms and a key phrase. Any key phrase and target term list can be used for biomedical inquiry. We built the web application around a text index derived from PubMed. It is the first publicly available implementation of the algorithm, is fast and easy to use, and includes an interactive analysis tool. The KinderMiner web application is a public resource offering scientists a cohesive summary of what is currently known about a particular topic within the literature, and helping them to prioritize experiments around that topic. It performs comparably or better to similar state-of-the-art text mining tools, is more flexible, and can be applied to any biomedical topic of interest. It is also continually improving with quarterly updates to the underlying text index and through response to suggestions from the community. The web application is available at https://www.kinderminer.org.

                Using fMRI and c-Fos-iDISCO+, Choe et al. show that mice missing Cntnap2, an ASD-linked gene, exhibit altered functional brain connectivity. This is normalized by exogenous oxytocin, which also rescues social deficits. Critical to this process is endogenous oxytocin signaling within the NAc, implicating its potential role in ASD-associated social impairments.

                Strategies are commonly used to improve working memory performance, but whether they change the information held in mind is less clear. Using a self-ordered selection task, Chiang et al. show that adopting sequencing strategies shifts information from single, highly tuned neurons to more distributed population codes in lateral prefrontal cortex.

                Tada et al. show that infection with SARS-CoV-2 followed by vaccination results in broadly neutralizing antibody. The C.1.2 variant has a highly mutated spike and is the most neutralization-resistant variant; however, its affinity for ACE2 is decreased. Thus, the virus cannot evolve to escape humoral response without becoming less fit.

They also present the structures of the Kappa and Beta S-ACE2 complexes, where a population shift towards the three receptor-binding domain up conformation was observed. In combination with biochemical data these structures show how the S protein variants efficiently recognize and bind to ACE2.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Naïve individuals promote collective exploration in homing pigeons</a></h4>

              
                Group-living animals that rely on stable foraging or migratory routes can develop behavioural traditions to pass route information down to inexperienced individuals. Striking a balance between exploitation of social information and exploration for better alternatives is essential to prevent the spread of maladaptive traditions. We investigated this balance during cumulative route development in the homing pigeon <i>Columba livia</i>. We quantified information transfer within pairs of birds in a transmission-chain experiment and determined how birds with different levels of experience contributed to the exploration–exploitation trade-off. Newly introduced naïve individuals were initially more likely to initiate exploration than experienced birds, but the pair soon settled into a pattern of alternating leadership with both birds contributing equally. Experimental pairs showed an oscillating pattern of exploration over generations that might facilitate the discovery of more efficient routes. Our results introduce a new perspective on the roles of leadership and information pooling in the context of collective learning.

                Employing concepts from physics, chemistry and bioengineering, 'learning-by-building' approaches are becoming increasingly popular in the life sciences, especially with researchers who are attempting to engineer cellular life from scratch. The SynCell2020/21 conference brought together researchers from different disciplines to highlight progress in this field, including areas where synthetic cells are having socioeconomic and technological impact. Conference participants also identified the challenges involved in designing, manipulating and creating synthetic cells with hierarchical organization and function. A key conclusion is the need to build an international and interdisciplinary research community through enhanced communication, resource-sharing, and educational initiatives.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Light sets the brain’s daily clock by regional quickening and slowing of the molecular clockworks at dawn and dusk</a></h4>

              
                How daily clocks in the brain are set by light to local environmental time and encode the seasons is not fully understood. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is a central circadian clock in mammals that orchestrates physiology and behavior in tune with daily and seasonal light cycles. Here, we have found that optogenetically simulated light input to explanted mouse SCN changes the waveform of the molecular clockworks from sinusoids in free-running conditions to highly asymmetrical shapes with accelerated synthetic (rising) phases and extended degradative (falling) phases marking clock advances and delays at simulated dawn and dusk. Daily waveform changes arise under ex vivo entrainment to simulated winter and summer photoperiods, and to non-24 hr periods. Ex vivo SCN imaging further suggests that acute waveform shifts are greatest in the ventrolateral SCN, while period effects are greatest in the dorsomedial SCN. Thus, circadian entrainment is encoded by SCN clock gene waveform changes that arise from spatiotemporally distinct intrinsic responses within the SCN neural network.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The energetic basis for smooth human arm movements</a></h4>

              
                The central nervous system plans human reaching movements with stereotypically smooth kinematic trajectories and fairly consistent durations. Smoothness seems to be explained by accuracy as a primary movement objective, whereas duration seems to economize energy expenditure. But the current understanding of energy expenditure does not explain smoothness, so that two aspects of the same movement are governed by seemingly incompatible objectives. Here we show that smoothness is actually economical, because humans expend more metabolic energy for jerkier motions. The proposed mechanism is an underappreciated cost proportional to the rate of muscle force production, for calcium transport to activate muscle. We experimentally tested that energy cost in humans (N=10) performing bimanual reaches cyclically. The empirical cost was then demonstrated to predict smooth, discrete reaches, previously attributed to accuracy alone. A mechanistic, physiologically measurable, energy cost may therefore explain both smoothness and duration in terms of economy, and help resolve motor redundancy in reaching movements.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Phylogenomic and mitogenomic data can accelerate inventorying of tropical beetles during the current biodiversity crisis</a></h4>

              
                Conservation efforts must be evidence-based, so rapid and economically feasible methods should be used to quantify diversity and distribution patterns. We have attempted to overcome current impediments to the gathering of biodiversity data by using integrative phylogenomic and three mtDNA fragment analyses. As a model, we sequenced the Metriorrhynchini beetle fauna, sampled from ~700 localities in three continents. The species-rich dataset included ~6,500 terminals, ~1,850 putative species delimited at 5% uncorrected pairwise threshold, possibly ~1,000 of them unknown to science. Neither type of data could alone answer our questions on biodiversity and phylogeny. The phylogenomic backbone enabled the integrative delimitation of robustly defined natural genus-group units that will inform future research. Using constrained mtDNA analysis, we identified the spatial structure of species diversity, very high species-level endemism, and a biodiversity hotspot in New Guinea. We suggest that focused field research and subsequent laboratory and bioinformatic workflow steps would substantially accelerate the inventorying of any hyperdiverse tropical group with several thousand species. The outcome would be a scaffold for the incorporation of further data from environmental sequencing and ecological studies. The database of sequences could set a benchmark for the spatiotemporal evaluation of biodiversity, would support evidence-based conservation planning, and would provide a robust framework for systematic, biogeographic, and evolutionary studies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The decrotonylase FoSir5 facilitates mitochondrial metabolic state switching in conidial germination of Fusarium oxysporum</a></h4>

              
                <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> is one of the most important pathogenic fungi with a broad range of plant and animal hosts. The first key step of its infection cycle is conidial germination, but there is limited information available on the molecular events supporting this process. We show here that germination is accompanied by a sharp decrease in expression of FoSir5, an ortholog of the human lysine deacetylase SIRT5. We observe that FoSir5 decrotonylates a subunit of the fungal pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (FoDLAT) at K148, resulting in inhibition of the activity of the complex in mitochondria. Moreover, FoSir5 decrotonylates histone H3K18, leading to a downregulation of transcripts encoding enzymes of aerobic respiration pathways. Thus, the activity of FoSir5 coordinates regulation in different organelles to steer metabolic flux through respiration. As ATP content is positively related to fungal germination, we propose that FoSir5 negatively modulates conidial germination in <i>F. </i><i>oxysporum</i> through its metabolic impact. These findings provide insights into the multifaceted roles of decrotonylation, catalysed by FoSir5, that support conidial germination in <i>F. oxysporum</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structure-guided glyco-engineering of ACE2 for improved potency as soluble SARS-CoV-2 decoy receptor</a></h4>

              
                Infection and viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 crucially depends on the binding of its Spike protein to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) presented on host cells. Glycosylation of both proteins is critical for this interaction. Recombinant soluble human ACE2 can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and is currently undergoing clinical tests for the treatment of COVID-19. We used 3D structural models and molecular dynamics simulations to define the ACE2 N-glycans that critically influence Spike-ACE2 complex formation. Engineering of ACE2 N-glycosylation by site-directed mutagenesis or glycosidase treatment resulted in enhanced binding affinities and improved virus neutralization without notable deleterious effects on the structural stability and catalytic activity of the protein. Importantly, simultaneous removal of all accessible N-glycans from recombinant soluble human ACE2 yields a superior SARS-CoV-2 decoy receptor with promise as effective treatment for COVID-19 patients.

                Prospect theory, arguably the most prominent theory of choice, is an obvious candidate for neural valuation models. How the activity of individual neurons, a possible computational unit, reflects prospect theory remains unknown. Here, we show with theoretical accuracy equivalent to that of human neuroimaging studies that single-neuron activity in four core reward-related cortical and subcortical regions represents the subjective valuation of risky gambles in monkeys. The activity of individual neurons in monkeys passively viewing a lottery reflects the desirability of probabilistic rewards, parameterized as a multiplicative combination of a utility and probability weighting functions in the prospect theory framework. The diverse patterns of valuation signals were not localized but distributed throughout most parts of the reward circuitry. A network model aggregating these signals reliably reconstructed risk preferences and subjective probability perceptions revealed by the animals' choices. Thus, distributed neural coding explains the computation of subjective valuations under risk.

                Cerebellar output has been shown to enhance movement precision by scaling the decelerative phase of reaching movements in mice. We hypothesized that during reach, initial kinematics cue late-phase adjustments through cerebellar associative learning. We identify a population-level response in mouse PCs that scales inversely with reach velocity, suggesting a candidate mechanism for anticipatory control to target limb endpoint. We next interrogate how such a response is generated by combining high-density neural recordings with closed-loop optogenetic stimulation of cerebellar mossy fiber afferents originating in the pontine nuclei during reach, using perturbation schedules reminiscent of classic adaptation paradigms. We found that reach kinematics and PC electrophysiology adapt to position-locked mossy fiber perturbations and exhibit aftereffects when stimulation is removed. Surprisingly, we observed partial adaptation to position-randomized stimulation schedules but no opposing aftereffect. A model that recapitulated these findings provided novel insight into how the cerebellum deciphers cause-and-effect relationships to adapt.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Bayesian perspective on the ring attractor for heading-direction tracking in the Drosophila central complex</a></h4>

              
                Efficient navigation requires animals to track their position, velocity and heading direction (HD). Bayesian inference provides a principled framework for estimating these quantities from unreliable sensory observations, yet little is known about how and where Bayesian algorithms could be implemented in the brain's neural networks. Here, we propose a class of recurrent neural networks that track both a dynamic HD estimate and its associated uncertainty. They do so according to a circular Kalman filter, a statistically optimal algorithm for circular estimation. Our network generalizes standard ring attractor models by encoding uncertainty in the amplitude of a bump of neural activity. More generally, we show that near-Bayesian integration is inherent in ring attractor networks, as long as their connectivity strength allows them to sufficiently deviate from the attractor state. Furthermore, we identified the basic network motifs that are required to implement Bayesian inference, and show that these motifs are present in the Drosophila HD system connectome. Overall, our work demonstrates that the Drosophila HD system can in principle implement a dynamic Bayesian inference algorithm in a biologically plausible manner, consistent with recent findings that suggest ring-attractor dynamics underlie the Drosophila HD system.

                Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) movement within the brain interstitium is essential for the development and functioning of the brain. However, the interstitium has largely been thought of as a single entity through which CSF circulates, and it is not known whether specific cell populations within the CNS preferentially interact with CSF. Here, we developed a novel technique for CSF tracking, gold nanoparticle enhanced X-ray microtomography, to achieve micrometer-scale resolution visualization of CSF pathways during development. Using this method and subsequent histological analysis, we map global CSF pathways and present novel particle size-dependent circulation patterns through the CNS. We identify an intraparenchymal CSF circulation that targets stem cell-rich and cholinergic neuronal populations. CSF solute distribution to these areas is mediated by CSF flow along projections from the basal cisterns which is altered in posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus. Our study uncovers region-specific patterns in a biologically driven CSF circulation that has implications for normal brain development and the pathophysiology of hydrocephalus and neurodegenerative disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Metabolically-Incorporated Deuterium in Myelin Localized by Neutron Diffraction and Identified by Mass Spectrometry</a></h4>

              
                Myelin is a natural and dynamic multilamellar membrane structure that continues to be of significant biological and neurological interest, especially its biosynthesis and assembly in the context of its normal formation and renewal, and pathological breakdown. To explore further the usefulness of neutron diffraction in the structural analysis of myelin, we investigated the use of in vivo labeling by metabolically incorporating via drinking water nontoxic levels of deuterium (2H; D) into pregnant dams and their developing embryos. All of the mice were sacrificed when the pups were about 60 days old. Myelinated nerves were dissected, fixed in glutaraldehyde and examined by neutron diffraction. Parallel samples that were unfixed were frozen for mass spectrometry (MS). Analysis of the neutron diffraction patterns of the sciatic nerves from deuterium-fed mice (D mice) versus the controls (H mice) showed no appreciable differences in myelin periodicity, but major differences in the intensities of the Bragg peaks. The neutron scattering density profiles showed an appreciable increase in density at the center of the membrane bilayer in the D mice, particularly in the pups. MS analysis of the lipids isolated from the trigeminal nerves demonstrated that the level of D was greater in the pups compared to their mother: 97.6% +/- 2.0% (n=54; range 89.6% to 99.6%) versus 60.6% +/- 26.4% (n=27; range 11.4% to 97.3%). Deuteration in the mother also varied by lipid species, and among lipid subspecies. Three molecular species of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and diglycerol (DG) were the most deuterated lipids, and sulfatide (SHexCer), one species of sphingomyelin (SM), and triacylglycerol (TG) were the least deuterated. The distribution pattern of deuterium in the D pups was always bell-shaped, and the average number of D atoms ranged from a low of ~4 in fatty acid (FA), to a high of ~9 in cerebroside (HexCer). By contrast, in D dam only about one third of the lipids had symmetric bell-shaped distributions; most had more complex, overlapping distributions that were weighted toward a lower average number of D atom labels. The average number of D atoms ranged from a low of ~3 to 4 in FA and in one species of SHexCer, to a high of 6 to 7 in HexCer and SM. In D pups, the consistently high level of deuteration can be attributed to their de novo lipogenesis during gestation and continuation of rapid myelination postnatally. In D dam, the widely varying levels of deuteration of lipids likely depends on the relative metabolic stability of the particular lipid species during myelin maintenance in the mature animal. Our current findings demonstrate that stably-incorporated D label can be detected and localized using neutron diffraction in a complex tissue such as myelin; and moreover, that MS can be used to screen a broad range of deuterated lipid species to monitor differential rates of lipid turnover. In addition to helping to develop a comprehensive understanding of the de novo synthesis and turnover of specific lipids in normal and abnormal myelin, our results also suggest application to myelin proteins, as well as more broadly to the molecular constituents of other biological tissues.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sensory cortical dynamics during optical microstimulation training</a></h4>

              
                Primary sensory cortex is a key locus of plasticity during learning. Exposure to novel stimuli often alters cortical activity, but isolating cortex-specific dynamics is challenging due to extensive pre-cortical processing. Here, we employ optical microstimulation of pyramidal neurons in layer (L) 2/3 of mouse primary vibrissal somatosensory cortex (vS1) to study cortical dynamics as mice learn to discriminate microstimulation intensity. Tracking activity over weeks using two-photon calcium imaging, we observe a rapid sparsification of the photoresponsive population, with the most responsive neurons exhibiting the largest declines in responsiveness. Following sparsification, the photoresponsive population attains a stable rate of neuronal turnover. At the same time, the photoresponsive population increasingly overlaps with populations encoding whisker movement and touch. Finally, we find that mice with larger declines in responsiveness learn the task more slowly than mice with smaller declines. Our results reveal that microstimulation-evoked cortical activity undergoes extensive reorganization during task learning and that the dynamics of this reorganization impact perception.

                Volition - the sense of control or agency over one's voluntary actions - is widely recognized as the basis of both human subjective experience and natural behavior in non-human animals. To date, several human studies have found peaks in neural activity preceding voluntary actions, e.g. the readiness potential (RP), and some have shown upcoming actions could be decoded even before awareness. These findings remain controversial with some suggesting they pose a challenge to traditional accounts of human volition while others proposing that random processes underlie pre-movement neural activity. Here we seek to address part of this controversy by evaluating whether pre-movement neural activity in mice contains structure beyond that expected from random processes. Implementing a self-initiated water-rewarded lever pull paradigm in mice while recording widefield [Ca++] neural activity we find that cortical activity changes in variance seconds prior to movement and that upcoming lever pulls or spontaneous body movements could be predicted between 1 second to more than 10 seconds prior to movement, similar to but even earlier than in human studies. We show that mice, like humans, are biased towards initiation of voluntary actions during specific phases of neural activity oscillations but that the pre-movement neural code in mice changes over time and is widely distributed as behavior prediction improved when using all vs single cortical areas. These findings support the presence of structured multi-second neural dynamics preceding voluntary action beyond that expected from random processes. Our results also suggest that neural mechanisms underlying self-initiated voluntary action could be preserved between mice and humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Electrobehavioral phenotype and seizure pharmacosensitivity in a novel mouse model of patient-derived SLC6A1 S295L mutation-associated neurodevelopmental epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Solute carrier family 6 member 1 (SLC6A1) gene encodes GAT-1, a GABA transporter expressed on glia and presynaptic terminals of inhibitory neurons. Mutations in SLC6A1 are associated with myoclonic atonic epilepsy, absence epilepsy, autism, and intellectual disability. However, the mechanisms leading to these defects are unknown. Here, we used a novel mouse model harboring a point mutation (S295L) recently identified in the human SLC6A1 gene that results in impaired membrane trafficking of the GAT-1 protein. We performed chronic wireless telemetry recordings of heterozygous (GAT-1S295L/+) mice, and of mice lacking one or both copies of the Slc6a1 gene (GAT-1+/- and GAT-1-/-). We assessed their behaviors and pharmacosensitivity, and investigated the relationship between seizure burden and behavioral performance. GAT-1S295L/+ mice exhibited frequent spike-wave discharges (SWDs) associated with behavioral arrest, and there was a dose-effect relationship between GAT-1 gene copy number and the severity of electrocorticogram (ECoG) abnormalities. Seizure burden was inversely correlated with behavioral performance. Forelimb grip strength was reduced in female mice. Acute administration of GAT-1 antagonist NO-711 induced SWDs in wild-type mice, exacerbated the phenotype in GAT-1S295L/+ and GAT-1+/- mice, and had no effect on GAT-1-/- mice lacking the drug target. By contrast, ethosuximide normalized the ECoG in GAT-1S295L/+ and GAT-1+/- mice. In conclusion, GAT-1S295L/+ mice show haploinsufficiency with evidence of GAT-1 hypofunction. This mouse model reconstitutes major aspects of human disease and thus provides a useful preclinical model for drug screening and gene therapy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modeling spectral changes following stimulation: Is there an event-related shift in 1/f activity?</a></h4>

              
                Neural activity contains oscillatory components (i.e., narrowband oscillations) and non-oscillatory components (e.g., event-related potentials [ERPs] and 1/f-like background activity). Here, surface-level EEG data was analyzed to investigate how the spectral content of neural activity below 25 Hz changes from before to after an event. We focused on changes in non-oscillatory background activity, a spectral component often assumed to be static across time in time-frequency analyses. During a simple auditory perception task (n = 46) and an auditory oddball task (n = 23), we found an apparent increase in the offset and a decrease in the slope of 1/f activity from before to after a tone. Importantly, however, these changes in non-oscillatory background activity were almost completely accounted for by the emergence of ERPs in response to the stimulus in frequencies below the alpha range (8-12 Hz). Our findings suggest that post-event spectral changes below 25 Hz can be modelled as the sum of pre-event non-oscillatory activity, the spectrum of the ERP, and an independent alpha component that is modulated in amplitude, but not elicited, by the event. Theta activity (4-8 Hz), however, was not present before the event and appeared to be phase-locked to it. The theoretical and methodological implications of our findings regarding the nature and origin of 1/f activity, and the interpretation of low-frequency activity in the time-frequency domain are discussed.

	<p>Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the early assessment of neurological pupil index (NPi) values derived from automated pupillometry could predict neurological outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Methods: Retrospective observational study including adult (&amp;amp;gt;18 years) TBI patients admitted from January 2018 to December 2020, with available NPi on admission. Abnormal NPi was considered if &amp;amp;lt;3. Unfavorable neurological outcome (UO) at hospital discharge was considered for a Glasgow Outcome Scale of 1&amp;amp;ndash;3. Results: 100 patients were included over the study period (median age 48 (34&amp;amp;ndash;69) years and median GCS on admission 11 (6&amp;amp;ndash;15)); 49 (49%) patients had UO. On admission, 20 (20%) patients had an abnormal NPi (NPi &amp;amp;lt; 3); median worst (i.e., from both eyes) NPi was 4.2 (3.2&amp;amp;ndash;4.5). Median worst and mean NPi on admission were significantly lower in the UO group than others (3.9 (1.7&amp;amp;ndash;4.4) vs. 4.4 (3.7&amp;amp;ndash;4.6); p = 0.005&amp;amp;ndash;4.0 (2.6&amp;amp;ndash;4.5) vs. 4.5 (3.9&amp;amp;ndash;4.7); p = 0.002, respectively). The ROC curve for the worst and mean NPi showed a moderate accuracy to predict UO (AUC 0.66 (0.56&amp;amp;ndash;0.77); p = 0.005 and 0.68 (0.57&amp;amp;ndash;0.78); p = 0.002). However, in a generalized linear model, the prognostic role of NPi on admission was limited. Conclusions: Low NPi on admission has limited prognostic value in TBI.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex-dependent effects of traumatic stress on social behavior and neuronal activation in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala</a></h4>

              
                Social behavior is complex and fundamental, and deficits in social behavior are common pathological features for a variety of psychiatric disorders including anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Acute stress has a negative impact on social behavior, and these effects may vary based on sex. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of footshock stress on the sociability of male and female C57Bl/6J mice. Animals were divided into two main groups of footshock exposure or context exposure control. Each group had mice that were treated with either the benzodiazepine alprazolam, or vehicle. Neuronal activation during social interaction was assessed using immunohistochemistry against the immediate early gene product cFos. Footshock stress induced a significantly increased latency to approach a social interaction counterpart in both sexes. Stress-induced increases in defensive tail-rattling behavior elicited during the sociability test were sex-dependent and alleviated by alprazolam. Alprazolam also lowered social exploration and neuronal activation in the infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex. Social interaction induced sex-dependent differences in cFos activation in the lateral subdivision of the central nucleus of the amygdala and ventromedial intercalated cell clusters. Overall, our results suggest that acute footshock stress induces alterations in sociability and patterns of cFos activation in a sex-dependent manner.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain intrinsic connection patterns underlying tool processing in human adults are present in neonates and not in macaques</a></h4>

              
                Tool understanding and use are supported by a dedicated left-lateralized, intrinsically connected network in the human adult brain. To examine this network's phylogenic and ontogenetic origins, we compared resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) among regions subserving tool processing in human adults to rsFC among homologous regions in human neonates and macaque monkeys (adolescent and mature). These homologous regions formed an intrinsic network in human neonates, but not in macaques. Network topological patterns were highly similar between human adults and neonates, and significantly less so between humans and macaques. The premotor-parietal rsFC had most significant contribution to the formation of the neonate tool network. These results suggest that an intrinsic brain network potentially supporting tool processing exists in the human brain prior to individual tool use experiences, and that the premotor-parietal functional connection in particular offers a brain basis for complex tool behaviors specific to humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spontaneous Neuronal Oscillations in the Human Insula are Hierarchically Organized Traveling Waves</a></h4>

              
                The insula plays a fundamental role in a wide range of adaptive human behaviors, but its electrophysiological dynamics are poorly understood. Here we used human intracranial electroencephalographic recordings to investigate the electrophysiological properties and hierarchical organization of spontaneous neuronal oscillations within the insula. We analyzed the neuronal oscillations of the insula directly and found that rhythms in the theta and beta frequency oscillations are widespread and spontaneously present. These oscillations are largely organized along the anterior-posterior axis of the insula. Both the left and right insula showed anterior-to-posterior decreasing gradients for the power of oscillations in the beta frequency band. The left insula also showed a posterior-to-anterior decreasing frequency gradient and an anterior-to-posterior decreasing power gradient in the theta frequency band. In addition to measuring the power of these oscillations, we also examined the phase of these signals across simultaneous recording channels and found that the insula oscillations in the theta and beta bands are traveling waves. The strength of the traveling waves in each frequency was positively correlated with the amplitude of each oscillation. However, the theta and beta traveling waves were uncoupled to each other in terms of phase and amplitude, which suggested that insula traveling waves in the theta and beta bands operate independently. Our findings provide new insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics and hierarchical organization of neuronal oscillations within the insula, which, given its rich connectivity with widespread cortical regions, indicates that oscillations and traveling waves have an important role in intra- and inter-insula communication.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Slice-direction geometric distortion evaluation and correction with reversed slice-select gradient acquisitions</a></h4>

              
                Accurate spatial alignment of MRI data acquired across multiple contrasts in the same subject is often crucial for data analysis and interpretation, but can be challenging in the presence of geometric distortions that differ between acquisitions. It is well known that single-shot echo-planar imaging (EPI) acquisitions suffer from distortion in the phase-encoding direction due to B0 field inhomogeneities arising from tissue magnetic susceptibility differences and other sources, however there can be distortion in other encoding directions as well in the presence of strong field homogeneities. High-resolution ultrahigh-field MRI typically uses low bandwidth in the slice-encoding direction to acquire thin slices and, when combined with the pronounced B0 inhomogeneities, is prone to an additional geometric distortion in the slice direction as well. Here we demonstrate a presence of this slice distortion in high-resolution 7T EPI acquired with a novel pulse sequence allowing for the reversal of the slice-encoding gradient polarity that enables the acquisition of pairs of images with equal magnitudes of distortion in the slice direction but with opposing polarities. We also show that the slice-direction distortion can be corrected using gradient reversal-based method applying the same software used for conventional corrections of phase-encoding direction distortion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Large scale similarity search across digital reconstructions of neural morphology</a></h4>

              
                Most functions of the nervous system depend on neuronal and glial morphology. Continuous advances in microscopic imaging and tracing software have provided an increasingly abundant availability of 3D reconstructions of arborizing dendrites, axons, and processes, allowing their detailed study. However, efficient, large-scale methods to rank neural morphologies by similarity to an archetype are still lacking. Using the NeuroMorpho.Org database, we present a similarity search software enabling fast morphological comparison of hundreds of thousands of neural reconstructions from any species, brain regions, cell types, and preparation protocols. We compared the performance of different morphological measurements: 1) summary morphometrics calculated by L-Measure, 2) persistence vectors, a vectorized descriptor of branching structure, 3) the combination of the two. In all cases, we also investigated the impact of applying dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis (PCA). We assessed qualitative performance by gauging the ability to rank neurons in order of visual similarity. Moreover, we quantified information content by examining explained variance and benchmarked the ability to identify occasional duplicate reconstructions of the same specimen. The results indicate that combining summary morphometrics and persistence vectors with applied PCA provides an information rich characterization that enables efficient and precise comparison of neural morphology. The execution time scaled linearly with data set size, allowing seamless live searching through the entire NeuroMorpho.Org content in fractions of a second. We have deployed the similarity search function as an open-source online software tool both through a user-friendly graphical interface and as an API for programmatic access.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Orbitofrontal cortex contributes to the comparison of values underlying economic choices</a></h4>

              
                Economic choices between goods entail the computation and comparison of subjective values. Previous studies examined neuronal activity in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) of monkeys choosing between different types of juices. Three groups of neurons were identified: offer value cells encoding the value of individual offers, chosen juice cells encoding the identity of the chosen juice, and chosen value cells encoding the value of the chosen offer. The encoded variables capture both the input (offer value) and the output (chosen juice, chosen value) of the decision process, suggesting that values are compared within OFC. Recent work demonstrates that choices are causally linked to the activity of offer value cells. Conversely, the hypothesis that OFC contributes to value comparison has not been confirmed. Here we show that weak electrical stimulation of OFC specifically disrupts value comparison without altering offer values. This result implies that neuronal populations in OFC participate in the decision process.

                Limitations in the accuracy of brain pathways reconstructed by diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography have received considerable attention. While the technical advances spearheaded by the Human Connectome Project (HCP) led to significant improvements in dMRI data quality, it remains unclear how these data should be analyzed to maximize tractography accuracy. Over a period of two years, we have engaged the dMRI community in the IronTract Challenge, which aims to answer this question by leveraging a unique dataset. Macaque brains that have received both tracer injections and ex vivo dMRI at high spatial and angular resolution allow a comprehensive, quantitative assessment of tractography accuracy on state-of-the-art dMRI acquisition schemes. We find that, when analysis methods are carefully optimized, the HCP scheme can achieve similar accuracy as a more time-consuming, Cartesian-grid scheme. Importantly, we show that simple pre- and post-processing strategies can improve the accuracy and robustness of many tractography methods. Finally, we find that fiber configurations that go beyond crossing (e.g., fanning, branching) are the most challenging for tractography. The IronTract Challenge remains open and we hope that it can serve as a valuable validation tool for both users and developers of dMRI analysis methods.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A nutriepigenetic pathway links nutrient information to sensory plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Diet composition has a profound influence on brain physiology and behavior, but the mechanisms through which nutrient information is transmuted into neural changes remain elusive. Here we uncover how the metabolic enzyme O-GlcNAc Transferase (OGT) transforms information about the dietary environment into taste adaptations. We show that in the fly D. melanogaster, OGT decorates the chromatin of the sweet taste neurons and provides the nutrient context to drive changes in chromatin accessibility in response to high dietary sugar. Specifically, we found that OGT cooperates with the epigenetic silencer Polycomb Repressive Complex 2.1 (PRC2.1) to promote nutrient-sensitive variations in chromatin openness; these chromatin dynamics result in changes in gene expression and taste plasticity that are dependent on the catalytic activity of OGT. Parallel nutrigenomic signatures were also observed in the lingual epithelium of rats exposed to high dietary sugar, suggesting that this conserved metabolic-epigenetic pathway may also underlie diet-dependent taste changes in mammals. Together our findings reveal a novel role for nutriepigenetic signaling in the brain: amplifying nutrient perturbations into robust changes in chromatin accessibility and transcriptional output that shape neural and behavioral plasticity.

                Neuronal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) appears continuous throughout the cell. Its shape and continuity are influenced by ER- shaping proteins, mutations in which can cause axon degeneration in Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP). While HSP is thought of as an axon degeneration disease, the susceptibility of distal axons suggests a ''dying back'' pathology, in which presynaptic terminals could also be affected. We therefore asked how loss of Rtnl1, a Drosophila ortholog of the human HSP gene RTN2 (SPG12), which encodes an ER-shaping protein, affected ER organization and the function of presynaptic terminals. Loss of Rtnl1 depleted ER membrane markers at larval presynaptic motor terminals, and appeared to deplete mainly narrow tubular ER while leaving cisternae largely unaffected, thus suggesting little change in Ca2+ storage capacity at rest. Nevertheless, these changes in presynaptic ER architecture were accompanied by major reductions in activity-evoked Ca2+ fluxes in the cytosol, ER lumen, and mitochondria, as well as by reduced evoked and spontaneous neurotransmission. Our results provide a unique model to explore the roles of presynaptic tubular ER, and show the importance of ER architecture in regulating presynaptic physiology and synaptic function. Altered presynaptic Ca2+ physiology is therefore a potential factor in the pathological changes found in HSP.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Speech-driven Facial Animations Improve Speech-in-Noise Comprehension of Humans</a></h4>

              
                Understanding speech becomes a demanding task when the environment is noisy. Comprehension of speech in noise can be substantially improved by looking at the speake's face, and this audiovisual benefit is even more pronounced in people with hearing impairment. Recent advances in AI have allowed to synthesize photorealistic talking faces from a speech recording and a still image of a person's face in an end-to-end manner. However, it has remained unknown whether such facial animations improve speech-in-noise comprehension. Here we consider facial animations produced by a recently introduced generative adversarial network (GAN), and show that humans cannot distinguish between the synthesized and the natural videos. Importantly, we then show that the end-to-end synthesized videos significantly aid humans in understanding speech in noise, although the natural facial motions yield a yet higher audiovisual benefit. We further find that an audiovisual speech recognizer benefits from the synthesized facial animations as well. Our results suggest that synthesizing facial motions from speech can be used to aid speech comprehension in difficult listening environments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visual speech is processed differently in auditory and visual cortex: evidence from MEG and partial coherence analysis</a></h4>

              
                Speech perception in noisy environments is enhanced by seeing facial movements of communication partners. However, the neural mechanisms by which audio and visual speech are combined are not fully understood. We explore MEG phase locking to auditory and visual signals in MEG recordings from 14 human participants (6 female) that reported words from single spoken sentences. We manipulated the acoustic clarity and visual speech signals such that critical speech information is present in auditory, visual or both modalities. MEG coherence analysis revealed that both auditory and visual speech envelopes (auditory amplitude modulations and lip aperture changes) were phase-locked to 2-6Hz brain responses in auditory and visual cortex, consistent with entrainment to syllable-rate components. Partial coherence analysis was used to separate neural responses to correlated audio-visual signals and showed non-zero phase locking to auditory envelope in occipital cortex during audio-visual (AV) speech. Furthermore, phase-locking to auditory signals in visual cortex was enhanced for AV speech compared to audio-only (AO) speech that was matched for intelligibility. Conversely, auditory regions of the superior temporal gyrus (STG) did not show above-chance partial coherence with visual speech signals during AV conditions, but did show partial coherence in VO conditions. Hence, visual speech enabled stronger phase locking to auditory signals in visual areas, whereas phase-locking of visual speech in auditory regions only occurred during silent lip-reading. Differences in these cross-modal interactions between auditory and visual speech signals are interpreted in line with cross-modal predictive mechanisms during speech perception.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Music-selective cortex is sensitive to structure in both pitch and time</a></h4>

              
                Converging evidence suggests that neural populations within human non-primary auditory cortex respond selectively to music. These neural populations respond strongly to a wide range of music stimuli, and weakly to other natural sounds and to synthetic control stimuli matched to music in many acoustic properties, suggesting that they are driven by high-level musical features. What are these features? Here we used fMRI to test the extent to which musical structure in pitch and time contribute to music-selective neural responses. We used voxel decomposition to derive music-selective response components in each of 15 participants individually, and then measured the response of these components to synthetic music clips in which we selectively disrupted musical structure by scrambling either the note pitches and/or onset times. Both types of scrambling produced lower responses compared to when melodic or rhythmic structure was intact. This effect was much stronger in the music-selective component than in the other response components, even those with substantial spatial overlap with the music component. We further found no evidence for any cortical regions sensitive to pitch but not time structure, or vice versa. Our results suggest that the processing of melody and rhythm are intertwined within auditory cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Planning the potential future during multi-item visual working memory</a></h4>

              
                Working memory allows us to retain visual information to guide upcoming future behavior. In line with this future-oriented purpose of working memory, recent studies have shown that action planning occurs during encoding and retention of a single visual item, for which the upcoming action is certain. We asked whether and how this extends to multi-item visual working memory, when visual representations serve the potential future. Human participants performed a visual working memory task with a memory-load manipulation (one/two/four items), and a delayed orientation-reproduction report (of one item). We measured EEG to track 15-25 Hz beta activity in electrodes contralateral to the required response hand - a canonical marker of action planning. We show an attenuation of beta activity, not only in load one (with one certain future action), but also in load two (with two potential future actions), compared to load four (with low prospective-action certainty). Moreover, in load two, potential action planning occurs regardless whether both visual items afford similar or dissimilar manual responses; and it predicts the speed of ensuing memory-guided behavior. This shows that potential action planning occurs during multi- item visual working memory, and brings the perspective that working memory helps us prepare for the potential future.

                Cortical processing streams for item and contextual information come together in the entorhinal-hippocampal circuitry. Various evidence suggest that information-specific pathways organize the cortical -- entorhinal interaction and the circuitry's inner communication along the transversal axis. Here, we leveraged ultra-high field functional imaging and advance Maass, Berron et al. (2015) who report two functional routes segregating the entorhinal cortex (EC) and subiculum. Our data show specific scene processing in the functionally connected posterior-medial EC and distal subiculum. The regions of another route, that connects the anterior-lateral EC and a newly identified retrosplenial-based anterior-medial EC subregion with the CA1/subiculum border, process object and scene information similarly. Our results support topographical information flow in human entorhinal-hippocampal subregions with organized convergence of cortical processing streams and a unique route for contextual information. They characterize the functional organization of the circuitry and underpin its central role in memory function and pathological decline.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Help or flight: Neural defensive circuits promote helping under threat in humans</a></h4>

              
                Helping of conspecifics under threat has been observed across species. In humans, the dominant view proposes that empathy is the key proximal mechanism driving helping motivation in a threatening context, but little is known about how one s own defensive responses to the threat may guide helping decisions. In this pre-registered study, we manipulated threat imminence to activate the entire defensive brain circuitry, and assess the impact of different defensive responses on risky helping behaviour. Forty-nine participants underwent fMRI scanning while making trial-by-trial decisions about whether or not to help a co-participant avoid aversive shocks at the risk of receiving a shock themselves. Helping decisions were prompted under imminent and distal threat, based on the spatiotemporal distance to the administration of the shock to the co-participant. We found that greater engagement of reactive fear circuits (insula, ACC, PAG) during the threat presentation led to helping decisions, whereas engagement of cognitive fear circuits (hippocampus and vmPFC) preceded decisions not to help. Relying on representational similarity analysis, we identified how the defensive circuitry uniquely represented the threat to oneself, and the distress of the co-participant during the task. Importantly, we found that the strength with which the amygdala represented the threat to oneself, and not the other s distress, predicted decisions to help. Our results demonstrate that defensive neural circuits coordinating fast escape from immediate danger may also facilitate decisions to help others, potentially by engaging neurocognitive systems implicated in caregiving across mammals. Taken together, our findings provide novel insights into the proximal basis of altruistic responding, suggesting that defensive responses may play a more important role in helping than previously understood.

                Humans can readily perceive a multitude of features from social interactions, but the phenomenological and neural basis of social perception has yet to be solved. Short film clips with rich social content were shown to 97 healthy participants while their haemodynamic brain activity was measured with fMRI. The stimulus clips were annotated for 112 social features yielding the initial stimulus model. Cluster analysis revealed that 13 dimensions were sufficient for describing the social perceptual space. Univariate GLM using these dimensions as predictors was used to map regional neural response profiles to different social features. Multivariate pattern analysis was then utilized to establish the regional specificity of the responses. The results revealed a posterior-anterior gradient in the processing of social information in the brain. Occipital and temporal regions responded to most social dimensions and the classifier revealed that these responses were dimension specific; in contrast Heschl gyri and parietal areas were also broadly tuned to different social signals yet the responses were domain-general and did not differentiate between dimensions. Altogether these results highlight the distributed nature of social processing in the brain as well as the specific contributions of feature-specific versus domain-general social perceptual processes.

                MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are found in nerve terminals, synaptic vesicles, and synaptosomes, but it is unclear whether synaptic and cytosolic miRNA populations differ in Alzheimers disease (AD) or if synaptosomal miRNAs affect AD synapse activity. To address these questions, we generated synaptosomes and cytosolic fractions from postmortem brains of AD and unaffected control (UC) samples and analyzed them using a global Affymetrix miRNAs microarray platform. A group of miRNAs significantly differed (p<0.0001) with high fold changes variance (+/- >200-fold) in their expressions in different comparisons- 1) UC synaptosome vs UC cytosol, 2) AD synaptosomes vs AD cytosol, 3) AD cytosol vs UC cytosol, and 4) AD synaptosomes vs UC synaptosomes. MiRNAs data analysis revealed that some potential miRNAs were consistently different across sample groups. These differentially expressed miRNAs were further validated using AD postmortem brains, brains of APP transgenic (Tg2576), Tau transgenic (P301L), and wild type mice. The miR-501-3p, miR-502-3p and miR-877-5p were identified as potential synaptosomal miRNAs upregulated with disease progression based on AD Braak stages. Gene Ontology Enrichment and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of synaptosomal miRNAs showed the involvement of miRNAs in nervous system development, cell junction organization, synapse assembly formation, and function of GABAergic synapse. This is the first description of synaptic versus cytosolic miRNAs in AD and their significance in synapse function.

In particular, research involving rodents has utilized MRI to accurately identify brain regions and characteristics by acquiring high resolution cavity images with different contrasts non-invasively, and this has resulted in high reproducibility and throughput. In addition, tractographic analysis using diffusion tensor imaging to obtain information on the neural structure of white matter has emerged as a major methodology in the field of neuroscience due to its contribution in discovering significant correlations between altered neural connections and various neurological and psychiatric diseases. However, unlike image analysis studies with human subjects where a myriad of human image analysis programs and procedures have been thoroughly developed and validated, methods for analyzing rat image data using MRI in preclinical research settings have seen significantly less developed. Therefore, in this study, we present a deterministic tractographic analysis pipeline using the SIGMA atlas for a detailed structural segmentation and structural connectivity analysis of the rat brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s structural connectivity. In addition, the structural connectivity analysis pipeline presented in this study was preliminarily tested on normal and stroke rat models for initial observation.</p>

	<p>Gliomas represent 70% of all central system nervous tumors and are classified according to the degree of malignancy as low- or high-grade. The permanent activation of the EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathway by various genetic or post-translational alterations of EGFR, PI3KCA, and PTEN has been associated with increased proliferation and resistance to apoptosis. The present study aimed to analyze the molecular/genetic changes in the EGFR/PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathway between low-grade and high-grade gliomas in a sample of Colombian patients. A total of 30 samples were tested for PI3K and PTEN mutations, EGFR, PI3K, and AKT gene amplification, AKT, PI3K, BAX, Bcl2 expression levels, and phosphorylation of AKT and PTEN, EGFR and/or PI3K gene amplification was found in 50% of low-grade and 45% of high-grade ones. AKT amplification was found in 25% of the low-grade and 13.6% of the high-grade. The expression of PI3K, AKT, Bcl2, and BAX was increased particularly to a high degree. AKT phosphorylation was found in 66% of low-grade and 31.8% of high-grade. Increased phosphorylation of PTEN was found in 77% low-grade and 66% high-grade. Our results indicate that alterations in the EGFR/PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathway could be important in the initiation and malignant progression of this type of tumor.</p>

	<p>The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has affected the daily life of the worldwide population since 2020. Links between the newly discovered viral infection and the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases have been investigated in different studies. This review aims to summarize the literature concerning COVID-19 and Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) to give an overview on the interface between viral infection and neurodegeneration with regard to this current topic. We will highlight SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism, neuropathology and the suspected pathophysiological links between the infection and neurodegeneration as well as the psychosocial impact of the pandemic on patients with PD. Some evidence discussed in this review suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic might be followed by a higher incidence of neurodegenerative diseases in the future. However, the data generated so far are not sufficient to confirm that COVID-19 can trigger or accelerate neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

                Background: As greater career development support for doctoral students and postdoctoral researchers has been emphasized, the individual development plan (IDP) has become a recommended mentoring tool. However, little is known about the effect of IDPs on mentoring and career development. This study proposed two conceptual models to examine the interrelationships among the use of IDPs, mentoring support, and career preparedness with a diverse sample of doctoral students and postdoctoral researchers in the life sciences. Methods: The data leveraged for this study was collected over a three-month period, March 2016 to June 2016, as part of a cross-sectional, online survey. The survey was distributed through social media and direct email to participants enrolled in life/biological/medical or physical/applied doctoral programs at U.S. institutions. To test the proposed conceptual models, this study employed the design-based multilevel structural equation modeling. Results: The analytic sample comprised 660 doctoral students and postdoctoral researchers in the life sciences from 91 institutions. The results suggested that 1) using the IDP could enhance mentoring support and career preparedness of doctoral students and postdoctoral researchers; 2) greater mentoring support and career preparedness would motivate mentees to continue utilizing the IDP with their principal investigator (PI) or advisor; and 3) females, postdoctoral researchers, and international scholars might need more support throughout the mentoring and career development process. Conclusions: This research offered empirical evidence for how an IDP, mentorship, and career preparedness interact. Findings revealed the IDP enhances mentoring support and career preparedness, as well as mentoring support and career preparedness predict IDP use. We conclude the IDP is an important mentorship tool that enhances trainees’ overall career preparation.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Precision Mapping of Amyloid-{beta} Binding Reveals Perisynaptic Localization and Spatially Restricted Plasticity Deficits</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Secreted amyloid-&beta; (A&beta;) peptide forms neurotoxic oligomeric assemblies thought to cause synaptic deficits associated with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (AD). Soluble A&beta; oligomers (A&beta;o) directly bind to neurons with high affinity and block plasticity mechanisms related to learning and memory, trigger loss of excitatory synapses and eventually cause cell death. While A&beta;o toxicity has been intensely investigated, it remains unclear precisely where A&beta;o initially binds to the surface of neurons and whether sites of binding relate to synaptic deficits. Here, we used a combination of live cell, super-resolution and ultrastructural imaging techniques to investigate the kinetics, reversibility and nanoscale location of A&beta;o binding. Surprisingly, A&beta;o does not bind directly at the synaptic cleft as previously thought but, instead, forms distinct nanoscale clusters encircling the postsynaptic membrane with a significant fraction also binding presynaptic axon terminals. Synaptic plasticity deficits were observed at A&beta;o-bound synapses but not closely neighboring A&beta;o-free synapses. Thus, perisynaptic A&beta;o binding triggers spatially restricted signaling mechanisms to disrupt synaptic function. These data provide new insight into the earliest steps of A&beta;o pathology and lay the groundwork for future studies evaluating potential surface receptor(s) and local signaling mechanisms responsible for A&beta;o binding and synapse dysfunction.</p>

                <p>The cochaperone FKBP51, encoded by the <I>Fkbp5</I> gene, has been identified as central risk factor for anxiety-related disorders and stress system dysregulation. In the brain, the oval bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (ovBNST) has been implicated in stress-induced anxiety. However, the role of <I>Fkbp5</I> in the ovBNST and its impact on anxiety-like behavior have remained unknown. Here, we show in mice that <I>Fkbp5</I> in the ovBNST is reactive to acute stress and coexpressed with the stress-regulated neuropeptides <I>Tac2</I> and <I>Crh</I>. Subsequently, results obtained from viral-mediated manipulation indicate that <I>Fkbp5</I> overexpression (OE) in the ovBNST results in an anxiolytic-like tendency regarding behavior and endocrinology, whereas a <I>Fkbp5</I> knock-out (KO) exposed a clear anxiogenic phenotype, indicating that native ovBNST expression and regulation is necessary for normal anxiety-related behavior. Notably, our data suggests that a stress-induced increase of <I>Fkbp5</I> in the ovBNST may in fact have a protective role, leading to a transient decrease in anxiety and suppression of a future stress-induced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation. Together, our findings provide a first insight into the previously unknown relationship and effects of <I>Fkbp5</I> and the ovBNST on anxiety-like behavior and HPA axis functioning.</p>

                Background: Modern artificial intelligence applications are appearing in healthcare and medical practices. Artificial intelligence is used both in medical research and on patients via medical devices. The aim of this paper is to examine and compare English and Taiwanese tort laws in relation to medical artificial intelligence. Methods: The methodologies employed are legal doctrinal analysis and comparative law analysis. Results: The investigation finds that English tort law treats wrong diagnostic or wrong advice as negligent misstatement, and mishaps due to devices as a physical tort under the negligence rule. Negligent misstatement may occur in diagnosis or advisory systems, while a negligent act may occur in products used in the treatment of the patient. Product liability under English common law applies the same rule as negligence. In Taiwan, the general principles of tort law in Taiwan’s Civil Code for misstatement and negligent action apply, whereas the Consumer Protection Act provides for additional rules on product liability of traders. Conclusions: Safety regulations may be a suitable alternative to tort liability as a means to ensure the safety of medical artificial intelligence systems.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Review of recent lung biomarkers of potential harm/effect for tobacco research [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Biomarkers of potential harm (BoPH) are indicators of biological perturbations which may contribute to the pathophysiology of disease. In this review, we critically assessed the published data on lung-related BoPH in human lung disease for potential use in evaluating the effects of tobacco and nicotine products. A Scopus literature search was conducted on lung disease biomarkers used in a clinical setting over the last 10 years. We identified 1171 papers which were further screened using commercial software (Sciome SWIFT-Active Screener) giving 68 publications that met our inclusion criteria (data on the association of the biomarker with cigarette smoking, the impact of smoking cessation on the biomarker, and differences between smokers and non-smokers), the majority of which investigated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Several physiological and biochemical measures were identified that are potentially relevant for evaluating the impact of tobacco products on lung health. Promising new candidates included blood biomarkers, such as surfactant protein D (SP-D), soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE), skin autofluorescence (SAF), and imaging techniques. These biomarkers may provide insights into lung disease development and progression; however, all require further research and validation to confirm their role in the context of tobacco and nicotine exposure, their time course of development and ability to measure or predict disease progression.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Structural analysis of the microglia‐interneuron interactions in the CA1 hippocampal area of the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Microglia can interact with glutamatergic neurons and, through control of synaptic elements, regulate their physiological function. Much less is known about the partnership between microglia and GABAergic inhibitory interneurons. Here, we compared the interactions between microglia and parvalbumin (PV+) and somatostatin (SOM+) expressing interneurons in the CA1 hippocampal area of APP/PS1 transgenic mice that mimic certain aspects of the Alzheimer's disease (AD). We first uncovered a high level of interactions between microglia and two types of interneurons, with 98% of SOM+ and 90% of PV+ cells receiving different types of putative microglial contacts. The latter included the microglia soma to the interneuron soma (Soma<sub>MG</sub>-to-Soma<sub>IN</sub>), the microglia process to the interneuron soma (Process<sub>MG</sub>-to-Soma<sub>IN</sub>) and the microglia process to the interneuron dendrite (Process<sub>MG</sub>-to-Dend<sub>IN</sub>) interactions. Moreover, we found significantly larger areas of interaction for the Soma<sub>MG</sub>-to-Soma<sub>IN</sub> and the Process<sub>MG</sub>-to-Dend<sub>IN</sub> type of contacts between microglia and SOM+ cells. In contrast, PV+ cells exhibited larger areas for the Process<sub>MG</sub>-to-Soma<sub>IN</sub> interactions. Second, in APP/PS1 mice, whereas the overall microglia interactions with interneurons remained preserved, the fraction of interneurons receiving putative microglia contacts on their dendrites was reduced, and larger areas of interactions were observed for somatic contacts, suggesting a stronger modulation of the interneuron output by microglia in AD. In summary, these results reveal microglia as important partners of hippocampal PV+ and SOM+ GABAergic cells, with interneuron type-specific pattern of interactions. Thus, microglia may play an essential role in the operation of interneurons under normal conditions and their dysfunction in disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Strychnine poisoning due to traditional Chinese medicine: a case series [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Strychnine poisoning is rare but possibly fatal. The most reported sources of strychnine poisoning include rodenticides and adulterated street heroin. Here we report a case series of an unusual cause of strychnine poisoning – Strychni semen, a herb known as “maqianzi” in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Methods: All cases of strychnine poisoning confirmed by the Hospital Authority Toxicology Reference Laboratory (HATRL, the highest-level clinical toxicology laboratory in Hong Kong) between May 2005 and May 2018 were reviewed. Results: Twelve cases of strychnine poisoning were recorded, and Strychni semen was the exclusive source. Ten (83%) patients presented with muscle spasms, and four (33%) developed typical conscious convulsions. The poisoning was severe in two (17%) patients, moderate in three (25%) and mild in eight (58%). No case fatality was recorded. Three (25%) patients were TCM practitioners and two (17%) were laymen who bought the herb themselves without a proper prescription. Conclusion: The practice of TCM is becoming popular in different parts of the world amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The spectrum of clinical features of strychnine poisoning secondary to Strychni semen are similar to those arising from different origins. Eliciting a history of TCM use, apart from exposure to rodenticides and drugs of abuse, may allow timely diagnosis in patients with compatible clinical features. Enhancement of TCM safety could minimize the hazard.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A spatio-temporal model to reveal oscillator phenotypes in molecular clocks: Parameter estimation elucidates circadian gene transcription dynamics in single-cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Måns Unosson, Marco Brancaccio, Michael Hastings, Adam M. Johansen, Bärbel Finkenstädt</p>

We propose a stochastic distributed delay model together with a Markov random field prior and a measurement model for bioluminescence-reporting to analyse spatio-temporal gene expression in intact networks of cells. The model describes the oscillating time evolution of molecular mRNA counts through a negative transcriptional-translational feedback loop encoded in a chemical Langevin equation with a probabilistic delay distribution. The model is extended spatially by means of a multiplicative random effects model with a first order Markov random field prior distribution. Our methodology effectively separates intrinsic molecular noise, measurement noise, and extrinsic noise and phenotypic variation driving cell heterogeneity, while being amenable to parameter identification and inference. Based on the single-cell model we propose a novel computational stability analysis that allows us to infer two key characteristics, namely the robustness of the oscillations, i.e. whether the reaction network exhibits sustained or damped oscillations, and the profile of the regulation, i.e. whether the inhibition occurs over time in a more distributed versus a more direct manner, which affects the cells’ ability to phase-shift to new schedules. We show how insight into the spatio-temporal characteristics of the circadian feedback loop in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) can be gained by applying the methodology to bioluminescence-reported expression of the circadian core clock gene <i>Cry1</i> across mouse SCN tissue. We find that while (almost) all SCN neurons exhibit robust cell-autonomous oscillations, the parameters that are associated with the regulatory transcription profile give rise to a spatial division of the tissue between the central region whose oscillations are resilient to perturbation in the sense that they maintain a high degree of synchronicity, and the dorsal region which appears to phase shift in a more diversified way as a response to large perturbations and thus could be more amenable to entrainment.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Preparing to move: Setting initial conditions to simplify interactions with complex objects</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rashida Nayeem, Salah Bazzi, Mohsen Sadeghi, Neville Hogan, Dagmar Sternad</p>

Humans dexterously interact with a variety of objects, including those with complex internal dynamics. Even in the simple action of carrying a cup of coffee, the hand not only applies a force to the cup, but also indirectly to the liquid, which elicits complex reaction forces back on the hand. Due to underactuation and nonlinearity, the object’s dynamic response to an action sensitively depends on its initial state and can display unpredictable, even chaotic behavior. With the overarching hypothesis that subjects strive for predictable object-hand interactions, this study examined how subjects explored and prepared the dynamics of an object for subsequent execution of the target task. We specifically hypothesized that subjects find initial conditions that shorten the transients prior to reaching a stable and predictable steady state. Reaching a predictable steady state is desirable as it may reduce the need for online error corrections and facilitate feed forward control. Alternative hypotheses were that subjects seek to reduce effort, increase smoothness, and reduce risk of failure. Motivated by the task of ‘carrying a cup of coffee’, a simplified cup-and-ball model was implemented in a virtual environment. Human subjects interacted with this virtual object via a robotic manipulandum that provided force feedback. Subjects were encouraged to first explore and prepare the cup-and-ball before initiating a rhythmic movement at a specified frequency between two targets without losing the ball. Consistent with the hypotheses, subjects increased the predictability of interaction forces between hand and object and converged to a set of initial conditions followed by significantly decreased transients. The three alternative hypotheses were not supported. Surprisingly, the subjects’ strategy was more effortful and less smooth, unlike the observed behavior in simple reaching movements. Inverse dynamics of the cup-and-ball system and forward simulations with an impedance controller successfully described subjects’ behavior. The initial conditions chosen by the subjects in the experiment matched those that produced the most predictable interactions in simulation. These results present first support for the hypothesis that humans prepare the object to minimize transients and increase stability and, overall, the predictability of hand-object interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Genome-wide gene expression noise in Escherichia coli is condition-dependent and determined by propagation of noise through the regulatory network</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Arantxa Urchueguía, Luca Galbusera, Dany Chauvin, Gwendoline Bellement, Thomas Julou, Erik van Nimwegen</p>

Although it is well appreciated that gene expression is inherently noisy and that transcriptional noise is encoded in a promoter’s sequence, little is known about the extent to which noise levels of individual promoters vary across growth conditions. Using flow cytometry, we here quantify transcriptional noise in <i>Escherichia coli</i> genome-wide across 8 growth conditions and find that noise levels systematically decrease with growth rate, with a condition-dependent lower bound on noise. Whereas constitutive promoters consistently exhibit low noise in all conditions, regulated promoters are both more noisy on average and more variable in noise across conditions. Moreover, individual promoters show highly distinct variation in noise across conditions. We show that a simple model of noise propagation from regulators to their targets can explain a significant fraction of the variation in relative noise levels and identifies TFs that most contribute to both condition-specific and condition-independent noise propagation. In addition, analysis of the genome-wide correlation structure of various gene properties shows that gene regulation, expression noise, and noise plasticity are all positively correlated genome-wide and vary independently of variations in absolute expression, codon bias, and evolutionary rate. Together, our results show that while absolute expression noise tends to decrease with growth rate, relative noise levels of genes are highly condition-dependent and determined by the propagation of noise through the gene regulatory network.

                Background: The recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease corresponding to it (coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19) has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. COVID-19 has become a global crisis, shattering health care systems, and weakening economies of most countries. The current methods of testing that are employed include reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), rapid antigen testing, and lateral flow testing with RT-PCR being used as the golden standard despite its accuracy being at a mere 63%. It is a manual process which is time consuming, taking about an average of 48 hours to obtain the results. Alternative methods employing deep learning techniques and radiologic images are up and coming. Methods: In this paper, we used a dataset consisting of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 folders for both X-Ray and CT images which contained a total number of 17,599 images. This dataset has been used to compare 3 (non-pre-trained) CNN models and 5 pre-trained models and their performances in detecting COVID-19 under various parameters like validation accuracy, training accuracy, validation loss, training loss, prediction accuracy, sensitivity and the training time required, with CT and X-Ray images separately. Results: Xception provided the highest validation accuracy (88%) when trained with the dataset containing the X- ray images while VGG19 provided the highest validation accuracy (81.2%) when CT images are used for training. Conclusions: The model, VGG16, showed the most consistent performance, with a validation accuracy of 76.6% for CT images and 87.76% for X-ray images. When comparing the results between the modalities, models trained with the X-ray dataset showed better performances than the same models trained with CT images. Hence, it can be concluded that X-ray images provide a higher accuracy in detecting COVID-19 making it an effective method for detecting COVID-19 in real life.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Modulation of lateral septal and dorsomedial striatal neurons by hippocampal sharp‐wave ripples, theta rhythm, and running speed</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Single units were recorded in hippocampus, lateral septum (LS), and dorsomedial striatum (DMS) while freely behaving rats (<i>n</i> = 3) ran trials in a T-maze task and rested in a holding bucket between trials. In LS, 28% (64/226) of recorded neurons were excited and 14% (31/226) were inhibited during sharp wave ripples (SWRs). LS neurons that were excited during SWRs fired preferentially on the downslope of hippocampal theta rhythm and had firing rates that were positively correlated with running speed; LS neurons that were inhibited during SWRs fired preferentially on the upslope of hippocampal theta rhythm and had firing rates that were negatively correlated with running speed. In DMS, only 3.3% (12/366) of recorded neurons were excited and 5.7% (21/366) were inhibited during SWRs. As in LS, DMS neurons that were excited by SWRs tended to have firing rates that were positively modulated by running speed, whereas DMS neurons that were inhibited by SWRs tended to have firing rates that were negatively modulated by running speed. But in contrast with LS, these two DMS subpopulations did not clearly segregate their spikes to different phases of the theta cycle. Based on these results and a review of prior findings, we discuss how concurrent activation of spatial trajectories in hippocampus and motor representations in LS and DMS may contribute to neural computations that support reinforcement learning and value-based decision making.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Understanding the funding characteristics of research impact: A proof-of-concept study linking REF 2014 impact case studies with Researchfish grant agreements [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: All parts of the research community have an interest in understanding research impact whether that is around the pathways to impact, processes around impact, methods for measurement, describing impact and so on. This proof of concept study explored the relationship between research funding and research impact using the case studies submitted to the UK Research Excellence Framework (REF) exercise in 2014 as a proxy for impact. Methods: The paper describes an approach to link the REF impact case studies with the underpinning research grants present in the Researchfish dataset, primarily using the publications captured in both datasets. Where possible the methodology utilised unique identifiers such as Digital Object Identifiers and PubMed ID’s, and where this was not possible the funding information within each publication was used. Results: Through this automated approach 21% of the non-redacted case studies could be linked to a specific research grant. Additional qualitative analysis was then done for unlinked REF impact case studies, which involved reading the document to identify additional information to make the linkage. This approach was taken on 100 REF impact case studies selected at random and resulted in only seven having no identifiable research grants funding associated. The linked research grants were analysed to identify characteristics that are more frequently associated with these grants, than non-linked ones. Conclusions: This analysis did point to some interesting observations such as the grant funding linked to REF impact case studies are more likely to be longer, higher financial value, have more publications and be more collaborative (amongst other characteristics). These findings should be used with caution at present and not be over interpreted, this is due to the sample size for this proof of concept study and some potential limitations on the data which were not addressed at this stage.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A whole genome atlas of 81 Psilocybe genomes as a resource for psilocybin production. [version 2; peer review: 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                The Psilocybe genus is well known for the synthesis of valuable psychoactive compounds such as Psilocybin, Psilocin, Baeocystin and Aeruginascin. The ubiquity of Psilocybin synthesis in Psilocybe has been attributed to a horizontal gene transfer mechanism of a ~20Kb gene cluster. A recently published highly contiguous reference genome derived from long read single molecule sequencing has underscored interesting variation in this Psilocybin synthesis gene cluster. This reference genome has also enabled the shotgun sequencing of spores from many Psilocybe strains to better catalog the genomic diversity in the Psilocybin synthesis pathway. Here we present the de novo assembly of 81 Psilocybe genomes compared to the P.envy reference genome. Surprisingly, the genomes of Psilocybe galindoi, Psilocybe tampanensis and Psilocybe azurescens lack sequence coverage over the previously described Psilocybin synthesis pathway but do demonstrate amino acid sequence homology to a less contiguous gene cluster and may illuminate the previously proposed evolution of psilocybin synthesis.

                Breathing can be influenced by pain and anxiety, but the neural substrate underlying this connection is unknown. Liu et al. report that neurons in the lateral parabrachial nucleus expressing the μ-opioid receptor coordinate breathing with affective pain and negative emotions through divergent output circuits and local recurrent networks in mice.

                Martin-de-Saavedra et al. report that the neuronal sheddome is detectable in human cerebrospinal fluid and is enriched in neurodevelopmental disorder risk factors. Among them is the CNTNAP2 ectodomain. Its synaptic shedding is increased by neuronal activity. CNTNAP2-ecto binds and activates PMCA Ca2+ extrusion pumps and thereby decreases neuronal network synchrony.

                Zhang et al. reveal that prelimbic (PrL) neurons encode a complex reward-driven behavior as a continuous sequence, rather than signaling only the most salient task events. Other PrL neurons encode non-task behaviors, whereas many others possess weak/unstable tuning but may be recruited to represent newly learned behaviors.

                The current paradigm is that inflammatory pain resolves passively because inflammation dissipates. Van der Vlist, Raoof, Willemen, et al. identify that resolution of inflammatory pain occurs independent of the resolving inflammation. They identify that macrophages accumulate in peripheral nervous tissue and donate their mitochondria to sensory neurons to support pain resolution.

                Kimura et al. reveal the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 Lambda variant of interest. Lambda spike is more infectious than that of other variants due to the T76I and L452Q mutations. The RSYLTPGD246-253N mutation is responsible for evasion from neutralizing antibodies and further augments antibody-mediated enhancement of infection.
