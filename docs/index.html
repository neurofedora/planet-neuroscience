              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Association of Apolipoprotein E ɛ4 allele with Enlarged Perivascular Spaces</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Enlarged perivascular spaces have emerged as markers of cerebral small vessel disease and are linked to perivascular drainage dysfunction. The Apolipoprotein E ɛ4 allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for cerebral amyloid angiopathy and Alzheimer’s neuropathology, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We studied the relationship between APOE-ɛ4 and the topography and burden of enlarged perivascular spaces to elucidate underlying mechanisms between APOE-ɛ4 and adverse clinical outcomes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 3,564 Framingham Heart Study participants with available genotypes and magnetic resonance imaging. Enlarged perivascular spaces in the basal ganglia and centrum semiovale were rated using a validated scale. We related APOE-ɛ4 allele presence to high burden of enlarged perivascular spaces in each region and a mixed score reflecting high burden in both regions using multivariable logistic regression. Exploratory analyses incorporated presence of cerebral microbleeds and assessed effect modification by hypertension.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Mean age was 60.7 years (SD: 14.6), 1644 (46.1%) were male, 1486 (41.8%) were hypertensive, and 836 (23.5%) participants were APOE-ɛ4 carriers. APOE-ɛ4 was associated with high burden of enlarged perivascular spaces in the centrum semiovale (OR 1.45, 95% CI: 1.16, 1.81) and mixed regions (OR: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.68). Associations were slightly stronger in hypertensive subjects.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The APOE-ɛ4 allele plays a modest role in the burden of enlarged perivascular spaces in the centrum semiovale. Further studies are needed to clarify the underlying small vessel disease type in community-dwelling individuals with predominant centrum semiovale enlarged perivascular spaces, which may be hypertensive angiopathy in our sample.</p>

                <p>The Ophelia syndrome or encephalitis with antibodies against the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) manifests with behavioral changes, memory deficits and anxiety. To study the antibody pathogenicity, mice received continuous cerebroventricular infusion of patients' or controls' IgG for 14 days, followed by a 15-day wash-out. The effects on hippocampal mGluR5 clusters were determined by confocal microscopy. Animals infused with patients' IgG, but not controls' IgG, showed memory impairment, increased anxiety, and decreased neuronal surface mGluR5 clusters. After antibody clearance, both behavioral and molecular changes reversed to baseline conditions<b>.</b> These findings support the pathogenicity of these antibodies in anti-mGluR5 encephalitis.</p>

     alt="Comparative distribution of Arcadlin/Protocadherin-8 mRNA in the intact and ischemic brains of adult mice"/>
<p>Arcadlin/Paraxial protocadherin/Protocadherin-8 (Acad) is a regulator of dendritic spine density. We comprehensively described <i>Acad</i> expression patterns in normal and ischemic adult brains by in situ hybridization histochemistry. <i>Acad</i> was substantially expressed in the piriform cortex, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, amygdala, and hypothalamus of intact brains. Cerebral ischemia dramatically upregulated <i>Acad</i> expression, mainly in the limbic and paralimbic regions. The upregulation of <i>Acad</i> depended on neuronal activation following cerebral ischemia. Our data provide insight into the mechanisms underlying neuronal plasticity after brain ischemia.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The structural plasticity of dendritic spines serves as the adaptive capabilities of the central nervous system to various stimuli. Among these stimuli, cerebral ischemia induces dynamic alterations in neuronal network activity. Arcadlin/Paraxial protocadherin/Protocadherin-8 (Acad), a regulator of dendritic spine density, is strongly induced by activating stimuli to the neurons. However, the detailed distribution of Acad in normal and ischemic adult brains remains unclear. We comprehensively described <i>Acad</i> expression patterns in normal and ischemic adult brains by in situ hybridization histochemistry. We found that intact adult brains expressed <i>Acad</i> in the piriform cortex, dentate gyrus, hippocampal CA3, entorhinal cortex, amygdala, and hypothalamus. <i>Acad</i> expression was dramatically upregulated in the piriform cortex, olfactory area, dentate gyrus, entorhinal cortex, prefrontal cortex, insular cortex, amygdala, and septohippocampal nucleus 4 h after cerebral ischemia. Cerebral ischemia induced widespread neuronal activation, which was required for <i>Acad</i> upregulation. Our data suggested the involvement of Acad in the adaptive plasticity and remodeling of the neuronal network in the limbic and paralimbic systems.</p>

                Kenney et al. develop a mouse model co-engrafted with human lung xenografts (fLX) and a myeloid-enriched immune system (HNFL mice). While mice solely engrafted with fLX are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, HNFL mice are protected from viral infection. Protection associates with upregulation of a specific macrophage-enriched gene signature.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dual pathway architecture underlying vocal learning in songbirds</a></h4>

              
                Song acquisition and production in songbirds is governed by a dedicated neural circuitry that involves two parallel pathways: a motor pathway for the production and a basal ganglia (BG) pathway for the acquisition. Juveniles learn by imitating adult vocalizations and proceed by trial and error, errors being conveyed by a dopaminergic signal. The complex nature of the relationship between neural control and syrinx musculature makes song learning a complicated problem to solve. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely hypothesized to underlie such sensorimotor learning even though this can lead to sub-optimal solutions under uneven contours in continuous action spaces. In this article, we propose to re-interpret the role of a dual pathway architecture, underlying avian vocal learning, that helps overcome these limitations. We posit that the BG pathway conducts exploration by inducing large daily shifts in the vocal production while the motor pathway gradually consolidates this exploration. This process can be understood as a modified form of a simulated annealing process. Simulations on Gaussian performance landscapes and a syrinx-based performance landscape are demonstrated and compared with standard approaches. Taking behavioral constraints into account (60 days of learning, 1000 trials per day), the model allows to reach the global optimum in complex landscapes and thus provides a sound insight into the role of the dual pathway architecture underlying vocal learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Viability of AMURA biomarkers from single-shell diffusion MRI in Migraine Clinical Studies</a></h4>

              
                Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is the most employed method to assess white matter properties using quantitative parameters derived from diffusion MRI, but it presents known limitations that restricts the evaluation of complex structures. The objective of this study was the assessment of complementary diffusion measures extracted with a novel approach, Apparent Measures Using Reduced Acquisitions (AMURA), in comparison with DTI in clinical studies. Fifty healthy controls, 51 episodic migraine and 56 chronic migraine patients underwent single-shell diffusion MRI. Three DTI-based and eight AMURA-based parameters were compared between groups with tract-based spatial statistics. On the other hand, following a region-based analysis, the measures were assessed for multiple subsamples with diverse reduced sample sizes and their stability was evaluated with the coefficient of quartile variation. Compared to DTI, statistically significant differences in additional regions and group comparisons were found with AMURA-based measures. Additionally, some AMURA-based measures showed a remarkable discriminative power for quite reduced sample size and, simultaneously, lower stability (higher coefficient of quartile variation) than DTI-based measures. These findings suggest that AMURA presents favorable characteristics to identify differences of specific microstructural properties between clinical groups in regions with complex fiber architecture and lower dependency on the sample size or assessing technique than DTI.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">VMHdm/cSF-1 Neuronal Circuits Regulate Skeletal Muscle PGC1-α via the Sympathoadrenal Drive</a></h4>

              
                To adapt to metabolically challenging environments, the central nervous system (CNS) orchestrates metabolism of peripheral organs including skeletal muscle. The organ-communication between the CNS and skeletal muscle has been investigated, yet our understanding of the neuronal pathway from the CNS to skeletal muscle is still limited. Neurons in the dorsomedial and central parts of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMHdm/c) expressing steroidogenic factor-1 (VMHdm/cSF-1 neurons) are key for metabolic adaptations to exercise, including increased basal metabolic rate and skeletal muscle mass in mice. However, the mechanisms by which VMHdm/cSF-1 neurons regulate skeletal muscle function remain unclear. Here, we show that VMHdm/cSF-1 neurons increase the sympathoadrenal activity and regulate skeletal muscle peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1) in mice via multiple downstream nodes. Optogenetic activation of VMHdm/cSF-1 neurons dramatically elevates mRNA levels of skeletal muscle Pgc-1, which regulates a spectrum of skeletal muscle function including protein synthesis and metabolism. Mechanistically, the sympathoadrenal drive coupled with {beta}2 adrenergic receptor ({beta}2AdR) is essential for VMHdm/cSF-1 neurons-mediated increases in skeletal muscle PGC1-. Specifically, adrenalectomy and knockout of {beta}2AdR block augmented skeletal muscle PGC1- by VMHdm/cSF-1 neuronal activation. Optogenetic functional mapping reveals that downstream nodes of VMHdm/cSF-1 neurons are functionally redundant to increase circulating epinephrine and skeletal muscle PGC1-. Collectively, we propose that VMHdm/cSF-11 neurons-skeletal muscle pathway, VMHdm/cSF-1 neurons[-&gt;]multiple downstream nodes[-&gt;]the adrenal gland[-&gt;]skeletal muscle {beta}2AdR, underlies augmented skeletal muscle function for metabolic adaptations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">RNA methylation influences TDP43 binding and disease pathogenesis in models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia</a></h4>

              
                Methylation of RNA at the N6 position of adenosine (m6A) is one of the most common RNA modifications, impacting RNA stability as well as its transport and translation. Previous studies uncovered RNA destabilization in models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), in association with accumulation of the RNA-binding protein TDP43, which is itself mislocalized from the nucleus in >95% of those with ALS. Here, we show that TDP43 recognizes m6A-modified RNA, and that RNA methylation is critical for both TDP43 binding and autoregulation. We also observed extensive hypermethylation of coding and non-coding transcripts in ALS spinal cord, many of which overlap with methylated TDP43 target RNAs. Emphasizing the importance of m6A for TDP43 binding and function, we identified several m6A factors that enhance or suppress TDP43-mediated toxicity via a single-cell CRISPR/Cas9 candidate-based screen in primary neurons. The most promising genetic modifier among these-the canonical m6A reader YTHDF2-accumulated within spinal motor neurons in ALS postmortem sections, and its knockdown prolonged the survival of human neurons carrying ALS-associated mutations. Collectively, these data show that m6A modifications modulate RNA binding by TDP43, and that m6A is pivotal for TDP43-related neurodegeneration in ALS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A retrospective and stepwise learning strategy revealed by neuronal activity in the basal forebrain</a></h4>

              
                Associative learning is a fundamental cognitive capacity that allows animals and humans to learn the predictive relationship between behavioral events and rewarding outcomes. While the process of learning is commonly conceptualized as a prospective strategy (learning how behavioral events predict future rewards), here we provide behavioral and neurophysiological evidence to show that animals may instead employ a retrospective and stepwise learning strategy (learning how the reward is predicted by preceding behavioral events). In rats learning a new association in which the reward was paired with a sequence of behavioral events, learning started from the event closest to the reward and sequentially incorporated earlier events into animals' internal model. The learning of each behavioral event as a new reward predictor was accompanied by the emergence of basal forebrain (BF) neuronal responses toward that event. BF activities quantitatively conveyed a reward prediction error signal associated with the behavioral event, and promoted reward-seeking behavioral sequences containing the newly learned event. As the internal model incorporated more behavioral events as reward predictors, non-rewarded behavioral sequences that were once compatible with the internal model during early stages of learning became incompatible and were sequentially eliminated. Together, these results demonstrate how the retrospective and stepwise learning strategy can effectively establish animals' internal model during the learning process and lead to the sequential refinement of reward-seeking behaviors. These results also highlight the functional significance of BF neuronal activities, which provided unique insights into the covert dynamics of the learning process in single trials.

	<p>Background: Oligoclonal bands represent intrathecal immunoglobulin G (IgG) synthesis and play an important role in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). Kappa free light chains (KFLC) are increasingly recognized as an additional biomarker for intrathecal Ig synthesis. However, there are limited data on KFLC in neurological diseases other than MS. Methods: This study, conducted at two centers, retrospectively enrolled 346 non-MS patients. A total of 182 patients were diagnosed with non-inflammatory and 84 with inflammatory neurological diseases other than MS. A further 80 patients were classified as symptomatic controls. Intrathecal KFLC production was determined using different approaches: KFLC index, Reiber&amp;amp;rsquo;s diagram, Presslauer&amp;amp;rsquo;s exponential curve, and Senel&amp;amp;rsquo;s linear curve. Results: Matching results of oligoclonal bands and KFLC (Reiber&amp;amp;rsquo;s diagram) were frequently observed (93%). The Reiber&amp;amp;acute;s diagram for KFLC detected intrathecal KFLC synthesis in an additional 7% of the patient samples investigated (4% non-inflammatory; 3% inflammatory), which was not found by oligoclonal band detection. Conclusion: The determination of both biomarkers (KFLC and oligoclonal bands) is recommended for routine diagnosis and differentiation of non-inflammatory and inflammatory neurological diseases. Due to the high sensitivity and physiological considerations, the assessment of KFLC in the Reiber&amp;amp;acute;s diagram should be preferred to other evaluation methods.</p>

	<p>Temporal connectives play a crucial role in marking the sequence of events during language comprehension. Although existing studies have shown that sentence comprehension can be modulated by temporal connectives, they have mainly focused on languages with grammatical tense such as English. It thus remains unclear how temporal information is processed in tenseless languages. The present study used event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine how world knowledge is retrieved and integrated in sentences linked by zhiqian (before) and zhihou (after) in Mandarin Chinese (e.g., After/Before going to the countryside, Grandpa went to the city because the air there was fresh and pure). The critical words (e.g., fresh) were either congruent or incongruent with world knowledge. Relative to the after-congruent sentences, the after-incongruent sentences evoked a P600 on critical words and a negativity on sentence-final words, whereas relative to before-congruent sentences, before-incongruent sentences showed no significant difference on critical words but a sustained negativity on sentence-final words. Additionally, before-congruent sentences elicited a larger sustained positivity (P600) than after-congruent sentences. The results suggest that before is more difficult to process than after in Mandarin Chinese, supporting the iconicity account of temporal relations.</p>

	<p>The development of potent and selective therapeutic approaches to glioblastoma (GBM) requires the identification of molecular pathways that critically regulate the survival and proliferation of GBM. Glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) possess stem-cell-like properties, self-renewal, and differentiation into multiple neural cell lineages. From a clinical point of view, GSCs have been reported to resist radiation and chemotherapy. GSCs are influenced by the microenvironment, especially the hypoxic condition. N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) is a tumor suppressor with the potential to suppress the proliferation, invasion, and migration of cancer cells. Previous studies have reported that deregulated expression of NDRG1 affects tumor growth and clinical outcomes of patients with GBM. This literature review aimed to clarify the critical role of NDRG1 in tumorigenesis and acquirement of resistance for anti-GBM therapies, further to discussing the possibility and efficacy of NDRG1 as a novel target of treatment for GBM. The present review was conducted by searching the PubMed and Scopus databases. The search was conducted in February 2022. We review current knowledge on the regulation and signaling of NDRG1 in neuro-oncology. Finally, the role of NDRG1 in GBM and potential clinical applications are discussed.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this paper was to explore the utility of time to maximum concentration (T<sub>max</sub>)-based target mismatch on computed tomography perfusion (CTP) in predicting radiological and clinical outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion (LVO) selected for endovascular treatment (EVT).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with AIS underwent CTP within 24 hours from onset followed by EVT. Critically hypoperfused tissue and ischemic core volumes were automatically calculated using T<sub>max</sub> thresholds &gt;9.5 seconds and &gt;16 seconds, respectively. The difference between T<sub>max</sub> &gt; 9.5 seconds and T<sub>max</sub> &gt; 16 seconds volumes and the ratio between T<sub>max</sub> &gt; 9.5 seconds and T<sub>max</sub> &gt; 16 seconds volumes were considered ischemic penumbra and T<sub>max</sub> mismatch ratio, respectively. Final infarct volume (FIV) was measured on follow-up non-contrast computed tomography (CT) at 24 hours. Favorable clinical outcome was defined as 90-day modified Rankin Scale 0 to 2. Predictors of FIV and outcome were assessed with multivariable logistic regression. Optimal T<sub>max</sub> volumes for identification of good outcome was defined using receiver operating curves.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 393 patients were included, of whom 298 (75.8%) achieved successful recanalization and 258 (65.5%) achieved good outcome. In multivariable analyses, all T<sub>max</sub> parameters were independent predictors of FIV and outcome. T<sub>max</sub> &gt; 16 seconds volume had the strongest association with FIV (beta coefficient = 0.596 <i>p</i> &lt;0.001) and good outcome (odds ratio [OR] = 0.96 per 1 ml increase, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.95–0.97, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). T<sub>max</sub> &gt; 16 seconds volume had the highest discriminative ability for good outcome (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.842–0.909). A T<sub>max</sub> &gt; 16 seconds volume of ≤67 ml best identified subjects with favorable outcome (sensitivity = 0.91 and specificity = 0.73).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>T<sub>max</sub> target mismatch predicts radiological and clinical outcomes in patients with AIS with LVO receiving EVT within 24 hours from onset. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), one of the major extracellular matrix components of the glial scar that surrounds central nervous system (CNS) injuries, are known to inhibit the regeneration of neurons. This study investigated whether pleiotrophin (PTN), a growth factor upregulated during early CNS development, can overcome the inhibition mediated by CSPGs and promote the neurite outgrowth of neurons in vitro. The data showed that a CSPG matrix inhibited the outgrowth of neurites in primary cortical neuron cultures compared to a control matrix. PTN elicited a dose dependent increase in the neurite outgrowth even in the presence of the growth inhibitory CSPG matrix, with optimal growth at 15 ng mL-1 of PTN (114.8% of neuronal outgrowth relative to laminin control). The growth promoting effect of PTN was blocked by inhibition of the receptor anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) by alectinib in a dose dependent manner. Neurite outgrowth in the presence of this CSPG matrix was induced by activation of the protein kinase B (AKT) pathway, a key downstream mediator of ALK activation. This study identified PTN as a dose-dependent regulator of neurite outgrowth in primary cortical neurons cultured in the presence of a CSPG matrix, and identified ALK activation as a key driver of PTN-induced growth

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modulation of C5a-C5aR1 signaling alters the dynamics of AD progression</a></h4>

              
                Background: The complement system is part of the innate immune system that clears pathogens and cellular debris. In the healthy brain, complement influences neurodevelopment and neurogenesis, synaptic pruning, clearance of neuronal blebs, recruitment of phagocytes, and protects from pathogens. However, excessive downstream complement activation that leads to generation of C5a, and C5a engagement with its receptor C5aR1, instigates a feed-forward loop of inflammation, injury, and neuronal death, making C5aR1 a potential therapeutic target for neuroinflammatory disorders. C5aR1 ablation in the Arctic (Arc) model of Alzheimers disease protects against cognitive decline and neuronal injury without altering amyloid plaque accumulation. Methods: To elucidate the effects of C5a-C5aR1 signaling on AD pathology, we crossed Arc mice with a C5a overexpressing mouse (ArcC5a+) and tested hippocampal memory. RNA-seq was performed on hippocampus and cortex from Arc, ArcC5aR1KO, and ArcC5a+ mice at 2.7-10 months and age-matched controls to assess mechanisms involved in each system. Immunohistochemistry was used to probe for protein markers of microglia and astrocytes activation states. Results: ArcC5a+ mice had accelerated cognitive decline compared to Arc. Deletion of C5ar1 delayed or prevented the expression of some, but not all, AD-associated genes in the hippocampus and a subset of pan-reactive and A1 reactive astrocyte genes, indicating a separation between genes induced by amyloid plaques alone and those influenced by C5a-C5aR1 signaling. Biological processes associated with AD and AD mouse models, including inflammatory signaling, microglial cell activation, and astrocyte migration, were delayed in the ArcC5aR1KO hippocampus. Interestingly, C5a overexpression also delayed the increase of some AD-, complement-, and astrocyte-associated genes, suggesting the possible involvement of neuroprotective C5aR2. However, these pathways were enhanced in older ArcC5a+ mice compared to Arc. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that C5a-C5aR1 modulation in Arc mice delayed the increase in CD11c-positive microglia, while not affecting other pan-reactive microglial or astrocyte markers. Conclusion: C5a-C5aR1 signaling in AD largely exerts its effects by enhancing microglial activation pathways that accelerate disease progression. While C5a may have neuroprotective effects via C5aR2, engagement of C5a with C5aR1 is detrimental in AD models. These data support specific pharmacological inhibition of C5aR1 as a potential therapeutic strategy to treat AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inter-Individual Variability in Dorsal Stream Dynamics During Word Production</a></h4>

              
                The current standard model of language production involves a sensorimotor dorsal stream connecting areas in the temporo-parietal junction with those in the inferior frontal gyrus and lateral premotor cortex. These regions have been linked to various aspects of word production such as phonological processing or articulatory programming, primarily through neuropsychological and functional imaging group studies. Most if not all the theoretical descriptions of this model imply that the same network should be identifiable across individual speakers. We tested this hypothesis by quantifying the variability of activation observed across individuals within each dorsal stream anatomical region. This estimate was based on electrical activity recorded directly from the cerebral cortex with millisecond accuracy in awake epileptic patients clinically implanted with intracerebral depth electrodes for pre-surgical diagnosis. Each region's activity was quantified using two different metrics, intra-cerebral evoked related potentials and high gamma activity, at the level of the group, the individual, and the recording contact. Using picture naming task, the two metrics show simultaneous activation of parietal and frontal regions in line with models that posit interactive processing during word retrieval. They also reveal different levels of variability across brain regions and patients except in auditory and motor regions. The independence and non-uniformity of cortical activity according to the two metrics push the current model towards sub-second and sub-region explorations focused on individualized language speech production. Several hypotheses are considered for this within-region heterogeneity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Explaining flexible continuous speech comprehension from individual motor rhythms</a></h4>

              
                When speech is too fast, the tracking of the acoustic signal along the auditory pathway deteriorates, leading to suboptimal speech segmentation and decoding of speech information. Thus, speech comprehension is limited by the temporal constraints of the auditory system. Previous research suggests that individual differences in auditory-motor coupling strength might shape such temporal constraints. In two behavioral experiments, we characterize individual differences in the comprehension of naturalistic speech as function of the individual coupling strength between the auditory and motor systems, and the preferred frequencies of the systems. As expected, speech comprehension declined at higher rates. Importantly, both, higher auditory-motor coupling and higher spontaneous speech motor production rates were related to better speech-comprehension performance. Furthermore, performance increased with higher linguistic sentence predictability (using a recurrent neural network) -particularly at higher speech rates and for individuals with high auditory-motor coupling strength- and with participants' higher working memory capacity (Digit Span). These findings support the notion of an individual preferred auditory regime that allows for optimal auditory (speech) processing. Crucially, we provide evidence for a model that assigns a central role to motor-system-dependent individual flexibility in continuous speech comprehension.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Late maturation of executive control promotes conceptual development</a></h4>

              
                Control processes are critical for the generation of task-appropriate behaviour across cognitive domains, yet children have a long developmental period with reduced executive control. Traditionally, this is viewed as a negative but necessary consequence of the time taken to learn control processes and develop the prefrontal cortex. Here, we exploit a recent computational model of controlled semantic cognition to formally test an alternative (yet perhaps complementary) view that a developmental period without control promotes conceptual knowledge acquisition. Our simulations show that maturational delay and anatomical connectivity conspire to promote conceptual learning. Learning conceptual structure necessitates a connection from control to more peripheral regions rather than the deep multimodal hub. Delayed control speeds conceptual learning without compromising conceptual representations, particularly when control connects to intermediate layers. These results are counterintuitive as delayed control onset can produce overall faster mastery of controlled behaviours. To assess whether delayed semantic control is also observed over development, we conducted a meta-analysis of the classic triadic matching task where participants decide which of two options best matches a third. Matching can be based on taxonomic or thematic relations, and when these conflict, participants must use task context to determine which relation to choose - that is, they must exert semantic control. Children aged 2 have the representations to identify both relations when distractors are unrelated, but when relations conflict, they cannot use context to guide their choices. Context-sensitivity develops later than conceptual structure and shows large increases around 6, a critical time for executive function across domains.

	<p>(1) Background: Hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT) and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibodies have been reported to have a promising survival benefit in recent studies. Anlotinib is a new oral VEGF receptor inhibitor. This report describes our experience using HSRT and anlotinib for recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM). (2) Methods: Between December 2019 and June 2020, rGBM patients were retrospectively analysed. Anlotinib was prescribed at 12 mg daily during HSRT. Adjuvant anlotinib was administered d1-14 every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) after salvage treatment, and toxicity. (3) Results: Five patients were enrolled. The prescribed dose was 25.0 Gy in 5 fractions. The median number of cycles of anlotinib was 21 (14&amp;amp;ndash;33). The ORR was 100%. Three (60%) patients had the best outcome of a partial response (PR), and 2 (40%) achieved a complete response (CR). One patient died of tumour progression at the last follow-up. Two patients had grade 2 hand-foot syndrome. (4) Conclusions: Salvage HSRT combined with anlotinib showed a favourable outcome and acceptable toxicity for rGBM. A prospective phase II study (NCT04197492) is ongoing to further investigate the regimen.</p>

	<p>Associative memory (AM) is the ability to remember the relationship between previously unrelated items. AM is significantly affected by normal aging and neurodegenerative conditions, thus there is a growing interest in applying non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques for AM enhancement. A growing body of studies identifies posterior parietal cortex (PPC) as the most promising cortical target for both transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) to modulate a cortico-hippocampal network that underlines AM. In that sense, theta frequency oscillatory tES protocols, targeted towards the hallmark oscillatory activity within the cortico-hippocampal network, are increasingly coming to prominence. To increase precision and effectiveness, the need for EEG guided individualization of the tES protocols is proposed. Here, we present the study protocol in which two types of personalized oscillatory tES&amp;amp;ndash;transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) and oscillatory transcranial direct current stimulation (otDCS), both frequency-modulated to the individual theta-band frequency (ITF), are compared to the non-oscillatory transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and to the sham stimulation. The study has cross-over design with four tES conditions (tACS, otDCS, tDCS, sham), and the comprehensive set of neurophysiological (resting state EEG and AM-evoked EEG) and behavioral outcomes, including AM tasks (short-term associative memory, face&amp;amp;ndash;word, face&amp;amp;ndash;object, object-location), as well as measures of other cognitive functions (cognitive control, verbal fluency, and working memory).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Afterhyperpolarization Promotes the Firing of Mitral Cells through a Voltage-Dependent Modification of Action Potential Threshold</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>In the olfactory bulb, mitral cells (MCs) display a spontaneous firing that is characterized by bursts of action potentials (APs) intermixed with silent periods. Intraburst firing frequency and duration are heterogeneous among MCs and increase with membrane depolarization. By using patch-clamp recording on rat slices, we dissected out the intrinsic properties responsible for this bursting activity. We showed that the threshold of AP generation dynamically changes as a function of the preceding trajectory of the membrane potential. In fact, the AP threshold became more negative when the membrane was hyperpolarized and had a recovery rate inversely proportional to the membrane repolarization rate. Such variations appeared to be produced by changes in the inactivation state of voltage-dependent Na<sup>+</sup> channels. Thus, AP initiation was favored by hyperpolarizing events, such as negative membrane oscillations or inhibitory synaptic input. After the first AP, the following fast afterhyperpolarization (AHP) brought the threshold to more negative values and then promoted the emission of the following AP. This phenomenon was repeated for each AP of the burst making the fast AHP a regenerative mechanism that sustained the firing, AHP with larger amplitudes and faster repolarizations being associated with larger and higher-frequency bursts. Burst termination was found to be because of the development of a slow repolarization component of the AHP (slow AHP). Overall, the AHP characteristics appeared as a major determinant of the bursting properties.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">A Novel Automated Approach for Improving Standardization of the Marble Burying Test Enables Quantification of Burying Bouts and Activity Characteristics</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The marble burying test is a commonly used paradigm to describe phenotypes in mouse models of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. The current methodological approach relies predominantly on reporting the number of buried marbles at the end of the test. By measuring the proxy of the behavior (buried marbles), many important characteristics regarding the temporal aspect of this assay are lost. Here, we introduce a novel, automated method to quantify mouse behavior during the marble burying test with the focus on the burying bouts and movement dynamics. Using open-source software packages, we trained a supervised machine learning algorithm (the "classifier") to distinguish burying behavior in freely moving mice. In order to confirm the classifier&rsquo;s accuracy and characterize burying events in high detail, we performed the marble burying test in three mouse models: <I>Ube3a<sup>m-/p+</sup> </I>[Angelman syndrome (AS) model], <I>Shank2</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> (autism model), and <I>Sapap3</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> [obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) model] mice. The classifier scored burying behavior accurately and consistent with the previously reported phenotype of the <I>Ube3a<sup>m-/p+</sup> </I>mice, which showed decreased levels of burying compared with controls. <I>Shank2</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice showed a similar pattern of decreased burying behavior, which was not found in <I>Sapap3</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice. Tracking mouse behavior throughout the test revealed hypoactivity in <I>Ube3a<sup>m-/p+</sup> </I>and hyperactivity in the <I>Shank2</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice, indicating that mouse activity is unrelated to burying behavior. Reducing activity with midazolam in <I>Shank2</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice did not alter the burying behavior. Together, we demonstrate that our classifier is an accurate method for the analysis of the marble burying test, providing more information than currently used methods.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Temporally and Spatially Localized PKA Activity within Learning and Memory Circuitry Regulated by Network Feedback</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Dynamic functional connectivity within brain circuits requires coordination of intercellular signaling and intracellular signal transduction. Critical roles for cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) signaling are well established in the <I>Drosophila</I> mushroom body (MB) learning and memory circuitry, but local PKA activity within this well-mapped neuronal network is uncharacterized. Here, we use an <I>in vivo</I> PKA activity sensor (PKA-SPARK) to test spatiotemporal regulatory requirements in the MB axon lobes. We find immature animals have little detectable PKA activity, whereas postcritical period adults show high field-selective activation primarily in just 3/16 defined output regions. In addition to the age-dependent PKA activity in distinct &alpha;&rsquo;/&beta;&rsquo; lobe nodes, females show sex-dependent elevation compared with males in these same restricted regions. Loss of neural cell body Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and Rugose [human Neurobeachin (NBEA)] suppresses localized PKA activity, whereas overexpression (OE) of MB lobe PKA-synergist Meng-Po (human SBK1) promotes PKA activity. Elevated Meng-Po subverts the PKA age-dependence, with elevated activity in immature animals, and spatial-restriction, with striking  lobe activity. Testing circuit signaling requirements with temperature-sensitive <I>shibire</I> (human Dynamin) blockade, we find broadly expanded PKA activity within the MB lobes. Using transgenic tetanus toxin to block MB synaptic output, we find greatly heightened PKA activity in virtually all MB lobe fields, although the age-dependence is maintained. We conclude spatiotemporally restricted PKA activity signaling within this well-mapped learning/memory circuit is age-dependent and sex-dependent, driven by FMRP-Rugose pathway activation, temporally promoted by Meng-Po kinase function, and restricted by output neurotransmission providing network feedback.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The stochastic logistic model with correlated carrying capacities reproduces beta-diversity metrics of microbial communities</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Silvia Zaoli, Jacopo Grilli</p>

The large taxonomic variability of microbial community composition is a consequence of the combination of environmental variability, mediated through ecological interactions, and stochasticity. Most of the analysis aiming to infer the biological factors determining this difference in community structure start by quantifying how much communities are similar in their composition, trough beta-diversity metrics. The central role that these metrics play in microbial ecology does not parallel with a quantitative understanding of their relationships and statistical properties. In particular, we lack a framework that reproduces the empirical statistical properties of beta-diversity metrics. Here we take a macroecological approach and introduce a model to reproduce the statistical properties of community similarity. The model is based on the statistical properties of individual communities and on a single tunable parameter, the correlation of species’ carrying capacities across communities, which sets the difference of two communities. The model reproduces quantitatively the empirical values of several commonly-used beta-diversity metrics, as well as the relationships between them. In particular, this modeling framework naturally reproduces the negative correlation between overlap and dissimilarity, which has been observed in both empirical and experimental communities and previously related to the existence of universal features of community dynamics. In this framework, such correlation naturally emerges due to the effect of random sampling.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modelling the interaction between stem cells derived cardiomyocytes patches and host myocardium to aid non-arrhythmic engineered heart tissue design</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Damiano Fassina, Caroline M. Costa, Stefano Longobardi, Elias Karabelas, Gernot Plank, Sian E. Harding, Steven A. Niederer</p>

Application of epicardial patches constructed from human-induced pluripotent stem cell- derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) has been proposed as a long-term therapy to treat scarred hearts post myocardial infarction (MI). Understanding electrical interaction between engineered heart tissue patches (EHT) and host myocardium represents a key step toward a successful patch engraftment. EHT retain different electrical properties with respect to the host heart tissue due to the hiPSC-CMs immature phenotype, which may lead to increased arrhythmia risk. We developed a modelling framework to examine the influence of patch design on electrical activation at the engraftment site. We performed an in-silico investigation of different patch design approaches to restore pre-MI activation properties and evaluated the associated arrhythmic risk. We developed an <i>in silico</i> cardiac electrophysiology model of a transmural cross section of host myocardium. The model featured an infarct region, an epicardial patch spanning the infarct region and a bath region. The patch is modelled as a layer of hiPSC-CM, combined with a layer of conductive polymer (CP). Tissue and patch geometrical dimensions and conductivities were incorporated through 10 modifiable model parameters. We validated our model against 4 independent experimental studies and showed that it can qualitatively reproduce their findings. We performed a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) to isolate the most important parameters, showing that the stimulus propagation is mainly governed by the scar depth, radius and conductivity when the scar is not transmural, and by the EHT patch conductivity when the scar is transmural. We assessed the relevance of small animal studies to humans by comparing simulations of rat, rabbit and human myocardium. We found that stimulus propagation paths and GSA sensitivity indices are consistent across species. We explored which EHT design variables have the potential to restore physiological propagation. Simulations predict that increasing EHT conductivity from 0.28 to 1–1.1 S/m recovered physiological activation in rat, rabbit and human. Finally, we assessed arrhythmia risk related to increasing EHT conductivity and tested increasing the EHT Na<sup>+</sup> channel density as an alternative strategy to match healthy activation. Our results revealed a greater arrhythmia risk linked to increased EHT conductivity compared to increased Na<sup>+</sup> channel density. We demonstrated that our modeling framework could capture the interaction between host and EHT patches observed in <i>in vitro</i> experiments. We showed that large (patch and tissue dimensions) and small (cardiac myocyte electrophysiology) scale differences between small animals and humans do not alter EHT patch effect on infarcted tissue. Our model revealed that only when the scar is transmural do EHT properties impact activation times and isolated the EHT conductivity as the main parameter influencing propagation. We predicted that restoring physiological activation by tuning EHT conductivity is possible but may promote arrhythmic behavior. Finally, our model suggests that acting on hiPSC-CMs low action potential upstroke velocity and lack of I<sub>K1</sub> may restore pre-MI activation while not promoting arrhythmia.

                <p>by Yuge Wang, Hongyu Zhao</p>

Advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have led to successes in discovering novel cell types and understanding cellular heterogeneity among complex cell populations through cluster analysis. However, cluster analysis is not able to reveal continuous spectrum of states and underlying gene expression programs (GEPs) shared across cell types. We introduce scAAnet, an autoencoder for single-cell non-linear archetypal analysis, to identify GEPs and infer the relative activity of each GEP across cells. We use a count distribution-based loss term to account for the sparsity and overdispersion of the raw count data and add an archetypal constraint to the loss function of scAAnet. We first show that scAAnet outperforms existing methods for archetypal analysis across different metrics through simulations. We then demonstrate the ability of scAAnet to extract biologically meaningful GEPs using publicly available scRNA-seq datasets including a pancreatic islet dataset, a lung idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis dataset and a prefrontal cortex dataset.

                <p>by Haoyang Sun, Joel Koo, Borame L. Dickens, Hannah E. Clapham, Alex R. Cook</p>

As the most widespread viral infection transmitted by the <i>Aedes</i> mosquitoes, dengue has been estimated to cause 51 million febrile disease cases globally each year. Although sustained vector control remains key to reducing the burden of dengue, current understanding of the key factors that explain the observed variation in the short- and long-term vector control effectiveness across different transmission settings remains limited. We used a detailed individual-based model to simulate dengue transmission with and without sustained vector control over a 30-year time frame, under different transmission scenarios. Vector control effectiveness was derived for different time windows within the 30-year intervention period. We then used the extreme gradient boosting algorithm to predict the effectiveness of vector control given the simulation parameters, and the resulting machine learning model was interpreted using Shapley Additive Explanations. According to our simulation outputs, dengue transmission would be nearly eliminated during the early stage of sustained and intensive vector control, but over time incidence would gradually bounce back to the pre-intervention level unless the intervention is implemented at a very high level of intensity. The time point at which intervention ceases to be effective is strongly influenced not only by the intensity of vector control, but also by the pre-intervention transmission intensity and the individual-level heterogeneity in biting risk. Moreover, the impact of many transmission model parameters on the intervention effectiveness is shown to be modified by the intensity of vector control, as well as to vary over time. Our study has identified some of the critical drivers for the difference in the time-varying effectiveness of sustained vector control across different dengue endemic settings, and the insights obtained will be useful to inform future model-based studies that seek to predict the impact of dengue vector control in their local contexts.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Packaging contests between viral RNA molecules and kinetic selectivity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Inbal Mizrahi, Robijn Bruinsma, Joseph Rudnick</p>

The paper presents a statistical-mechanics model for the kinetic selection of viral RNA molecules by packaging signals during the nucleation stage of the assembly of small RNA viruses. The effects of the RNA secondary structure and folding geometry of the packaging signals on the assembly activation energy barrier are encoded by a pair of characteristics: the <i>wrapping number</i> and the <i>maximum ladder distance</i>. Kinetic selection is found to be optimal when assembly takes place under conditions of <i>supersaturation</i> and also when the concentration ratio of capsid protein and viral RNA concentrations equals the stoichiometric ratio of assembled viral particles. As a function of the height of the activation energy barrier, there is a form of order-disorder transition such that for sufficiently low activation energy barriers, kinetic selectivity is erased by entropic effects associated with the number of assembly pathways.

     alt="Bate palmas mutant mice as a model of Kabuki syndrome: Higher susceptibility to infections and vocalization impairments?"/>
<p><i>Bate palmas</i> (<i>bapa</i>) mutant mice were validated as a model of Kabuki syndrome as they were more susceptible to infections. Juvenile <i>bapa</i> mice also presented dopaminergic system hyperactivity. Juvenile control and <i>bapa</i> female mice emitted a novel vocalization pattern: 31-kHz.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The recessive mutant mouse <i>bate palmas</i> (<i>bapa</i>) arose from N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis. Previous studies of our group revealed some behavioral impairments and a mutation in the lysine (K)-specific methyltransferase 2D (Kmt2d) gene. Because mutations in the KMT2D gene in humans are mainly responsible for Kabuki syndrome, this study was proposed to validate <i>bapa</i> mice as a model of Kabuki syndrome. Besides other symptoms, Kabuki syndrome is characterized by increased susceptibility to infections and speech impairments, usually diagnosed in the early childhood. Thus, juvenile male and female <i>bapa</i> mice were studied in different developmental stages (prepubertal period and puberty). To induce sickness behavior and to study infection susceptibility responses, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used. To study oral communication, ultrasonic vocalizations were evaluated. Behavioral (open-field test) and central (astrocytic glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP] and tyrosine hydroxylase [TH]) evaluations were also performed. Control and <i>bapa</i> female mice emitted 31-kHz ultrasounds on prepubertal period when exploring a novel environment, a frequency not yet described for mice, being defined as 31-kHz exploratory vocalizations. Males, LPS, and puberty inhibited these vocalizations. <i>Bapa</i> mice presented increased motor/exploratory behaviors on prepubertal period due to increased striatal TH expression, revealing striatal dopaminergic system hyperactivity. Combining open-field behavior and GFAP expression, <i>bapa</i> mice did not develop LPS tolerance, that is, they remained expressing signs of sickness behavior after LPS challenge, being more susceptible to infectious/inflammatory processes. It was concluded that <i>bapa</i> mice is a robust experimental model of Kabuki syndrome.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to determine the impact of multiple sclerosis (MS) disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) on the development of cellular and humoral immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with MS aged 18 to 60 years were evaluated for anti-nucleocapsid and anti-Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) antibody with electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay; antibody responses to Spike protein, RBD, N-terminal domain with multiepitope bead-based immunoassays (MBI); live virus immunofluorescence-based microneutralization assay; T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 Spike using TruCulture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); and IL-2 and IFNγ ELISpot assays. Assay results were compared by DMT class. Spearman correlation and multivariate analyses were performed to examine associations between immunologic responses and infection severity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Between January 6, 2021, and July 21, 2021, 389 patients with MS were recruited (mean age 40.3 years; 74% women; 62% non-White). Most common DMTs were ocrelizumab (OCR)—40%; natalizumab —17%, Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1P) modulators −12%; and 15% untreated. One hundred seventy-seven patients (46%) had laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection; 130 had symptomatic infection, and 47 were asymptomatic. Antibody responses were markedly attenuated in OCR compared with other groups (<i>p</i> ≤0.0001). T-cell responses (IFNγ) were decreased in S1P (<i>p</i> = 0.03), increased in natalizumab (<i>p</i> &lt;0.001), and similar in other DMTs, including OCR. Cellular and humoral responses were moderately correlated in both OCR (<i>r</i> = 0.45, <i>p</i> = 0.0002) and non-OCR (<i>r</i> = 0.64, <i>p</i> &lt;0.0001). Immune responses did not differ by race/ethnicity. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinical course was mostly non-severe and similar across DMTs; 7% (9/130) were hospitalized.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>DMTs had differential effects on humoral and cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Immune responses did not correlate with COVID-19 clinical severity in this relatively young and nondisabled group of patients with MS. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                A recent study by Triphati et al. used a protein engineering approach to demonstrate that cellular stress caused by familial α-synuclein mutations can be alleviated by altering the monounsaturated fatty acid equilibrium in neuronal cells. This work supports the notion that metabolic perturbation of lipids may be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.

                Insects adapt their response to stimuli, such as odours, according to their pairing with positive or negative reinforcements, such as sugar or shock. Recent electrophysiological and imaging findings in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> allow detailed examination of the neural mechanisms supporting the acquisition, forgetting, and assimilation of memories. We propose that this data can be explained by the combination of a dopaminergic plasticity rule that supports a variety of synaptic strength change phenomena, and a circuit structure (derived from neuroanatomy) between dopaminergic and output neurons that creates different roles for specific neurons. Computational modelling shows that this circuit allows for rapid memory acquisition, transfer from short term to long term, and exploration/exploitation trade-off. The model can reproduce the observed changes in the activity of each of the identified neurons in conditioning paradigms and can be used for flexible behavioural control.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Synthetic reconstruction of the hunchback promoter specifies the role of Bicoid, Zelda and Hunchback in the dynamics of its transcription</a></h4>

              
                For over 40 years, the Bicoid-<i>hunchback</i> (Bcd-<i>hb</i>) system in the fruit fly embryo has been used as a model to study how positional information in morphogen concentration gradients is robustly translated into step-like responses. A body of quantitative comparisons between theory and experiment have since questioned the initial paradigm that the sharp <i>hb</i> transcription pattern emerges solely from diffusive biochemical interactions between the Bicoid transcription factor and the gene promoter region. Several alternative mechanisms have been proposed, such as additional sources of positional information, positive feedback from Hb proteins or out-of-equilibrium transcription activation. By using the MS2-MCP RNA-tagging system and analysing in real time, the transcription dynamics of synthetic reporters for Bicoid and/or its two partners Zelda and Hunchback, we show that all the early <i>hb</i> expression pattern features and temporal dynamics are compatible with an equilibrium model with a short decay length Bicoid activity gradient as a sole source of positional information. Meanwhile, Bicoid’s partners speed-up the process by different means: Zelda lowers the Bicoid concentration threshold required for transcriptional activation while Hunchback reduces burstiness and increases the polymerase firing rate.

                The ability to control transgene expression, both spatially and temporally, is essential for studying model organisms. In <i>Drosophila</i>, spatial control is primarily provided by the GAL4/UAS system, whilst temporal control relies on a temperature-sensitive GAL80 (which inhibits GAL4) and drug-inducible systems. However, these are not ideal. Shifting temperature can impact on many physiological and behavioural traits, and the current drug-inducible systems are either leaky, toxic, incompatible with existing GAL4-driver lines, or do not generate effective levels of expression. Here, we describe the auxin-inducible gene expression system (AGES). AGES relies on the auxin-dependent degradation of a ubiquitously expressed GAL80, and therefore, is compatible with existing GAL4-driver lines. Water-soluble auxin is added to fly food at a low, non-lethal, concentration, which induces expression comparable to uninhibited GAL4 expression. The system works in both larvae and adults, providing a stringent, non-lethal, cost-effective, and convenient method for temporally controlling GAL4 activity in <i>Drosophila</i>.

                Dynamics of excitable cells and networks depend on the membrane time constant, set by membrane resistance and capacitance. Whereas pharmacological and genetic manipulations of ionic conductances of excitable membranes are routine in electrophysiology, experimental control over capacitance remains a challenge. Here, we present capacitance clamp, an approach that allows electrophysiologists to mimic a modified capacitance in biological neurons via an unconventional application of the dynamic clamp technique. We first demonstrate the feasibility to quantitatively modulate capacitance in a mathematical neuron model and then confirm the functionality of capacitance clamp in in vitro experiments in granule cells of rodent dentate gyrus with up to threefold virtual capacitance changes. Clamping of capacitance thus constitutes a novel technique to probe and decipher mechanisms of neuronal signaling in ways that were so far inaccessible to experimental electrophysiology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Physiopathological changes of ferritin mRNA density and distribution in hippocampal astrocytes in the mouse brain</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes are thought to play a crucial role in brain iron homeostasis. How they accomplish this regulation in vivo remains unclear. In a recent transcriptomic analysis, we showed that polysomal Ftl1 and Fth1 mRNAs, encoding the ferritin light (Ftl) and heavy (Fth) chains that assemble into ferritin, a critical complex for iron storage and reduction, are enriched in perisynaptic astrocytic processes as compared to astrocytic soma. These data suggested that ferritin translation plays a specific role at the perisynaptic astrocytic interface and is tighly regulated by local translation. Here, we used our recently described AstroDot 3D in situ methodology to study the density and localization of ferritin mRNAs in astrocytes in the hippocampus in three different contexts in which local or systemic iron overload has been documented: ageing, the hepcidin knock-out mouse model of hemochromatosis and the APP/PS1dE9 mouse model of Alzheimers disease (AD). Our results showed that in wild type mice, Fth1 mRNA density was higher than Ftl1 and that both mRNAs were mostly distributed in astrocyte fine processes. Ageing and absence of hepcidin caused an increased Fth1/Ftl1 ratio in astrocytes and in the case of ageing, led to a redistribution of Fth1 mRNAs in astrocytic fine processes. In contrast, in AD mice, we observed a lower Fth1/Ftl1 ratio and Fth1 mRNAs became more somatic. Hence, we propose that regulation of ferritin mRNA density and distribution in astrocytes regulates iron homeostasis in physiology and pathophysiology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Irrational choices via a curvilinear representational geometry for value</a></h4>

              
                We make decisions by comparing values, but how is value represented in the brain? Many models assume, if only implicitly, that the representational geometry of value is linear. However, in part due to a historical focus on noisy single neurons, rather than neuronal populations, this hypothesis has not been rigorously tested. Here, we examined the representational geometry of value in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), a part of the brain linked to economic decision-making. We found that values were encoded along a curved manifold in vmPFC. This curvilinear geometry predicted a specific pattern of irrational decision-making: that decision-makers will make worse choices when an irrelevant, decoy option is worse in value, compared to when it is better. Indeed, we observed these irrational choices in behavior. Together, these results not only suggest that the representational geometry of value is nonlinear, but that this nonlinearity could impose bounds on rational decision-making.

                Developing neurons must meet core molecular, cellular, and temporal requirements to ensure the correct formation of synapses, resulting in functional circuits. However, because of the vast diversity in neuronal class and function, it is unclear whether or not all neurons use the same organizational mechanisms to form synaptic connections and achieve functional and morphological maturation. Moreover, it remains unknown if neurons united in a common goal and comprising the same sensory circuit develop on similar timescales and using identical molecular approaches to ensure the formation of the correct number of synapses. To begin to answer these questions, we took advantage of the Drosophila antennal lobe, a model olfactory circuit with remarkable genetic access and synapse-level resolution. Using tissue-specific genetic labeling of active zones, we performed a quantitative analysis of synapse formation in multiple classes of neurons throughout development and adulthood. We found that olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), projection neurons (PNs), and local interneurons (LNs) each have unique time-courses of synaptic development, addition, and refinement, demonstrating that each class follows a distinct developmental program. This raised the possibility that these classes may also have distinct molecular requirements for synapse formation. We genetically altered neuronal activity in each neuronal subtype and observed differing effects on synapse number based on the neuronal class examined. Silencing neuronal activity in ORNs, PNs, and LNs impaired synaptic development but only in ORNs did enhancing neuronal activity influence synapse formation. ORNs and LNs demonstrated similar impairment of synaptic development with enhanced activity of a master kinase, GSK-3{beta}, suggesting that neuronal activity and GSK-3{beta} kinase activity function in a common pathway. ORNs also, however, demonstrated impaired synaptic development with GSK-3{beta} loss-of-function, suggesting additional activity-independent roles in development. Ultimately, our results suggest that the requirements for synaptic development are not uniform across all neuronal classes with considerable diversity existing in both their developmental timeframes and molecular requirements. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms of synaptic development and lay the foundation for future work determining their underlying etiologies.

                The entorhinal cortex (EC) is the main interface between the hippocampus and the neocortex. The EC plays a critical role in learning and memory. We investigated the neuronal representation of behavioral events during operant learning in the hippocampal-entorhinal circuit of head-fixed rats. Both CA1 and lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) neurons develop task-related activities after learning. Among diverse task-related activities, we compared the transient peak activities that represent action and reward and found a distinct difference in the timing of behavioral event representation between CA1 and LEC. CA1 represents action and reward events in close to real-time, whereas both the superficial and deep layers of the LEC showed delayed representation of those events. Our results suggest that subpopulations exist within which CA1 and LEC neurons process the information in a different order from the anatomically defined hippocampal-entorhinal circuit.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">History of previous midlife estradiol treatment permanently alters interactions of brain insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling and hippocampal estrogen synthesis to enhance cognitive aging in a rat model of menopause</a></h4>

              
                Across species, including humans, elevated levels of brain estrogen receptor (ER)  are associated with enhanced cognitive aging even in the absence of circulating estrogens. In rodents, short-term estrogen treatment--such as that commonly used in the menopausal transition--results in long-term increases in levels of ER in the hippocampus, leading to enhanced memory long after termination of estrogen treatment. However, mechanisms by which increased levels of brain ER enhances cognitive aging remain unclear. Here we show that in the hippocampus, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)--which can activate ER via ligand-independent mechanisms--requires concomitant synthesis of brain-derived neuroestrogens to phosphorylate ER via MAPK signaling, ultimately resulting in enhanced memory. In a rat model of menopause involving long-term ovarian hormone deprivation, hippocampal neuroestrogen activity decreases, altering IGF-1 activity and resulting in impaired memory. However, this process is reversed by short-term estradiol treatment. Forty-days of estradiol exposure following ovariectomy results in maintenance of neuroestrogen levels that persist beyond the period of hormone treatment, allowing for continued interactions between IGF-1 and neuroestrogen signaling, elevated levels of hippocampal ER, and ultimately enhanced memory. Collectively, results demonstrate that short-term estradiol use following loss of ovarian function has long-lasting effects on hippocampal function and memory by dynamically regulating cellular mechanisms that promote activity of ER in the absence of circulating estrogens. Translational impacts of these findings suggest lasting cognitive benefits of short-term estrogen use near menopause and highlight the importance of hippocampal ER, independent from the role of circulating estrogens,in regulating memory in aging females.

                Noisy social environments constrain human speech intelligibility in two primary ways: spectro-temporal overlap between signals and noise reduces speech audibility (energetic masking) and noise interferes with processing the informative features of otherwise audible speech (informational masking). To date, informational masking has not been investigated in studies of vocal communication in nonhuman animals, even though their behavioral decisions frequently depend on extracting information from vocalizations in noisy aggregations. In this study of a treefrog, in which females chose mates in noisy breeding choruses, we investigated whether informational masking can disrupt the processing of signal information in the contexts of species recognition and sexual selection. We observed significant reductions in response to the vocalizations of a potential mate when they were broadcast concurrently with other biologically relevant sounds designed to reduce or eliminate energetic masking. These effects were more pronounced when competing sounds were present in a particularly salient frequency range for processing vocalizations. Among responsive subjects, however, performance in signal recognition and discrimination tasks remained largely unchanged. These results confirm that informational masking is a general communication problem among humans and other animals and suggest it may be a crucial yet understudied source of selection shaping the evolution of animal communication.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The mouse claustrum synaptically connects cortical network motifs</a></h4>

              
                Spatially distant areas of cerebral cortex coordinate their activity into networks that are integral to cognitive processing. A common structural motif of cortical networks is co-activated frontal and posterior cortical regions. Knowledge of the neural circuit mechanisms underlying such widespread inter-areal cortical coordination is lacking. Using anesthetized mouse functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we discovered that mouse frontal cortical functional connectivity reflects the common cortical network motif in its functional connectivity to posterior cortices, but also demonstrates significant functional connectivity with the claustrum. Exploring whether the claustrum may synaptically support such network architecture, we used a channelrhodopsin-assisted electrophysiological circuit mapping approach to assess the strength of synaptic connectivity of 35 unique frontal cortico-claustral-cortical connections through 1,050 subtype-identified claustrum projection neurons. We observed significant trans-claustral synaptic connectivity from the anterior cingulate cortex and prelimbic prefrontal cortex back to originating frontal cortical regions as well as to posteriorly-lying visual and parietal association cortices contralaterally. The infralimbic prefrontal cortex possessed significant trans-claustral synaptic connectivity with the posteriorly-lying retrosplenial cortex, but to a far lesser degree with visual and parietal association cortices. These data reveal discrete extended cortical pathways through the claustrum that are positioned to support cortical network motifs central to cognitive control functions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Munc13 supports vesicle fusogenicity after disrupting active zone scaffolds and synaptic vesicle docking</a></h4>

              
                Active zones consist of protein scaffolds that are tightly attached to the presynaptic plasma membrane. They dock and prime synaptic vesicles, couple them to Ca2+ entry, and target neurotransmitter release to postsynaptic receptor domains. Simultaneous RIM+ELKS ablation disrupts these scaffolds, abolishes vesicle docking and removes active zone-targeted Munc13, but some vesicles remain releasable. This enduring vesicular fusogenicity may be Munc13-independent or be mediated by non-active zone-anchored Munc13. We tested its Munc13-dependence by ablating Munc13-1 and Munc13-2 on top of RIM+ELKS in cultured hippocampal neurons. The hextuple knockout synapses lacked docked vesicles, but other ultrastructural features were near-normal despite the strong genetic manipulation. Removing Munc13 in addition to RIM+ELKS further impaired action potential-evoked release by decreasing the remaining pool of releasable vesicles. We conclude that Munc13 can support some fusogenicity without RIM and ELKS, and that presynaptic recruitment of Munc13, even without active zone-anchoring, suffices to generate some fusion-competent vesicles.

                How humans transform sensory information into decisions that steer purposeful behaviour is a central question in psychology and neuroscience that is traditionally investigated during the sampling of external sensations. The decision-making framework of gradual information sampling toward a decision has been proposed also to apply when sampling internal sensory evidence from memory. However, neural evidence for this proposal remains lacking. Here we report that sampling internal visual representations from working memory elicits a scalp-EEG potential associated with gradual evidence accumulation - the Central Parietal Positivity (CPP). Consistent with an evolving decision process, we show how this signal (i) builds up to, and scales with, the time participants require to reach a decision about the cued memory content and (ii) is amplified when having to select (decide) among multiple contents in working memory. These results bring the electrophysiology of decision making into the domain of working memory and suggest that variability in memory-guided behaviour may be driven (at least in part) by variations in the sampling of our inner mental contents.

                Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common debilitating neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by a progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Mutations, gene dosage increase, and single nucleotide polymorphisms in the -synuclein-encoding gene SNCA either cause or increase the risk for PD. However, neither the function of -synuclein in health and disease, nor its role throughout development is fully understood. Here, we introduce DeePhys, a new tool that allows for data-driven functional phenotyping of neuronal cell lines by combining electrophysiological features inferred from high-density microelectrode array (HD-MEA) recordings with a robust machine learning workflow. We apply DeePhys to human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived DA neuron-astrocyte co-cultures harboring the prominent SNCA mutation A53T and an isogenic control line. Moreover, we demonstrate how DeePhys can facilitate the assessment of cellular and network-level electrophysiological features to build functional phenotypes and to evaluate potential treatment interventions. We find that electrophysiological features across all scales proved to be highly specific for the A53T phenotype, enabled to predict the genotype and age of individual cultures with high accuracy, and revealed a mutant-like phenotype after downregulation of -synuclein.

                Mutations enhancing the kinase activity of LRRK2 cause Parkinson's disease (PD) and therapies that reduce LRRK2 kinase activity are being tested in clinical trials. Numerous rare variants of unknown clinical significance have been reported, but how the vast majority impact on LRRK2 function is unknown. Here, we investigate 98 LRRK2 variants linked to PD, including previously described pathogenic mutations, and identify 22 variants that robustly stimulate LRRK2 kinase activity. These include variants within the N-terminal non-catalytic regions [ARM (E334K, A419V), ANK (R767H), LRR (R1067Q, R1325Q)] as well as variants residing within the GTPase domain, predicted to destabilise the ROC:CORB interface [ROC (A1442P, V1447M), CORB (S1761R, L1795F)] and CORB:CORB dimer interface [CORB (R1728H/L)]. Most activating variants decrease LRRK2 biomarker site phosphorylation (pSer910/pSer935), consistent with the notion that the active kinase conformation blocks their phosphorylation. We find that the R1628P variant that has been linked to PD does not stimulate LRRK2 activity. We observe that the impact of variants on kinase activity is best evaluated by deploying a cellular assay of LRRK2-dependent Rab10 substrate phosphorylation at Thr73 compared to an in vitro kinase assay, as only a minority of activating variants enhance the activity of immunoprecipitated LRRK2, comprising the CORB (Y1699C, R1728H, S1761R) and kinase (G2019S, I2020T, T2031S) variants. Twelve variants including some that activated LRRK2, suppressed microtubule association in the presence of a Type 1 kinase inhibitor [ARM (M712V), LRR (R1320S), ROC (A1442P, K1468E, S1508R), CORA (A1589S), CORB (Y1699C, R1728H/L) and WD40 (R2143M, S2350I, G2385R)]. Our findings will aid in understanding the impact of these variants on LRRK2 kinase activation, stimulate work to reveal mechanisms by which variants impact biology, and provide rationale for variant carrier inclusion or exclusion in ongoing and future LRRK2 clinical trials.

                Changes in patterns of activity within the medial prefrontal cortex enable rodents, non-human primates, and humans to update their behavior to adapt to changes in the environment, e.g., during cognitive tasks. Within medial prefrontal cortex, inhibitory neurons expressing parvalbumin are important for updating strategies in a rule shift task. Nevertheless, causal mechanisms through which parvalbumin neurons recruit specific circuits to produce prefrontal network dynamics that switch from maintaining to updating task-related patterns of activity remain unknown. Here we identify a new long-range inhibitory projection from prefrontal parvalbumin neurons to the contralateral cortex that mediates this process. Whereas nonspecifically inhibiting all callosal projections does not prevent mice from learning rule shifts, selectively inhibiting these callosal parvalbumin projections disrupts rule shift learning, desynchronizes gamma-frequency activity that is necessary for learning, and suppresses changes in prefrontal activity patterns that normally accompany rule shifts. Thus, callosal parvalbumin projections switch prefrontal circuits from maintaining to updating behavioral strategies by synchronizing callosal communication and preventing it from inappropriately maintaining outdated neural representations. These findings may explain how deficits in prefrontal parvalbumin neurons and gamma synchrony cause impaired behavioral flexibility in schizophrenia, and identify long-range projections from prefrontal parvalbumin neurons as a key circuit locus for understanding and treating these deficits.

                Work in the last two decades has identified sleep spindles, discrete 'sigma band' oscillations during stage 2 sleep, as a key oscillatory mechanism required for off-line memory consolidation. Although, sleep spindles are known to evolve concomitant with brain maturation and reflect cognitive function across the lifespan, the details of this developmental trajectory are unknown. To address this, we curated a database of sleep electroencephalograms from 772 developmentally normal children to characterize spindles from birth through 18 years. After validating an automated spindle detector against ~20,000 hand-marked spindles across ages, we demonstrate that sleep spindle features follow distinct age-specific patterns in distribution, rate, duration, frequency, estimated refractory period, and inter-hemispheric spindle lag. These data expand our current knowledge of normal physiological brain development and provide a large normative database to detect deviations in sleep spindles to aid discovery, biomarker development, and diagnosis in pediatric neurodevelopmental disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The role of capacity constraints in Convolutional Neural Networks for learning random versus natural data</a></h4>

              
                Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are often described as promising models of human vision, yet they show many differences from human abilities. We focus on a superhuman capacity of top-performing CNNs, namely, their ability to learn very large datasets of random patterns. We verify that human learning on such tasks is extremely limited, even with few stimuli. We argue that the performance difference is due to CNNs' overcapacity and introduce biologically inspired mechanisms to constrain it, while retaining the good test set generalisation to structured images as characteristic of CNNs. We investigate the efficacy of adding noise to hidden units' activations, restricting early convolutional layers with an information bottleneck, and using a bounded activation function. Internal noise was the most potent intervention and the only one which, by itself, could reduce random data performance in the tested models to chance levels. We also investigated whether networks with biologically inspired capacity constraints show improved generalisation to out-of-distribution stimuli, however little benefit was observed. Our results suggest that constraining networks with biologically motivated mechanisms paves the way for closer correspondence between network and human performance, but the few manipulations we have tested are only a small step towards that goal.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">EEG-representational geometries and psychometric distortions in approximate numerical judgment</a></h4>

              
                When judging the average value of sample stimuli (e.g., numbers) people tend to either over- or underweight extreme sample values, depending on task context. In a context of overweighting, recent work has shown that extreme sample values were overly represented also in neural signals, in terms of an anti-compressed geometry of number samples in multivariate electroencephalography (EEG) patterns. Here, we asked whether neural representational geometries may also reflect underweighting of extreme values (i.e., compression) which has been observed behaviorally in a great variety of tasks. We used a simple experimental manipulation (instructions to average a single-stream or to compare dual-streams of samples) to induce compression or anti-compression in behavior when participants judged rapid number sequences. Model-based representational similarity analysis (RSA) replicated the previous finding of neural anti-compression in the dual-stream task, but failed to provide evidence for neural compression in the single-stream task, despite the evidence for compression in behavior. Instead, the results suggested enhanced neural processing of extreme values in either task, regardless of whether extremes were over- or underweighted in subsequent behavioral choice. We further observed more general differences in the neural representation of the sample information between the two tasks. The results suggest enhanced processing of extreme values as the brain's default. Such a default raises new questions about the origin of common psychometric distortions, such as diminishing sensitivity for larger values.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Performance comparison of systemic activity correction in fNIRS for methods with and without short distance channels</a></h4>

              
                Significance: Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a promising tool for neurofeedback (NFB) or brain computer interfaces (BCIs). However, fNIRS signals are typically highly contaminated by systemic activity (SA) artifacts and, if not properly corrected, NFB or BCIs run the risk of being based on noise instead of brain activity. This risk can likely be reduced by correcting for SA, in particular when short distance channels (SDCs) are available. Literature comparing correction methods with and without SDCs is still sparse, specifically comparisons considering single trials are lacking. Aim: This study aimed at comparing the performance of SA correction methods with and without SDCs. Approach: Semi-simulated and real motor task data of healthy elderly individuals were used. Correction methods without SDCs included a simple and a more advanced spatial filter. Correction methods with SDCs included a regression approach considering only the closest SDC and two GLM-based methods, one including all eight SDCs and one using only two a priori selected SDCs as regressors. All methods were compared to data uncorrected for SA and correction performance was assessed with quality measures quantifying signal improvement and spatial specificity at single trial level. Results: All correction methods were found to improve signal quality and to enhance spatial specificity as compared to the uncorrected data. Methods with SDCs usually outperformed methods without SDCs. Correction methods without SDCs tended to overcorrect the data. However, the exact pattern of results and the degree of differences observable between correction methods varied between semi-simulated and real data, and also between quality measures. Conclusions: Overall, results confirmed that both {Delta}[HbO] and {Delta}[HbR] are affected by SA and that correction methods with SDCs outperform methods without SDCs. Nonetheless, improvements in signal quality can also be achieved without SDCs and should therefore be given priority over not correcting for SA.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Unraveling the functional attributes of the language connectome: crucial subnetworks, flexibility and variability.</a></h4>

              
                Language processing is a highly integrative function, intertwining linguistic operations (processing the language code intentionally used for communication) and extra-linguistic processes (e.g., attention monitoring, predictive inference, long-term memory). This synergetic cognitive architecture requires a distributed and specialized neural substrate. Brain systems have mostly been examined at rest. However, task-related functional connectivity provides additional and valuable information about how information is processed when various cognitive states are involved. We gathered thirteen language fMRI tasks in a unique database of one hundred and fifty neurotypical adults (InLang database). The tasks were designed to assess a wide range of linguistic processes and subprocesses. From this database, we applied network theory as a computational tool to model the task-related functional connectome of language (LANG). The organization of this data-driven neurocognitive atlas of language is examined at multiple levels, uncovering its major components (or crucial subnetworks) and its anatomical and functional correlates. Furthermore, we estimate its reconfiguration as a function of linguistic demand (flexibility), or several factors such as age or gender (variability). By accounting for the multifaceted nature of language and modulating factors, this study can contribute to enrich and refine existing neurocognitive models of language. The LANG atlas can also be considered as a reference for comparative or clinical studies, involving a variety of patients and conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Affective enhancement of episodic memory is associated with widespread patterns of intrinsic functional connectivity across the adult lifespan</a></h4>

              
                Subjectively arousing experiences tend to be better remembered than neutral ones. While numerous task-related neuroimaging studies have revealed the neural mechanisms associated with this phenomenon, it remains unclear how variability in the extent to which individuals show superior memory for subjectively arousing stimuli is associated with the intrinsic functional organization of their brains. Here, we addressed this issue using functional magnetic resonance imaging data collected at rest from a sample drawn from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing Neuroscience cohort (N = 269, 18-86 years). Specifically, we performed multi-voxel pattern analysis of intrinsic functional connectivity, an unbiased, data-driven approach to examine whole-brain voxel-wise connectivity patterns. This technique allowed us to reveal the most important features from the high-dimensional, whole-brain connectivity structure without a priori hypotheses about the topography and direction of functional connectivity differences. Behaviorally, both item and associative memory accuracy were enhanced for trials with affectively arousing (positive or negative) stimuli than those with neutral ones. Whole-brain multi-voxel pattern analysis of functional connectivity revealed that the affective enhancement of memory was associated with intrinsic connectivity patterns of spatially distributed brain regions belonging to several functional networks in the cerebral cortex. Post hoc seed-based brain-behavior regression analysis and principal component analysis of the resulting correlation maps showed that these connectivity patterns were in turn primarily characterized by the involvement of heteromodal association (dorsal attention, salience, and default mode) networks as well as select subcortical structures (striatum, thalamus, and cerebellum). Collectively, these findings suggest that the affective enhancement of episodic memory may be characterized as a whole-brain phenomenon, possibly supported by intrinsic functional interactions across several networks and structures in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Frontal Cortex Gates Distractor Stimulus Encoding in Target Sensory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Suppressing behavioral responses to distractor stimuli is a fundamental cognitive process, essential for performing goal-directed tasks. A common framework for the neuronal implementation of distractor suppression is the attenuation of distractor stimuli from early sensory to higher-order processing. However, details of the localization and mechanisms of attenuation are poorly understood. In this study, we trained mice to selectively respond (lick) to whisker deflections from one whisker field and ignore identical deflections from the opposite whisker field. We found that suppression of frontal cortex, aligned to the target stimulus or the distractor stimulus, increases responses to distractors (false alarms). By simultaneously recording spiking activity in the mouse whisker region of primary somatosensory cortex (S1), we found that frontal cortex selectively suppresses the neuronal encoding of distractor stimuli in target-aligned S1. Frontal cortex decorrelates the encoding of target and distractor stimuli in single units, thereby increasing stimulus selectivity across the population of target-aligned S1 neurons. Even before stimulus onset, effects of frontal cortex on S1 were robust and context-dependent, indicating proactive modulation. Overall, our study provides important mechanistic details about the roles of frontal cortex in gating sensory responses in sensory cortex.

                Negative family environment can be harmful for a child's psychological wellbeing through suboptimal child-parent interactions. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is implicated in socioemotional cognition within either child or parent's brain, but how interactions between child and parent brains within this region contribute to children's psychological wellbeing remain unknown. Across two studies examining 395 child-parent dyads, results showed that children from negative family environment experienced more psychopathological symptoms. Dyad-based analyses of movie-watching functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data revealed that children had higher inter-subject correlations in dorsal- and ventral-mPFC with parents than stranger controls, and increased concordance of activity with regions critical for socioemotional skills. Negative family environment reduced inter-subject connectivity of the ventral-MPFC with the hippocampus in child-parent dyads, which further mediated children's internalizing symptoms. The ventral-mPFC and hippocampus exhibited reciprocal activity concordance in child-parent dyads. Our findings suggest child-parent brain-to-brain concordance as a neurobiological mechanism of how family environment affects psychopathological symptoms.

                The majority of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk genes are associated with ASD due to haploinsufficiency, where only one gene copy is functional. Here, using SCN2A haploinsufficiency, a major risk factor for ASD, we show that increasing the expression of the existing functional SCN2A allele with CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) can provide a viable therapeutic approach. We first demonstrate therapeutic potential by showing that restoring Scn2a expression in adolescent heterozygous Scn2a conditional knock-in mice rescues electrophysiological deficits associated with Scn2a haploinsufficiency. Next, using an rAAV-CRISPRa based treatment, we restore electrophysiological deficits in both Scn2a heterozygous mice and human stem-cell-derived neurons. Our results provide a novel therapeutic approach for numerous ASD-associated genes and demonstrate that rescue of Scn2a haploinsufficiency, even at adolescent stages, can ameliorate neurodevelopmental phenotypes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Responses of cortical neurons to intracortical microstimulation in awake primates</a></h4>

              
                Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) is commonly used in many experimental and clinical paradigms; however, its effects on the activation of neurons are still not completely understood. To document the responses of cortical neurons in non-human primates to stimulation, we recorded single unit activity while delivering single-pulse stimulation via Utah arrays implanted in primary motor cortex of three macaque monkeys. Stimuli between 5-50 A delivered to single channels reliably evoked spikes in neurons recorded throughout the array with delays of up to 12 milliseconds. ICMS pulses also induced a period of inhibition lasting up to 150 ms that typically followed the initial excitatory response. Higher current amplitudes led to a greater probability of evoking a spike and extended the duration of inhibition. The likelihood of evoking a spike in a neuron was dependent on the spontaneous firing rate as well as the delay between its most recent spike time and stimulus onset. Repetitive stimulation often modulated both the probability of evoking spikes and the duration of inhibition, although high frequency stimulation in particular was more likely to change both responses. Comparisons between stimuli that evoked a spike and stimuli that did not revealed that the excitatory and inhibitory responses were independent of one another on a trial-by-trial basis; however, their changes over time were frequently positively or negatively correlated. Our results document the complex dynamics of cortical neural responses to electrical stimulation that need to be considered when utilizing ICMS for scientific and clinical applications.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Retinal ganglion cell endowment is correlated with optic tract fiber cross section, not density</a></h4>

              
                There is substantial variation between healthy individuals in the number of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) in the eye, with commensurate variation in the number of axons in the optic tracts. Fixel-based analysis of diffusion MR produces estimates of fiber density (FD) and cross section (FC). Using these fixel measurements along with retinal imaging, we asked if individual differences in the estimated number of RGCs are correlated with individual differences in FD and FC measurements obtained from the optic tracts, and subsequent structures along the cortical visual pathway. We find that RGC endowment is correlated with optic tract FC, but not with FD. RGC cell number had a decreasing relationship with measurements from subsequent regions of the visual system (LGN volume, optic radiation FC/FD, and V1 surface area). However, we also found that the variations in each visual area were correlated with the variations in its immediately adjacent visual structure. We only observed these serial correlations when FC is used as the measure of interest for the optic tract and radiations, but no significant relationship was found when FD represented these white matter structures. From these results, we conclude that the variations in RGC endowment, LGN volume, and V1 surface area are better predicted by the overall cross section of the optic tract and optic radiations relative to the intra-axonal restricted signal component of these white matter pathways. Additionally, the presence of the significant correlations between adjacent, but not distant, anatomical structures suggest that there are multiple, local sources of anatomical variation along the visual pathway.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Different patterns of visual processing for shapes in V1 of mouse and monkey</a></h4>

              
                Recently, mice became a popular research model for the visual system including objects processing. However, while primates use their fovea to inspect objects at high resolution, mice have low visual acuity and lack a foveal region. Thus, how objects are encoded in the visual cortex of mice and whether monkeys and mice use similar neural mechanisms to discriminate between shapes, is unknown. Using voltage sensitive dye imaging, we investigated spatio-temporal patterns of population response in the primary visual cortex (V1) of mice and monkeys to shape contours. Neural responses in mice showed blurred spatial patterns, low correlation to the original stimuli and only subtle spatial differences between the shapes. In contrast, the neural responses in monkey's V1 fovea, showed prominent differences between the shapes at sub-degree resolution with high resemblance to the original shapes, in agreement with a topographic code. Furthermore, the spatial patterns of neural synchronization in monkey's V1 suggested contour binding by synchrony, but not in mice V1. Finally, monkey's V1 responses at larger eccentricities resembled more to those in mice. These results may suggest that to discriminate between shapes, mice rely on neural processing of low-level cues, whereas monkeys rely more on a topographic code.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The role of clearance in neurodegenerative diseases</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, is a systemic neurological disorder associated with the formation of toxic, pathological aggregates of proteins within the brain that lead to severe cognitive decline, and eventually, death. In normal physiological conditions, the brain rids itself of toxic proteins using various clearance mechanisms. The efficacy of brain clearance can be adversely affected by the presence of toxic proteins and is also known to decline with age. Motivated by recent findings, such as the connection between brain cerebrospinal fluid clearance and sleep, we propose a mathematical model coupling the progression of toxic proteins over the brain's structural network and protein clearance. The model is used to study the interplay between clearance in the brain, toxic seeding, brain network connectivity, aging, and progression in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Our findings provide a theoretical framework for the growing body of clinical results showing that clearance plays an important role in the etiology, progression and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The impact of sparsity in low-rank recurrent neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Neural population dynamics are often highly coordinated, allowing task-related computations to be understood as neural trajectories through low-dimensional subspaces. How the network connectivity and input structure give rise to such activity can be investigated with the aid of low-rank recurrent neural networks, a recently-developed class of computational models which offer a rich theoretical framework linking the underlying connectivity structure to emergent low-dimensional dynamics. This framework has so far relied on the assumption of all-to-all connectivity, yet cortical networks are known to be highly sparse. Here we investigate the dynamics of low-rank recurrent networks in which the connections are randomly sparsified, which makes the network connectivity formally full-rank. We first analyse the impact of sparsity on the eigenvalue spectrum of low-rank connectivity matrices, and use this to examine the implications for the dynamics. We find that in the presence of sparsity, the eigenspectra in the complex plane consist of a continuous bulk and isolated outliers, a form analogous to the eigenspectra of connectivity matrices composed of a low-rank and a full-rank random component. This analogy allows us to characterise distinct dynamical regimes of the sparsified low-rank network as a function of key network parameters. Altogether, we find that the low-dimensional dynamics induced by low-rank connectivity structure are preserved even at high levels of sparsity, and can therefore support rich and robust computations even in networks sparsified to a biologically-realistic extent.

                Axonal swellings (AS) are the neuropathological hallmark of axonal injury in several disorders from trauma to neurodegeneration. Current evidence proposes a role of perturbed Ca2+ homeostasis in AS formation, involving impaired axonal transport and focal distension of the axons. Mechanisms of AS formation, in particular moments following injury, however, remain unknown. Here we show that AS form independently from intra-axonal Ca2+ changes, which are required primarily for the persistence of AS in time. We further show that the majority of axonal proteins undergoing de/phosphorylation immediately following injury belong to the cytoskeleton. This correlates with an increase in the distance of the actin/spectrin periodic rings and with microtubule tracks remodeling within AS. Observed cytoskeletal rearrangements support axonal transport without major interruptions. Our results demonstrate that the earliest axonal response to injury consists in physiological adaptations of axonal structure to preserve function rather than in immediate pathological events signaling axonal destruction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Computational analysis of memory consolidation following inhibitory avoidance (IA) training in adult and infant rats: critical roles of CaMKIIα and MeCP2</a></h4>

              
                Key features of long-term memory (LTM), such as its stability and persistence, are acquired during processes collectively referred to as consolidation. The dynamics of biological changes during consolidation are complex. In adult rodents, consolidation exhibits distinct periods during which the engram is more or less resistant to disruption. Moreover, the ability to consolidate memories differs during developmental periods. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying consolidation are poorly understood, the initial stages rely on interacting signaling pathways that regulate gene expression, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) dependent feedback loops. We investigated the ways in which these pathways may contribute to developmental and dynamical features of consolidation. A computational model of molecular processes underlying consolidation following inhibitory avoidance (IA) training in rats was developed. Differential equations described the actions of CaMKII, multiple feedback loops regulating BDNF expression, and several transcription factors including methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), and SIN3 transcription regulator family member A (Sin3a). This model provides novel explanations for the (apparent) rapid forgetting of infantile memory and the temporal progression of memory consolidation in adults. Simulations predict that dual effects of MeCP2 on the expression of bdnf, and interaction between MeCP2 and CaMKII, play critical roles in the rapid forgetting of infantile memory and the progress of memory resistance to disruptions. These insights suggest new potential targets of therapy for memory impairment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A recurrent network architecture explains tectal activity dynamics and experience-dependent behaviour</a></h4>

              
                The ongoing activity of neuronal populations represents an internal brain state that influences how sensory information is processed to control behaviour. Conversely, external sensory inputs perturb network dynamics, resulting in lasting effects that persist beyond the duration of the stimulus. However, the relationship between these dynamics and circuit architecture and their impact on sensory processing, cognition and behaviour are poorly understood. By combining cellular-resolution calcium imaging with mechanistic network modelling, we aimed to infer the spatial and temporal network interactions in the zebrafish optic tectum that shape its ongoing activity and state-dependent responses to visual input. We showed that a simple recurrent network architecture, wherein tectal dynamics are dominated by fast, short range, excitation countered by long-lasting, activity-dependent suppression, was sufficient to explain multiple facets of population activity including intermittent bursting, trial-to-trial sensory response variability and spatially-selective response adaptation. Moreover, these dynamics also predicted behavioural trends such as selective habituation of visually evoked prey-catching responses. Overall, we demonstrate that a mechanistic circuit model, built upon a uniform recurrent connectivity motif, can estimate the incidental state of a dynamic neural network and account for experience-dependent effects on sensory encoding and visually guided behaviour.

	<p>The Hubel&amp;amp;ndash;Wiesel (HW) model is a classical neurobiological model for explaining the orientation selectivity of cortical cells. However, the HW model still has not been fully proved physiologically, and there are few concise but efficient systems to quantify and simulate the HW model and can be used for object orientation detection applications. To realize a straightforward and efficient quantitive method and validate the HW model&amp;amp;rsquo;s reasonability and practicality, we use McCulloch-Pitts (MP) neuron model to simulate simple cells and complex cells and implement an artificial visual system (AVS) for two-dimensional object orientation detection. First, we realize four types of simple cells that are only responsible for detecting a specific orientation angle locally. Complex cells are realized with the sum function. Every local orientation information of an object is collected by simple cells and subsequently converged to the corresponding same type complex cells for computing global activation degree. Finally, the global orientation is obtained according to the activation degree of each type of complex cell. Based on this scheme, an AVS for global orientation detection is constructed. We conducted computer simulations to prove the feasibility and effectiveness of our scheme and the AVS. Computer simulations show that the mechanism-based AVS can make accurate orientation discrimination and shows striking biological similarities with the natural visual system, which indirectly proves the rationality of the Hubel&amp;amp;ndash;Wiesel model. Furthermore, compared with traditional CNN, we find that our AVS beats CNN on orientation detection tasks in identification accuracy, noise resistance, computation and learning cost, hardware implementation, and reasonability.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">SPOROS: A pipeline to analyze DISE/6mer seed toxicity</a></h4>

microRNAs (miRNAs) are (18-22nt long) noncoding short (s)RNAs that suppress gene expression by targeting the 3’ untranslated region of target mRNAs. This occurs through the seed sequence located in position 2-7/8 of the miRNA guide strand, once it is loaded into the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC). G-rich 6mer seed sequences can kill cells by targeting C-rich 6mer seed matches located in genes that are critical for cell survival. This results in induction of Death Induced by Survival gene Elimination (DISE), through a mechanism we have called 6mer seed toxicity. miRNAs are often quantified in cells by aligning the reads from small (sm)RNA sequencing to the genome. However, the analysis of any smRNA Seq data set for predicted 6mer seed toxicity requires an alternative workflow, solely based on the exact position 2–7 of any short (s)RNA that can enter the RISC. Therefore, we developed SPOROS, a semi-automated pipeline that produces multiple useful outputs to predict and compare 6mer seed toxicity of cellular sRNAs, regardless of their nature, between different samples. We provide two examples to illustrate the capabilities of SPOROS: Example one involves the analysis of RISC-bound sRNAs in a cancer cell line (either wild-type or two mutant lines unable to produce most miRNAs). Example two is based on a publicly available smRNA Seq data set from postmortem brains (either from normal or Alzheimer’s patients). Our methods (found at https://github.com/ebartom/SPOROS and at Code Ocean: https://doi.org/10.24433/CO.1732496.v1) are designed to be used to analyze a variety of smRNA Seq data in various normal and disease settings.

When responding to infectious disease outbreaks, rapid and accurate estimation of the epidemic trajectory is critical. However, two common data collection problems affect the reliability of the epidemiological data in real time: missing information on the time of first symptoms, and retrospective revision of historical information, including right censoring. Here, we propose an approach to construct epidemic curves in near real time that addresses these two challenges by 1) imputation of dates of symptom onset for reported cases using a dynamically-estimated “backward” reporting delay conditional distribution, and 2) adjustment for right censoring using the <i>NobBS</i> software package to nowcast cases by date of symptom onset. This process allows us to obtain an approximation of the time-varying reproduction number (<i>R</i><sub>t</sub>) in real time. We apply this approach to characterize the early SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in two Spanish regions between March and April 2020. We evaluate how these real-time estimates compare with more complete epidemiological data that became available later. We explore the impact of the different assumptions on the estimates, and compare our estimates with those obtained from commonly used surveillance approaches. Our framework can help improve accuracy, quantify uncertainty, and evaluate frequently unstated assumptions when recovering the epidemic curves from limited data obtained from public health systems in other locations.

                <p>by Grant R. Howard, Tyler A. Jost, Thomas E. Yankeelov, Amy Brock</p>

While acquired chemoresistance is recognized as a key challenge to treating many types of cancer, the dynamics with which drug sensitivity changes after exposure are poorly characterized. Most chemotherapeutic regimens call for repeated dosing at regular intervals, and if drug sensitivity changes on a similar time scale then the treatment interval could be optimized to improve treatment performance. Theoretical work suggests that such optimal schedules exist, but experimental confirmation has been obstructed by the difficulty of deconvolving the simultaneous processes of death, adaptation, and regrowth taking place in cancer cell populations. Here we present a method of optimizing drug schedules in vitro through iterative application of experimentally calibrated models, and demonstrate its ability to characterize dynamic changes in sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic doxorubicin in three breast cancer cell lines subjected to treatment schedules varying in concentration, interval between pulse treatments, and number of sequential pulse treatments. Cell populations are monitored longitudinally through automated imaging for 600–800 hours, and this data is used to calibrate a family of cancer growth models, each consisting of a system of ordinary differential equations, derived from the bi-exponential model which characterizes resistant and sensitive subpopulations. We identify a model incorporating both a period of growth arrest in surviving cells and a delay in the death of chemosensitive cells which outperforms the original bi-exponential growth model in Akaike Information Criterion based model selection, and use the calibrated model to quantify the performance of each drug schedule. We find that the inter-treatment interval is a key variable in determining the performance of sequential dosing schedules and identify an optimal retreatment time for each cell line which extends regrowth time by 40%-239%, demonstrating that the time scale of changes in chemosensitivity following doxorubicin exposure allows optimization of drug scheduling by varying this inter-treatment interval.

Brain functions rely on the communication network formed by axonal fibers. However, the number of axons connecting different brain regions is unknown. A study in PLoS Biology addresses this question and finds that most areas of the human cerebral cortex are linked by an astoundingly small number of fibers.

Activity patterns and complex functions of the brain rely on the characteristic communication network formed by axonal fiber networks, but how many axons actually connect different brain regions? This Primer explores a study in PLOS Biology which finds that most areas of the human cerebral cortex are linked by an astoundingly small number of fibers.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Folliculin promotes substrate-selective mTORC1 activity by activating RagC to recruit TFE3</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kristina Li, Shogo Wada, Bridget S. Gosis, Chelsea Thorsheim, Paige Loose, Zolt Arany</p>

Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex I (mTORC1) is central to cellular metabolic regulation. mTORC1 phosphorylates a myriad of substrates, but how different substrate specificity is conferred on mTORC1 by different conditions remains poorly defined. Here, we show how loss of the mTORC1 regulator folliculin (FLCN) renders mTORC1 specifically incompetent to phosphorylate TFE3, a master regulator of lysosome biogenesis, without affecting phosphorylation of other canonical mTORC1 substrates, such as S6 kinase. FLCN is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for RagC, a component of the mTORC1 amino acid (AA) sensing pathway, and we show that active RagC is necessary and sufficient to recruit TFE3 onto the lysosomal surface, allowing subsequent phosphorylation of TFE3 by mTORC1. Active mutants of RagC, but not of RagA, rescue both phosphorylation and lysosomal recruitment of TFE3 in the absence of FLCN. These data thus advance the paradigm that mTORC1 substrate specificity is in part conferred by direct recruitment of substrates to the subcellular compartments where mTORC1 resides and identify potential targets for specific modulation of specific branches of the mTOR pathway.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Variable susceptibility of intestinal organoid–derived monolayers to SARS-CoV-2 infection</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kyung Ku Jang, Maria E. Kaczmarek, Simone Dallari, Ying-Han Chen, Takuya Tada, Jordan Axelrad, Nathaniel R. Landau, Kenneth A. Stapleford, Ken Cadwell</p>

Gastrointestinal effects associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) are highly variable for reasons that are not understood. In this study, we used intestinal organoid–derived cultures differentiated from primary human specimens as a model to examine interindividual variability. Infection of intestinal organoids derived from different donors with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) resulted in orders of magnitude differences in virus replication in small intestinal and colonic organoid–derived monolayers. Susceptibility to infection correlated with angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (<i>ACE2</i>) expression level and was independent of donor demographic or clinical features. <i>ACE2</i> transcript levels in cell culture matched the amount of ACE2 in primary tissue, indicating that this feature of the intestinal epithelium is retained in the organoids. Longitudinal transcriptomics of organoid-derived monolayers identified a delayed yet robust interferon signature, the magnitude of which corresponded to the degree of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, virus with the Omicron variant spike (S) protein infected the organoids with the highest infectivity, suggesting increased tropism of the virus for intestinal tissue. These results suggest that heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 replication in intestinal tissues results from differences in ACE2 levels, which may underlie variable patient outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Identification of substrates of palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1 highlights roles of depalmitoylation in disulfide bond formation and synaptic function</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Erica L. Gorenberg, Sofia Massaro Tieze, Betül Yücel, Helen R. Zhao, Vicky Chou, Gregory S. Wirak, Susumu Tomita, TuKiet T. Lam, Sreeganga S. Chandra</p>

Loss-of-function mutations in the depalmitoylating enzyme palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1) cause neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), a devastating neurodegenerative disease. The substrates of PPT1 are largely undescribed, posing a limitation on molecular dissection of disease mechanisms and therapeutic development. Here, we provide a resource identifying >100 novel PPT1 substrates. We utilized Acyl Resin-Assisted Capture (Acyl RAC) and mass spectrometry to identify proteins with increased in vivo palmitoylation in PPT1 knockout (KO) mouse brains. We then validated putative substrates through direct depalmitoylation with recombinant PPT1. This stringent screen elucidated diverse PPT1 substrates at the synapse, including channels and transporters, G-protein–associated molecules, endo/exocytic components, synaptic adhesion molecules, and mitochondrial proteins. Cysteine depalmitoylation sites in transmembrane PPT1 substrates frequently participate in disulfide bonds in the mature protein. We confirmed that depalmitoylation plays a role in disulfide bond formation in a tertiary screen analyzing posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Collectively, these data highlight the role of PPT1 in mediating synapse functions, implicate molecular pathways in the etiology of NCL and other neurodegenerative diseases, and advance our basic understanding of the purpose of depalmitoylation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The effect of apathy and compulsivity on planning and stopping in sequential decision-making</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jacqueline Scholl, Hailey A. Trier, Matthew F. S. Rushworth, Nils Kolling</p>

Real-life decision-making often comprises sequences of successive decisions about whether to take opportunities as they are encountered or keep searching for better ones instead. We investigated individual differences related to such sequential decision-making and link them especially to apathy and compulsivity in a large online sample (discovery sample: <i>n</i> = 449 and confirmation sample: <i>n</i> = 756). Our cognitive model revealed distinct changes in the way participants evaluated their environments and planned their own future behaviour. Apathy was linked to decision inertia, i.e., automatically persisting with a sequence of searches for longer than appropriate given the value of searching. Thus, despite being less motivated, they did not avoid the effort associated with longer searches. In contrast, compulsivity was linked to self-reported insensitivity to the cost of continuing with a sequence of searches. The objective measures of behavioural cost insensitivity were clearly linked to compulsivity only in the discovery sample. While the confirmation sample showed a similar effect, it did not reach significance. Nevertheless, in both samples, participants reported awareness of such bias (experienced as “overchasing”). In addition, this awareness made them report preemptively avoiding situations related to the bias. However, we found no evidence of them actually preempting more in the task, which might mean a misalignment of their metacognitive beliefs or that our behavioural measures were incomplete. In summary, individual variation in distinct, fundamental aspects of sequential decision-making can be linked to variation in 2 measures of behavioural traits associated with psychological illness in the normal population.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Caffeine Consumption and Dementia: Are Lewy Bodies the Link?</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to examine the association between caffeine intake and cognitive impairment. Caffeine-neuropathology correlations and interactions with lifestyle and genetic factors impacting caffeine metabolism and response were also tested.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 888 participants aged 59+ years from the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) and 303,887 participants aged 55+ years from the UK Biobank (UKB). MAP participants took part in annual cognitive testing. Diagnosis of dementia was based on clinical neurological examination and standardized criteria. A subset provided postmortem tissue for neuropathologic evaluation for common age-related diseases (eg, Alzheimer's disease [AD], Lewy bodies, and vascular). For UKB, dementia was determined by linked hospital and death records. Self-reported caffeine intake was estimated using food-frequency questionnaires in both cohorts. Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR), regression, and mixed models were used to examine associations of caffeine intake with incident dementia, cognitive decline, and neuropathology.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In MAP, compared to ≤100 mg/day, caffeine intake &gt;100 mg/day was associated with a significantly higher HR (95% confidence interval [CI]) of all-cause (HR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.03–1.76) and AD (HR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.07–1.85) dementia. Caffeine intake was not associated with cognitive decline. In UKB, compared to ≤100 mg/day, the HRs (95% CI) of all-cause dementia for consuming 100 ≤ 200, 200 ≤ 300, 300 ≤ 400, and &gt; 400 mg/day were 0.83 (95% CI = 0.72–0.94), 0.74 (95% CI = 0.64–0.85), 0.74 (95% CI = 0.64–0.85), and 0.92 (95% CI = 0.79–1.08), respectively. Similar results were observed for Alzheimer's dementia. In MAP, caffeine intake was inversely associated with postmortem Lewy bodies but no other age-related pathologies. Caffeine intake &gt;100 mg/day was associated with lower neocortical type Lewy bodies (odds ratio (95%CI): 0.40 (95% CI = 0.21–0.75).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Caffeine intake was inconsistently associated with clinical dementia; potentially explained by cohort differences in underlying dementia etiology. Lewy bodies may link caffeine to lower risk in some persons. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) patients suffer from a cognitive and memory dysfunction. Because the hippocampus plays a key role in both cognition and memory, we tested for volumetric differences in the subfields of the hippocampus in ME/CFS. We estimated hippocampal subfield volumes for 25 ME/CFS patients who met Fukuda criteria only (ME/CFS<sub>Fukuda</sub>), 18 ME/CFS patients who met the stricter ICC criteria (ME/CFS<sub>ICC</sub>), and 25 healthy controls (HC). Group comparisons with HC detected extensive differences in subfield volumes in ME/CFS<sub>ICC</sub> but not in ME/CFS<sub>Fukuda</sub>. ME/CFS<sub>ICC</sub> patients had significantly <i>larger</i> volume in the left subiculum head (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), left presubiculum head (<i>p</i> = 0.0020), and left fimbria (<i>p</i> = 0.004). Correlations of hippocampus subfield volumes with clinical measures were stronger in ME/CFS<sub>ICC</sub> than in ME/CFS<sub>Fukuda</sub> patients. In ME/CFS<sub>Fukuda</sub> patients, we detected positive correlations between fatigue and hippocampus subfield volumes and a negative correlation between sleep disturbance score and the right CA1 body volume. In ME/CFS<sub>ICC</sub> patients, we detected a strong negative relationship between fatigue and left hippocampus tail volume. Strong negative relationships were also detected between pain and SF36 physical scores and two hippocampal subfield volumes (left: GC-ML-DG head and CA4 head). Our study demonstrated that volumetric differences in hippocampal subfields have strong statistical inference for patients meeting the ME/CFS<sub>ICC</sub> case definition and confirms hippocampal involvement in the cognitive and memory problems of ME/CFS<sub>ICC</sub> patients.</p>

<p>Activating subpopulations of <i>parafascicular</i> (Pf) neurons selected on the basis of their projections to different basal ganglia components shows that the activity of the <i>substantia nigra pars reticulata</i> (SNr) can be shaped by convergent information processed through direct thalamonigral (1), trans-subthalamic (2), and trans-striatal direct (3) and indirect (4) subcircuits.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Accumulating evidence implicates the <i>parafascicular nucleus</i> of the thalamus (Pf) in basal ganglia (BG)-related functions and pathologies. Despite Pf connectivity with all BG components, most attention is focused on the thalamostriatal system and an integrated view of thalamic information processing in this network is still lacking. Here, we addressed this question by recording the responses elicited by Pf activation in single neurons of the <i>substantia nigra pars reticulata</i> (SNr), the main BG output structure in rodents, in anesthetized mice. We performed optogenetic activation of Pf neurons innervating the striatum, the subthalamic nucleus (STN), or the SNr using virally mediated transcellular delivery of Cre from injection in either target in Rosa26-LoxP-stop-ChR2-EYFP mice to drive channelrhodopsin expression. Photoactivation of Pf neurons connecting the striatum evoked an inhibition often followed by an excitation, likely resulting from the activation of the trans-striatal direct and indirect pathways, respectively. Photoactivation of Pf neurons connecting the SNr or the STN triggered one or two early excitations, suggesting partial functional overlap of trans-subthalamic and direct thalamonigral projections. Excitations were followed in about half of the cases by an inhibition that might reflect recruitment of intranigral inhibitory loops. Finally, global Pf stimulation, electrical or optogenetic, elicited similar complex responses comprising up to four components: one or two short-latency excitations, an inhibition, and a late excitation. These data provide evidence for functional connections between the Pf and different BG components and for convergence of the information processed through these pathways in single SNr neurons, stressing their importance in regulating BG outflow.</p>

                Wandelt et al. study how signals from the human supramarginal gyrus, ventral premotor cortex, and somatosensory cortex can be used for brain-machine interfaces. The supramarginal gyrus and ventral premotor cortex encode grasp motor imagery, and the supramarginal gyrus encodes vocalized speech, indicating new target regions for grasp and speech BMI applications.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Digital restoration of the pectoral girdles of two Early Cretaceous birds, and implications for early flight evolution</a></h4>

              
                The morphology of the pectoral girdle, the skeletal structure connecting the wing to the body, is a key determinant of flight capability, but in some respects is poorly known among stem birds. Here, the pectoral girdles of the Early Cretaceous birds <i>Sapeornis</i> and <i>Piscivorenantiornis</i> are reconstructed for the first time based on computed tomography and three-dimensional visualization, revealing key morphological details that are important for our understanding of early flight evolution. <i>Sapeornis</i> exhibits a double articulation system (widely present in non-enantiornithine pennaraptoran theropods including crown birds) which involves, alongside the main scapula-coracoid joint, a small subsidiary joint, though variation exists with respect to the shape and size of the main and subsidiary articular contacts in non-enantiornithine pennaraptorans. This double articulation system contrasts with <i>Piscivorenantiornis</i> in which a spatially restricted scapula-coracoid joint formed by a single set of opposing articular surfaces, a feature also present in other members of Enantiornithines, a major clade of stem birds known only from the Cretaceous. The unique single articulation system may reflect correspondingly unique flight behavior in enantiornithine birds, but this hypothesis requires further investigation from a functional perspective. Our renderings indicate that both <i>Sapeornis</i> and <i>Piscivorenantiornis</i> had a partially closed triosseal canal (a passage for muscle tendon that plays a key role in raising the wing), and our study suggests that this type of triosseal canal occurred in all known non-euornithine birds except <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, representing a transitional stage in flight apparatus evolution before the appearance of a fully closed bony triosseal canal as in modern birds. Our study reveals additional lineage-specific variations in pectoral girdle anatomy, as well as significant modification of the pectoral girdle along the line to crown birds. These modifications produced diverse pectoral girdle morphologies among Mesozoic birds, which allowed a commensurate range of capability levels and styles to emerge during the early evolution of flight.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dedicated chaperones coordinate co-translational regulation of ribosomal protein production with ribosome assembly to preserve proteostasis</a></h4>

              
                The biogenesis of eukaryotic ribosomes involves the ordered assembly of around 80 ribosomal proteins. Supplying equimolar amounts of assembly-competent ribosomal proteins is complicated by their aggregation propensity and the spatial separation of their location of synthesis and pre-ribosome incorporation. Recent evidence has highlighted that dedicated chaperones protect individual, unassembled ribosomal proteins on their path to the pre-ribosomal assembly site. Here, we show that the co-translational recognition of Rpl3 and Rpl4 by their respective dedicated chaperone, Rrb1 or Acl4, reduces the degradation of the encoding <i>RPL3</i> and <i>RPL4</i> mRNAs in the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. In both cases, negative regulation of mRNA levels occurs when the availability of the dedicated chaperone is limited and the nascent ribosomal protein is instead accessible to a regulatory machinery consisting of the nascent-polypeptide-associated complex and the Caf130-associated Ccr4-Not complex. Notably, deregulated expression of Rpl3 and Rpl4 leads to their massive aggregation and a perturbation of overall proteostasis in cells lacking the E3 ubiquitin ligase Tom1. Taken together, we have uncovered an unprecedented regulatory mechanism that adjusts the de novo synthesis of Rpl3 and Rpl4 to their actual consumption during ribosome assembly and, thereby, protects cells from the potentially detrimental effects of their surplus production.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fear extinction is regulated by long noncoding RNA activity at the synapse</a></h4>

              
                Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) represent a multidimensional class of regulatory molecules involved in many aspects of brain function. Emerging evidence indicates that lncRNAs are expressed at the synapse; however, a direct role for their activity in this subcellular compartment in memory formation has yet to be demonstrated. Using lncRNA capture-seq on synaptosomes, we identified a significant number of lncRNAs that accumulate at synapses within the infralimbic prefrontal cortex of adult male C57/Bl6 mice. Among these is a splice variant related to the stress-associated lncRNA, Gas5. RNA immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry and single molecule imaging revealed that this Gas5 isoform, in association with the RNA binding proteins G3bp2 and Caprin1, regulates the activity-dependent trafficking and clustering of RNA granules in dendrites. In addition, we found that cell-type-specific, state-dependent, and synapse-specific knockdown of the Gas5 variant led to impaired fear extinction memory. These findings identify a new mechanism of fear extinction that involves the dynamic interaction between local lncRNA activity and the coordination of RNA condensates in the synaptic compartment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hierarchical architecture of dopaminergic circuits enables second-order conditioning in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Dopaminergic neurons with distinct projection patterns and physiological properties compose memory subsystems in a brain. However, it is poorly understood whether or how they interact during complex learning. Here, we identify a feedforward circuit formed between dopamine subsystems and show that it is essential for second-order conditioning, an ethologically important form of higher-order associative learning. The Drosophila mushroom body comprises a series of dopaminergic compartments, each of which exhibits distinct memory dynamics. We find that a slow and stable memory compartment can serve as an effective <teacher> by instructing other faster and transient memory compartments via a single key interneuron, which we identify by connectome analysis and neurotransmitter prediction. This excitatory interneuron acquires enhanced response to reward-predicting odor after first-order conditioning and, upon activation, evokes dopamine release in the <student> compartments. These hierarchical connections between dopamine subsystems explain distinct properties of first- and second-order memory long known by behavioral psychologists.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mapping whole-brain projections of anatomically defined prefrontal neurons using combined 3D convolution networks</a></h4>

              
                Long-range axonal projections provide the foundation for functional connectivity between brain regions and are critical in the modulation of behavior. Descending projections from medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to various target regions regulate critical behavioral functions including decision making, social behavior and mood. While specific mPFC projections have distinct behavioral roles, individual mPFC projection neurons can also innervate multiple target regions. Yet how mPFC projection neurons divide their axons across the brain is poorly understood. In this study, we mapped the axon collaterals of mPFC neurons that project to nucleus accumbens (NAc), ventral tegmental area (VTA), or contralateral mPFC (cmPFC) in mice. We used tissue clearing and light sheet fluorescence microscopy to visualize the 3-D structure of axonal arbors across the intact brain. While machine learning can automate analysis of axons in images of cleared tissue, it is challenging to train a model that generalizes to all axonal structures because the appearance of axons varies by target region. In this study, we present DeepTraCE (Deep learning-based image Tracing with Combined-model Enhancement), a new strategy for axon segmentation and quantification in images of cleared tissue. DeepTraCE is based on the deep-learning framework TRAILMAP; it achieves highly accurate axon detection by combining multiple machine learning models that are each applied to different brain regions. Using DeepTraCE, we find that cmPFC, NAc, and VTA-projecting mPFC neurons represent largely separable classes with unique axon collaterals in cortical, olfactory, and thalamic regions, respectively.

                Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-containing neurons of the dopamine (DA) cell group A13 are well-positioned to impact known dopamine-related functions since their descending projections innervate target regions that regulate vigilance, sensorimotor integration and execution. Despite this known connectivity little is known regarding the functionality of A13-DA circuits. Using TH-specific loss-of-function methodology and techniques to monitor population activity in transgenic rats in vivo we investigated the contribution of A13-DA neurons in reward and movement-related actions. Our work demonstrates a role for A13-DA neurons in grasping and handling of objects that is independent from reward. A13-DA neurons respond strongly when animals grab and manipulate food items while their inactivation or degeneration prevents animals from successfully doing so - a deficit partially attributed to a reduction in grip strength. In contrast, there was no relation between A13-DA activity and food-seeking behavior when animals were tested on a reward-based task that did not include a reaching/grasping response. Moreover, motivation for food was unaffected as goal-directed behavior for food items was in general intact following A13 neuronal inactivation/degeneration. These results demonstrate a functional role for A13-DA neurons in prehensile actions that are uncoupled from reward and as such position A13-DA neurons into the functional framework regarding centrally-located DA populations and their ability to coordinate movement.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fear memory in humans is consolidated over time independent of sleep</a></h4>

              
                Background: Many pathological fear memories rely on processes of fear conditioning upon an aversive event. These fear memories may continue to change after acquisition, but the factors contributing to these changes are not well understood. Sleep is known to consolidate, strengthen and change newly acquired declarative and procedural memories. However, evidence on the role of time and sleep in the consolidation of fear memories is inconclusive. Here, we used highly sensitive electrophysiological measures to examine the development of fear-conditioned responses over time and sleep in humans. Methods: We assessed event-related brain potentials (ERP) in 18 healthy young individuals during fear conditioning before and after a 2-hour afternoon nap or a corresponding wake interval in a counterbalanced within-subject design. The procedure involved pairing a neutral tone (CS+) with a highly unpleasant sound (US). As a control, another neutral tone (CS-) was paired with a neutral sound. Fear responses were examined before the interval during a habituation phase and an acquisition phase as well as after the interval during an extinction phase and a re-acquisition phase. Results: Differential fear conditioning during acquisition was evidenced by a more negative slow ERP component preceding the CS+ compared to the CS- (stimulus-preceding negativity). This differential fear response was even stronger after the interval during re-acquisition compared to initial acquisition, but this effect was similarly pronounced after sleep and wakefulness. Conclusions: These findings suggest that fear memories are consolidated over time, with this effect being independent of intervening sleep.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hypercaloric diet triggers transient molecular rearrangements of astrocytes selectively in the arcuate nucleus</a></h4>

              
                Hypothalamic astrocytes are particularly affected by energy-dense food consumption. How the anatomical location of these glial cells and their spatial molecular distribution in the arcuate nu-cleus of the hypothalamus (ARC) determine the cellular response to a high caloric diet remains unclear. In this study, we investigated their distinctive molecular responses following the expo-sure to a high-fat high-sugar (HFHS) diet, specifically in the ARC. Using RNA sequencing and proteomics, we showed that astrocytes have a distinct transcriptomic and proteomic profile de-pendent on their anatomical location, with a major proteomic reprogramming in hypothalamic astrocytes. By ARC single-cell sequencing, we observed that a HFHS diet dictates time- and cell- specific transcriptomic responses, revealing that astrocytes have the most distinct regulatory pat-tern compared to other cell types. Lastly, we topographically and molecularly characterized as-trocytes expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein and/or aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family mem-ber L1 in the ARC, of which the abundance was significantly increased, as well as the alteration in their spatial and molecular profiles, with a HFHS diet. Together, our results provide a detailed multi-omics view on the spatial and temporal changes of astrocytes particularly in the ARC dur-ing different time points of adaptation to a high caloric diet.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neighbouring modifications interfere with the detection of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein at Serine 129: Revisiting the specificity of pS129 antibodies</a></h4>

              
                Alpha-synuclein (aSyn) within Lewy bodies, Lewy neurites, and other pathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease and synucleinopathies have consistently been shown to accumulate in aggregated and phosphorylated forms of the protein, predominantly at Serine 129 (S129). Antibodies against phosphorylated S129 (pS129) have emerged as the primary tools to investigate, monitor, and quantify aSyn pathology in the brain and peripheral tissues. However, most of the antibodies and immunoassays aimed at detecting pS129-aSyn were developed based on the assumption that neighbouring post-translational modifications (PTMs) either do not co-occur with pS129 or do not influence its detection. Herein, we demonstrate that the co-occurrence of multiple pathology-associated C-terminal PTMs (e.g., phosphorylation at Tyrosine 125 or truncation at residue 133 or 135) differentially influences the detection of pS129-aSyn species by pS129-aSyn antibodies. These observations prompted us to systematically reassess the specificity of the most commonly used pS129 antibodies against monomeric and aggregated forms of pS129-aSyn in mouse brain slices, primary neurons, mammalian cells and seeding models of aSyn pathology formation. We identified two antibodies that are insensitive to pS129 neighbouring PTMs. However, consistent with previous reports, most pS129 antibodies showed cross-reactivity towards other proteins and often detected low and high molecular weight bands in aSyn knock-out samples that could be easily mistaken for monomeric or High Molecular Weight aggregates of aSyn. Our observations suggest that the pS129 antibodies do not capture the biochemical and morphological diversity of aSyn pathology. They also underscore the need for more specific pS129 antibodies, more thorough characterization and validation of existing antibodies, and the use of the appropriate protein standards and controls in future studies.

	<p>Dopamine transporter (DAT) is involved in dopamine (DA) reuptake in presynaptic terminals. Deletion of DAT results in a hyperdopaminergic KO-rat phenotype. To conduct our studies in heterozygous DAT rats, several pedigree lines were created, with known derivation of the allele (i.e., maternal or paternal). Our purpose was to elucidate the role of parental origin rather than maternal care, assessing if maternal maltreatments generated sequelae in female offspring. In the first experiment, female rats and their pups were observed during postnatal lactation. Control dams were WT and heterozygous ones were MAT (but K-MAT, with previous experience of early maltreatment by their KO adoptive dams). WT dams were highly attracted to their offspring (predictably, they spent a lot of time licking their pups); in contrast, K-MAT dams showed strangely comparable levels of caring for their pups and exploring the environment. Subsequently, peculiar features of the circadian cycle were found in adolescent rats with different epigenotypes (WT, MUX = offspring of MAT father, MIK = offspring of K-MAT dam). The MIK epigenotype produced locomotor hyperactivity also during resting hours, well above typical values. The MUX epigenotype, on the other hand, was less active and presented a depression-like profile. This study is unique: maltreatment was generated in a spontaneous way from a DAT-KO mother to offspring. We highlight how future studies will address separate contributions by genotype and upbringing. In conclusion, paternal-allele asset generates sequelae diametrically opposed to the inheritance of early maternal trauma.</p>

	<p>Virtual Reality (VR) emerges as a promising technology capable of creating different scenarios in which the body, environment, and brain are closely related, proving enhancements in the diagnosis and treatment of several spatial memory deficits. In recent years, human spatial navigation has increasingly been studied in interactive virtual environments. However, navigational tasks are still not completely adapted in immersive 3D VR systems. We stipulate that an immersive Radial Arm Maze (RAM) is an excellent instrument, allowing the participants to be physically active within the maze exactly as in the walking RAM version in reality modality. RAM is a behavioral ecological task that allows the analyses of different facets of spatial memory, distinguishing declarative components from procedural ones. In addition to describing the characteristics of RAM, we will also analyze studies in which RAM has been used in virtual modality to provide suggestions into RAM building in immersive modality.</p>
