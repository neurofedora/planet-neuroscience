                Background The objective of this systematic review was to analyze the effects of physical activity (PA) intervention as an adjuvant strategy to pharmacological treatment in people with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and non-remitted depression (NRD). Methods A search strategy was conducted from five databases: PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database and Oxford’s Evidence Levels were used to classify the quality appraisal. Results Of the 10777 records, 11 randomized controlled studies met the inclusion criteria. The main outcome for this analysis was the effect of physical activity (PA) or exercise on depressive symptoms in people with TRD and NRD diagnosis. According to the FITT (Frequency, Intensity, Time, and Type) principle, there was some variability in the PA intervention. However, except for one article, all were classified as excellent in terms of quality description. Conclusions This review highlights the potential of PA intervention as an adjuvant program to improve various traits in TRD and NRD. The remission of depression seems to be higher after PA intervention, showing improvements in quality of life, sleep quality, executive function, and vitality.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-62/v1?src=rss">Why Kyphoplasty for Osteoporotic Vertebral Fractures? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) are frequent reasons behind painful, spinal deformity, and low-quality of life among the aged. Percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty (KP) is a minimally invasive procedure aimed at stabilizing fractured vertebrae, regaining vertebral height, and correcting kyphotic deformity. The purpose of this study was to compare the radiological and functional outcome of unilateral percutaneous kyphoplasty in patients with OVCFs that are not responding to conservative therapy. Methods This retrospective case study was conducted on 32 adult patients with vertebral compression fracture as a result of osteoporosis who received percutaneous kyphoplasty in the Department of Neurosurgery, Hatay Mustafa Kemal University, Turkey, between 2022 and 2024. Radiological evaluation was conducted before surgery, in the 24 hours after surgery and 1 month after surgery. The heights of anterior, middle, and posterior vertebral bodies and kyphosis angles were measured on the lateral radiographs using Cobb method. The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of pain was used as a measure of functional outcomes. Paired statistical tests were conducted to statistically compare pre and postoperative values and the significance was set at p < 0.05. Results The sample population was a group of 24 females (75% of the total population) and 8 males (25% of the total population) with the mean age of the sample population equal to 63.09 years. The number of kyphoplasties carried out was 36. The mean VAS pain scores reduced significantly by the 8.56 at preoperative stage to 5.83 in the early postoperative stage and further to 0.63 at 1 month postoperative, which is a 92.64% pain reduction. Anterior and middle height of vertebral bodies was significantly better after operation and there was no significant change of the height of the posterior walls. Mean kyphosis angle dropped to 10.73 owing to surgery as compared to 18.44 owing to surgery, and was maintained at 1 month. No significant complications such as cement leakage, pulmonary embolism or neurological deficit were observed. Conclusions Percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty is safe and effective, minimally invasive therapy of osteoporotic compression fracture of the vertebra. The surgery offers quick and lasting analgesia, considerable recovery of vertebral stature, and lasting remedy of kyphotic deformity at a low complication rate. These results justify using kyphoplasty as a useful treatment measure to patients with symptomatic OVCFs.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09912">High-Density Multi-Depth Human Recordings Using 45 mm Long Neuropixels Probes</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.09912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuropixels probes, initially developed for use in small animal models, have transformed basic neuroscience by enabling high-density, single-cell resolution recordings across multiple brain regions simultaneously. The recent development of Neuropixels 1.0 NHP Long, a longer probe designed for non-human primates, has expanded this capability, enabling unprecedented simultaneous access to multiple cortical layers and deep brain structures of large-brained animals. Here, we report the first use of these probes in humans, aiming to establish safe intraoperative use and assess feasibility for clinical and research applications. Nine patients undergoing neurosurgical procedures, including epilepsy or tumor resection and deep brain stimulation (DBS) implantation, were enrolled. Successful intraoperative recordings were obtained from surface and deep cortical structures without probe breakage or adverse events. Compared with conventional electrodes, the Neuropixels probe enabled dense sampling across multiple parenchymal depths with submillisecond temporal resolution. Recordings were obtained from deep targets including the hippocampus and cingulate cortex, as well as from regions that are challenging to access with single-unit precision, such as the superior frontal sulcus. Custom tools and refined workflows lowered technical barriers for operative use and improved recording stability. Neural activity was observed across all recordings. Neuropixels 1.0-NHP Long probes can be deployed in the human operating room, enabling simultaneous recordings from multiple brain structures at single-neuron resolution. These methods expand opportunities for studying human brain function and pathology in vivo, and may ultimately support the development of more precise neurosurgical interventions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10032">Macroscopic dynamics of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons subject to correlated noise</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.10032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of correlated noise, arising from a mixture of independent fluctuations and a common noisy input shared across the neural population, is a ubiquitous feature of neural circuits, yet its impact on collective network dynamics remains poorly understood. We analyze a network of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons driven by Gaussian noise with a tunable degree of correlation. Using the cumulant expansion method, we derive a reduced set of effective mean-field equations that accurately describe the evolution of the population's mean firing rate and membrane potential. Our analysis reveals a counterintuitive phenomenon: increasing the noise correlation strength suppresses the mean network activity, an effect we term correlated-noise-inhibited spiking. Furthermore, within a specific parameter regime, the network exhibits metastability, manifesting itself as spontaneous, noise-driven transitions between distinct high- and low-activity states. These results provide a theoretical framework for reducing the dynamics of complex stochastic networks and demonstrate how correlated noise can fundamentally regulate macroscopic neural activity, with implications for understanding state transitions in biological systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10221">A Unified Dynamical Field Theory of Learning, Inference, and Emergence</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.10221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning, inference, and emergence in biological and artificial systems are often studied within disparate theoretical frameworks, ranging from energy-based models to recurrent and attention-based architectures. Here we develop a unified dynamical field theory in which learning and inference are governed by a minimal stochastic dynamical equation admitting a Martin--Siggia--Rose--Janssen--de Dominicis formulation. Within this framework, inference corresponds to saddle-point trajectories of the associated action, while fluctuation-induced loop corrections render collective modes dynamically emergent and generate nontrivial dynamical time scales. A central result of this work is that cognitive function is controlled not by microscopic units or precise activity patterns, but by the collective organization of dynamical time scales. We introduce the \emph{time-scale density of states} (TDOS) as a compact diagnostic that characterizes the distribution of collective relaxation modes governing inference dynamics. Learning and homeostatic regulation are naturally interpreted as processes that reshape the TDOS, selectively generating slow collective modes that support stable inference, memory, and context-dependent computation despite stochasticity and structural irregularity. This framework unifies energy-based models, recurrent neural networks, transformer architectures, and biologically motivated homeostatic dynamics within a single physical description, and provides a principled route toward understanding cognition as an emergent dynamical phenomenon.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10276">How Intrinsic Motivation Underlies Embodied Open-Ended Behavior</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.10276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although most theories posit that natural behavior can be explained as maximizing some form of extrinsic reward, often called utility, some behaviors appear to be reward independent. For instance, spontaneous motor babbling in human newborns and curiosity in little kids and other animals seem to elude a simple explanation in terms of extrinsic reward maximization. Rooted in these observations, intrinsic motivation has emerged as a potentially major driver of behavior. However, only recently have several quantitative and foundational theories of intrinsic motivation been put forward. We first provide a general framework to understand behavior as being organized hierarchically: objective--intrinsic reward, or motivation--drives, goals and extrinsic reward. We next review the main formalizations of intrinsic motivation, including empowerment, the free energy principle, information-gain maximization, and the maximum occupancy principle. These theories produce complex behavior by promoting, in various ways, entropic action-state paths. The presence of a single intrinsic motivation objective breaks infinite regress, as drives and goals act only temporarily to serve the objective. Extrinsic rewards, such as sugar or protein, are just a means to achieve the objective. Bounded cognition and embodiment impose constraints and boundary conditions for the intrinsic motivation objective. By virtue of their capability to generate complex behavior in a task-agnostic manner, theories of intrinsic motivation promise to become successful generative models of open-ended, embodied behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10397">Reshaping Neural Representation via Associative, Presynaptic Short-Term Plasticity</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.10397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short-term synaptic plasticity (STP) is traditionally viewed as a purely presynaptic filter of incoming spike trains, independent of postsynaptic activity. Recent experiments, however, reveal an associative form of STP in which presynaptic release probability changes alongside long-term potentiation, implying a richer computational role for presynaptic plasticity. Here we develop a normative theory of associative STP using an information-theoretic framework. Extending Fisher-information-based learning to Tsodyks-Markram synapses, we derive analytic update rules for baseline synaptic strength and release probability that maximize encoded stimulus information under resource constraints. The learning rules separate into a conventional postsynaptic term tracking local firing and a distinct presynaptic term with a phase-advanced structure that selectively detects stimulus onset; critically, differences between plasticity of baseline strength and release probability arise within this presynaptic component. For stimulus variations slower than the EPSP time constant, onset sensitivity biases optimal connectivity toward anti-causal associations, strengthening synapses from neurons activated later to those activated earlier. In recurrent circuits, these rules yield ramp-like sustained representations and reverse replay after drive removal. Linear-response analysis further shows that STP confers frequency-dependent phase selectivity on presynaptic drive and that constraints on total release probability systematically tune temporal asymmetry. Together, our results provide a principled account of associative STP and identify presynaptic plasticity of release probability as a substrate for rapidly reconfigurable temporal coding.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10482">Convex Efficient Coding</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.10482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Why do neurons encode information the way they do? Normative answers to this question model neural activity as the solution to an optimisation problem; for example, the celebrated efficient coding hypothesis frames neural activity as the optimal encoding of information under efficiency constraints. Successful normative theories have varied dramatically in complexity, from simple linear models (Atick & Redlich '90), to complex deep neural networks (Lindsay '21). What complex models gain in flexibility, they lose in tractability and often understandability. Here, we split the difference by constructing a set of tractable but flexible normative representational theories. Instead of optimising the neural activities directly, following Sengupta et al. '18, we optimise the representational similarity, a matrix formed from the dot products of each pair of neural responses. Using this, we show that a large family of interesting optimisation problems are convex. This family includes problems corresponding to linear and some non-linear neural networks, and problems from the literature not previously recognised as convex, such as modified versions of semi-nonnegative matrix factorisation or nonnegative sparse coding. We put these findings to work in three ways. First, we provide the first necessary and sufficient identifiability result for a form of semi-nonnegative matrix factorisation. Second, we show that if neural tunings are `different enough' then they are uniquely linked to the optimal representational similarity, partially justifying the use of single neuron tuning analysis in neuroscience. Finally, we use the tractable nonlinearity of some of our problems to explain why dense retinal codes, but not sparse cortical codes, optimally split the coding of a single variable into ON & OFF channels. In sum, we identify a space of convex problems, and use them to derive neural coding results.

                arXiv:2601.10515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acute stress alters cognitive performance, yet competing models make divergent predictions regarding the mechanisms, scope, and temporal dynamics of these effects. This large-scale randomized controlled trial tested predications from three influential stress-effect models using a broad cognitive task battery embedded within a psychopharmacological stress paradigm. Across 606 testing sessions, 303 healthy male participants completed both the Maastricht Acute Stress Test (MAST) and its non-stress control condition. To independently manipulate acute stress and stress hormone availability, participants were additionally randomized to receive atomoxetine (40 mg; to prolong norepinephrine availability), hydrocortisone (10 mg; to increase cortisol availability), or placebo. Cognitive performance was assessed over 80-minutes (post-stress) using tasks targeting visual perception (rapid serial visual presentation), response inhibition (stop-signal), and cognitive flexibility (dual and switch tasks). MAST exposure selectively impaired response inhibition, reflected in shorter stop-signal delays, lower probabilities of successful stopping and prolonged stop-signal reaction times, particularly during later testing phases (40-80 minutes post-stress). MAST exposure did not affect visual perception or task-switching performance but buffered time-related declines in processing efficiency at the expense of task prioritization in the dual task. Pharmacological manipulation of norepinephrine or cortisol availability was effective but did not moderate cognitive stress effects. Overall, this pattern of task-specific impairment alongside stabilized processing efficiency cannot be fully explained by any tested model, highlighting the need to refine existing models and adopt more integrative approaches to advance our mechanistic understanding of cognitive stress-effects in laboratory and real-world contexts.

                arXiv:2601.09736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear Genetic Programming (LGP) is a powerful technique that allows for a variety of problems to be solved using a linear representation of programs. However, there still exists some limitations to the technique, such as the need for humans to explicitly map registers to actions. This thesis proposes a novel approach that uses Q-Learning on top of LGP, Reinforced Linear Genetic Programming (RLGP) to learn the optimal register-action assignments. In doing so, we introduce a new framework "linear-gp" written in memory-safe Rust that allows for extensive experimentation for future works.

Abstract: After Industry 4.0 has embraced tight integration between machinery (OT), software (IT), and the Internet, creating a web of sensors, data, and algorithms in service of efficient and reliable production, a new concept of Society 5.0 is emerging, in which infrastructure of a city will be instrumented to increase reliability, efficiency, and safety. Robotics will play a pivotal role in enabling this vision that is pioneered by the NEOM initiative - a smart city, co-inhabited by humans and robots. In this paper we explore the computing platform that will be required to enable this vision. We show how we can combine neuromorphic computing hardware, exemplified by the Loihi2 processor used in conjunction with event-based cameras, for sensing and real-time perception and interaction with a local AI compute cluster (GPUs) for high-level language processing, cognition, and task planning. We demonstrate the use of this hybrid computing architecture in an interactive task, in which a humanoid robot plays a musical instrument with a human. Central to our design is the efficient and seamless integration of disparate components, ensuring that the synergy between software and hardware maximizes overall performance and responsiveness. Our proposed system architecture underscores the potential of heterogeneous computing architectures in advancing robotic autonomy and interactive intelligence, pointing toward a future where such integrated systems become the norm in complex, real-time applications.

                arXiv:2601.10035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computers hold the potential to vastly improve the speed and efficiency of a wide range of computational kernels with their asynchronous, compute-memory co-located, spatially distributed, and scalable nature. However, performance models that are simple yet sufficiently expressive to predict runtime on actual neuromorphic hardware are lacking, posing a challenge for researchers and developers who strive to design fast algorithms and kernels. As breaking the memory bandwidth wall of conventional von-Neumann architectures is a primary neuromorphic advantage, modeling communication time is especially important. At the same time, modeling communication time is difficult, as complex congestion patterns arise in a heavily-loaded Network-on-Chip. In this work, we introduce the first max-affine lower-bound runtime model -- a multi-dimensional roofline model -- for Intel's Loihi 2 neuromorphic chip that quantitatively accounts for both compute and communication based on a suite of microbenchmarks. Despite being a lower-bound model, we observe a tight correspondence (Pearson correlation coefficient greater than or equal to 0.97) between our model's estimated runtime and the measured runtime on Loihi 2 for a neural network linear layer, i.e., matrix-vector multiplication, and for an example application, a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization solver. Furthermore, we derive analytical expressions for communication-bottlenecked runtime to study scalability of the linear layer, revealing an area-runtime tradeoff for different spatial workload configurations with linear to superliner runtime scaling in layer size with a variety of constant factors. Our max-affine runtime model helps empower the design of high-speed algorithms and kernels for Loihi 2.

                arXiv:2601.10110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes MCEMOL (Multi-Constrained Evolutionary Molecular Design Framework), a molecular optimization approach integrating rule-based evolution with molecular crossover. MCEMOL employs dual-layer evolution: optimizing transformation rules at rule level while applying crossover and mutation to molecular structures. Unlike deep learning methods requiring large datasets and extensive training, our algorithm evolves efficiently from minimal starting molecules with low computational overhead. The framework incorporates message-passing neural networks and comprehensive chemical constraints, ensuring efficient and interpretable molecular design. Experimental results demonstrate that MCEMOL provides transparent design pathways through its evolutionary mechanism while generating valid, diverse, target-compliant molecules. The framework achieves 100% molecular validity with high structural diversity and excellent drug-likeness compliance, showing strong performance in symmetry constraints, pharmacophore optimization, and stereochemical integrity. Unlike black-box methods, MCEMOL delivers dual value: interpretable transformation rules researchers can understand and trust, alongside high-quality molecular libraries for practical applications. This establishes a paradigm where interpretable AI-driven drug design and effective molecular generation are achieved simultaneously, bridging the gap between computational innovation and practical drug discovery needs.

                arXiv:2601.10263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of artificial intelligence, real parameter single objective optimization is an important direction. Both the Differential Evolution (DE) and the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) demonstrate good performance for real parameter single objective optimization. Nevertheless, there exist other types of evolutionary algorithm for the purpose. In recent years, researchers begin to study long-term search. EA4eig - an ensemble of three DE variants and CMA-ES - performs well for long-term search. In this paper, we introduce two types of evolutionary algorithm proposed recently - crisscross search and sparrow search - into EA4eig as secondary evolutionary algorithms to process inferior individuals. Thus, EA4eigCS is obtained. In our ensemble, the secondary evolutionary algorithms are expected to vary distribution of the population for breaking stagnation. Experimental results show that our EA4eigCS outperforms EA4eig and is competitive when compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.

                arXiv:2601.10657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful operators for evolutionary search, yet the design of efficient search scaffolds remains ad hoc. While promising, current LLM-in-the-loop systems lack a systematic approach to managing the evolutionary process. We identify three distinct failure modes: Context Pollution, where experiment history biases future candidate generation; Mode Collapse, where agents stagnate in local minima due to poor exploration-exploitation balance; and Weak Collaboration, where rigid crossover strategies fail to leverage parallel search trajectories effectively. We introduce Progress-Aware Consistent Evolution (PACEvolve), a framework designed to robustly govern the agent's context and search dynamics, to address these challenges. PACEvolve combines hierarchical context management (HCM) with pruning to address context pollution; momentum-based backtracking (MBB) to escape local minima; and a self-adaptive sampling policy that unifies backtracking and crossover for dynamic search coordination (CE), allowing agents to balance internal refinement with cross-trajectory collaboration. We demonstrate that PACEvolve provides a systematic path to consistent, long-horizon self-improvement, achieving state-of-the-art results on LLM-SR and KernelBench, while discovering solutions surpassing the record on Modded NanoGPT.

Abstract: This paper brings an in detail Genetic Algorithm (GA) based combinatorial optimization method used for the optimal design of the water distribution network (WDN) of Gurudeniya Service Zone, Sri Lanka. Genetic Algorithm (GA) mimics the survival of the fittest principle of nature to develop a search process. Methodology employs fuzzy combinations of pipe diameters to check their suitability to be considered as the cost effective optimal design solutions. Furthermore, the hydraulic constraints were implicitly evaluated within the GA itself in its aim to reaching the global optimum solution. Upon analysis, the results of this approach delivered agreeable design outputs. In addition, the comparison made between the results obtained by a previous study inspired by the Honey Bee Mating Optimization (HBMO) Algorithm and results obtained by the GA based approach, proves competency of GA for the optimal design of water distribution network in Gurudeniya Service Zone, Sri Lanka.

                arXiv:2507.20923v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOP) frequently arise in practical applications that require the simultaneous optimization of conflicting objectives. Although traditional evolutionary algorithms can be effective, they typically depend on domain knowledge and repeated parameter tuning, limiting flexibility when applied to unseen MOCOP instances. Recently, integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into evolutionary computation has opened new avenues for automatic heuristic generation, using their advanced language understanding and code synthesis capabilities. Nevertheless, most existing approaches predominantly focus on single-objective tasks, often neglecting key considerations such as runtime efficiency and heuristic diversity in multi-objective settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multi-heuristics for MOCOP via Pareto-Grid-guided Evolution of LLMs (MPaGE), a novel enhancement of the Simple Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization (SEMO) framework that leverages LLMs and Pareto Front Grid (PFG) technique. By partitioning the objective space into grids and retaining top-performing candidates to guide heuristic generation, MPaGE utilizes LLMs to prioritize heuristics with semantically distinct logical structures during variation, thus promoting diversity and mitigating redundancy within the population. Through extensive evaluations, MPaGE demonstrates superior performance over existing LLM-based frameworks, and achieves competitive results to traditional Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), with significantly faster runtime. Our code is available at: https://github.com/langkhachhoha/MPaGE.

                arXiv:2601.09557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents SiliconHealth, a comprehensive blockchain-based healthcare infrastructure designed for resource-constrained regions, particularly sub-Saharan Africa. We demonstrate that obsolete Bitcoin mining Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) can be repurposed to create a secure, low-cost, and energy-efficient medical records system. The proposed architecture employs a four-tier hierarchical network: regional hospitals using Antminer S19 Pro (90+ TH/s), urban health centers with Antminer S9 (14 TH/s), rural clinics equipped with Lucky Miner LV06 (500 GH/s, 13W), and mobile health points with portable ASIC devices. We introduce the Deterministic Hardware Fingerprinting (DHF) paradigm, which repurposes SHA-256 mining ASICs as cryptographic proof generators, achieving 100% verification rate across 23 test proofs during 300-second validation sessions. The system incorporates Reed-Solomon LSB watermarking for medical image authentication with 30-40% damage tolerance, semantic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for intelligent medical record queries, and offline synchronization protocols for intermittent connectivity. Economic analysis demonstrates 96% cost reduction compared to GPU-based alternatives, with total deployment cost of $847 per rural clinic including 5-year solar power infrastructure. Validation experiments on Lucky Miner LV06 (BM1366 chip, 5nm) achieve 2.93 MH/W efficiency and confirm hardware universality. This work establishes a practical framework for deploying verifiable, tamper-proof electronic health records in regions where traditional healthcare IT infrastructure is economically unfeasible, potentially benefiting over 600 million people lacking access to basic health information systems.

                arXiv:2601.07348v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-evolution methods enhance code generation through iterative "generate-verify-refine" cycles, yet existing approaches suffer from low exploration efficiency, failing to discover solutions with superior complexity within limited budgets. This inefficiency stems from initialization bias trapping evolution in poor solution regions, uncontrolled stochastic operations lacking feedback guidance, and insufficient experience utilization across tasks. To address these bottlenecks, we propose Controlled Self-Evolution (CSE), which consists of three key components. Diversified Planning Initialization generates structurally distinct algorithmic strategies for broad solution space coverage. Genetic Evolution replaces stochastic operations with feedback-guided mechanisms, enabling targeted mutation and compositional crossover. Hierarchical Evolution Memory captures both successful and failed experiences at inter-task and intra-task levels. Experiments on EffiBench-X demonstrate that CSE consistently outperforms all baselines across various LLM backbones. Furthermore, CSE achieves higher efficiency from early generations and maintains continuous improvement throughout evolution. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/QuantaAlpha/EvoControl.

                <p>The nigrostriatal and mesoaccumbal dopamine systems are thought to contribute to changes in behavior and learning during adolescence, yet it is unclear how the rise in gonadal hormones at puberty impacts the function of these systems. We studied the impact of prepubertal gonadectomy (GDX) on later evoked dopamine release in male <I>Mus spicilegus</I>, a mouse whose adolescent life history has been carefully characterized in the wild and laboratory. To examine how puberty impacts dopamine neuron function in <I>M. spicilegus</I> males, we removed the gonads prepubertally at postnatal day (P)25 and then examined evoked dopamine release in the dorsomedial, dorsolateral (DLS), and nucleus accumbens core regions of striatal slices at P60&ndash;70 (late adolescence/early adulthood). To measure dopamine release, we used near-infrared catecholamine nanosensors which enable study of spatial distribution of dopamine release. We found that prepubertal GDX led to a significantly reduced density of dopamine release sites and reduced dopamine release at each site in the DLS nigrostriatal system compared with sham controls. In contrast, mesoaccumbal dopamine release was comparable between sham and gonadectomized groups. Our data suggest that during adolescence, the development of the nigrostriatal dopamine system is significantly affected by the rise in gonadal hormones in males, while the mesoaccumbal system shows no detectable sensitivity at this time point. These data are consistent with molecular studies in rodents that suggest nigrostriatal neurons are sensitive to androgens at puberty and extend our understanding of how gonadal hormones could impact the spatial distribution and release potential of dopamine terminals in the striatum.</p>

                Abstract* The global environmental crisis exposes the flaws of current approaches and highlights the importance of spiritual and locally based ecological ethics. This research examines how Islamic values and Javanese traditional culture are incorporated into environmental rituals at the community level in Selorejo, Malang, Indonesia, as a local response to environmental issues. The primary aim is to illustrate how the incorporation of Islamic values and Javanese traditions constitutes dynamic ecological rituals that foster environmental conservation from both global and local points of view. Using a qualitative ethnographic method, data were collected through three primary techniques: participant observation of community ecological rituals, in-depth interviews with traditional leaders, local community, and local residents involved in conservation efforts. Thematic analysis was applied, utilizing frameworks of acculturation and ecophy. Results reveal that Selorejo’s ecological rituals include six rites: Merti Wono (Selametan Alas), Selametan Sumber, Jogo Wono Performing Arts (Wong Ireng), Jagong Alas, Boundary Marking and Reforestation, and Eco-friendly Agriculture. The rites of Selametan Alas and Sumber demonstrate the fusion of Islamic principles with Javanese traditions, viewing nature as a sacred reflection of God. This combination enhances ecological awareness and establishes a spiritual model of conservation rooted in ecosophy. Such a model presents a relevant global ecological citizenship alternative and supports the achievement of SDGs. This study confirms that spiritually based local ecological rituals can contribute to global ecological citizenship and provide an alternative approach to environmental crises.

                Guo et al. investigate IL-1 signaling in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) by analyzing multi-omic single-cell data. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) respond to IL-1 signals from myeloid cells and activate an inflammatory signature, mediated by transcription factor NFATC2. Inhibiting NFAT leads to decreased tumor weight, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target.

                Chanvillard et al. reveal that NNMT drives tubular senescence and fibrosis in early CKD. Through human data, spatial transcriptomics, and mouse, cell, and organoid models, they show that NNMT inhibition restores methylation balance and reverses senescence and fibrosis, therefore identifying NNMT as a promising therapeutic target for early CKD intervention.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106791">Functionally coupled ion channels begin co-assembling at the start of their synthesis</a></h4>

              
                Calcium binding to BK channels lowers BK activation threshold, substantiating functional coupling with calcium-permeable channels. This coupling requires close proximity between different channel types, and the formation of BK-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 hetero-clusters at nanometer distances exemplifies this unique organization. To investigate the structural basis of this interaction, we tested the hypothesis that BK and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels assemble before their insertion into the plasma membrane. Our approach incorporated four strategies: (1) detecting interactions between BK and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 proteins inside the cell, (2) identifying membrane compartments where intracellular hetero-clusters reside, (3) measuring the proximity of their mRNAs, and (4) assessing protein interactions at the plasma membrane during early translation. These analyses revealed that a subset of BK and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 transcripts are spatially close in micro-translational complexes, and their newly synthesized proteins associate within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi. Comparisons with other proteins, transcripts, and randomized localization models support the conclusion that BK and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 hetero-clusters form before their insertion at the plasma membrane.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106037">Trained immunity in acute and chronic neurological diseases</a></h4>

              
                Trained immunity, the long-term reprogramming of innate immune cells to elicit an enhanced response upon subsequent challenges, has become a key concept in understanding a wide range of pathologies, including both acute and chronic inflammatory disorders. Recent evidence suggests that trained immunity also plays a significant role in the development and progression of various neurological disorders and related comorbidities, in which brain pathology can lead to trained immunity. This review summarizes the current understanding of trained immunity within both brain-resident immune cells and myeloid-derived innate immune cells, focusing on their roles in neurological disorders, such as ischemic brain injury, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease. Additionally, we explore the heterogeneity of trained immunity across different conditions and its potential applications in clinical neurology.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94524">Rtf1-dependent transcriptional pausing regulates cardiogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Transcriptional pause-release critically regulates cellular RNA biogenesis, yet how dysregulation of this process impacts embryonic development is not fully understood. Rtf1 is a multifunctional transcription regulatory protein involved in modulating promoter-proximal pausing of RNA Polymerase II (RNA Pol II). Using zebrafish and mouse as model systems, we show that Rtf1 activity is essential for the differentiation of the myocardial lineage from mesoderm. Ablation of <i>rtf1</i> impairs the formation of <i>nkx2.5+</i>/<i>tbx5a+</i> cardiac progenitor cells, resulting in the development of embryos without cardiomyocytes. Structure-function analysis demonstrates that Rtf1’s cardiogenic activity requires its Plus3 domain, which confers interaction with the pausing/elongation factor Spt5. In Rtf1-deficient embryos, the occupancy of RNA Pol II at transcription start sites was reduced relative to downstream occupancy, suggesting a reduction in transcriptional pausing. Intriguingly, attenuating pause release by pharmacological inhibition or morpholino targeting of CDK9 improved RNA Pol II occupancy at the transcription start sites of key cardiac genes and restored cardiomyocytes in Rtf1-deficient embryos. Thus, our findings demonstrate the crucial role that Rtf1-mediated transcriptional pausing plays in controlling the precise spatiotemporal transcription programs that govern early heart development.

">ZC4H2 loss of function is associated with temporal dysregulation of neural stem proliferation and neuron development</a></h4>

              
                ZC4H2 is an X-linked zinc finger transcription factor essential for early neurodevelopment. Pathogenic variants in ZC4H2 are associated with both central and peripheral nervous system pathologies. The molecular and cellular mechanisms driving these phenotypes remain poorly understood, particularly in human female models that have undergone X chromosome inactivation. Neuronal models were differentiated from a human female cell line with a de novo Xq11.2 deletion causing ZC4H2 loss of function, associated with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita and cognitive impairment. Using iPSC-derived neural stem cells and cortical organoids, we identified premature neuronal differentiation, reduced BMP-SMAD signaling, and decreased SMAD1/5 phosphorylation. In cortical organoids, ZC4H2 deficiency altered neurogenesis timing, retaining proliferative progenitors while prematurely activating neuronal programs, leading to enlarged organoids with persistent dysregulation of gene programs required for complete neuronal maturation. We identified ZC4H2 target genes likely to mediate these phenotypes and tested a codon-optimized transgene showing both the restoration of SMAD1/5 phosphorylation, BMPR2 gene expression, and improved neuronal complexity. These results demonstrate effective ZC4H2 restoration in complex human models and highlight therapeutic potential for ZC4H2-linked neurodevelopmental disorders.

">Experience Reorganizes Coordinated Population Dynamics Across Hippocampal Circuits</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal function relies on structured patterns of population activity that reflect the intrinsic organization of the circuit. Although experience is known to influence synaptic properties and local activity features, whether prolonged experience reshapes the large-scale organization of population dynamics across hippocampal subfields in the intact brain has remained unclear. Progress on this question has been limited by the lack of measurements that capture circuit-wide activity simultaneously while preserving spatial circuit structure. Here, we combined prolonged environmental experience with large-scale, simultaneous multi-shank recordings spanning CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus in the mouse hippocampus to examine experience-dependent changes in circuit dynamics. We find that long-term experience reorganizes the basal operating state of the hippocampus, altering the statistical structure of field potentials, population spiking, and sharp-wave ripple activity in a coordinated manner across subfields. These changes are not confined to specific regions but instead reflect a circuit-wide reconfiguration of functional interactions that extends over larger spatial scales. At the population level, experience shifts hippocampal dynamics into a more coordinated dynamical regime, characterized by shared low-dimensional structure across hippocampal subfields. Together, these findings demonstrate that long-term experience reorganizes coordinated population dynamics across hippocampal circuits, establishing an intrinsic activity organization that reflects the experiential history of a memory network.

">Evolution of Hierarchical Phase-Contrast Tomography on the European Synchrotron beamlines BM05 and BM18: a whole adult human brain imaging case study</a></h4>

              
                Hierarchical Phase-Contrast Tomography (HiP-CT) was recently developed to enable the ex-vivo imaging of human organs at multiple scales from whole organ down to cellular level. Using whole adult human brain imaging as a case study, this manuscript shows the evolution of this technique from its initial development at the BM05 beamline to its transition and current status at BM18. Thanks to the higher coherence, larger beam size, higher energies and larger propagation distances available at BM18 and due to the European Synchrotron's Extremely Brilliant Source upgrade (ESRF-EBS), this transition resulted in significantly improved data quality, resolution, sensitivity and speed. More recently, the implementation of a new generation of larger sCMOS cameras, helical scanning (including dedicated reconstruction algorithm developments), binning at the chip and projections levels, and the design of high-efficiency optics allowed to progressively improve the trade-off between dose and image quality, while simultaneously reducing scanning times. All these acquisition schemes present the current status of full organ imaging using HiP-CT and represent the constant efforts for the improvement of the technique towards the investigation of human organs in health, disease and aging.

">Non-focal beta oscillation suppression along the sensorimotor cortex revealed by corticomuscular coherence</a></h4>

              
                An Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD) of the 13-30 Hz sensorimotor (SM1) beta oscillations is commonly observed during movement preparation and execution. Human electrophysiological measurements suggest that such a beta ERD has a wide topographical distribution along the SM1, however, no accessible means of quantifying the degree of its focality exist. Therefore, we investigated how the movement-induced beta ERD in one somatotopic SM1 area affects beta oscillations in a neighbouring SM1 area. Thirty-six participants performed right brachium movements while holding a submaximal isometric contraction with their right first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle. Beta ERD in the left SM1 brachium area was assessed with electroencephalography (EEG). The effect of that ERD on beta activity in the neighbouring SM1 FDI area was assessed through the corticomuscular coherence (CMC) between SM1 EEG signals and the electromyographic and force signals recorded from the contracted right FDI muscle. Our results showed that the strong movement-induced beta ERD in the SM1 brachium area spreads to the neighbouring SM1 FDI area and suppresses beta oscillations therein, as evidenced by significantly attenuated CMC with both FDI signals. These findings confirm that beta ERD is not a strictly focal phenomenon as it spreads to a neighbouring SM1 area. Importantly, we introduced a novel approach that combines a dual motor task paradigm with CMC to assess beta propagatory effects. This approach could allow for investigating the topographical properties of beta oscillations and their role for motor control in healthy and clinical populations.

">Neural Decoding of Musical Engagement Reveals Tension-Release Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Music listening is one of the most compelling and rewarding activities humans engage in spontaneously. But what exactly catches people's attention when listening to music remains unclear. Musicologists have argued that tension-release dynamics in music constitute crucial features of the listening experience. They arise from the intertwining of different low-level and high-level features and sit at the core of music enjoyment by engaging listeners dynamically. This study aims to characterize the relationship between tension dynamics and engagement during naturalistic music listening. Using canonical correlation analysis, we decoded the music envelope from EEG and ECoG responses and found that musical tension patterns, as reported by listeners, were predictive of fluctuations in the coupling between the music and the neural response. Importantly, tension dynamics were significantly correlated with neural measures of envelope tracking even after controlling for loudness and musical expectations, confirming the specific and crucial role of musical tension in engaging listeners. These results shed new light on how musical structure gives rise to internal response modulations that, in turn, dynamically reflect musical engagement. This interplay may underlie the pervasive and emotionally rewarding nature of music.

">Self-organized Recovery of Coordinated Locomotion in Crickets Revealed by Prosthetic Limb Integration</a></h4>

              
                Distributed sensorimotor interactions facilitate the coordination of multilegged locomotion in insects without centralized control, yet the mechanisms that allow coordinated locomotion to re-emerge following limb loss remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically evaluate the effects of leg amputation and the integration of prosthetic legs on walking coordination in crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus). Spherical treadmill experiments revealed that leg amputation disrupts inter-leg phase coupling, decreases locomotor speed, and alters spatial foot placement in a state-dependent manner, indicating impaired load-mediated coordination. Prosthetic legs did not merely restore intact kinematics; instead, they selectively reinstated coherent temporal coordination and axis-specific spatial organization. This structured recovery illustrates that re-introducing mechanically relevant sensory constraints is sufficient to re-engage distributed coordination networks, even in the absence of anatomical integrity. Our findings elucidate an embodied principle through which sensory-mechanical feedback facilitates the self-organization of resilient multi-legged locomotion in the context of morphological interventions.

">Synaptic vesicle undocking induces low frequency depression</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic depression is often interpreted as reflecting depletion of the readily releasable pool (RRP) following exocytosis. Such a mechanism predicts little or no depression at low stimulation frequency, as RRP replenishment should then offset the loss of vesicles by exocytosis. Nevertheless, in several types of mammalian central synapses, repetitive presynaptic stimulation at low frequency (< 5 Hz) elicits synaptic depression (low frequency depression, or LFD). In the present work we count the number of synaptic vesicles released at individual active zones to study the RRP and its replenishment during LFD. Contrary to depletion models of synaptic depression, we find that LFD does not depend on previous SV consumption. We find that LFD displays a long recovery time course (tens of seconds) when challenged by isolated stimulations but is immediately reversed by a high frequency train. We suggest that LFD results from undocking, a shift between two classes of synaptic vesicles organized sequentially inside the RRP (replacement vs. docked vesicles) in favor of the upstream (replacement) state. While undocking is apparent hundreds of milliseconds after a stimulation, calcium dependent docking takes only a couple of milliseconds, explaining the fast LFD recovery when stimulating at high frequency. Consistent with the undocking model, we find that double presynaptic stimulations alleviate LFD as they favor vesicular docking and RRP replenishment. Finally, we expand our model to explain how stimulation frequency shapes short-term synaptic depression, changing from depression at low frequency to a facilitation-depression sequence at medium or high frequency trains.

">Transmembrane PhoxID: Photo-proximity labelling across the plasma membrane</a></h4>

              
                Transmembrane proteins perform essential roles in cellular transport, signalling, and communication. The function and dynamics of these proteins are precisely regulated by interactions on both sides of the plasma membrane; thus, mapping the composition of these interactomes is a fundamental challenge in molecular biology. Proximity labelling methods are powerful tools for this purpose; however, existing approaches that rely on membrane-impermeable reactive species are limited by the ability to detect only one side, either the extracellular or the intracellular region, of transmembrane proteins. Here, we capitalized on the cell permeability of singlet oxygen to carry out proximity labelling of the cytoplasmic side of transmembrane proteins using an extracellularly anchored photosensitizer. We applied this method, termed transmembrane PhoxID (tmPhoxID), to several receptors (GRID2, GABAAR, and GRM1) in the living mouse brain and successfully determined their specific intracellular interactomes. Notably, network analysis of the identified proteins revealed that this method can characterize the native components of transsynaptic nanocolumns formed at parallel fibre-Purkinje cell synapses. Furthermore, our study revealed a previously uncharacterized GABAAR-CAMKV interaction in mice and human brains. Our results provide a proof of concept for transmembrane and transcellular proximity labelling, providing a powerful platform for analysing the interactome of transmembrane proteins.

">Causal Evidence for Left DLPFC Contributions to Working Memory, Attention, and Cognitive Control in Ageing: A cTBS/ERP Study</a></h4>

              
                Ageing is characterised by progressive neurodegeneration and marked declines in working memory (WM), a domain critically dependent on the integrity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Although non-invasive brain stimulation is widely used to target this region, the causal contribution of the DLPFC to WM performance in older adults remains insufficiently understood. Here, we applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) to transiently inhibit the left DLPFC in twenty healthy older adults and assessed the behavioural and neurophysiological consequences during verbal and visuospatial N-back tasks. Behaviourally, moderate learning effects emerged exclusively in the verbal task following vertex stimulation, whereas learning after DLPFC stimulation remained inconclusive. Performance in the visuospatial task showed no reliable evidence of learning across conditions, consistent with greater interindividual variability and age-related decline in spatial WM. Neurophysiologically, ERP amplitudes were stable across conditions; however, marked latency perturbations were observed. In the verbal task, P200 and N200 latencies robustly predicted performance, with P200 latency significantly prolonged after DLPFC inhibition, indicating disrupted early attentional gating. N200 and P300 latency modulations further suggested load-dependent compensatory strategies, reflecting adaptive slowing of cognitive control processes. In contrast, visuospatial performance was not reliably predicted by P200 latency, although N200 and P300 latencies remained informative, indicating domain-specific differences in DLPFC involvement. Taken together, these findings provide causal evidence that left DLPFC disruption selectively interferes with the temporal coordination of verbal WM, emphasising the central role of processing speed and compensatory dynamics in cognitive ageing. ERP latency markers emerge as sensitive indices of subtle stimulation-induced perturbations in older adults.

">Vocal production differentially affects fast- and broad-spiking neurons in auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Vocalization, foundational for information exchange in animals, is supported by vocalization-modulated neurons that occur across species and brain areas. These neurons are typically studied in an undifferentiated manner, despite the heterogeneous nature of the cortical circuitry regarding cell types. Overlooking this diversity risks producing incomplete models of cortical function. Here, we address this challenge by studying large-scale, cell-type specific auditory cortical activity during vocalization in the bat Carollia perspicillata, a vocal specialist. We discovered that vocalisation-related modulatory effects in the auditory cortex, a critical attribute of the underlying circuit, differ starkly between putative inhibitory and pyramidal neurons. During calling, novel cell assemblies and temporal spiking patterns emerge wherein inhibitory cells play a pivotal role. Further, vocalization-specific neural decorrelations affect inhibitory cells most strongly. Together, these results demonstrate that vocalization-related neuronal activity is cell-type specific at the single- and multi-cellular levels of cortical organisation and highlight the importance of inhibitory neurons for auditory cortical dynamics during vocal production.

">Microstate-specific functional connectivity in alcohol use disorder using resting-state EEG</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is often described as a "disconnection syndrome", reflecting neural dysfunction associated with chronic alcohol use. However, previous studies on functional connectivity of resting-state EEG (rsEEG) in AUD have reported inconsistent findings -- some showing hyperconnectivity, others hypoconnectivity or no significant differences -- possibly due to overlooking the brain's dynamic nature even at its resting state. Here, we examined rsEEG in 26 young adults with AUD and 35 healthy controls (HC), using microstate analysis to characterize transient brain states and to estimate functional connectivity within each state. We showed that microstate map topologies were comparable between the two groups. However, the temporal dynamics in the AUD group were biased toward microstates C and D, characterized by anterior-to-posterior configurations, within which between-channel functional connectivity differed from that of HC. Particularly within microstate C, the AUD group showed significantly reduced functional connectivity compared to the HC group in the majority of channel pairs. Moreover, compared with conventional functional connectivity estimates, microstate-specific functional connectivity yielded superior classification performance in distinguishing individuals with AUD from HC. Subsequent computation of graph-theoretical measures revealed that individuals with AUD showed less stable hub-like properties and reduced small-worldness in microstate C, indicating diminished network efficiency. Our findings suggest that transient EEG properties, exemplified by microstate-specific functional connectivity, provide informative neural markers for characterizing the impact of alcohol use on the brain.

">Soluble DLK1 secreted by telomere-shortening-induced senescent microglia impairs oligodendrocyte functions and alters neuronal activity</a></h4>

              
                Aging is the major risk factor for neurodegenerative disease, yet the mechanisms linking physiological aging to brain dysfunction remain unclear. Because telomere erosion is a hallmark of aging, we examined its impact on glial and neuronal physiology. Telomere shortened mice showed lipofuscinosis, hypomyelination, microglial atrophy, and cognitive deficits. Single nuclei RNA-seq revealed accelerated glial aging, elevated microglial senescence pathways, and impaired oligodendrocyte functions. Inducing senescence in human iPSC derived microglia with shortened telomeres identified soluble DLK1 as a novel senescence associated ligand. sDLK1 was increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of telomere shortened and naturally aged mice, and this increase was eliminated by microglial depletion. AAV delivery of sDLK1 in vivo caused hypomyelination and blocked oligodendrocyte lineage progression, demonstrating the detrimental nature of excessive sDLK1. In human iPSC systems, sDLK1 impaired oligodendrocyte maturation and altered calcium signaling in excitatory neurons. These findings identify microglial senescence as a core consequence of telomere shortening and reveal sDLK1 as a microglia-derived senescence ligand that drives oligodendrocyte and neuronal dysfunction in aging.

">Serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus scale O2 utilization in response to traumatic stress</a></h4>

              
                Trauma is a main cause of psychiatric disorders. Approximately 24% of trauma-exposed individuals suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder throughout their lifetime, however, the vast majority of people are resilient. Why some people are resilient while others develop mental disorders in face of trauma in a short timescale? Here, we show that O2 actively initiates a cell-signaling pathway that regulates behavioral outcomes in response to traumatic stress. We found that serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN5-HT neurons) projecting to the ventral caudate putamen and the ventral tegmental area exhibit distinct physiological patterns of O2 utilization. In response to traumatic stress, O2 utilization in these neurons changed individually, following either a susceptible or resilient pattern, thereby modulating corresponding behaviors. This O2 scaling was regulated by ferroptosis within the DRN5-HT neurons. Thus, we identify a previously unrecognized function of O2, opening an avenue for the treatment and prevention of stress-related disorders.

">Persistent enhancement of intrinsic neuronal excitability induced by transient divalent cation depletion</a></h4>

              
                Fluctuations in external calcium concentration [Ca2+]e occur during the wake and sleep cycle and during intense neuronal activity. However, the incidence of these fluctuations on neuronal excitability is not precisely known. We show here that reducing divalent cation (Ca2+ and Mg2+) concentrations from 1.3/0.8 to 0.6/0.4 mM during 15-30 minutes induces long-term potentiation of intrinsic excitability (LTP-IE) in CA1 pyramidal neurons. LTP-IE induced by low divalent cations is associated with a hyperpolarization of the action potential threshold and constitutes a positive feed-back of brain activity. This plasticity requires Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaSR), IP3 receptor (IP3R) and calcium-calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII). In fact, LTP-IE was occluded in the presence of the calcilytic NPS-2143 and absent in CRISPR CaSR neurons. In addition, inhibiting IP3R with 2-APB and CaMKII with kin considerably reduced LTP-IE magnitude. LTP-IE and synaptic potentiation (LTP) induced by spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) protocol were also found to depend on CaSR as they were totally absent in CRISPR CaSR neurons. Spontaneous excitatory synaptic activity was found to be reduced by ~35% following LTP induced by STDP. Importantly, this drop of spontaneous activity was not observed in CRISPR CaSR neurons. Taken together, these results show that CaSR plays a critical role in LTP-IE induced by low [Ca2+]e and [Mg2+]e and as well as in LTP of synaptic transmission and intrinsic excitability induced by STDP.

">SnapG: An Automated Tool for Myelin g-ratio Measurement with Batch Processing Capability</a></h4>

              
                The g-ratio, calculated as the axon diameter divided by the total myelinated fiber diameter, is widely used to assess the degree of myelination in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Changes in g-ratios accompany demyelinating, hypomyelinating, and remyelinating conditions, and can also result from activity-dependent, adaptive myelination. Although manual tracing from electron micrographs has been the gold-standard to measure g-ratios, this process is laborious and limits throughput. To address this challenge, we developed SnapG, an automated and user friendly software tool to streamline g-ratio analysis from electron micrographs. SnapG implements an end to end pipeline for axon and myelin segmentation on EM images. The tool integrates robust segmentation and post processing steps to extract axon and fiber diameters and generates both per image and cohort level summary statistics. SnapG produces g-ratio distributions that agree well with expert manual annotations and established tools across imaging modalities. It reduces user intervention, supports large image and batch processing, and achieves faster processing times while delivering accurate, reproducible measurements. SnapG's automated reporting thereby facilitates high throughput analyses and improves consistency across experiments. SnapG can accelerate studies of myelin biology and provides a practical alternative to existing tools.

">Astrocyte stimulation reopens the window of the critical period for the experience-dependent plasticity of retinogeniculate synapses</a></h4>

              
                A specific time window during which neural circuits undergo dramatic changes in response to individual experiences is known as the critical period (CP). Developing methods to reopen the CP after its closure could lead to the establishment of effective treatment approaches. The retinogeniculate (RG) synapses in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) undergo experience-dependent remodeling only during the limited period of development. We investigated the effects of astrocyte manipulation on the restoration of RG synapse plasticity after the CP termination. Astrocytic stimulation with the designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD) after the CP closure caused RG synapse remodeling in the dark-reared mice but not in those reared in normal conditions. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of dLGN astrocytes implicated the underlying mechanisms of astrocyte-induced RG synaptic plasticity. Therefore, astrocytes can regulate the susceptibility of RG synapses to experience-dependent plasticity after CP termination.

                The serotonergic psychedelic, psilocybin, shows potential for rapid and sustained antidepressant effects but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Using a chronic interferon-alpha-induced rat model of depression, we show acute psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) reverses impaired reward-induced biases within 24hrs, with effects enduring for at least 7 days. This suggests psilocybin can restore blunted reward processing, an effect which could significantly contribute to its sustained antidepressant effects.

">Plasma proteomics reveal heterogeneous subtypes of depression linked to inflammation and aging</a></h4>

              
                The clinical heterogeneity of depression has defied biological classification, limiting personalized treatment. Previous neuroimaging- or symptom-based subtyping of depression failed to clarify the underlying pathoetiology, while plasma proteins which integrates signals from multiple organ systems, offers a promising way to define biologically grounded subtypes. Using plasma proteomics from 2,127 incident depression cases in a cohort of 53000 individuals, we identified three biologically distinct subtypes differing in inflammation, aging, and metabolic profiles. The most prevalent subtype (inflammation/aging) was characterized by aging-related inflammation, poorest prognosis with hippocampal atrophy and highest suicide risk, mediated by age-related amygdalar atrophy; this subtype had highest anhedonia burden. A distinct inflammation/energy dysregulation group had metabolic pathway enrichment with high inflammation and lifestyle risk factors (smoking) but no aging trend, predominantly physical/psychomotor symptoms and decreased thalamic volume. In contrast, the inflammation-resilient group had the lowest inflammatory proteomic loading, lowest depression severity, more resilient lifestyle and increased hippocampal volume. These proteomic signatures, detectable years before symptom onset, enable risk stratification and suggest subtype-specific targeted physical and lifestyle interventions.

">Distinct CA1 inputs support shifts in neural dimensionality and memory resolution</a></h4>

              
                Event-based memories may be encoded with high (e.g., episodic) or low (e.g., gist) mnemonic resolution. While the CA1 region of the hippocampus encodes events at both scales, it is unclear how such dual coding emerges. Consistent with theoretical predictions (1,2), here we show that trisynaptic (from CA3) and monosynaptic (from the medial entorhinal cortex) projections to CA1 encode high- and low-resolution event-based memories, respectively. Recruitment of the trisynaptic pathway during contextual fear conditioning promotes feedforward inhibition of CA1 via activation of parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons. This allows sparse encoding of event-based memories in high-dimensional neural states that support high-resolution contextual fear memories, where mice exhibit conditioned fear only in the training context and not similar contexts. Inhibiting this input during training reduces activation of CA1 PV+ interneurons and feedforward inhibition, shifting neural dynamics to low-dimensional states that support low-resolution contextual fear memories where mice freeze in the training context and similar contexts. These experiments identify a circuit-based mechanism that causally links the dimensionality of CA1 neural dynamics to mnemonic resolution.

                The prevalence of MR-visible perivascular spaces (PVS) is age-dependent in rhesus macaques. Automated quantification in 94 male and female animals ranging 5-28 years of age demonstrated a robust association between age and PVS burden, with an anatomical distribution paralleling that of humans. Preliminary ex vivo validation confirmed that the MRI-detected tubular structures correspond to perivascular spaces. These findings establish the rhesus macaque as a tractable model for understanding the role of perivascular dysfunction in age-related brain vulnerability.

">The geometry of context-dependent biased decisions during learning</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive behavior requires inferring latent context and rapidly adjusting decisions in response to changing environmental contingencies. We investigated how reward context is learned, represented, and updated during decision making. We recorded large populations of neurons in lateral prefrontal cortex while macaque monkeys learned a direction-discrimination task in which reward contingencies alternated unpredictably between favoring leftward and rightward choices. Once trained, monkeys inferred context switches from a single unexpected outcome, immediately adjusting both choice bias and reaction times---hallmarks of model-based inference. Early in learning, however, adaptation unfolded gradually across multiple trials. Neural population analyses revealed that reward context was encoded through systematic shifts in the geometry of neural representations. Accumulated sensory evidence (decision variable) and choice were organized along curvilinear decision manifolds, which were displaced across contexts primarily along the decision-variable axis. This geometry naturally implemented context-dependent biases: a fixed linear readout generated different choice tendencies across contexts without remapping. Longitudinal recordings further showed that, with learning, these representational transitions between manifolds became faster, mirroring the emergence of one-trial behavioral generalization. Recurrent neural networks trained on the same task reproduced both the behavioral signatures and the context-dependent geometric shifts. Together, these findings identify a mechanism by which prefrontal circuits support hierarchical inference: reward context is encoded as structured shifts in representational geometry, enabling rapid generalization and flexible control of decision policies.

Neuroinflammatory processes mediated by glial cells play crucial roles in the pathophysiology of these and other diseases, defined as TDP-43 proteinopathies. Here, we characterized region-specific glial activation in two conditional mouse models: hTDP-43-WT (overexpressing nuclear wild-type human TDP-43) and hTDP-43-{Delta}NLS (expressing cytoplasmic TDP-43 with altered nuclear localization signal) following one month of transgene expression. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed distinct patterns of microglial activation across brain regions. hTDP-43-WT mice exhibited significant microgliosis in motor (MC) and somatosensory (SSC) cortices and hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) with pronounced morphological alterations (i.e. increased soma size). Sholl analysis demonstrated reduced branching length and complexity in MC, SSC and hippocampal subfields. hTDP-43-{Delta}NLS mice displayed more pronounced microglial activation in hippocampal regions (CA1, DG) compared to cortical areas, with significant increases in microglial density. Additionally, we observed region-specific cortical astrocytosis in both models, suggesting coordinated glial reactivity. hTDP-43-{Delta}NLS mice showed decreased polarization of astrocytic water channel Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) around vascular structures in SSC and hippocampal CA1/DG. The changes in AQP4 localization, which is critical for glymphatic function, supports the hypothesis that this waste clearance system for the brain is altered in TDP-43 proteinopathies. These findings demonstrate that these different animal models of ALS/FTD induce distinct neuroinflammatory signatures, potentially contributing to the region-specific vulnerability observed in these diseases. Our data provide insights into early glial-mediated pathogenic mechanisms that could guide targeted therapeutic strategies for TDP-43 proteinopathies.

">Wasf1 deletion attenuates tau hyperphosphorylation, microglial state transition, and cognitive deficits in P301S tau mice</a></h4>

              
                We previously reported that WAVE1, a major activator of Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin polymerization, is downregulated in postmortem brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and that WAVE1 regulates amyloid precursor protein trafficking and amyloid-{beta} production. However, its role in tau pathology remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that WAVE1 activity is suppressed in P301S tau mice through elevated inhibitory phosphorylation. Strikingly, WAVE1 gene (Wasf1) knockout in P301S tau mice significantly reduces tau hyperphosphorylation and improves cognition, suggesting a compensatory role for WAVE1 suppression in tau pathogenesis. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing reveals that Wasf1 deletion in P301S tau mice reverses microglial state transitions, with minimal impact on other brain cell types. Wasf1 mRNA is highly translated in microglia in non-Tg mice, while its expression is downregulated in P301S tau mice. Wasf1 knockdown in BV2 microglia cells enhances the degradation of engulfed tau fibrils, indicating WAVE1 as an endogenous regulator of microglial function. Additionally, CellChat analysis indicates that Wasf1 deletion alters microglial autocrine signaling and their interactions with other cell types in P301S tau mice. These findings, taken together, suggest that Wasf1 deletion restores homeostatic microglial function, mitigates tau pathology, and alleviates cognitive deficits, highlighting WAVE1 as a potential therapeutic target for tauopathy-related dementias.

">Modafinil Modulation of Oscillatory and Aperiodic Brain Activity in Rats Across Wakefulness and Subsequent Sleep</a></h4>

              
                Cortical states shape sensory processing, decision-making, and behavior, and are characterized by distinct patterns of neuronal oscillatory activity. Pharmacological agents can modulate these states and their underlying electrophysiological signatures. Modafinil is a widely used wake-promoting agent and cognitive enhancer, but its effects on cortical oscillations are not fully understood. In this study, we evaluated the effect of modafinil on cortical activity during wakefulness and subsequent sleep. Ten male Wistar rats were implanted with electrocorticographic electrodes and recorded following oral administration of modafinil or its vehicle. Our results show that modafinil increased wakefulness in a dose-dependent manner, with doses of 200 and 300 mg/kg producing prolonged wake episodes and reducing hypnogram complexity. During wakefulness, modafinil enhanced gamma-band power in anterior cortices, an effect primarily driven by increases in the aperiodic rather than oscillatory components. Although no sleep rebound was observed, subsequent NREM sleep exhibited increased delta power, particularly in anterior regions, indicating heightened sleep pressure. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that modafinil-induced wakefulness is associated with an enhanced aperiodic gamma band component at the anterior cortices in the EEG. Furthermore, modafinil modulates sleep homeostasis by enhancing NREM sleep intensity rather than extending its duration.

">Leveraging Pretrained Vision Transformers for classifying Alcohol Use Disorder using Raw Resting-State EEG</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a prevalent and debilitating neuropsychiatric condition characterized by compulsive alcohol consumption, impaired control, and negative emotional states, affecting about 28 million adults in the United States. Despite its significant public health burden, there are few objective biomarkers and no reliable neurophysiological tools to assist in its clinical diagnosis. In this study, we investigated the potential of deep learning to classify individuals with AUD using raw resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) data. EEG recordings were obtained from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA), a large, longitudinal, multi-site dataset. The initial cohort included a total of 5,402 recordings from 2,710 participants (aged 12-83 years, mean age 24; 1,338 males and 1,372 females). To reduce confounding factors, we applied demographic matching, and to address class imbalance, we applied undersampling. Minimal preprocessing was applied to preserve the raw EEG features. We utilized EEGViT, a hybrid deep learning architecture that combines convolutional patch embedding with a Vision Transformer (ViT) pretrained on ImageNet, thereby enabling end-to-end learning directly from raw EEG input. The analysis was stratified by sex and age, and all groups were age-matched. To validate the generalization of the model, models were also trained for Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) and Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). Results for the AUD model showed a classification accuracy of approximately 56% in the overall dataset, 54% for males, and 58% for females. The CUD model showed an accuracy of about 63%, with 59% for females and 69% for males. The OUD model showed an accuracy of about 63%, with 61% for females and 65% for males. Temporal analysis indicated that the model's performance varied across time intervals, with higher accuracy observed in later minutes compared to earlier ones. While modest, these findings underscore the potential of transformer-based models in psychiatric classification using raw EEG data and provide a foundation for future development of EEG-based diagnostic tools for AUD.

                <p>Speech in everyday life is often masked by background noise, making comprehension effortful. Characterizing brain activity patterns when individuals listen to masked speech can help clarify the mechanisms underlying such effort. In the current study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans of either sex to investigate how neural signatures of story listening change in the presence of masking noise. We show that, as speech masking increases, spatial and temporal activation patterns in auditory regions become more idiosyncratic to each listener. In contrast, spatial activity patterns in brain networks linked to effort (e.g., cingulo-opercular network) are more similar across listeners when speech is highly masked and less intelligible, suggesting shared neural processes. Moreover, at times during stories when one meaningful event ended and another began, neural activation increased in frontal, parietal, and medial cortices. This event-boundary response appeared little affected by background noise, suggesting that listeners process meaningful units and, in turn, the gist of naturalistic, continuous speech even when it is masked somewhat by background noise. The current data may indicate that people stay engaged and cognitive processes associated with naturalistic speech processing remain intact under moderate levels of noise, whereas auditory processing becomes more idiosyncratic to each listener.</p>

                <p>The chemokine CXCL12 plays critical roles in the development of the hippocampus dentate gyrus during both embryogenesis and adulthood. While multiple cell types in the hippocampus express <I>Cxcl12</I>, their individual contributions to the dentate gyrus development and function remain unclear. Here, using <I>Cxcl12</I> reporter mice of both sexes, we characterize <I>Cxcl12</I> expression in Cajal&ndash;Retzius (CR) cells&mdash;neurons that guide dentate gyrus morphogenesis and influence hippocampal circuitry. We show that CR cells prominently express <I>Cxcl12</I> during early postnatal development, although both the number and proportion of <I>Cxcl12</I>-expressing CR cells decline significantly in adulthood. Notably, partial deletion of <I>Cxcl12</I> from hippocampal CR cells in male and female mice does not result in detectable changes in dentate gyrus architecture, adult neurogenesis, or specific behaviors. These findings suggest that CR cell-derived CXCL12 may be less critical for dentate gyrus development than previously assumed and underscore the complexity and potential redundancy of CXCL12 signaling in the hippocampus.</p>

                Plastic waste accumulation is a global environmental issue. Current methods (recycling, incineration, landfilling, etc.) are not a sustainable long-term solution and so far they cannot prevent continuous accumulation of plastic waste worldwide. This article introduces the concept of deep geological disposal (DGD) of plastic waste as an alternative strategy. The concept principally differs from the traditional landfilling. In the latter, plastic waste is affected by chemical, physical, and microbial factors that cause plastic fragmentation and environmental leakage. On the contrary, DGD isolates plastic waste in abandoned mines, quarries and caves, ensuring safe long-term containment of the waste and the possibility of its reuse as a raw material in the future. Another advantage of DGD is that these geological structures usually have transport infrastructure and storage facilities, and, as a result, they offer a more controlled environment with reduced risk of leachate, microplastic dispersion, and surface pollution. The paper discusses the practical, economic, and environmental aspects of the concept of DGD of plastic waste. The proposal does not offer to replace other available mechanisms of plastic waste management, it presents DGD as a complementary and potentially effective method for addressing non-recyclable and mismanaged plastic waste worldwide.

                Background Morbidity and mortality due to tobacco smoking is a public health crisis predicted to rise in coming years with the growing global population. Smoking cessation programs are an important tool to support service users to quit smoking. Understanding how programs are implemented to support the uptake of smoking cessation services may help enhance service design and delivery, service user engagement, and cessation outcomes. Objectives The objective of this review is to evaluate the implementation of smoking cessation programs for adult smokers aged 18 years or older. Rationale Whilst the effectiveness of smoking cessation programs have been previously investigated, there is limited research examining the implementation of programs in practice. This scoping review will provide novel information by evaluating the implementation of smoking cessation programs, including smoking cessation interventions; implementation strategies; and implementation theories, models, and frameworks. Inclusion criteria This review will include the implementation of smoking cessation programs for adults aged 18 years or older, who are daily smokers of tobacco-based cigarettes, accessing a community-based service for smoking cessation support. Methods A search of research databases Medline, CENTRAL, Embase, and Web of Science will be undertaken, in addition to searching for grey literature and hand searches for potential articles for inclusion. Data will be extracted into a spreadsheet and ordered into predetermined categories based on the inclusion criteria; intervention; implementation strategies; and implementation theories, models and/or frameworks. Conclusions This scoping review will evaluate the implementation of smoking cessation services to adults in the community. An evidence map highlighting current knowledge will be developed, contributing to the body of literature on community-based smoking cessation programs. Evidence gaps will be identified, providing direction for future research and service delivery internationally.

                Background The aim of this study is to evaluate the long-term psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on students and technical personnel at healthcare institutions, with a focus on levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Methods A total of 250 participants were included, comprising 130 students from health sciences and 120 individuals from technical fields. In total, 164 participants were females, and 192 participants were aged ≤20 years. A cross-sectional study was conducted using a self-administered electronic questionnaire. The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), followed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), was used to retrospectively assess psychological distress linked to the pandemic. The data were analysed via the chi-square test. Results DASS severity ratings revealed that 41.3% of participants aged ≤20 years experienced severe or extremely severe anxiety, which was statistically significant (p = 0.013). The stress scores were also significantly higher in this age group (p = 0.004). Binary logistic regression analysis indicated that younger age and female sex were significantly associated with increased odds of depression and stress. Males had comparatively lower odds of experiencing psychological distress. Participants from technical fields demonstrated higher odds of anxiety and stress, although not of depression. Conclusion The long-term psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic appears to be more pronounced among younger individuals, females, and technical staff in healthcare institutions. Although students may have greater awareness about the disease, this awareness may contribute to heightened psychological distress.

                Innate immune cells can acquire a form of memory through epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming following exposure to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), resulting in an enhanced, heterologous inflammatory response upon subsequent stimulation, a phenomenon termed trained immunity. This emerging concept challenges the traditional view that immunological memory is restricted to the adaptive immune system and is reshaping current understanding of host defense. Trained immunity is driven by long-lasting functional reprogramming of innate immune cells, particularly monocytes, macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells, and their progenitors, leading to heightened responsiveness to secondary, often unrelated, stimuli. Comparable forms of innate immune memory have been documented across diverse biological systems, including systemic acquired resistance in plants, immune priming in insects, and trained immunity in mammals, highlighting its evolutionary conservation. The capacity of trained immunity to enhance immune responses provides a mechanistic basis for improved protection against reinfection and strengthened tumor surveillance. However, its dysregulated or excessive activation may also contribute to the development of autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases, underscoring its dual and context-dependent nature. Consequently, trained immunity holds significant relevance for a wide range of clinical and translational applications, including infectious disease control, cancer immunotherapy, inflammatory disorders, and vaccine development. Harnessing trained immunity in vaccine design offers promising opportunities to achieve broader protective coverage, prolonged immune durability, and improved vaccine efficacy. Despite these advances, key challenges remain, including elucidating the precise molecular mechanisms underlying trained immunity, understanding its crosstalk with adaptive immune responses, and identifying optimal inducers and adjuvants capable of safely modulating trained immune pathways. Addressing these knowledge gaps will be essential for translating the concept of trained immunity into effective and safe therapeutic and vaccine strategies for human health.

                Background The fast-paced acceptance of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in various sectors of society, such as health, the judiciary, and education, has had several socio-ethical, legal, and human rights consequences. While AI technologies allow for more efficiency and specialization in decision-making processes, the use of such technologies in very sensitive spheres of social life brings with it great potential dangers, such as bias, discrimination, and violation of privacy. Methods The analysis was performed using Biblioshiny, which is the web interface of the Bibliometric R-package and VOSviewer, to ascertain trends in publication rates, citation impact, keyword development, concentration of journals, institutional affiliations, and inter-country contributions. A co-word and cluster analysis was also performed to show the current dominant and emerging themes of the literature and the thematic evolution from 2018 to 2025. The (theo–context–characteristics–methodology TCCM () framework was applied to analyze the theoretical, contextual, characteristic, and methodological gaps in the literature. Results Most of the heavier hits and influential research are found in only a small number of journals and institutions, mainly located in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. There is a predominance of the themes of AI ethics, governance, and data protection. New themes, such as AI governance and algorithmic accountability, have become apparent in recent years. Conclusions This study contributes to the research in the area in that it provides a comprehensive overview of the developments in AI ethics and human rights and also notes the major gaps in this area. A future agenda for research using the TCCM framework is presented, whereby a call is made for the integration of formal ethical theories into the sphere, a move to empirical methodologies, and enhancement of the geographic and sectoral spread of research.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-58/v1?src=rss">A protocol on Perspectives and Health-Seeking Behaviours of men on Prostate Cancer in Rural South Africa: A Qualitative study of survivors and the general population [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract* Background Prostate cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers among men in South Africa, particularly affecting those in rural and underserved communities. Despite growing awareness, late presentation and poor health-seeking behaviour remain significant challenges. Understanding the sociocultural factors that shape men’s experiences and decision-making regarding prostate cancer is essential for improving early detection and care. Objective This study explores the perspectives of prostate cancer survivors and men in the general population on prostate cancer, its prevention, treatment and related health-seeking behaviour in rural South African context. Methods This study adopts a qualitative design. Semi-structured interviews conducted with two purposefully sampled groups: prostate cancer survivors (n=15) and men from the general population with no known diagnosis (n=15), in the OR Tambo District OF THE eastern Cape Province, South Africa. Interviews will be conducted in isiXhosa (the local language), audio recorded, transcribes and translated into English. Data will be analysed thematically using NVivo software. Ethical approval has been obtained from the Walter Sisulu University Human Research Ethics Committee (014/2025), with additional permissions granted by the Eastern Cape Provincial Department of health and Nelson Mandela Academic hospital. Conclusion the findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of individual and community-level factors influencing prostate cancer health-seeking behaviour. This study will generate context-specific qualitative evidence to guide public health policy and prostate cancer awareness campaigns in rural African settings, male-friendly community interventions to promote early detection in rural areas, with broader implications for addressing health inequities in non-communicable disease care.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-57/v1?src=rss">Testicular Histomorphometric Parameters, Reticular Fibres Expression and antioxidant markers Assessment on Testicular Tissue of Methamphetamine-Exposed Wistar Rats Treated with Curcuma longa [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study evaluated the effects of Curcuma longa on histomorphometric parameters and reticular fiber expression in the testes of methamphetamine-exposed Wistar rats. Methods Twenty-five adult male rats were divided into five groups: Group 1 (Normal Control) received distilled water; Group 2 (Methamphetamine-Only) was administered 5 mg/kg b.w. methamphetamine; Group 3 received methamphetamine alongside a low dose of Curcuma longa extract (100 mg/kg b.w.); Group 4 was given methamphetamine with a medium dose of Curcuma longa extract (200 mg/kg b.w.); and Group 5 received methamphetamine and a high dose of Curcuma longa extract (400 mg/kg b.w.), all treatments were administered for 28 days. Histomorphometric analysis (seminiferous tubular diameter, germinal epithelial height) was conducted using ImageJ software, while reticular fibers were visualized via Gomori’s methenamine silver staining. Results Methamphetamine exposure significantly increased reticular fiber density around seminiferous tubules and dilated tubular diameter compared to other groups (p < 0.05). Curcuma longa treatment dose-dependently reversed these alterations, with the High Dose Curcuma longa treated Group (400 mg/kg) showing reduced reticular fiber expression and restored tubular diameter (247.35 ± 4.40 μm), comparable to the normal control group. Germinal epithelial heights remained statistically unchanged across groups, suggesting shorter intervention periods may limit observable epithelial recovery. Tissue anti-oxidant analysis revealed a significant increase (p < 0.05) in superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) levels in the methamphetamine group compared to the control, whereas treatment groups showed significant reductions (p< 0.05) compared to the methamphetamine group. The ameliorative effects of Curcuma longa are attributed to curcumin’s antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties, which mitigate oxidative stress and extracellular matrix remodeling induced by methamphetamine. Conclusions Curcuma longa attenuates methamphetamine-induced testicular damage, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic adjunct for drug-associated male infertility. Further clinical studies are warranted to validate these findings in human populations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-56/v1?src=rss">The Effect of Corporate Governance and Transformational Leadership on Business Strategy and Business Performance Moderated by Government Policy [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The performance of regional-owned multi-business enterprises (BUMD Aneka Usaha) in Indonesia is crucial for regional economic development, yet many still face challenges related to weak corporate governance, leadership, and business strategy. Methods Data were collected through a questionnaire survey administered to 176 directors of regional-owned multi-business enterprises across Indonesia. The data were analysed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM), with higher-order constructs estimated in SmartPLS. Results The findings show that corporate governance, transformational leadership, and business strategy each have positive and significant effects on business performance, and that business strategy mediates the effects of governance and leadership on performance. Government policy also significantly moderates the relationships between corporate governance, transformational leadership, business strategy, and business performance, strengthening their positive impact. Conclusions These results highlight the need to reinforce internal capabilities through stronger governance practices, transformational leadership, and flexible, innovation-oriented strategies, while ensuring a supportive government policy environment so that regional-owned enterprises can improve their sustainable performance and public value creation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-55/v1?src=rss">Enhancing Quality Assurance Monitoring and Evaluation and the Promotion of Competence-Based Education in Uganda: A Case of Kampala International University [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Competence-Based Education (CBE) has become a central reform in higher education, emphasizing mastery of practical skills alongside theoretical knowledge. Kampala International University (KIU) recognizes the importance of aligning its programs with labour market expectations. However, challenges remain in staff understanding, curriculum adaptation, and identification of essential competencies. Quality assurance monitoring and evaluation frameworks are critical in guiding institutions through this transition. Methods The study adopted a cross-sectional design and employed a concurrent mixed-methods approach. A sample of 357 participants was drawn from a population of 5,400, including 328 students, 28 lecturers, and the Director of Quality Assurance. Data were collected using questionnaires and interviews. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation, while qualitative responses were examined through thematic analysis. Results The findings revealed a statistically significant positive relationship between institutional quality assurance monitoring and evaluation and the promotion of CBE. Student responses showed a weak but significant correlation (r (304) = 0.17, p = 0.003), whereas lecturer responses showed a moderate correlation (r (23) = 0.62, p = 0.001). Lecturers perceived their institution as having a well-defined monitoring and evaluation framework, which influenced their professional conduct more strongly than students’ daily learning experiences. Conclusion The study concludes that robust quality assurance mechanisms are essential for advancing CBE implementation. Effective governance structures, organized data management, continuous staff training, and stakeholder participation strengthen institutional readiness and compliance with national standards. These mechanisms ensure that CBE reforms at KIU contribute to sustainable educational transformation and improved workforce preparedness.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Stimulation of nociceptin/orphanin FQ peptide (NOP) opioid receptors by the endogenous ligand nociceptin (Noc) leads to voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel inhibition or G protein inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channel activation. One mechanism of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) desensitization occurs when G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRK) phosphorylate the agonist-bound receptors. In the continued presence of an agonist, Gβγ recruits GRK to the plasma membrane where GPCR are then phosphorylated by GRK. The purpose of this study was to identify the GRK subtype responsible for desensitization of the Noc-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> current inhibition in rat stellate ganglion (SG) neurons. We observed that GRK2 and GRK5 are expressed in SG neurons. Further, silencing either GRK subtype alone or together employing siRNA did not overtly alter their Noc pharmacological profile. We assessed NOP receptor desensitization employing a protocol where the peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> current inhibition was measured during intermittent application of high Noc concentrations in the continued presence of the IC<sub>50</sub> Noc concentration. With this approach, we observed complete Ca<sup>2+</sup> current desensitization in neurons transfected with either scrambled or GRK2 siRNA following exposure to high Noc concentrations. On the other hand, full desensitization of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents was not observed in neurons in which GRK5 was silenced alone or with GRK2. That is, coupling of NOP receptors with Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels was still observed following application of high Noc concentration. These results suggest that GRK5 plays a key role in the mechanism that mediates NOP receptor desensitization in SG neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-54/v1?src=rss">Anger, Aggression and Hostility Assessment Among Medical Students [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Anger, aggression, and hostility are interconnected and are difficult to evaluate. Aggression, in particular, may be a negative behavior and should be minimized. This study aimed to obtain the perceptions of anger, hostility, and aggression among medical students by comparing self-rating detailed assessment tool scores with students’ self, social and academic factors. Methods This cross-sectional study measured the anger, aggression, and hostility of medical students using the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (AGQ). AGQ scores were compared with age, body mass index (BMI), sex, physical activity, academic level, college grade point average (GPA), study duration, gaming, and social media time using t-test, ANOVA, and Spearman’s correlation. Results A total of 138 medical students were included in this study: 109 males (79.0%) and 29 females (21.0%), with ages ranging from 18 to 27 years. The median Total AGQ was 71.5 with an IQR of 43.3. Insignificant results were found comparing total aggression scores (AGQ) with sex or educational levels, with p-value of 0.93 and 0.243, respectively, with the exception of hostility scores (AGQ_Host), which showed a significant association with educational level, with a p-value of 0.023. A significant inverse association was found between physical activity level and both the AGQ and AGQ-Host, with p-values of 0.047 and 0.002, respectively. Finally, GPA had a significant positive correlation with the AGQ-Host, with a p-value of 0.021. Conclusion Physical activity level, educational levels, and GPA were found to be the most influential factors in affecting the AGQ scores among other factors in this study. The use of better coping mechanisms, encouraging physical activity, improving sleep quality, and maintaining proper studying techniques may help reduce the AGQ scores.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-53/v1?src=rss">MorphoCloud: Democratizing Access to High-Performance Computing for Morphological Data Analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The digitization of biological specimens has revolutionized morphology, generating massive 3D datasets such as microCT scans. While open-source platforms like 3D Slicer and SlicerMorph have democratized access to advanced visualization and analysis software, a significant “compute gap” persists. Processing high-resolution 3D data requires high-end GPUs and substantial RAM, resources that are frequently unavailable at Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs) and other educational settings. This “digital divide” prevents many researchers and students from utilizing the very data and software that have been made open to them. Methods We present MorphoCloud, a platform designed to bridge this hardware barrier by providing on-demand, research-grade computing environments via a web browser. MorphoCloud utilizes an “IssuesOps” architecture, where users manage their remote workstations entirely through GitHub Issues using natural-language commands (e.g., /create, /unshelve). The technology stack leverages GitHub Issues and Actions for front-end and orchestration respectively, JetStream2 for backend compute, and Apache Guacamole to deliver a high-performance, GPU-accelerated desktop experience to any modern browser. Results The platform enables a streamlined lifecycle for remote instances, which come pre-configured with the SlicerMorph ecosystem, R/RStudio, and AI-assisted segmentation tools like NNInteractive and MEMOs. Users have access to a persistent storage volume that is decoupled from the instance. For educational purposes, MorphoCloud supports “Workshop” instances that allow for bulk provisioning and stay online continuously for short-term events. This identical environment ensures that instructors can conduct complex 3D workflows without the typical troubleshooting delays caused by heterogeneous student hardware. Conclusion MorphoCloud demonstrates that true scientific accessibility requires not just open data and software, but also open infrastructure. By abstracting the complexities of cloud administration into a simple, command-driven interface, MorphoCloud empowers researchers at under-resourced institutions to engage in high-performance morphological analysis and AI-assisted segmentation.
