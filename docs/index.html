">Lipid nanoparticle-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 delivery enables efficient trabecular meshwork gene editing in mice</a></h4>

              
                Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as a transformative platform for mRNA delivery, enabling vaccines and gene editing with transient expression and high cargo capacity. However, their potential for ocular gene editing remains underexplored. In this study, we assessed the transduction efficiency, inflammatory response, and gene editing capability of LNP-encapsulated mRNA in murine eyes. Intravitreal delivery of LNPs achieved targeted mRNA expression in the trabecular meshwork (TM) with superior specificity and efficiency compared to adenoviral or adeno-associated viral vectors, while inducing minimal microglial activation in the retina. Using LNPs co-encapsulating SpCas9 mRNA and sgRNA, we demonstrated efficient CRISPR-mediated knockout (KO) of Matrix Gla Protein (Mgp), a key inhibitor of TM calcification. Mgp-KO eyes exhibited sustained intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation and anterior chamber deepening with normal anterior chamber angle, recapitulating key features of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Chronic IOP elevation led to reactive Muller gliosis and ganglion cell complex thinning, reflecting retinal stress and progressive neurodegeneration. Our findings establish LNP-CRISPR as a safe and efficient system for TM-targeted gene editing, with broad applicability in glaucoma pathogenesis modelling and therapeutic discovery.

">Mice discriminate odour source distance via sub-sniff temporal features of odour plumes</a></h4>

              
                Rodents rely on olfaction to navigate complex environments, particularly where visual cues are limited. Yet how they estimate the distance to an odour source remains unclear. The spatiotemporal dynamics of natural odour plumes, shaped by airflow turbulence, offer valuable cues for locating odour sources. Here, we show that mice can discriminate odour sources placed at different distances by extracting information from the sub-sniff temporal structure of naturalistic odour plumes. Using a wind tunnel and an olfactory virtual reality system, we generated dynamic plumes and demonstrated, through high-throughput automated behaviour, that mice distinguish near from far sources based on odour fluctuations operating faster than their respiratory cycle. Two-photon calcium imaging of olfactory bulb projection neurons revealed that distance-dependent responses are present in a small subset of mitral and tufted cells, and that population activity encodes source distance. Critically, neural responses correlated more strongly with high-frequency plume features than with mean odour concentration. Our results identify a neural basis for distance estimation from odour dynamics and highlight the importance of rapid temporal processing in mammalian olfaction.

">Preventing light-induced toxicity in a new mouse model of rhodopsin sector retinitis pigmentosa</a></h4>

              
                Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited retinal dystrophy characterized by the progressive loss of rod photoreceptors. Sector RP is a form of RP, where degeneration originates in the inferior retina, mainly influenced by light exposure. Over 200 RHO variants are pathogenic and associated with autosomal dominant RP. RHOM39R is one of the most common RHO variants linked to sector RP in the UK. A knock-in (KI) mouse model expressing RhoM39R was generated and characterized to investigate the mechanisms of degeneration associated with this variant and explore novel therapeutic strategies for rhodopsin sector RP. Under ambient light, RhoM39R/+ KI mice exhibited impaired retinal function by ERG, with some defects in OS ultrastructure, but retained normal outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness. Repeated exposure to bright light led to photoreceptor loss. In contrast, RhoM39R/M39R KI mice in ambient light displayed severe retinal dysfunction, ONL thinning, and grossly abnormal OS ultra structure. In homozygous mice, a single bright light exposure significantly reduced ONL thickness within 48 h. The rescue of these models was achieved through reduced light exposure and pharmacological intervention. Rearing in dim red light (red cage condition) restored ERG responses in RhoM39R/+ KI mice and improved ONL thickness in RhoM39R/M39R KI mice. Transcriptomic analysis in RhoM39R/M39R KI mice revealed upregulation of Sphingosine 1-P Receptor (S1PR) transcripts. Treatment with the S1PR agonist Fingolimod (FTY720) before bright light exposure significantly reduced degeneration, demonstrating a protective effect in both heterozygous and homozygous models and suggesting potential a therapeutic approach for sector RP patients.

">Arithmetic learning is associated with developmental increases in similarity between brain activity and artificial neural networks</a></h4>

              
                The ability to learn simple arithmetic is often thought to rely on the associative nature of human memory, where repeated exposure to arithmetic problems strengthens the relations between operands and outcomes. This view is reminiscent of learning in large language artificial neural networks (ANNs), where training involves statistical associations between symbolic inputs and outputs. Based on this parallel, we hypothesized that brain activity during arithmetic problem-solving should be increasingly similar to ANN-derived representations with learning and development. We used fMRI to investigate the relation between brain activity during single-digit addition problem-solving and ANN features in 104 participants across four age groups (8-, 11-, 14-year-olds, and adults). Vertex-wise encoding models were used to predict brain activity using latent features extracted from pre-trained ANNs. Results revealed that the ANN-based model better predicted arithmetic-related activity in older than younger participants in a specific region of the left precentral sulcus. Prediction accuracy was higher for smaller than larger problems, consistent with the idea that associations between problems may decrease in strength with problem size. Furthermore, ANN prediction patterns aligned with a model in which each addition problem was increasingly represented separately with age. On the one hand, these findings may support the idea that, with learning and development, some neural representations of arithmetic problems become discretely organized in memory and increasingly resemble ANN-like processing. On the other hand, the lack of relation between the ANN-based model and activity in other brain regions suggests some degree of dissimilarity between arithmetic processing in humans and ANNs, suggesting the existence of additional mechanisms for simple arithmetic learning in humans.

">Enhancing Biomedical Optical Volumetric Imaging via Self-Supervised Orthogonal Learning</a></h4>

              
                Optical volumetric imaging grapples with inherent noise problems arising from photon budget constraints, light scattering, and space-bandwidth product bottlenecks, all of which degrade structural fidelity and become even more pronounced than in planar imaging. While deep learning presents potential for denoising, supervised methods are hindered by the impracticality of paired datasets, and existing self-supervised approaches fail to fully exploit the intrinsic volumetric structural redundancy inherent to optical imaging. Here, we present a self-supervised Volumetric biomedicAL Imaging Denoiser (VALID) that leverages intrinsic three-dimensional spatial coherence for highly efficient volumetric denoising through a self-supervised orthogonal learning framework. VALID demonstrates robust denoising performance across diverse imaging modalities, including two- and three-photon microscopy, light-field microscopy, and optical coherence tomography, substantially enhancing structural fidelity in deep-tissue, multimodal, and dynamic imaging scenarios. By combining computational efficiency with zero-shot adaptability, VALID establishes a transformative approach to volumetric image enhancement with structure-aware precision.

">The temporal and perceptual characteristics of emotion-induced blindness</a></h4>

              
                Attentional capture by emotionally salient stimuli is adaptive, permitting identification of possible threats; however, an excessive bias towards emotional stimuli can interrupt goal-directed behavior. This is especially relevant in psychiatric disease, where severe emotional distress can interfere with daily function. As such, understanding the mechanisms by which emotional stimuli compete for attentional resources is a critical area of investigation. Previous studies using rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigms observe that emotional distractors disrupt the detection of subsequent stimuli, referred to as emotion-induced blindness (EIB). Our study expands upon this work, characterizing how temporal and perceptual factors shape the emergence and intensity of EIB. Contrary to previous assumptions regarding temporal dynamics of EIB, we found that effects of emotional distractors persisted across prolonged image presentation durations. Further, we investigated the extent to which the depth of distractor processing influences EIB using a distractor recall task. While recall was predictive of EIB magnitude, a significant effect of emotional distractors on target detection was nonetheless present even without conscious recall of the distractor. These findings demonstrate the robustness of the EIB effect in RSVP in the context of temporal and perceptual manipulations.

">Global motor system suppression as the primary mechanism of human action stopping: challenging the pause-then-cancel model</a></h4>

              
                The ability to stop a planned or ongoing action is fundamental to inhibitory control. A recent theory proposes that stopping involves two distinct phases: an initial global suppression of motor activity ("pause") followed by a selective cancellation of the targeted action. However, the necessity of a second "cancel" stage remains debated. We tested whether global suppression alone is sufficient to stop movement by analysing electromyography from task-relevant agonist and antagonist muscles, alongside transcranial magnetic stimulation measures of global motor suppression from task-irrelevant muscles, during a stop-signal task in adult human participants of both sexes. In Experiment 1, reanalysis of ballistic finger movements revealed that agonist muscle offset consistently preceded behavioural stopping, aligning with the time course of global suppression. In Experiment 2, we extended these findings to whole-arm reaching movements, demonstrating that global motor suppression persisted beyond the termination of muscle activity when stopping prevented movement initiation, but disengaged in time for antagonist activation used to interrupt movements once they had begun. These findings challenge the pause-then-cancel model, instead supporting a single-stage global suppression framework. They also suggest that the global suppression mechanism is not a rigid, top-down stopping mechanism but rather part of a broader motor control system that flexibly adjusts movement commands based on task demands.

">Hypoxia and Cognitive Ability in Humans: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</a></h4>

              
                This systematic and meta-analytical review examined how a reduction in oxygen availability to tissue (hypoxia) affects cognitive function. Hypoxia had a moderate-to-large detrimental effect on general cognitive ability and across domains, including memory, attention, executive function, processing speed, and psychomotor speed. Increased hypoxic severity was associated with greater declines in general cognitive ability and executive function, while longer duration of exposure was associated with greater declines in executive function and psychomotor speed. Participant age was a moderator for executive function and psychomotor speed, with older adults experiencing greater impairments. For executive function and psychomotor speed, the magnitude of these effects was less pronounced during intermittent and hypobaric exposures, potentially due to adaptive physiological mechanisms. While our models accounted for exposure characteristics and age of participants, substantial unexplained variance remained. These findings highlight hypoxias impact on cognition and emphasize the need to investigate underlying neurophysiological mechanisms that may influence individual vulnerability.

">Volitional and forced running ability in mice lacking intact primary motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                The coordination of various brain regions achieves both volitional and forced motor control, but the role of the primary motor cortex in proficient running motor control remains unclear. This study trained mice to run at high performance (>10,000 rotations per day or >2,700 rotations per hour) using a running wheel, and then assessed the effects of the removal of bilateral cortical areas including the primary motor cortex on volitional and forced running locomotion. The control sham-operated group revealed a quick recovery of volitional running, reaching half of the maximum daily rotation in 3.9 +/- 2.6 days (n = 10). In contrast, the cortical injury group took significantly a longer period (7.0 +/- 3.3 days, n = 15) to reach half of the maximum volitional daily rotation, but recovered to preoperative levels in about two weeks. Furthermore, even 3 days after surgery to remove cortical regions, the running time on a treadmill moving at 35.3 cm/sec, which is difficult for naive mice to run on, was not significantly different from that in the sham-operated group. These results suggest that the intact primary motor cortex is not necessarily required to execute trained fast-running locomotion, but rather contributes to the spontaneity of running in mice.

">Pervasive homeobox gene function in the male-specific nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                We explore here how neuronal cell type diversity is genetically delineated in the context of the large, but poorly studied male-specific nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Mostly during postembryonic development, the C. elegans male adds 93 male-specific neurons, falling into 25 cardinal classes, to the predominantly embryonically generated, sex-shared nervous system, comprised of 294 neurons (116 cardinal classes). Using engineered reporter alleles, we investigate here the expression pattern of 40 phylogenetically conserved homeodomain proteins within the male-specific nervous system of C. elegans, demonstrating that in aggregate, the expression of these homeodomain proteins covers each individual male-specific neuron. We show that the male-specific nervous system can be subdivided along the anterior/posterior axis in HOX cluster expression domains. The extent of our expression analysis predicts that each individual neuron class is likely defined by unique combinations of homeodomain proteins. Using a collection of newly available molecular markers, we undertake a mutant analysis of five of these genes (unc-30, unc-42, lim-6, lin-11, ttx-1) and identified defects in cell fate specification and/or male copulatory defects in each of these mutant strains. Our analysis expands our understanding of the importance of homeobox genes in nervous system development and function.

                -Klotho is a multifunctional protein widely recognized for its anti-aging and neuroprotective properties. This study investigates the expression and localization of the secreted Klotho (s-KL) isoform in the human brain and its potential role in Alzheimer's disease. Using RT-qPCR, we observed that the s-KL transcript predominates over the membrane-bound KL (m-KL) in multiple brain regions, a pattern consistent in macaques and lemurs. Immunohistochemistry and immunoprecipitation assays confirmed the presence of the s-KL protein in human and mouse brain parenchyma, revealing species-specific cellular localization. In human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), s-KL constitutes ~28% of total KL, with levels significantly reduced in mild dementia-AD patients. These findings underscore s-KL's potential neuroprotective role and highlight its differential regulation and expression during AD progression.

">Macrophage migration inhibitory factor is a potential therapeutic target for cisplatin induced peripheral neuropathy in breast cancer</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cisplatin (CP) is an effective chemotherapy drug for several cancers. However, the use of CP is associated with peripheral neuropathy, a painful nerve disorder. Unfortunately, no therapies are available for CP-induced peripheral neuropathy (CisIPN). This study explored the role of a cytokine, the macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), as a potential therapeutic target for CisIPN. Methods: The role of neuroinflammation and MIF in CisIPN was evaluated in mice models of CisIPN, with and without breast cancer, after treatment with the anti-inflammatory drug Dexamethasone (Dex). Circulating MIF levels in animals were examined using ELISA. Pharmacological inhibition of MIF was achieved using the small molecule inhibitors, CPSI-1306 and ISO-1. Mechanical and thermal sensitivities of animals were assessed using von frey filament and cold acetone assays. Macrophage infiltration in peripheral nerve tissues was examined using CD68 and Iba-1 staining. Results: Our results showed that Dex suppressed mechanical hyperalgesia in CisIPN animals, which was accompanied by downregulation of MIF. We also found that circulating MIF levels were increased in CisIPN animals. Furthermore, direct inhibition of MIF using CPSI-1306 and ISO-1 led to suppression of mechanical hyperalgesia, without compromising the anti-tumor efficacy of CP, in CisIPN animals. We did not find any significant change in macrophage infiltration in the peripheral nerve tissues of CisIPN animals. Immunostaining results indicated that sensory neurons in the DRGs and Schwann Cells in the sciatic nerves are potential sources for increased MIF in CisIPN. Interpretation: Overall, our results strongly suggest that MIF is a promising therapeutic target for CisIPN.

                Functional recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) is hindered by the limited ability of axons to regenerate in the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS). Overcoming this barrier is critical for achieving effective recovery. Axonal regeneration depends on the activation of intracellular processes like transcription factor induction, protein and lipid trafficking, and cytoskeletal remodelling. Targeting these pathways offers a promising approach for promoting neuronal repair. This study examined the combined therapeutic effects of dibutyryl-cAMP (db-cAMP), which primes neurons for growth, and integrin 9 overexpression, which supports axonal extension. Using in vitro models with dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and astrocytes, as well as an in vivo SCI model, we evaluated the potential of this approach. In vitro, the combination of db-cAMP and integrin 9 significantly enhanced neuronal growth. However, in vivo results were less consistent, with db-cAMP affecting AAV-mediated transcription and the expression of tenascin C (TnC) in neurons and astrocytes. These findings highlight the potential of modulating intracellular signalling and integrin activation but underscore the challenges posed by the complexity of the in vivo environment. Further studies are necessary to unravel these mechanisms and refine therapeutic strategies for effective SCI recovery.

">See-through science: Danionella cerebrum as a model for neuroregeneration</a></h4>

              
                Rebuilding functional neuronal circuits after injury in the adult central nervous system (CNS) is unachievable for many vertebrates. In pro-regenerative models, it is unclear how regeneration and re-wiring is achieved in the CNS over long distances. The size and opacity of the adult vertebrate brain makes it difficult to study axon topography and dynamic cellular interactions during long-distance axon regeneration. Here, we harnessed the properties of the small and transparent adult Danionella cerebrum for longitudinal in vivo imaging of retinal ganglion cell axon regeneration, correlating cellular events with functional recovery. Our results suggest that some axons regenerate along tracts of degenerating myelin debris. However, the topography of re-innervation is different after regeneration, suggesting that new axon tracts are created to restore functional vision. The D. cerebrum model provides a unique opportunity to visualize and experimentally manipulate the spatial and temporal events during CNS regeneration in intact adult vertebrates.

">Inhibition of phosphodiesterase 4B as a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of refractory epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Despite the availability of nearly 40 approved anti-seizure medications (ASMs), at least one-third of individuals with epilepsy remain refractory to treatment, and many experience life-limiting cognitive or psychiatric side effects. Using a machine learning-guided platform, we identified PDE4 as an underexplored anti-seizure target, which became further validated based on its enriched expression in seizure-relevant brain regions and its potential to modulate excitatory/inhibitory neuronal tone via cAMP signaling. The pan-PDE4 inhibitor crisaborole partially protected against hyperthermia-induced seizures and reduced spontaneous seizures in Scn1a+/- mice, while rolipram and roflumilast showed no efficacy at tolerable doses. SN-2000, a first-in-kind allosteric modulator of PDE4B, was rationally designed for isoform selectivity and brain penetration, and demonstrated versatile reduction of seizure activity across multiple zebrafish and rodent genetic and acquired epilepsy models, with efficacy comparable to standard-of-care ASMs. SN-2000 also demonstrated favorable behavioral outcomes, reducing post-ictal aggression and anxiety-like behaviors, and improving cognitive performance in both wild-type and epileptic mice. These effects were linked to paradoxical regulation of excitatory and neuronal activity in the cortex and thalamus of epileptic mice, respectively, as well as elevated cAMP signaling and downstream pCREB activation. Together, these findings support PDE4B inhibition as a disease-relevant mechanism in epilepsy, and position SN-2000 as a promising therapeutic candidate offering seizure control without the neuropsychiatric burden of existing ASMs and potential pro-cognitive properties.

">Characterising the neural time-courses of food attribute representations</a></h4>

              
                Dietary decisions involve the consideration of multiple, often conflicting, food attributes that precede the computation of an overall value for a food. The differences in the speed at which attributes are processed play an important role; however, it is unknown whether different attributes are processed over distinct time windows. We mapped the neural time-courses of 12 choice-relevant food attributes. Participants (N = 110) viewed food images while we recorded brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG). A separate group of participants (N = 421) rated the same images on nutritive properties (healthiness, calorie content, edibility, and level of transformation), hedonic properties (tastiness, willingness to eat, negative and positive valence, and arousal), and familiarity (previous exposure, recognisability, and typicality). Using representational similarity analysis, we quantified differences in patterns of multivariate EEG signals across foods and assessed whether the structure of these differences was correlated with differences in attribute ratings. We observed similar correlation time-courses for many attributes. There was an early window of correlations (~200 ms from image onset), followed by sustained windows of correlation from ~400-650 ms. Using principal components analysis, we identified a set of broader constructs that accounted for variance in ratings across multiple attributes, and also correlated with the EEG data. Our results indicate that food attributes important for choice are represented rapidly and in parallel, over similar time windows. Furthermore, we reveal that broad dimensions underlying individual attributes are also represented in the neural activity with distinct time-courses, indicating a multilevel structure of food attribute representations.

">Direct interoceptive input to the insular cortex shapes learned feeding behavior</a></h4>

              
                The insular cortex (insula) is an interoceptive hub, which senses internal states such as hunger, thirst, pain, and emotions. Previous studies, however, suggest that the insula directly senses internal states, but the mechanisms remain elusive. We identified a novel population of glutamatergic leptin receptor-positive (LepR+) cells with a unique morphology in the insula (INSLepR). Based on leptin's known role in signaling adiposity levels, we hypothesized that INS-LepR neurons detect internal states and thus regulate food intake and body weight. Accordingly, we found that leptin administration in the insula increases intrinsic excitability of INSLepR cells, suppresses feeding, and reduces body weight. Moreover, optogenetic stimulation of INSLepR cells suppresses learned operant feeding and leads to avoidance in a real time place preference context. We also found that INSLepR neurons encode operant feeding bouts, and their activity is modulated specifically by hunger, but not thirst, states. Single-nuclei sequencing and ribosome profiling revealed that INSLepR is expressed on both Layer 6 neurons and on vascular cells, suggesting that leptin can be delivered directly through receptor-mediated transport through the blood brain barrier into the insula. . INSLepR neurons form mainly local connections within the insula and an external projection to the basolateral amygdala (BLA), and optogenetic stimulation of BLA terminals also regulated learned operant feeding. Moreover, we found that administration of leptin alters insula neural dynamics in response to feeding, but not drinking, behavior, and reshapes the transcriptome, suggesting that internal state information provided by leptin is used by the insula to coordinate feeding behavior. Taken together, our data supports a model for direct interoceptive input to the insula, in which INSLepR cells integrate adiposity level signals to regulate feeding and body weight in a learned manner.

">Visual Field Inhomogeneities Shape Visual Working Memory</a></h4>

              
                It is a topic of scientific debate whether early visual cortex (V1) is essential for creating visual working memory (vWM) representations. The current study aimed to replicate and expand previous research regarding the role of structural properties of V1 in vWM retention. Structural properties of V1, particularly visual field inhomogeneities (including visual field and polar angle asymmetries), were investigated to link interindividual differences in vWM performance to V1 structural differences. 292 participants underwent the MRI scan with the multiparametric mapping sequence, resulting in four microstructural maps per participant: magnetization transfer (MT), proton density (PD), longitudinal relaxation rate (R1), and transverse relaxation rate (R2*). During a separate session, the participants performed the vWM task. Both visual field and polar angle asymmetries were present in our dataset. We replicated behavioral asymmetries in vWM shown in previous studies, particularly the inverted polarity of the vertical meridian asymmetry (VMA) and found a link between VMA and R2* values in V1. This suggests a potential role of cortical iron content in V1 for vWM, particularly along the vertical meridian of the visual field, supporting the sensory recruitment hypothesis, thus indicating that early visual areas are crucial for vWM retention.

">Early development of direction selectivity in higher visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                A fundamental aspect of visual motion processing is the computation of motion direction. In ferrets, as in primates, selectivity for motion direction is found both in early cortical stages like the primary visual cortex (V1) and in higher visual areas like primate MT and ferret PMLS. Little is known about how this critical tuning function develops in higher visual cortex. Here, by studying the development of the ferret's motion pathway, we first reveal the surprising finding that direction selectivity develops earlier in PMLS than in V1, contrary to the areas' hierarchical positions. Our data furthermore show that while direction selectivity is sensitive to visual experience in both areas, the sensitivity profile differs between them: Moving stimuli, containing both spatial and temporal cues, are required to promote direction selectivity development in V1, but flashing stimuli that remain stationary spatially are sufficient for direction selectivity development in PMLS. Collectively, our findings reveal that the development of the motion pathway is highly complex when considered at the network level, and does not adhere to a simple feedforward model in which the development of lower visual areas sets the pace for higher ones. Not only will developmental models need to be updated to include this complexity, characterizing the link between the development of different visual areas will likely also be crucial for understanding the consequences of developmental disorders.

                Background Anemia is defined as a condition in which the number of red blood cells or the hemoglobin concentration within them is lower than normal. Objectives To determine the prevalence of anemia and the associated factors among adults residing in the UAE. The study also aims to assess the knowledge about anemia among the study population. Materials and Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among the adults residing in the UAE using a self-administered questionnaire. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 29. A score of six and higher was considered above average, whereas below six was considered below average knowledge. A chi-square test and logistic regression were done. Results Around 8.9% of participants currently had anemia. Around 100% of participants with secondary qualifications knew average compared to 93.5% of postgraduate participants with below-average knowledge about anemia. Consumption of dates, jaggery/molasses, beef liver, and sardines possessed statistically significant associations. Conclusion 8.9% of adults in the UAE are diagnosed with anemia. Consumption of dates, jaggery/molasses, beef liver, and sardines are the statistically significant factors associated. Knowledge about anemia is associated with age, gender, education, employment, marital status and the emirate of residence.

                <p>by Grace E. Johnson, Chenyi Fei, Ned S. Wingreen, Bonnie L. Bassler</p>

Bacteria commonly exist in multicellular, surface-attached communities called biofilms. Biofilms are central to ecology, medicine, and industry. The <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> pathogen forms biofilms from single founder cells that, via cell division, mature into three-dimensional structures with distinct, yet reproducible, regional architectures. To define mechanisms underlying biofilm developmental transitions, we establish a single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) approach that enables accurate quantitation of spatiotemporal gene-expression patterns in biofilms at cell-scale resolution. smFISH analyses of <i>V. cholerae</i> biofilm regulatory and structural genes demonstrate that, as biofilms mature, overall matrix gene expression decreases, and simultaneously, a pattern emerges in which matrix gene expression becomes largely confined to peripheral biofilm cells. Both quorum sensing and c-di-GMP-signaling are required to generate the proper temporal pattern of matrix gene expression. Quorum sensing signaling is uniform across the biofilm, and thus, c-di-GMP-signaling alone sets the regional matrix gene expression pattern. The smFISH strategy provides insight into mechanisms conferring particular fates to individual biofilm cells.

In the glucose-free environment of the midgut of the tsetse fly vector, the procyclic forms of <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i> primarily consume proline to feed its central carbon and energy metabolism. In this context, the parasite produces through gluconeogenesis, glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), the precursor of essential metabolic pathways, from proline catabolism. We show here that the parasite uses three different enzymes to perform the key gluconeogenic reaction producing fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) from fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, (<i>i</i>) fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), the canonical enzyme performing this reaction, (<i>ii</i>) sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (SBPase), and (<i>iii</i>) more surprisingly ATP-dependent phosphofructokinase (PFK), an enzyme considered to irreversibly catalyze the opposite reaction involved in glycolysis. These three enzymes, as well as six other glycolytic/gluconeogenic enzymes, are located in peroxisome-related organelles, named glycosomes. Incorporation of <sup>13</sup>C-enriched glycerol (a more effective alternative to proline for monitoring gluconeogenic activity) into F6P and G6P was more affected in the PFK null mutant than in the FBPase null mutant, suggesting the PFK contributes at least as much as FBPase to gluconeogenesis. We also showed that glucose deprivation did not affect the quantities of PFK substrates and products, whereas an approximately 500-fold increase in the substrate/product ratio was expected for PFK to carry out the gluconeogenic reaction. In conclusion, we show for the first time that ATP-dependent PFK can function in vivo in the gluconeogenic direction, even in the presence of FBPase activity. This particular feature, which precludes loss of ATP through a futile cycle involving PFK and FBPase working simultaneously in the glycolytic and gluconeogenic directions, respectively, is possibly due to the supramolecular organization of the metabolic pathway within glycosomes to overcome thermodynamic barriers through metabolic channeling.

                Background Chagas disease (CD) is a neglected tropical disease endemic to Latin America, has emerged as a global health concern due to the migration of infected individuals. With its epidemiological complexity, by difficulty to obtain appropriate diagnoses and poor treatment, the search for novel therapeutic options remains. Methods In this context, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of preclinical studies employing animal models to verify the progress in CD treatment. We searched the PubMed database for CD treatment studies published between 1990 and 2023, adhering to the PRISMA guidelines. Results Twelve papers met the inclusion criteria. The findings indicate that the fifteen treatment alternatives examined, mainly between 2010 and 2014, demonstrated efficacy in experimental CD models, evidenced by significant parasitemia reduction. Bis-triazole DO870 and VNI were effective in the acute and chronic phases, respectively. However, of these emerging therapies, only posaconazole and fexinidazole have progressed to clinical trials, yielding unsatisfactory outcomes as CD monotherapies Conclusions This meta-analysis highlights the existence of promising new drug candidates for CD treatment, but most remain in the preclinical stages. Those that reached clinical trials did not demonstrate optimal results, underscoring the ongoing challenges in CD therapy. Collaborative efforts among the academic community, pharmaceutical industries, funding agencies, and government agencies are urgently needed to accelerate the development of more effective medications against CD.

                Background Breast cancer remains a significant global health concern, with over 7.8 million cases reported in the last five years. Early detection and accurate classification are crucial for reducing mortality rates and improving outcomes. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a transformative tool in medical imaging, enabling more efficient and accurate diagnostic processes. Objective This study aims to develop a machine learning-based predictive model for early detection and classification of breast cancer using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset. Methods The dataset, comprising 569 samples and 32 features derived from fine needle aspirate biopsy images, was pre-processed through data cleaning, normalization using the Robust Scaler, and feature selection. Five supervised ML algorithms—Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classification (SVC) with linear and radial basis function (RBF) kernels, Decision Tree, and Random Forest—were implemented. Models were evaluated using performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 scores. Results The SVC-RBF model demonstrated the highest accuracy (98.68%) and balanced performance across other metrics, making it the most effective classifier for distinguishing between benign and malignant tumors. Key features such as texture mean and area (worst) significantly contributed to classification accuracy. Conclusions This study highlights the potential of ML algorithms, particularly SVC-RBF, to revolutionize breast cancer diagnostics through improved accuracy and efficiency. Future research should validate these findings with diverse datasets and explore their integration into clinical workflows to enhance decision-making and patient care.

                Background Women’s studies in Latin America are transcendental because they make visible and challenge gender inequalities to achieve a more just and equitable society. However, despite this, there are still many research gaps, for which the objective is to examine the trends in research on women’s studies in Latin America. Methods An exploratory methodology based on bibliometric analysis is proposed to evaluate the scientific literature, based on the parameters of the PRISMA-2020 declaration. Results The bibliometric analysis reveals a growth in women’s studies in Latin America, reflecting its importance and relevance. Scientific production has experienced exponential growth, with leading researchers and journals. The United States and Canada lead scientific production. A change is observed in the topics addressed, focusing more on gender and equality. The thematic clusters identified highlight priority areas such as politics, institutions and representation. Conclusions Emerging keywords include neoliberalism, gender violence, political participation, female empowerment, and femicide, reflecting new concerns and challenges addressed in gender studies in Latin America.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-483/v2?src=rss">A study of clinical profile in patients of cataracts with pseudoexfoliation in rural populations of central India [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Ophthalmologists deal with daily pseudoexfoliation (PXF) due to severe secondary glaucoma, which arises after cataract surgery. Cataracts with pseudoexfoliation are age-related and are associated with open-angle glaucoma. Therefore, pseudoexfoliation is expected to occur more frequently. Pseudoexfoliation is occasionally associated with the development of thick nuclear cataracts, which may make surgery challenging. risks of cataract extraction in patients with pseudoexfoliation include zonular weakness and inadequate pupillary dilation. This may cause vitreous loss, and intraoperative or postoperative lens displacement. It could also lead to a rise in postoperative intraocular pressure (IOP), progressing to long-term inflammation, phimosis of the capsular tissue, glaucoma, and surgical corneal decompensation. Recurrent secondary cataracts are typically caused by some remaining cortical tissue and decreased zonular support, which may lead to lens epithelial cell migration. Surgery for glaucoma and cataracts is complicated by the presence of pseudoexfoliative debris. Objectives To determine the prevalence of pseudoexfoliation in cataract patients visiting the ophthalmic OPD, AVBRH hospital, to locate patients with pseudoexfoliative cataracts, to evaluate their likelihood of progressing to open-angle glaucoma, and to examine the various ocular characteristics of these patients. Methodology The study participants will undergo ophthalmological examination after considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria. This examination will include sac syringing on the lacrimal gland, estimation of the highest corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp examination, application tonometer assessment of intraocular pressure (IOP), and fundus examination using an indirect ophthalmoscope. All individuals with cataracts visiting the ophthalmology department of AVBRH will be examined under a slit-lamp to determine the presence of pseudoexfoliation in the operating eye. Expected Results Hospital statistics from India indicated that the percentage of patients with pseudoexfoliation, in addition to cataracts, ranges from 1.87% to 13.5%.

                <p>A host of acquired abnormalities in visual function are known to occur in persons who suffer stroke, traumatic brain injury, and neurodegenerative disorders. Cerebral visual impairment occurs in children with early neurological injury or disorders, especially neonatal hypoxic-ischemic injury. With the improved survival of pre-term infants through meticulous neonatal intensive care unit care, cerebral visual impairment in children has become much more common in developed countries. In recent months a number of National Institutes of Health institutes and the American Academy of Pediatrics have brought new attention to this major public health problem, which is highly relevant to child neurologists, neuro-ophthalmologists, as well as the general neurologists who will care for affected individuals as they enter adulthood.

<p>The need for pragmatic clinical trials evaluating therapeutic interventions in patients with neurological disease is continually increasing due to availability of multiple therapeutic interventions (comparative effectiveness), multifaceted approaches (multiple concurrent synergistic therapeutic interventions), and gaps in trial-specific and real-world population outcomes. Several designs for pragmatic trials are available, including individual randomized trials with pragmatic characteristics, cluster-randomized and non-randomized trials, and observational prospective cohort studies. Cluster trials may have parallel cluster and crossover (unidirectional, bidirectional, and alternating crossover) designs. There are unique aspects of consenting and data collection leveraging existing registries, electronic health records (EHRs), and claims data that make pragmatic trials most suited to study the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions in patients with neurological diseases in real-world settings.

                <p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) and Alzheimer's disease are neurodegenerative diseases with age-related disability accumulation. In MS, inflammation spans decades, whereas AD is characterized by Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). Few studies explore accumulation of amyloids in MS. We examined Aβ deposition and NFT density in temporal and frontal cortices from postmortem MS (<i>n</i> = 75) and control (<i>n</i> = 66) cases. Compared with controls, MS cases showed reduced Aβ, especially in those aged &lt;65 years, and reduced NFT, notably in cases aged &gt;65 years. Aβ deposition predicted greater NFT density both in MS cases and controls. MS-related factors may affect Aβ/NFT deposition and/or clearance, offering new therapeutic insights for both diseases.

                <p><i>UNC13A</i> (rs12608932-CC) is associated with both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and shortens survival in ALS. We aim to describe the association for <i>UNC13A</i> and survival in FTD. We included 626 patients with FTD from Dutch memory clinics, including a subcohort of 150 patients with TDP-43 pathology. Survival analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard models in a recessive manner. Homozygosity for rs12608932-C in <i>UNC13A</i> was associated with a shorter survival compared with other genotypes (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02–1.60, <i>p</i> = 0.033), which has implications for patient counselling and trial design.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite diagnostic criteria refinements, Parkinson's disease (PD) clinical diagnosis still suffers from a not satisfying accuracy, with the post-mortem examination as the gold standard for diagnosis. Seminal clinicopathological series highlighted that a relevant number of patients alive-diagnosed with idiopathic PD have an alternative post-mortem diagnosis. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of PD comparing the in-vivo clinical diagnosis with the post-mortem diagnosis performed through the pathological examination in 2 groups.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this retrospective case–control study, patients and healthy subjects who consented to the post-mortem pathological diagnosis at the UK Brain Bank were consecutively enrolled from the UK Brain Bank. Medical records were reviewed to classify participants and performance metrics were further calculated using neuropathological diagnosis as the gold standard.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Four thousand five hundred seventy one subjects were eligible for the study. The clinical diagnosis group was: 1,048 Parkinson's patients and 1,242 healthy subjects. Pathology diagnosis group were: 996 Parkinson's patients and 1,288 subjects with no post-mortem abnormality. For the group of clinical diagnosis, PD diagnosis showed: sensitivity of 99%, specificity of 86%, accuracy of 90.96%, F1-Score 0.89, and a receiver operating characteristics area under the curve (ROC AUC) 0.925 (SE ± 0.006) [95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.913, 0.937], 𝑝&lt;0.001. In this group, the most frequent pathology diagnosis among clinically misdiagnosed PD (false positive) patients was dementia with Lewy bodies (19.4%). Conversely, the most frequent clinical diagnosis among PD missed clinical diagnosis (false negative) patients was Alzheimer's disease (18.5%).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings confirm a still significant diagnostic error and emphasize the need for more fine and homogeneous criteria to classify idiopathic Parkinson's patients correctly. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:1110–1121</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of heparin-binding protein (HBP) in cerebrospinal fluid for the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis in patients with a suspected central nervous system infection.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This prospective multicenter cohort study determined the diagnostic accuracy of HBP in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for bacterial meningitis among a cohort of consecutive patients with a suspected central nervous infection. The final clinical diagnosis was considered the reference standard. The results were validated in a separate cohort.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 631 Dutch patients were evaluated for the current study, of which 73 (12%) had a final diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. For the differentiation of bacterial meningitis from all other disorders, diagnostic accuracy was high with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.96–1.00). With the proposed cutoff of 5.2 ng/ml, sensitivity was 97% with a specificity of 96%. In the population of patients with a CSF leukocyte count of 5-1,000/mm<sup>3</sup>, the AUC was 0.96 (95% CI 0.87–1.00), outperforming CSF leukocytes (AUC 0.88 [95% CI 0.79–0.97]). Combining HBP with CSF C-reactive protein (CRP) significantly increased accuracy in this population and reached a 100% sensitivity (AUC 1.00 [95% CI 0.99–1.00], cutoff 0.07, sensitivity 100%, specificity 96%). These results remained robust in an external validation cohort of 120 Danish patients (AUC 0.97 [95% CI 0.93–1.00]).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>HBP can correctly distinguish bacterial meningitis from other disorders. It can be of additional value to current diagnostics in cases where CSF leukocyte count is relatively low, particularly when combined with CSF CRP. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:1088–1095</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective is to evaluate cognitive and behavioral progression and identify early predictors of these changes in a cohort of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 161 ALS patients were tested at diagnosis (T0), and 107 were re-tested after 1 year (T1) using cognitive/behavioral tests. All patients underwent whole-genome sequencing, and 46 patients (ALS-normal cognition [CN]) underwent [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of the 161 patients, 107 were re-rested at T1; non-retested patients included 10 with frontotemporal dementia and 44 who were either non-testable or deceased. At T0, 67 patients (62.6%) were classified as ALS-CN, whereas 40 (38.4%) showed some degree of cognitive/behavioral impairment. Eighteen ALS-CN patients (26.9%) experienced cognitive decline at T1. Phenoconverters had lower baseline scores in letter fluency (Letter Fluency Test [FAS]) (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioral ALS Screen (ECAS) verbal fluency score (<i>p</i> = 0.017). Both tests were independently predictive of phenoconversion in binary logistic regression models, with optimal cut-off scores of 28.75 and 14.2, with good sensitivity and specificity. Other predictors included older age, lower education, and ALS-related genetic variants. Phenoconverters were hypometabolic in the left temporal lobe. Thirteen (32.5%) of the 40 patients with cognitive impairment at T0 worsened by T1, with FAS (<i>p</i> = 0.02) and the ECAS verbal fluency score (<i>p</i> = 0.023) predicting further decline.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Approximately 30% of ALS patients experienced cognitive/behavioral decline within the first year after diagnosis. FAS and ECAS verbal fluency were predictive of cognitive phenoconversion. Our findings highlight the importance of early detection of at-risk individuals and the need for longitudinal cognitive assessments to monitor disease progression.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27201?af=R">Brain Metabolic Features of FUS‐ALS: A 2‐[18F]FDG‐PET Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed at evaluating the brain metabolic features of fused in sarcoma amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<i>FUS</i>-ALS) compared with sporadic ALS (sALS), using 2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (2-[<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We employed the 2-sample <i>t</i>-test model of SPM12, implemented in MATLAB, to compare 12 <i>FUS</i>-ALS cases with 40 healthy controls (HC) and 48 sALS, randomly collected from the series of patients who underwent brain 2-[<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET at the ALS Center of Turin (Italy) at diagnosis from 2009 to 2019. In the comparisons between cases and HC, we included age at PET and sex as covariates. Because <i>FUS</i>-ALS usually shows early onset in spinal regions, in the comparison between <i>FUS</i>-ALS and sALS, we included singularly the following covariates in a second step, to evaluate the determinants of eventual metabolic differences: age at PET, sex, and onset (spinal/bulbar).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>sALS patients showed significant relative hypometabolism in bilateral fronto-temporo-occipital cortex and right insula as compared with <i>FUS</i>-ALS. After adjusting for age, the relative hypometabolism remained in the bilateral precentral gyrus and in the right middle and inferior temporal gyrus. As compared with HC, <i>FUS</i> patients displayed a significant relative hypermetabolism in the pontobulbar region and right cerebellar tonsil, dentate nucleus, and uvula, while sALS showed relative hypometabolism in bilateral frontal and occipital cortices and in left temporal and parietal regions.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Patients with <i>FUS</i>-ALS show relative preservation of motor cortex metabolism compared with those with sALS, possibly reflecting the prevalence of lower motor neuron impairment in their phenotype. Prospective studies are necessary to investigate the possible role of 2-[<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET as a biomarker to track disease spreading in clinical trials.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRv) is an autosomal dominant genetic disease characterized by the misfolding and deposition of the transthyretin (TTR) protein. This study aimed to describe the clinical and genetic characteristics of ATTRv in a large multicenter Chinese cohort.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients from 14 centers were included in the study. The clinical and genetic characteristics of all patients were summarized. The peripheral blood white blood cell mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was detected in offspring from different genders.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 202 individuals with ATTRv from 148 families were identified. The average age of onset was 50.6 ± 12.4 years. Among these cases, 117 (57.9%) were classified as late-onset (≥50 years) and 85 (42.1%) as early-onset. Overall, the length dependent axonal sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy was the predominant phenotype (89.1%). A total of 42 heterozygous missense variants and 1 deletion variant were identified. The most common variants were Val30Met (19.8%) and Ala97Ser (15.8%) and patients with Val30Met and Ala97Ser were mostly late-onset in our cohort. Thirty-nine of these patients died with a mean age of 56.1 ± 13.5 years. Anticipation according to gender groups of offspring-parent pairs was different, and mother-son pairs showed the largest anticipation. The copies of mtDNA in the mother's offspring outnumbered those of the father's offspring (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study highlights that ATTRv patients in China exhibit high heterogeneity in their initial symptoms. The most common variants observed in this cohort is Val30Met. The mtDNA copy number shows gender-linked effects. These results can impact ATTRv diagnosis and patient care strategies. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:1158–1167</p>

<p>The AHM group (n = 227) exhibited significantly lower Aβ deposition (B [SE] = −0.104 [0.037], <i>p</i> = 0.006) compared to the non-AHM group (n = 181), even after controlling for age, sex, apolipoprotein E ε4-positivity, vascular risk factors, and mean arterial blood pressure. Further analysis by AHM class showed an association between the use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi) and less Aβ deposition (B [SE] = −0.143[0.049], <i>p</i> = 0.004). No significant relationships were observed between the use of BBB-permeable AHM and Aβ deposition. Additionally, associations between AHM use and tau deposition did not reach statistical significance.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings suggest that AHM use may be associated with lower Aβ burden in older adults with hypertension. Further studies exploring the underlying mechanism, particularly related to RASi, may provide insights into new therapeutic targets for AD. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:1051–1061</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27186?af=R">Neuroimaging Predictors of Cognitive Resilience against Alzheimer's Disease Pathology</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Some individuals demonstrate greater cognitive resilience—the ability to maintain cognitive performance despite adverse brain-related changes—through as yet unknown mechanisms. We examined whether cortical thickness in several brain regions confers resilience against cognitive decline in amyloid-positive adults by moderating the effects of thinner cortex in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related brain regions and of higher levels of tau.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Amyloid-positive participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative with relevant imaging data were included (n = 160, observations = 473). Risk factors included an AD brain signature and cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated tau. Cognitive measures were episodic memory and executive function composites. Mixed effects models tested whether region-specific cortical thickness moderated relationships between markers of AD risk and memory or executive function.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Cross-sectionally, thicker cortex in 8 regions minimized the negative impact of thinner cortex/smaller volume in AD signature regions on executive function. Longitudinally, higher baseline thickness in a composite of these 8 regions predicted less memory decline (<i>p</i> = 0.007) and weakened negative effects of phosphorylated tau on memory decline (<i>p</i> = 0.014), independent of baseline cognition and risk markers.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We identified 8 cortical regions that appear to confer cognitive resilience cross-sectionally and longitudinally in the face of established indicators of AD pathology. Brain regions fostering executive function may enable compensation in later memory performance and confer cognitive resilience against effects of phosphorylated tau and AD-related cortical changes. These “resilience” regions suggest the value of focusing on brain regions beyond only those determined to be AD-related and may partially explain variability in AD-related cognitive trajectories.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) is contraindicated for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients taking direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) within 48 hours before index stroke. Limited data exist on off-label use of IVT for these patients. We compared the safety and outcomes of IVT in AIS patients with DOAC treatment and patients with no OAC before index stroke.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed data from the Safe Implementations of Treatments in Stroke (SITS) International Stroke Thrombolysis Registry during 2013–2024. Outcomes were symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH) by the SITS Monitoring Study and European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study II definitions, functional independency (modified Rankin Scale score 0–2), and death by 3 months. Propensity score matching with a nearest neighbor matching algorithm with a ratio of 1:2 was used for relevant clinical variables. We also analyzed the time from last DOAC dose to IVT treatment.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 1,311 DOAC and 129,384 no OAC patients were included. We matched 894 patients with DOAC to 1,788 with no OAC. The mean age was 75 years versus 76 years, and the median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 11 versus 12, respectively. Patients with DOAC had a similar proportion of outcomes compared with patients with no OAC: SICH per SITS Monitoring Study (1.1 vs 1.5%, <i>p</i> = 0.50), SICH per European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study II (4.0 vs 4.3%, <i>p</i> = 0.82), any parenchymal hematoma (6.3 vs 7.8, <i>p</i> = 0.22), and functional independency (47.9 vs 46.4%, <i>p</i> = 0.59) and death (25.1 vs 24.0%, <i>p</i> = 0.65) at 3-month follow-up. The time from last DOAC dose to IVT did not affect outcomes.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In this observational study, we did not find any difference in outcomes after IVT therapy in AIS patients with DOAC compared with no OAC treatment before index stroke. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:1205–1214</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The neurodegenerative processes driving the build-up of disability in progressive multiple sclerosis (P-MS) have not been fully elucidated. Recent data link cellular senescence (CS) to neurodegeneration. We investigated for evidence of CS in P-MS and sought to determine its pattern.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used 53BP1, p16, and lipofuscin as markers of CS in white matter lesions (WMLs), normal appearing white matter (NAWM), normal appearing cortical gray matter (NAGM), control white matter (CWM), and control gray matter (CGM) on autopsy material from patient with P-MS and healthy controls. Senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors were quantified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>P16<sup>+</sup> cell counts were significantly increased in WMLs and GMLs, compared with NAWM, CWM, NAGM, and CGM and lipofuscin<sup>+</sup> cells were significantly increased in WMLs, compared with NAWM and CWM, indicating more abundant CS in demyelinated lesions. The 53BP1<sup>+</sup> cells in WMLs were significantly increased compared with NAWM and CWM. The 53BP1<sup>+</sup> and p16<sup>+</sup> cells were found significantly more abundant in acute active WMLs and GMLs, compared with chronic inactive lesions. Co-localization studies showed evidence of CS in neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and macrophages. Among the quantified CSF SASP factors, IL-6, MIF, and MIP1a levels correlated with 53BP1<sup>+</sup> cell counts in NAGM, whereas IL-10 levels correlated with p16<sup>+</sup> cell counts in NAWM. P16<sup>+</sup> cell counts in WMLs exhibited an inverse correlation with time to requiring a wheelchair and with age at death.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data indicates that CS primarily affects actively demyelinating gray and WMLs. A higher senescent cell load in P-MS is associated with faster disability progression and death. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:1074–1087</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Accurate personalized survival prediction in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is essential for effective patient care planning. This study investigates whether grey and white matter changes measured by magnetic resonance imaging can improve individual survival predictions.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed data from 178 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 166 healthy controls in the Canadian Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Neuroimaging Consortium study. A voxel-wise linear mixed-effects model assessed disease-related and survival-related atrophy detected through deformation-based morphometry, controlling for age, sex, and scanner variations. Additional linear mixed-effects models explored associations between regional imaging and clinical measurements, and their associations with time to the composite outcome of death, tracheostomy, or permanent assisted ventilation. We evaluated whether incorporating imaging features alongside clinical data could improve the performance of an individual survival distribution model.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Deformation-based morphometry uncovered distinct voxel-wise atrophy patterns linked to disease progression and survival, with many of these regional atrophies significantly associated with clinical manifestations of the disease. By integrating regional imaging features with clinical data, we observed a substantial enhancement in the performance of survival models across key metrics. Our analysis identified specific brain regions, such as the corpus callosum, rostral middle frontal gyrus, and thalamus, where atrophy predicted an increased risk of mortality.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study suggests that brain atrophy patterns measured by deformation-based morphometry provide valuable insights beyond clinical assessments for prognosis. It offers a more comprehensive approach to prognosis and highlights brain regions involved in disease progression and survival, potentially leading to a better understanding of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The involvement of cortical inflammation in migraine, particularly migraine with aura, has been a subject of considerable interest, but has proved challenging to demonstrate. We aimed to detect and characterize signs of cortical inflammation in adults with migraine using a novel, multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used T2 mapping to measure water content/cellularity, T1 mapping to measure tissue microstructure integrity, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping to measure intra- or extracellular edema. We compared these values between participants with migraine (with and without aura) and healthy controls using general linear models adjusted for age and sex.</p>
<h2>Result</h2>
<p>Two hundred ninety-six adult participants with migraine and 155 age- and sex-matched healthy controls provided eligible imaging data. Among the participants with migraine, 103 had migraine with aura, 180 chronic migraine, and 88 were ictal during the scan. Participants with migraine had higher quantitative T2 (qT2) in the left occipital cortex than healthy controls (<i>p &lt;</i> 0.0001). In migraine with aura, the higher qT2 was more widespread and located bilaterally in the occipital cortices, compared with controls (left, <i>p &lt;</i> 0.0001; right <i>p =</i> 0.004). Post-hoc analysis revealed overlapping ADC elevations in migraine with aura compared with controls (<i>p</i> = 0.0069).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Quantitative MRI changes compatible with cortical inflammation were detected in participants with migraine, and appeared driven by the subgroup with aura. Higher occipital qT2 in migraine with aura might represent either extracellular edema or accumulation of inflammatory microglia or astrocytes. These results support the importance of cortical inflammation in migraine pathophysiology, particularly in migraine with aura. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:1168–1179</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is diagnosed by imaging and clinical scoring using the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS). These methods have limited value for prognosis. Here, the prognostic value of plasma neurofilament-light (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and contactin-1 (CNTN-1) was analyzed.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Biomarker levels were determined in the plasma of traumatic SCI patients (<i>n</i> = 37) and healthy controls (<i>n</i> = 22). SCI samples (<i>n</i> = 112) were collected at different time points from 0 to 4 days to 18 weeks post-injury. NfL and GFAP were measured by single molecule array (Simoa) technology, CNTN-1 by Luminex. Baseline and outcome AIS and motor scores were collected as a measure of injury severity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>NfL, GFAP, and CNTN-1 showed different kinetics in SCI patients over time. Baseline biomarker levels could identify AIS-A SCI patients (NfL + GFAP) and discriminate between patients with a motor score change &lt;5 and those with a change ≥5 (NfL + GFAP+CNTN-1). Longitudinally, NfL could identify AIS-A patients up to 12 weeks post-SCI and discriminate between patients with a motor score change &lt;5 and those with a change ≥5 up to 18 weeks post-SCI. Further, baseline biomarker levels positively (NfL + GFAP) or negatively (CNTN-1) correlated with outcome injury severity and together could accurately predict AIS conversion (AUC 0.863) and motor score change (AUC 0.857). This predictive ability was maintained in subacute/chronic SCI stages.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In conclusion, plasma NfL, GFAP, and CNTN-1 are potential prognostic biomarkers in SCI. This is important for patient stratification in clinical trials, prediction of neurological outcome and informed decision-making in SCI treatment and rehabilitation.

                <img src="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/0037bec0-3e20-4a99-91f8-0e6c9f0af2bc/ana27200-toc-0001-m.png"
     alt="Vitamin B12 Levels Association with Functional and Structural Biomarkers of Central Nervous System Injury in Older Adults"/>
<p>At low levels of B12, specifically when bound to transcobalamin for cellular uptake, evidence of slower conductivity in the brain could point toward impaired myelin. At high levels of B12, specifically when bound to the biologically inert transport protein haptocorrin, biomarkers of neurodegeneration appear in the serum, indicating neuroaxonal injury. The biological basis for this phenomenon has yet to be explored. Holo-HC = holo-haptocorrin; Holo-TC = holo-transcobalamin; VEP = visual evoked potentials.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Vitamin B12 (B12) plays a critical role in fatty- and amino-acid metabolism and nucleotide synthesis. While the association between B12 deficiency and neurological dysfunction is well-known, the exact threshold for adequacy remains undefined in terms of functional impairment and evidence of injury. The objective was to assess whether B12 levels within the current normal range in a cohort of healthy older adults may be associated with measurable evidence of neurological injury or dysfunction.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We enrolled 231 healthy elderly volunteers (median age 71.2 years old) with a median B12 blood concentration of 414.8 pmol/L (as measured by automated chemiluminescence assay). We performed multifocal visual evoked potential testing, processing speed testing, and magnetic resonance imaging to assess neurological status. Moreover, we measured serum biomarkers of neuroaxonal injury, astrocyte involvement, and amyloid pathology.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Low (log-transformed) B12, especially decreased holo-transcobalamin, was associated with visual evoked potential latency delay (estimate = −0.04; <i>p</i> = 0.023), processing speed impairment (in an age-dependent manner; standardized β = −2.39; <i>p</i> = 0.006), and larger volumes of white matter hyperintensities on MRI (β = −0.21; <i>p</i> = 0.039). Remarkably, high levels of holo-haptocorrin (biologically inactive fraction of B12) correlated with serum levels of Tau, a biomarker of neurodegeneration (β = 0.22, <i>p</i> = 0.015).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Healthy older subjects exhibit neurological changes at both ends of the measurable “normal” B12 spectrum. These findings challenge our current understanding of optimal serum B12 levels and suggest revisiting how we establish appropriate nutritional recommendations.

<p>To investigate the role of neuroinflammation in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) across different parkinsonian disorders—Parkinson's disease (PD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and multiple system atrophy (MSA)—by examining SNc dopaminergic neuron counts, neuroinflammatory T cells, and microglial activity.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Postmortem neuropathological samples were collected from 79 individuals (PD, n = 38; PSP, n = 15; MSA, n = 14; controls, n = 12). The density of SNc tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons, T cells (CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+), and <i>Iba</i>1 expression (<i>Iba</i>1-positive microglia/macrophages) were examined in the SNc and crus cerebri. Demographic and clinical data were gathered from patient histories.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>PSP patients had 89 to 212% more nigral CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells compared to MSA patients (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.04), 125 to 178% more CD3+ and CD4+ T cells than healthy controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.002), and 95% more CD4+ T cells than PD patients (<i>p</i> = 0.001). <i>Iba</i>1 expression in the SNc was higher in PD patients than in MSA patients (<i>p</i> = 0.004), with no significant differences observed across other conditions. There was a negative association between disease duration and SNc CD3+ T cell density (<i>p</i> = 0.002), and a positive correlation between nigral dopaminergic neuron density and CD3+ density, CD8+ density, and <i>Iba</i>1 expression in PD patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The study reveals distinctive neuroinflammatory patterns in the SNc, with T cell-mediated inflammation prominent in PSP and microglia-mediated inflammation in PD. PSP and MSA show greater SNc dopaminergic neuron loss compared to PD. Increased neuroinflammatory response is seen in earlier disease stages, diminishing with greater neuron loss, which may inform disease progression understanding and therapeutic strategies.

                Graves et al. show that loss of an important cell-cycle inhibitor, p16Ink4a, prevents multiple signs of neurodegenerative disease in a mouse model of tauopathy. The authors also show that p16Ink4a expression in two specific brain cell types, endothelial cells and microglia, promotes tau-based disease.

                Santiago et al. report that the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo2 is required for the transcriptional and structural maturation of the primary sensory neurons that detect gentle touch and that Piezo2-dependent genes influence touch-sensory neuron innervation patterns.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98631">Insufficiency of 40S ribosomal proteins, RPS26 and RPS25, negatively affects biosynthesis of polyglycine-containing proteins in fragile-X associated conditions</a></h4>

              
                Expansion of CGG repeats (CGGexp) in the 5’ untranslated region (5’UTR) of the <i>FMR1</i> gene underlies the fragile X premutation-associated conditions including tremor/ataxia syndrome, a late-onset neurodegenerative disease and fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency. One common pathomechanism of these conditions is the repeat-associated non-AUG-initiated (RAN) translation of CGG repeats of mutant <i>FMR1</i> mRNA, resulting in production of FMRpolyG, a toxic protein containing long polyglycine tract. To identify novel modifiers of RAN translation we used an RNA-tagging system and mass spectrometry-based screening. It revealed proteins enriched on CGGexp-containing <i>FMR1</i> RNA in cellulo, including a ribosomal protein RPS26, a component of the 40 S subunit. We demonstrated that depletion of RPS26 and its chaperone TSR2, modulates FMRpolyG production and its toxicity. We also found that the RPS26 insufficiency impacted translation of limited number of proteins, and 5’UTRs of mRNAs encoding these proteins were short and guanosine and cytosine-rich. Moreover, <i>the</i> silencing of another component of the 40 S subunit, the ribosomal protein RPS25, also induced repression of FMRpolyG biosynthesis. Results of this study suggest that the two 40 S ribosomal proteins and chaperone TSR2 play an important role in noncanonical CGGexp-related RAN translation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89862">Microbes with higher metabolic independence are enriched in human gut microbiomes under stress</a></h4>

              
                A wide variety of human diseases are associated with loss of microbial diversity in the human gut, inspiring a great interest in the diagnostic or therapeutic potential of the microbiota. However, the ecological forces that drive diversity reduction in disease states remain unclear, rendering it difficult to ascertain the role of the microbiota in disease emergence or severity. One hypothesis to explain this phenomenon is that microbial diversity is diminished as disease states select for microbial populations that are more fit to survive environmental stress caused by inflammation or other host factors. Here, we tested this hypothesis on a large scale, by developing a software framework to quantify the enrichment of microbial metabolisms in complex metagenomes as a function of microbial diversity. We applied this framework to over 400 gut metagenomes from individuals who are healthy or diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We found that high metabolic independence (HMI) is a distinguishing characteristic of microbial communities associated with individuals diagnosed with IBD. A classifier we trained using the normalized copy numbers of 33 HMI-associated metabolic modules not only distinguished states of health vs IBD, but also tracked the recovery of the gut microbiome following antibiotic treatment, suggesting that HMI is a hallmark of microbial communities in stressed gut environments.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98143">Altered visual cortex excitatory/inhibitory ratio following transient congenital visual deprivation in humans</a></h4>

              
                Non-human animal models have indicated that the ratio of excitation to inhibition (E/I) in neural circuits is experience dependent, and changes across development. Here, we assessed 3T Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) and electroencephalography (EEG) markers of cortical E/I ratio in 10 individuals who had been treated for dense bilateral congenital cataracts, after an average of 12 years of blindness, to test for dependence of the E/I ratio on early visual experience in humans. First, participants underwent MRS scanning at rest with their eyes open and eyes closed, to obtain visual cortex Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA+) concentration, Glutamate/Glutamine (Glx) concentration, and the concentration ratio of Glx/GABA+, as measures of inhibition, excitation, and E/I ratio, respectively. Subsequently, EEG was recorded to assess aperiodic activity (1–20 Hz) as a neurophysiological measure of the cortical E/I ratio, during rest with eyes open and eyes closed, and during flickering stimulation. Across conditions, congenital cataract-reversal individuals demonstrated a significantly lower visual cortex Glx/GABA+ ratio, and a higher intercept and steeper aperiodic slope at occipital electrodes, compared to age-matched sighted controls. In the congenital cataract-reversal group, a lower Glx/GABA+ ratio was associated with better visual acuity, and Glx concentration correlated positively with the aperiodic intercept in the conditions with visual input. We speculate that these findings result from an increased E/I ratio of the visual cortex as a consequence of congenital blindness, which might require commensurately increased inhibition in order to balance the additional excitation from restored visual input. The lower E/I ratio in congenital cataract-reversal individuals would thus be a consequence of homeostatic plasticity.

">Neural signatures of predictive coding underlying the acquisition of incidental sensory associations</a></h4>

              
                A longstanding question in cognitive science is whether the human brain learns sensory regularities that are irrelevant to ongoing behavior, a phenomenon known as incidental associative learning. Here, we provide evidence at the single subject level that humans indeed acquired such incidental associations and reveal their neural signatures by combining Electroencephalography (EEG), multivariate decoding and computational modeling. We found robust encoding of incidental predictions and prediction errors underlying associative learning, consistent with predictive coding theories. Prediction errors were modulated by epistemic uncertainty, incidental associations persisted in memory over days and generalized beyond stimulus-stimulus pairings to encompass broader sensory events, including the absence of stimulation. Together, our results challenge traditional assumptions that associative learning requires behavioral relevance or physical co-occurrence and point to uncertainty minimization about environmental state transitions as a general objective of brain function. This intrinsic drive may reflect a fundamental computational principle supporting the formation of internal predictive models that guide perception, learning, and adaptive behavior.

">Basolateral amygdala dopamine transmits a nonassociative emotional salience signal</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive decision making relies on proper discrimination and prediction of positive and negative events. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is central to this valence encoding, assigning emotional value to stimuli to drive appropriate behavioral responses. The ventral tegmental area (VTA), which is classically known to regulate associative learning and incentive motivation via dopamine projections to the striatum, also contains strong dopamine projections to the BLA, but this system has received much less attention. Here, we used fiber photometry to investigate how in vivo BLA dopamine signaling tracks learning. We show that reward cues evoke BLA dopamine signals that diminish, rather than grow, with training. As the complexity of the learning context was increased, where rats actively differentiated between various cue types signaling threat, reward, safety, and neutral associations, the magnitude of cue-evoked BLA dopamine responses was largest early in training and reported the level of perceived emotional saliency. Fear and safety cues prompted larger, sustained dopamine signals compared to reward and neutral cues, an effect that was more apparent in female rats, compared to males. Together, our findings broaden the theoretical landscape of dopamine heterogeneity, showing that BLA dopamine supports dynamic disambiguation of relative stimulus importance by non-associatively encoding sensory state transitions, independent of value. These signals reflect a scalar readout of emotional salience to prime, rather than track, learning.

">Geometric principles of dendritic integration of excitation and inhibition in cortical neurons</a></h4>

              
                We use two-color uncaging of glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on layer-5 (L5) pyramidal neurons of the cingulate cortex to define how inhibitory control of excitation is controlled by dendritic geometry. Traditionally, GABAergic input was considered as the gatekeeper, thus, receptors closest to the soma were ideally placed to veto excitation. However, recently modeling has advanced several counter-intuitive hypotheses. Since laser uncaging can be directed at will to any position, we used photostimulation to show that inhibition near the sealed end of dendrites distal to excitation is more effective than inhibition near the soma in modulating excitation. Further, dendritic inhibition was found to be branch specific. Finally, we demonstrate that inhibitory input from multiple thin basal dendrites can centripetally elevate to effectively tune distant excitation at the soma. These findings provide direct experimental evidence supporting theoretical predictions based on dendritic cable properties, revealing the critical role of dendritic geometry in shaping the interaction between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission.

                Leigh syndrome (LS) is a complex, genetic mitochondrial disorder defined by neurodegenerative phenotypes with pediatric manifestation. However, recent clinical studies report behavioral phenotypes in human LS patients that are more reminiscent of neurodevelopmental delays. To determine if disruptions in epochs of rapid brain growth during infancy precede the hallmark brain lesions that arise during childhood, we evaluated neural and glial precursor cellular dynamics in a mouse model of LS. Single cell RNA sequencing along with histological and anatomical assessments were performed in NDUFS4 KO mice and compared with controls to determine the impact of Complex I deficiency on neural stem cells, their neuronal and oligodendroglial progeny, lineage progression, and overt differences in specific brain regions. Our findings show disruptions in all categories, specifically within the subventricular zone and corpus callosum. Given that LS is purely considered a neurodegenerative disease, we propose that mitochondrial dysfunction is a neurodevelopmental signature predating classic diagnosis in LS.

">Multimodal cortical connectome in the default mode network across the adult lifespan</a></h4>

              
                The default mode network (DMN) critically underpins cognitive and affective functions throughout the adult lifespan; however, detailed insights into its complex neuroarchitecture and connectivity patterns across aging remain limited. Leveraging the open-access CamCAN dataset, comprising structural and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) alongside magnetoencephalography (MEG) data from 599 adults spanning ages 18 to 88 years, we systematically investigated age-associated changes in multimodal connectomes within the DMN. Our analyses revealed a progressive decline in both structural and functional connectivity among DMN subregions with advancing age. Additionally, MEG-based connectivity assessment demonstrated age-related decreases in high-frequency oscillatory activity (alpha, beta, gamma bands) accompanied by increases in low-frequency oscillations (theta band). Integrating structural data with neurophysiological measures further revealed age-dependent shifts in neurophysiological-structural coupling within the prefrontal cortex, characterized by strengthened coupling at theta frequencies but weakened coupling at higher frequencies. Conversely, coupling within the posterior cingulate cortex consistently declined across all examined frequency bands. Notably, theta-band coupling within the prefrontal cortex significantly correlated with age-related memory performance variations. Collectively, our findings delineate nuanced changes in DMN information transmission dynamics across adulthood, underscoring its promise as a neurobiological biomarker reflective of cognitive aging heterogeneity.

">Distinct Ca2+ signatures of leptomeningeal fibroblast subgroups in awake mouse brains in health and inflammation</a></h4>

              
                The leptomeninges, composed of the arachnoid mater, and pia mater, contains distinct subgroups of fibroblasts that differ in location and transcriptomic profiles. These fibroblasts contribute to the blood cerebrospinal fluid barrier under physiological conditions, participate in fibrosis, and support blood brain barrier integrity during injury and disease. However, their Ca2+ signaling profiles and underlying mechanisms in health and disease remain poorly understood. In this study, we divided leptomeningeal fibroblasts into three subgroups based on their locations: arachnoid fibroblasts, pia mater fibroblasts and perivascular fibroblasts. We employed two-photon microscopy in awake transgenic mice expressing Ca2+; indicators in leptomeningeal fibroblasts to investigate spontaneous and behaviorally evoked Ca2+; transients across different fibroblast subgroups. We found that each subgroup exhibits a distinct Ca2+; activity profile, with pia mater fibroblasts showing the highest-amplitude Ca2+; transients. Moreover, these fibroblasts displayed unique responses to both whisker air-puff stimulation and locomotion. We further demonstrated, using a chronically implanted cannula beneath the cranial window, that locomotion-associated vasodilation is followed by TRPV4 channel-mediated fibroblast Ca2+; elevations. Finally, systemic inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) reduced spontaneous Ca2+; transients in pia mater fibroblasts, likely due to macrophage infiltration following the inflammatory response. For the first time, this study characterizes spontaneous and behaviorally evoked Ca2+; dynamics in distinct leptomeningeal fibroblast subgroups in awake animals, providing novel insights into the functional roles of leptomeningeal fibroblasts in the healthy and diseased brain.

">Layer-specific spatiotemporal dynamics of feedforward and feedback in human visual object perception</a></h4>

              
                Visual object perception is mediated by information flow between regions of the ventral visual stream along feedforward and feedback anatomical connections. However, feedforward and feedback signals during naturalistic vision are rapid and overlapping, complicating their identification and precise functional specification. Here we recorded human layer-specific fMRI responses to naturalistic object images in early visual cortex (EVC) and lateral occipital complex (LOC) to isolate feedforward and feedback information signals spatially by their cortical layer specific termination pattern. We combined these layer-specific fMRI responses with electroencephalography (EEG) responses for the same images to segregate feedforward and feedback signals in both time and space. Feedforward signals emerge early in the middle layers of EVC and LOC, followed by feedback signals in the superficial layer of both regions, and the deep layer of EVC. Comparing the identified dynamics in LOC to a visual deep neural network (DNN), revealed that early feedforward signals in LOC encode medium complexity features, whereas later feedback signals increase the representational format to high complexity features. Together this specifies the spatiotemporal dynamics and functional role of feedforward and feedback information flow mediating visual object perception.

">Alcohol use disorder is associated with increases in frontocentral phase-amplitude coupling strength during resting state</a></h4>

              
                Compromised functional connectivity in the brain seen in fMRI and EEG coherence is a key feature of alcohol use disorder (AUD). Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) represents another mechanism by which functional connectivity is achieved, and to date, the role played by PAC in understanding the development of AUD has yet to be investigated. In the current study, we compare PAC strengths between participants with severe AUD, defined as presenting with 6 or more symptoms (DSM-5), and unaffected controls. Associations between phase-amplitude coupling and AUD status were assessed using frontal EEG signals acquired during the resting state eyes closed condition as part of the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA). COGA is a national project following families affected with AUD and comparison families for over 35 years with data collection in multiple domains. COGA participants between 25 and 50 years old with severe AUD were compared to an age-matched group of unaffected controls (Women: N = 360; Men: N = 406). PAC calculations were made on EEG recordings from midfrontal channel FZ to generate high resolution comodulograms covering phase frequencies between 0.1-13 Hz and amplitude frequencies between 4-50 Hz. Comodulograms were generated for each 30 second EEG segment for a given visit. Average comodulogram for a visit was calculated for the first two minutes of EEG in the resting state condition for subsequent statistical analyses. PAC differences between AUD and unaffected controls were assessed at each frequency pair using Mann-Whitney test, and the resulting effect sizes and p-values were used to generate difference comodulograms and significance comodulograms, respectively. Results showed that severe AUD was associated with greater alpha-gamma PAC in both men and women compared to the unaffected groups. Men with AUD exhibited significant increases in PAC across large parts of theta-gamma. In women with AUD, increases in theta-gamma PAC were restricted to smaller domains, and accompanied significant decreases in neighboring theta-gamma subdomains. PAC strength in theta-alpha and alpha-beta frequency pair domains were also significantly greater in AUD for both men and women. The AUD-associated changes in PAC strength within the alpha-gamma, theta-beta, alpha-beta, and to a lesser degree in theta-gamma domains indicates some form of aberrant hyperconnectivity between networks within the medial prefrontal cortex during resting state of the brain.

">Retinal nerve fibre layer thickness reflects characteristics of brain grey and white matter</a></h4>

              
                The retina is a relatively accessible part of the central nervous system compared to the brain. Using high resolution optical imaging we investigated the relationship between retinal thickness, obtained with optical coherence tomography, and structural features of the brain obtained with magnetic resonance imaging. In a population-based sample of over 500 subjects, we hypothesized: (i) that there are structural associations between circumpapillary retinal nerve fibre layer thickness and brain grey matter density and white matter microstructural properties in visual information processing areas, and specifically contralateral associations for nasal retinal fibers, and (ii) that retinal findings reflect broader changes in brain grey and white matter related to cardiovascular risk factors. In support of the first hypothesis, we showed associations of circumpapillary retinal nerve fibre layer thickness with visual cortex grey matter density and with optic radiation fractional anisotropy. These correlations were stronger for the right eye, possibly reflecting right ocular dominancy. Regarding the second hypothesis, while we confirmed the broad impact of cardiovascular risk factors such as body mass index, diabetes, and hypertension on brain structure, we didn't find (adequate) significant partial correlations between circumpapillary retinal nerve fibre layer thickness and cardiovascular risk factors to support the hypothesis. As such, we couldn't confirm that circumpapillary retinal nerve fibre layer thickness is associated with the impact of cardiovascular risk factors on the brain structure. However, when the effects of cardiovascular risk factors were accounted for statistically, circumpapillary retinal nerve fibre layer thickness (particularly on the right side) was associated with fractional anisotropy of limbic system tracts, i.e., the fornix and stria terminalis including hippocampus and amygdala. To further explore the structural associations between eye and brain, in terms of a possible common underlying pathology related to cardiovascular risk factors and progressive neurodegenerative diseases on the central nervous system, longitudinal and interventional studies are necessary.

">Differential effects of ischemia and inflammation on plasma-derived extracellular vesicle characteristics and function</a></h4>

              
                Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have long been understood to be important mediators of cell-to-cell communication and may lead to the molecular aftermath and exacerbation of brain injuries such stroke. This study explored how the source of the EVs influenced their characteristics and the effect these differences had on naive brain tissue. EVs were isolated from animals post-stroke in the acute or chronic stages of recovery in animals with and without reperfusion, and from a model of systemic inflammation (intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide). The data show that neither stroke nor inflammation significantly increase EV numbers compared to sham or naive animals. Post-stroke EVs exhibited a panel of different platelet and inflammatory markers, when compared to EVs derived from a model of inflammation, reflecting differences between stroke and systemic immune activation. When injected into the brain, both stroke-derived and inflammation-derived EVs induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression, suggesting a potential role in neuroinflammation. However, there was a lack of distinct glial and astrocyte reactivity in response to any EVs, despite robust changes in ICAM reactivity. The findings here underscore the complexity of EV roles in pathophysiology and highlight the need for improved EV isolation methods. With further longitudinal studies we may be able to more accurately determine how the context of the injury (reperfusion vs no reperfusion vs inflammation) might contribute to the EV populations and their function. Understanding more about EVs in different contexts will improve our ability to use EVs as biomarkers, but also our capacity to interfere with EV biology as a novel therapeutic approach.

">EPIGENETIC REPROGRAMMING OF CELL IDENTITY IN THE RAT PRIMARY NEURON-GLIA CULTURES INVOLVES HISTONE SEROTONYLATION</a></h4>

              
                Epigenetic rearrangements can create a favorable environment for the intrinsic plasticity of brain cells, leading to cellular reprogramming into virtually any cell type through the induction of cell-specific transcriptional programs. In this study, we assessed how chromatin remodeling induced by broad-spectrum HDAC inhibitors affects cellular differentiation trajectories in rat primary neuron-glia cultures using a combination of transcriptomics, qPCR and cytochemistry. We described epigenetic regulation of transcriptional programs controlled by master transcription factors and neurotrophins in the context of neuronal and glial differentiation and evaluated the expression of representative cell-specific markers. The results obtained suggest that HDAC inhibitors reduce proliferative potential of cultured cells and induce transcriptomic changes associated with cell differentiation and specialization. Particularly, we revealed a significant upregulation of genes typically expressed in neuromodulatory neurons, and downregulation of genes expressed in glia and inhibitory neurons. Transcriptional changes were accompanied by continuous elevation of histone serotonylation levels in both neurons and glia. We assume that early appearance of the enhanced histone serotonylation marks, and the persistence of these changes over many hours in distinct brain cells may indicate that chromatin remodeling induced by histone serotonylation contributes to the maintainance of a new transcriptional programs associated with cellular reprogramming.

                Mycoplasma bovis (M. bovis) is a significant pathogen in cattle that causes respiratory disease, mastitis, and arthritis, leading to substantial economic losses globally. Early detection of M. bovis is crucial for its effective management because of its immune evasion strategies and resistance to antimicrobial therapies. In this review, we systematically assessed the diagnostic potential of P48 protein, an immunodominant lipoprotein of M. bovis, along with other potential biomarkers. The aim was to provide a comprehensive understanding of P48’s diagnostic utility through both literature analysis and computational insights. A literature search across major databases identified 243 relevant articles, 20 of which were selected based on predefined inclusion criteria. These studies consistently highlight P48’s diagnostic value due to its stability, immunodominance, and strong antibody response in infected cattle. In addition, a molecular analysis using the Expasy ProtParam tool reveals that P48 exhibits favorable properties for diagnostics, including a theoretical isoelectric point (pI) of 7.14, an instability index of 23.64 (classifying it as stable), and an aliphatic index of 83.40, indicating significant thermostability. The review also considers other diagnostic proteins, such as Variable Surface Proteins (VSPs), MbovP proteins, and MilA, although their variable nature and lesser validation across assays limit their broader application. In contrast, P48 is a reliable and specific marker, particularly in serological assays, for the early and accurate detection of M. bovis infections. This study confirms P48’s diagnostic efficacy over other biomarkers, and advocates its inclusion in diagnostic protocols.

                Drawing from historical accounts, cultural practices, archaeological discoveries, and indigenous technical knowledge, the research presents a critical review of varied aspects of the construction of the Konark temple and provides future research directions. To fulfil the purpose, documents were sourced from Scopus, Google Scholar, and ancient texts and palm leaves. Findings suggest the legacy of Narasimhadeva I, the Hindu monarch who remained undefeated during his reign, safeguarded the kingdom from encroaching Muslim rulers. The narrative highlights the bravery of a faithful elephant that revived the king on the battlefield. The Konark temple was built with the dual purpose of showcasing the glory of his victory and devotion to the Sun God. The ancient artisans’ knowledge, skills, and commitment were crucial in erecting this tallest temple structure. The investigation further illuminates the use of sea routes for transporting monumental stones, the ingenuity in laying the temple’s foundation, the selection of high-grade stones, the monumental task of lifting colossal stones, like the world’s heaviest stone hoisted to a height of about two hundred feet, the use of rust-resistant iron, and the application of advanced astronomical knowledge by ancient artisans. The study provides insights into ancient engineering ingenuity, encouraging further exploration of the enduring legacy of the Konark temple’s construction.

                <p>by Dieter Vanderelst, Herbert Peremans</p>

Some echolocating bats, such as <i>Tadarida brasiliensis</i>, fly in groups when emerging from or entering caves. In large, dense swarms, distinguishing self-generated echoes from the multitude of calls and echoes produced by others presents a significant challenge – akin to a cocktail party nightmare. While spectral jamming responses have been proposed as a solution, this mechanism is unlikely to be effective in such conditions. Here, we propose an alternative hypothesis: rather than isolating their own echoes, bats might navigate by relying on the local amplitude gradient of the collective soundscape. To test this, we developed an agent-based simulation of bats flying through corridors, demonstrating that they can avoid obstacles, including other bats and corridor walls, without distinguishing individual echoes. Our findings suggest that in dense swarms, bats can exploit the emergent acoustic environment to maintain safe distances passively. The current paper also suggests shifting the perspective on jamming itself. Rather than framing overlapping signals solely as a source of interference, our findings highlight that these signals can also carry useful information, reframing the problem from conflict to cooperative signal processing.

As humanity comes into contact with new microbes, there is a need to identify which might be future pathogenic threats. Host–microbe interactions manifest emergent properties and chaotic dynamics, posing limits on prediction. However, probabilistic predictions are possible.

To what extent can we predict future pathogenic microbes? This Perspective discusses why complex requirements for virulence and dynamic host-microbe interactions make probabilistic predictions difficult, but not impossible.

                Background The human ear is unique to individuals, and ear prints, like fingerprints, are discrete enough to distinguish identical twins. Thus, this study aimed to estimate the stature and sex using various morphometric parameters and morphological features of the external ear for forensic identification. Methods This was a cross-sectional observational study involving 40 participants recruited using simple random sampling technique. Eighteen measurements were taken, and various morphological features were noted for both the right and left ears. A digital Vernier caliper was used to measure all linear parameters. The angles were measured using a goniometer. Normal distribution was verified using the Shapiro–Wilk test. For normally distributed parameters, an independent t-test was used, and for non-normally distributed parameters, the Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare sexes. To compare the right and left parameters, independent t-tests (for normally distributed data) and Mann-Whitney U tests (for non-normally distributed data) were applied. Sex determination and stature estimation were performed using logistic regression analysis. Results In males and females, the most common shape was oval (47.5%), and the ear lobe was free (45%). When comparing the parameters of males on the right and left sides, it was noticed that only the ear inclination angle and concha mastoid angle showed significant differences (p < 0.05). It was seen that the right lobe width showed perfect separation, indicating its potential as an extremely reliable predictor of sex. It was noted that in females, the strongest correlation with height was with the ear inclination angle on both sides. Conclusion We can conclude from the results of this study that the right lobe width of external ear can be a reliable predictor of sex. Ear inclination angle on both sides showed strongest correlation with height. The results of this study can help forensic anthropologists identify the sex and stature of a person from various ear measurements in young South Indian adults.

                Background Lassa fever (LF) is an endemic and immediately notifiable disease in Liberia, and one laboratory confirmed case constitutes an outbreak. We described the epidemiological characteristics and hospital outcomes of LF cases hospitalized during the 2022-2023 outbreak in Liberia. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted using routine LF surveillance data from the 2022-2023 outbreak in Liberia. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data and log binomial regression to assess the association between epidemiological characteristics and mortality. Results A total of 439 suspected LF cases were reported. The median age was 22 (interquartile range (IQR): 10-33) years and 233 (53%) were females. The median number of days between symptom onset and admission was 4 (IQR 2-7). Of the 439 cases, 416 (95%) were tested for LF and 138 were confirmed with 33% positivity rate. The majority, 95 (69%), of confirmed cases were <30 years, 78 (57%) were females, and 81 (59%) were reported during the dry season (October – March). Contact with rodents, 95 (69%), was the commonest mode of exposure. Fever, 128 (93%), malaise, 121 (88%), headache, 114 (83%) and myalgia, 114 (83%) were the most common clinical characteristics. There were 83 (19%) deaths among hospitalized suspected LF cases - 42 deaths (15%) among 278 individuals who tested negative and 41 among confirmed cases with 30% case fatality rate (CFR). Age 40-49 years accounted for 8/12 (67%) and those aged≥50 reported 5/8 (63%) of the deaths among the confirmed cases. There was no significant association between epidemiological characteristics and LF mortality. Conclusions The outbreak highlighted a high disease burden of LF with young adults disproportionately infected, and mortality, even among those who tested negative for the virus. This underscores the urgent need for preventive measures like vaccines and health education campaigns.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a prevalent condition. Recent research on people with KOA has addressed kinetic chain and core muscle contribution in disease progression. Objective This study aims to assess the efficacy of including the CARE -KOA© regimen and evaluate its effect on pain, patient-reported functional outcomes, physical function tests, knee strength, and core endurance. Methods/Design 15 patients above 45 were recruited and underwent a 4-week CARE -KOA© program with 12 supervised sessions over four weeks. Pre- and Post-exercise assessment included evaluating the primary outcome pain using the VAS scale and the patient-reported outcome using the KOOS scale. The secondary outcomes, knee muscle strength, core endurance, and the physical function tests, i.e., the stair climb test, the sit-to-stand test, the 40m fast-paced walking test, and the timed up-and-go test, were also evaluated. The data collected in the study was analyzed using the statistical software JAMOVI. p < 0.05 was significant. Results Notably, all the parameters examined exhibited a statistically significant difference between their pre-intervention and post-intervention values, except the knee muscle strength in the flexors of the affected knee and extensors of the unaffected knee. Conclusion Patients who completed a 4-week supervised CARE -KOA© program alongside routine rehabilitation experienced reduced pain and improved outcomes. This approach aims to address biomechanical issues and positively impacts pain mechanisms.

                Opioid withdrawal produces a dysphoric state that can lead to relapse. Simon et al. reveal that lateral septal neurotensin-expressing neurons are selectively activated by naloxone and drive changes in pain coping and sociability in opioid-dependent mice, highlighting the potential role for the lateral septum in regulating behavior during opioid withdrawal.

                By photostimulating specific visual cortical ensembles, Bounds et al. discovered that an ensemble’s impact on local neural activity, not its visual encoding properties, predicts its impact on stimulus detection. Their analysis reveals that mice use a generalizable, albeit suboptimal, perceptual readout strategy of summing all V1 activity to detect stimuli.
