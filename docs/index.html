              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02908">Random Effects Models for Understanding Variability and Association between Brain Functional and Structural Connectivity</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.02908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human brain is organized as a complex network, where connections between regions are characterized by both functional connectivity (FC) and structural connectivity (SC). While previous studies have primarily focused on network-level FC-SC correlations (i.e., the correlation between FC and SC across all edges within a predefined network), edge-level correlations (i.e., the correlation between FC and SC across subjects at each edge) has received comparatively little attention. In this study, we systematically analyze both network-level and edge-level FC-SC correlations, demonstrating that they lead to divergent conclusions about the strength of brain function-structure association. To explain these discrepancies, we introduce new random effects models that decompose FC and SC variability into different sources: subject effects, edge effects, and their interactions. Our results reveal that network-level and edge-level FC-SC correlations are influenced by different effects, each contributing differently to the total variability in FC and SC. This modeling framework provides the first statistical approach for disentangling and quantitatively assessing different sources of FC and SC variability and yields new insights into the relationship between functional and structural brain networks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03115">The Multi-biophysical nature of Computation in brain neural networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.03115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comprehending the nature of action potentials is fundamental to our understanding of the functioning of nervous systems in general. The ionic mechanisms underlying action potentials in the squid giant axon were first described by Hodgkin and Huxley in 1952 and their findings have formed our orthodox view of how the physiological action potential functions. However, substan-tial evidence has now accumulated to show that the action potential is accompanied by a syn-chronized coupled soliton pressure pulse in the cell membrane, the action potential pulse (AP-Pulse) which we have recently shown to have an essential function in computation. Here we ex-plore the interactions between the soliton and the ionic mechanisms known to be associated with the action potential. Computational models of the action potential usually describe it as a binary event, but we have shown that it must be a quantum ternary event known as the computa-tional action potential (CAP), whose temporal fixed point is the threshold of the soliton, rather than the rather plastic action potential peak used in other models to facilitate meaningful compu-tation. We have demonstrated this type of frequency computation for the retina, in detail, and also provided an extensive analysis for computation for other brain neural networks. The CAP ac-companies the APPulse and the Physiological action potential. Therefore, we conclude that nerve impulses appear to be an ensemble of three inseparable, interdependent, concurrent states: the physiological action potential, the APPulse and the CAP. However, while the physio-logical action potential is important in terms of neural connectivity, it is irrelevant to computational processes as this is always facilitated by the soliton part of the APPulse.

                arXiv:2508.02995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their success in image classification, modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) exhibit fundamental limitations, including data inefficiency, poor out-of-distribution generalization, and vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. The primate visual system, in contrast, demonstrates superior efficiency and robustness, suggesting that its architectural principles may offer a blueprint for more capable artificial vision systems. This paper introduces Visual Cortex Network (VCNet), a novel neural network architecture whose design is informed by the macro-scale organization of the primate visual cortex. VCNet emulates key biological mechanisms, including hierarchical processing across distinct cortical areas, dual-stream information segregation, and top-down predictive feedback. We evaluate VCNet on two specialized benchmarks: the Spots-10 animal pattern dataset and a light field image classification task. Our results show that VCNet achieves a classification accuracy of 92.1\% on Spots-10 and 74.4\% on the light field dataset, surpassing contemporary models of comparable size. This work demonstrates that integrating neuroscientific principles into network design can lead to more efficient and robust models, providing a promising direction for addressing long-standing challenges in machine learning.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03187">Fitness and Overfitness: Implicit Regularization in Evolutionary Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.03187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common assumption in evolutionary thought is that adaptation drives an increase in biological complexity. However, the rules governing evolution of complexity appear more nuanced. Evolution is deeply connected to learning, where complexity is much better understood, with established results on optimal complexity appropriate for a given learning task. In this work, we suggest a mathematical framework for studying the relationship between evolved organismal complexity and enviroenmntal complexity by leveraging a mathematical isomorphism between evolutionary dynamics and learning theory. Namely, between the replicator equation and sequential Bayesian learning, with evolving types corresponding to competing hypotheses and fitness in a given environment to likelihood of observed evidence. In Bayesian learning, implicit regularization prevents overfitting and drives the inference of hypotheses whose complexity matches the learning challenge. We show how these results naturally carry over to the evolutionary setting, where they are interpreted as organism complexity evolving to match the complexity of the environment, with too complex or too simple organisms suffering from \textit{overfitness} and \textit{underfitness}, respectively. Other aspects, peculiar to evolution and not to learning, reveal additional trends. One such trend is that frequently changing environments decrease selected complexity, a result with potential implications to both evolution and learning. Together, our results suggest that the balance between over-adaptation to transient environmental features, and insufficient flexiblity in responding to environmental challenges, drives the emergence of optimal complexity, reflecting environmental structure. This framework offers new ways of thinking about biological complexity, suggesting new potential causes for it to increase or decrease in different environments.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03324">Live Demonstration: Neuromorphic Radar for Gesture Recognition</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.03324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a neuromorphic radar framework for real-time, low-power hand gesture recognition (HGR) using an event-driven architecture inspired by biological sensing. Our system comprises a 24 GHz Doppler radar front-end and a custom neuromorphic sampler that converts intermediate-frequency (IF) signals into sparse spike-based representations via asynchronous sigma-delta encoding. These events are directly processed by a lightweight neural network deployed on a Cortex-M0 microcontroller, enabling low-latency inference without requiring spectrogram reconstruction. Unlike conventional radar HGR pipelines that continuously sample and process data, our architecture activates only when meaningful motion is detected, significantly reducing memory, power, and computation overhead. Evaluated on a dataset of five gestures collected from seven users, our system achieves > 85% real-time accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that employs bio-inspired asynchronous sigma-delta encoding and an event-driven processing framework for radar-based HGR.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03466">A Genetic Algorithm Framework for Optimizing Three-Impulse Orbital Transfers with Poliastro Simulation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.03466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orbital maneuver planning is a critical aspect of mission design, aimed at minimizing propellant consumption, which is directly correlated with the total velocity change ($\Delta V$). While analytical solutions like the Hohmann and Bi-elliptic transfers offer optimal strategies for specific cases, they lack the flexibility for more general optimization problems. This paper presents a computational framework that couples a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the Poliastro orbital mechanics library to autonomously discover fuel-optimal, three-impulse transfer trajectories between coplanar circular orbits. We validate this framework across two distinct scenarios: a low-energy transfer from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to a Geostationary Orbit (GEO), and a high-energy transfer to a distant orbit with a radius 20 times that of LEO. Our results demonstrate the framework's remarkable adaptability. For the LEO-to-GEO transfer, the GA precisely converges to the classical Hohmann transfer, achieving an identical $\Delta V$ of 3853.96 m/s and validating the method's accuracy. Conversely, for the high-energy transfer, the GA identifies a superior Bi-elliptic trajectory that yields a significant $\Delta V$ saving of 213.47 m/s compared to the Hohmann transfer. This fuel efficiency, however, necessitates a trade-off, extending the mission duration from approximately 1 day to over 140 years. This work demonstrates an accessible and powerful toolchain for the rapid prototyping of optimal trajectories, showcasing how combining evolutionary algorithms with open-source libraries provides a robust method for solving complex astrodynamics problems and quantifying their critical design trade-offs.

                arXiv:2508.03600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imagine a robot controller with the ability to adapt like human synapses, dynamically rewiring itself to overcome unforeseen challenges in real time. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot adaptation mechanism for evolutionary robotics, merging a standard Genetic Algorithm (GA) controller with online Hebbian plasticity. Inspired by biological systems, the method separates learning and memory, with the genotype acting as memory and Hebbian updates handling learning. In our approach, the fitness function is leveraged as a live scaling factor for Hebbian learning, enabling the robot's neural controller to adjust synaptic weights on-the-fly without additional training. This adds a dynamic adaptive layer that activates only during runtime to handle unexpected environmental changes. After the task, the robot 'forgets' the temporary adjustments and reverts to the original weights, preserving core knowledge. We validate this hybrid GA-Hebbian controller on an e-puck robot in a T-maze navigation task with changing light conditions and obstacles.

                arXiv:2508.03614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce MinConvLSTM and MinConvGRU, two novel spatiotemporal models that combine the spatial inductive biases of convolutional recurrent networks with the training efficiency of minimal, parallelizable RNNs. Our approach extends the log-domain prefix-sum formulation of MinLSTM and MinGRU to convolutional architectures, enabling fully parallel training while retaining localized spatial modeling. This eliminates the need for sequential hidden state updates during teacher forcing - a major bottleneck in conventional ConvRNN models. In addition, we incorporate an exponential gating mechanism inspired by the xLSTM architecture into the MinConvLSTM, which further simplifies the log-domain computation. Our models are structurally minimal and computationally efficient, with reduced parameter count and improved scalability. We evaluate our models on two spatiotemporal forecasting tasks: Navier-Stokes dynamics and real-world geopotential data. In terms of training speed, our architectures significantly outperform standard ConvLSTMs and ConvGRUs. Moreover, our models also achieve lower prediction errors in both domains, even in closed-loop autoregressive mode. These findings demonstrate that minimal recurrent structures, when combined with convolutional input aggregation, offer a compelling and efficient alternative for spatiotemporal sequence modeling, bridging the gap between recurrent simplicity and spatial complexity.

                arXiv:2502.13730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rather than obtaining a single good solution for a given optimization problem, users often seek alternative design choices, because the best-found solution may perform poorly with respect to additional objectives or constraints that are difficult to capture into the modeling process.
  Aiming for batches of diverse solutions of high quality is often desirable, as it provides flexibility to accommodate post-hoc user preferences. At the same time, it is crucial that the quality of the best solution found is not compromised.
  One particular problem setting balancing high quality and diversity is fixing the required minimum distance between solutions while simultaneously obtaining the best possible fitness. Recent work by Santoni et al. [arXiv 2024] revealed that this setting is not well addressed by state-of-the-art algorithms, performing in par or worse than pure random sampling.
  Driven by this important limitation, we propose a new approach, where parallel runs of the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) inherit tabu regions in a cascading fashion. We empirically demonstrate that our CMA-ES-Diversity Search (CMA-ES-DS) algorithm generates trajectories that allow to extract high-quality solution batches that respect a given minimum distance requirement, clearly outperforming those obtained from off-the-shelf random sampling, multi-modal optimization algorithms, and standard CMA-ES.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09152">Vertical Federated Continual Learning via Evolving Prototype Knowledge</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.09152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) has garnered significant attention as a privacy-preserving machine learning framework for sample-aligned feature federation. However, traditional VFL approaches do not address the challenges of class and feature continual learning, resulting in catastrophic forgetting of knowledge from previous tasks. To address the above challenge, we propose a novel vertical federated continual learning method, named Vertical Federated Continual Learning via Evolving Prototype Knowledge (V-LETO), which primarily facilitates the transfer of knowledge from previous tasks through the evolution of prototypes. Specifically, we propose an evolving prototype knowledge method, enabling the global model to retain both previous and current task knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce a model optimization technique that mitigates the forgetting of previous task knowledge by restricting updates to specific parameters of the local model, thereby enhancing overall performance. Extensive experiments conducted in both CIL and FIL settings demonstrate that our method, V-LETO, outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods. For example, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 10.39% and 35.15% for CIL and FIL tasks, respectively. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/V-LETO-0108/README.md.

">Sensitivity analysis of voltage-gated ion channel models.</a></h4>

              
                Modeling voltage-gated ion channel function is essential for understanding neuronal excitability. However, finding the right balance between model complexity and practicality is a significant challenge. In this study, I explored how sensitive Markov models of ion channels were to different parameters, beginning with a straightforward two-state system and progressing to more intricate three- and four-state models. Through tests using step voltage and sine wave protocols, I discovered clear sensitivity patterns during both the activation and deactivation phases. As expected, forward transitions were most influential during activation, while reverse transitions became more pronounced during deactivation. Notably, I found that transitions between closed states had minimal impact on the overall whole-cell current or the opening probability (Po). This underscores a significant limitation in relying on these measurements to constrain specific parameters. These results highlight the strengths and limitations of Markov models, showing that their effectiveness can be restricted by how sensitive parameters are to the protocols used in experiments. My findings set clear guidelines on the level of complexity feasible in Markov models of voltage-gated ion channels and offer insights that can help create more efficient and reliable models of neuronal excitability.

">Early life chronic stress-disrupted activity of the dorsal raphe nucleus selectively drives behavioral impairments</a></h4>

              
                Stress elicits variable systemic and neural changes in vertebrates, with outcomes ranging from adaptive to pathological. Several studies have implicated the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), a brainstem nucleus containing a heterogeneous population of serotonergic (5-HT) neurons, in the adaptive stress response and the pathological changes resulting from chronic stress. However, it is not known whether early life chronic stress affects the developing DRN activity, or whether the stress-induced changes affect 5-HT DRN neurons in a subregion- or phenotype-specific manner. To answer these questions, we used in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging of 5-HT DRN neurons in larval zebrafish exposed to chronic unpredictable stress during early life. We found that early life chronic stress prevented the normal habituation of the serotonergic system to a repeated acute stressor by altering the balance of excitatory/inhibitory responses within the DRN. Interestingly, these changes were most pronounced in a subset of stress-vulnerable serotonergic cells co-expressing GABAergic markers. Further, using chemogenetic ablation of 5-HT DRN neurons, we showed that stress-induced plasticity of the DRN contributed to changes in startle response habituation and in locomotive activity, but not in anxiety-like behaviors. Collectively, our results emphasize the role of stress-induced plasticity of DRN neurons in the selective regulation of maladaptive behavioral outcomes.

">Identifying Neuroimaging Biomarkers of Resilience and Vulnerability to Chronic Stress in An Animal Model: An Exploratory Analysis</a></h4>

              
                Stress is a main contributor to mood disorders, with individuals displaying great heterogeneity in response to stressful life events and adversity. Identifying biomarkers of vulnerability and resilience to stress would facilitate a prevention-based approach to mental illness that benefits individuals and reduces healthcare costs. The present study adopted a multivariate machine-learning approach to track neuroimaging biomarkers predictive of resilience and vulnerability following a chronic restraint stress (CRS) model. 96 male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent two sessions of MRI and behavioral tests, before and after CRS. Resilience and vulnerability to CRS were assessed with elevated plus maze and forced swimming tests. Hierarchical clustering was applied to construct brain networks. Partial correlation was used to compute network connectivity. Repeated nested cross validation with a support vector machine was employed to identify rs-fMRI biomarkers predictive of resilience and vulnerability following CRS. No strong group effect size of behavioral changes following CRS was observed within the same animals, suggesting the presence of resilient and vulnerable subgroups. Although the average model performance was modest (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.3 ~ 0.67), baseline functional connectivity across cerebellum, brainstem, striatum, prefrontal and salience-orbitofrontal regions, as well as functional alteration across hippocampus, striatum, prefrontal regions, auditory thalamus, cerebellum, inferior colliculi and brainstem were identified as stable features. The present study is the first to identify connectome-based neuroimaging biomarkers predictive of resilience and vulnerability using an animal model. The results may provide insights into neuroimaging biomarkers to aid diagnosis and prevention of mood disorders in humans.

<p>We identify directly adjacent to the pallial–subpallial boundary a <i>pax6a</i>-negative dorsal Vdd2 portion of the zebrafish larval subpallium that develops into the extended medial amygdala (EMeA). Zebrafish subpallial dopaminergic neurons that locate to Vdd2 belong to the EMeA and form a heterogeneous group differentially expressing <i>calbindin2a</i> and <i>cortistatin/sst7</i>.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The amygdala is a heterogeneous, multinuclear telencephalic structure critical for motivated and emotion-related behaviors in vertebrates. In ray-finned fish (Actinopterygii) like the teleost zebrafish, a telencephalic outward-growing process called eversion makes defining amygdaloid territories particularly challenging. Teleosts are also peculiar in that they develop numerous dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the subpallium, while in tetrapods, such populations are less prominent or appear only transiently. To shed light on the organization of the amygdala in teleosts, we pursued an evolutionary developmental approach focusing on the topological origin of subpallial DA neurons. Specifically, we analyzed the distribution of tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) in conjunction with expression patterns of <i>pax6a+b</i>, <i>isl1a</i>, <i>nkx2.1</i>, <i>lhx8a</i>, <i>otpa+b</i>, and <i>calb2a</i> as markers of different telencephalic subdivisions in brains of 5- and 30-day-old zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>, Teleostei). Our data show that the previously identified dorsalmost division of the ventral telencephalon (Vdd) needs to be subdivided into an anteroventral <i>pax6a/b</i>-positive portion (Vdd1) and a posterodorsal <i>pax6a/b</i>-negative portion (Vdd2). This <i>pax6a</i>-negative Vdd2 portion develops into the extended medial amygdala (EMeA), including the DA population adjacent to the pallial–subpallial border. Our results also show that the EMeA DA neurons form a heterogeneous group of amygdaloid neurons because they differentially express <i>calb2a</i> and <i>sst7</i>. Our work sheds light on the early evolution and development of the amygdala and provides a foundation for functional analysis of the newly defined DA subtypes of the extended amygdala in zebrafish.</p>

                <p>The degeneration of midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons disrupts the neural control of natural behavior, such as walking, posture, and gait in Parkinson's disease. While some aspects of motor symptoms can be managed by DA replacement therapies, others respond poorly. Recent advancements in machine learning-based technologies offer opportunities to better understand the organizing principles of behavior modules at fine timescales and its dependence on dopaminergic modulation. In the present study, we applied the motion sequencing (MoSeq) platform to study the spontaneous locomotor activities of neurotoxin and genetic mouse models of parkinsonism as the midbrain DA neurons progressively degenerate. We also evaluated the treatment efficacy of levodopa (<scp>l</scp>-DOPA) on behavioral modules at fine timescales. We revealed robust changes in the kinematics and usage of the behavioral modules that encode spontaneous locomotor activity. Further analysis demonstrates that fast behavioral modules with higher velocities were more vulnerable to loss of DA and preferentially affected at early stages of Parkinsonism. Last, <scp>l</scp>-DOPA effectively improved the velocity, but not the usage and transition probability, of behavioral modules in parkinsonian animals. In conclusion, the hypokinetic phenotypes in parkinsonism involve the decreased velocities of behavioral modules and their disrupted temporal organization during movement. Moreover, we showed that the therapeutic effect of <scp>l</scp>-DOPA is mainly mediated by its effect on the velocities of behavior modules at fine timescales. This work documents robust changes in the velocity, usage, and temporal organization of behavioral modules and their responsiveness to dopaminergic treatment under the parkinsonian state.</p>

The nosocomial transmission of respiratory pathogens is an ongoing healthcare challenge, with consequences for the health of vulnerable individuals. Outbreaks in hospitals can require the closure of bays or entire wards, reducing hospital capacity and having a financial impact upon healthcare providers. Here we evaluate a novel strategy of pre-exposure prophylaxis as a means to reduce the nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We model the effect of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) upon levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression, SARS-CoV-2 viral entry, and ultimately the probability of an infection. We then implement this model within simulations describing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections within a hospital context, simulating an intervention in which UDCA is given to patients on a ward for 10 days following the detection of a case of SARS-CoV-2 on that ward. Under default model parameters we infer a potential 17% reduction in the nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to patients, with increased importation of cases into the hospital increasing the effectiveness of the intervention, and of the order 1000–2000 patient treatment days per nosocomial patient infection prevented. Our study provides preliminary evidence of the value of pre-exposure prophylaxis with UDCA as a strategy to reduce nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

                <p>by Robert T. Heussner, Cameron F. Watson, Christopher Z. Eddy, Kunlun Wang, Eric M. Cramer, Allison L. Creason, Gordon B. Mills, Young Hwan Chang</p>

Multiplexed tissue imaging (MTI) and other spatial profiling technologies commonly utilize serial tissue sectioning to comprehensively profile samples by imaging each section with unique biomarker panels or assays. The dependence on serial sections is attributed to technological limitations of MTI panel size or incompatible multi-assay protocols. Although image registration can align serially sectioned MTIs, integration at the single-cell level poses a challenge due to inherent biological heterogeneity. Existing computational methods overlook both cell population heterogeneity across modalities and spatial information, which are critical for effectively completing this task. To address this problem, we first use Monte-Carlo simulations to estimate the overlap between serial 5μm-thick sections. We then introduce COEXIST, a novel algorithm that synergistically combines shared molecular profiles with spatial information to seamlessly integrate serial sections at the single-cell level. We demonstrate COEXIST necessity and performance across several applications. These include combining MTI panels for improved spatial single-cell profiling, rectification of miscalled cell phenotypes using a single MTI panel, and the comparison of MTI platforms at single-cell resolution. COEXIST not only elevates MTI platform validation but also overcomes the constraints of MTI’s panel size and the limitation of full nuclei on a single slide, capturing more intact nuclei in consecutive sections and thus enabling deeper profiling of cell lineages and functional states.

                <p>by Shicong Lei, Yu’an Li, Zheng Ma, Hepeng Zhang, Min Tang</p>

The run-and-tumble behavior is a simple yet powerful mechanism that enables microorganisms to efficiently navigate and adapt to their environment. These organisms run and tumble alternately, with transition rates modulated by intracellular chemical concentration. We introduce a neural network-based model capable of identifying the governing equations underlying run-and-tumble dynamics. This model accommodates the nonlinear functions describing movement responses to intracellular biochemical reactions by integrating the general structure of ODEs that represent these reactions, without requiring explicit reconstruction of the reaction mechanisms. It is trained on datasets of measured responses to simple, controllable signals. The resulting model is capable of predicting movement responses in more realistic, complex, temporally varying environments. Moreover, the model can be used to deduce the underlying structure of hidden intracellular biochemical dynamics. We have successfully tested the validity of the identified equations based on various models of <i>Escherichia coli</i> chemotaxis, demonstrating efficacy even in the presence of noisy measurements. Moreover, we have identified the governing equation of the photo-response of <i>Euglena gracilis</i> cells using experimental data, which was previously unknown, and predicted the potential architecture of the intracellular photo-response pathways for these cells.

Sexual dimorphism is a crucial aspect of morphological and behavioral traits in animals. Unlike males, adult female locusts, i.e., <i>Locusta migratoria</i>, have highly extensible abdominal intersegmental membranes (ISMs) that facilitate deep oviposition into the soil, displaying an iconic sexual dimorphism, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we reveal that the extremely extensible ISMs in adult females are predominantly controlled by two female-specific proteins, LmAbd-1 and LmAbd-6, ensuring the oviposition behavior. Moreover, we discovered that LmJHBP, a juvenile hormone (JH) binding protein specifically expressed in adult female ISMs, mediates JH signaling to induce <i>LmAbd-1</i> and <i>LmAbd-6</i> expression. Importantly, the sex differentiation pathway (i.e., <i>Tra-2</i> and <i>Dsx</i>) determines the female-specific expression pattern of <i>LmJHBP,</i> and thus those of JH signaling and <i>LmAbd-1</i> and <i>LmAbd-6</i> expression. The finding of Tra/Dsx-JHBP axis significantly advanced understanding of sexual dimorphism and the adaptation of oviposition behavior in insects, the evolutionarily successful “segmentation” animals.

                <p>by Aswin Krishna, Gerry Tonkin-Hill, Thibaut Morel-Journel, Stephen Bentley, Paul Turner, François Blanquart, Sonja Lehtinen</p>

Competition plays a key role in shaping the structure and diversity of bacterial populations. In many clinically important bacterial species, strains compete at multiple scales: at the between-host scale for new hosts to colonise, and at the within-host scale during co-colonisation. Characterising these multiple facets of competition plays an important role in understanding bacterial ecology. This is particularly relevant for antibiotic resistance, where competition between antibiotic-susceptible and resistant strains determines resistance dynamics. In this work, we perform survival analyses on a large longitudinal dataset of <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> carriage to quantify how within-host competition affects the rates of clearance and establishment of pneumococcal strains. We find that the presence of a within-host competitor is associated with a 33% increase in clearance and a 54% reduction in establishment. Priority effects and serotype differences partially predict the outcomes of this within-host competition. Further, we quantify the effects of antibiotic resistance on between- and within-host components of fitness. Antibiotic consumption is associated with increased clearance rate for both susceptible and resistant strains, albeit to a higher extent in susceptible strains. In the absence of antibiotics, we find some evidence that resistance is associated with increased susceptibility to within-host competition, suggesting a fitness cost of resistance. Overall, our work provides quantitative insights into pneumococcal competition across scales and the role of this competition in shaping pneumococcal epidemiology.

                <p>by Joseph G. Mine, Laura C. Dees, Claudia Wilke, Erik P. Willems, Zarin P. Machanda, Martin N. Muller, Melissa Emery Thompson, Richard W. Wrangham, Erik J. Scully, Kevin Langergraber, Sabine Stoll, Katie E. Slocombe, Simon W. Townsend</p>

Face-to-face communication in humans typically consists of a combination of vocal utterances and body language. Similarly, our closest living relatives, chimpanzees, produce multiple vocal signals alongside a wide array of manual gestures, body postures and facial expressions. In humans, the ontogenetic development of communicative behavior is known to be heavily influenced by the child’s primary caretakers. In chimpanzees, the extent to which communicative behavior is learned, as opposed to genetically inherited, remains openly debated. Here, we address this issue within the context of multi-modal communication by investigating kinship patterns in the production of visual behaviors alongside vocal signals in wild chimpanzees from the Kanyawara community, Uganda. We report a similarity in the number of visual behaviors combined with vocal signals between individuals who are related via their mother, while no similarity is observed between paternal relatives, in line with the observation that chimpanzee mothers constitute the primary caretakers, while fathers are not involved in parenting. We conclude that the development of this aspect of multi-modal communicative behavior is unlikely to be genetically driven and is rather a result of learning via exposure to social templates, akin to processes involved in the acquisition of human communication.

                Montoya et al. describe genome evolution of the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans during long-term infection of human patients. They show that fungal evolution during such infections is characterized by extensive genome restructuring, resulting in the emergence of genomically and phenotypically distinct sublineages that co-persist within the host niche.

                Mapping DNA replication in cell populations can miss low-efficiency events and cell-to-cell heterogeneity. Using single-molecule mapping, Damasceno et al. reveal a program of DNA replication in Leishmania major comprising high-efficiency DNA initiation at a single locus in each chromosome supplemented by widespread and stochastic low-efficiency initiation.

                Lin et al. identify a population of Pitx2+ cholinergic respiratory interneurons in the spinal cord that directly project to phrenic motor neurons and modulate their output. These interneurons are integrated into respiratory circuits and become activated to increase breathing amplitude in response to hypercapnia.

                How neural circuits establish precise connectivity remains unclear. Park et al. demonstrate that differentially expressed neurexin isoforms in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) direct axon sorting to specific glomeruli through transsynaptic interactions with distinct ligands, including neuroligin1, on mitral/tufted (M/T) cells. This finding suggests a novel role for neurexins during brain development to ensure accurate circuit assembly in the mammalian olfactory bulb.

                Mutual regulation between microglia and astrocytes is essential for maintaining normal brain development. Li et al. found that Lag3 specifically regulates a subpopulation of microglia in the developmental white matter and modulates the morphogenesis of astrocytes in this region via the p38 MAPK-GITRL-mTOR signaling pathway.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99462">The novel role of Kallistatin in linking metabolic syndromes and cognitive memory deterioration by inducing amyloid-β plaques accumulation and tau protein hyperphosphorylation</a></h4>

              
                Accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins in the hippocampus triggers cognitive memory decline in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The incidence and mortality of sporadic AD were tightly associated with diabetes and hyperlipidemia, while the exact linked molecular mechanism is uncertain. Here, the present investigation identified significantly elevated serum Kallistatin levels in AD patients concomitant with hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia, suggesting potential crosstalk between neuroendocrine regulation and metabolic dysregulation in AD pathophysiology. In addition, the constructed Kallistatin-transgenic (KAL-TG) mice defined its cognitive memory impairment phenotype and lower long-term potentiation in hippocampal CA1 neurons accompanied by increased Aβ deposition and tau phosphorylation. Mechanistically, Kallistatin could directly bind to the Notch1 receptor and thereby upregulate BACE1 expression by inhibiting PPARγ signaling, resulting in Aβ cleavage and production. Besides, Kallistatin could promote the phosphorylation of tau by activating GSK-3β. Fenofibrate, a hypolipidemic drug, could alleviate cognitive memory impairment by downregulating Aβ and tau phosphorylation of KAL-TG mice. Collectively, the experiments clarified a novel mechanism for Aβ accumulation and tau protein hyperphosphorylation regulation by Kallistatin, which might play a crucial role in linking metabolic syndromes and cognitive memory deterioration, and suggested that fenofibrate might have the potential for treating metabolism-related AD.

">Motor cortical areas facilitate schema-mediated integration of new motor information into memory</a></h4>

              
                New information is rapidly learned when it is compatible with pre-existing knowledge, i.e. with a previously acquired schematic representation of the learned information. The influence of pre-established schema on learning has been extensively studied in the declarative memory domain, where it was shown that schema-compatible information could be rapidly assimilated into neocortical storage, bypassing the slow hippocampo-neocortical memory transfer process. Schema-mediated learning was recently examined in the motor memory domain; however, its neural substrates remain unknown. The goal of this study was to address this knowledge gap using both univariate and multivariate analyses of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data acquired in 60 young healthy participants during the practice of a motor sequence that was either compatible or incompatible with a previously acquired cognitive-motor schema. Consistent with previous literature, our behavioural results suggest that performance of sequential movements was enhanced when practice occurred in a context that was compatible with the previously acquired schema. Brain imaging results show that practice in a schema-compatible context specifically recruited the left primary motor cortex and resulted in a decrease in connectivity between the bilateral motor cortex and a set of task-relevant brain regions including the hippocampus, striatum, and cerebellum. Temporally fine-grained MRI analyses revealed that multivoxel activation patterns in the primary motor and the premotor cortices were modulated by schema-compatibility, with greater pattern similarity detected for sequence elements corresponding to and surrounding novel sequential movements under schema-compatible compared with -incompatible conditions. Altogether, these results suggest that motor cortical regions facilitate schema-mediated integration of novel movements into memory.

                Events are thought to be encoded into memory in the context of temporally-adjacent events. Here, using fMRI, we show that when a visual stimulus from the past is re-encountered, lateral occipitotemporal cortex (LOTC) reinstates visual content from stimuli that were adjacent to the original encounter. This LOTC reinstatement effect was selective to stimuli that were subjectively remembered and was mediated by stimulus-specific activity patterns within the hippocampus.

">Geometric principles determining the morphology of oligodendrocyte precursor cells in brain white matter</a></h4>

              
                We used transgenic mice expressing membrane-tagged green fluorescence protein in the oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), high-resolution imaging, and detailed quantitative morphometric analysis to investigate the geometrical principles that govern structural organization of OPCs in the mouse corpus callosum. Our major findings are: (1) During the first two months of postnatal life in mice, total length of all OPCs processes increases via elaboration of new branches from the existing processes rather than via the appearance of new processes; (2) New branches are preferentially added to more distal sites of OPCs processes; (3) The processes of OPCs show stronger preferential alignment with the posterior-anterior brain axis rather than with the lateral-medial or dorsal-ventral brain axes; at the same time, the processes of OPCs show stronger preferential alignment with the lateral-medial than with the dorsal-ventral brain axis. Our study is the first detailed comprehensive analysis of OPCs morphology comparable to those available for neurons. It helps understanding the geometrical principles that govern structural organization of OPCs. These principles are important when taking into account that OPCs receive synaptic input from neurons and are capable of synaptic integration. Arborization and structural organization of OPCs processes is expected to influence the travel of synaptic input from the processes (where synapses are located) to the cell soma (where synaptic inputs are integrated), in analogy to how it occurs in neurons. Hence, the integrated synaptic signal at the OPCs cell soma which is likely to influence development and behavior of OPCs will depend on the cell morphology.

">Testing the auditory steady-state response (ASSR) to 40-Hz and 27-Hz click trains in children with autism spectrum disorder and their first-degree biological relatives: A high-density electroencephalographic (EEG) study</a></h4>

              
                Motivation: Altered auditory processing likely contributes to core social and attentional impairments in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The auditory steady-state response (ASSR), a neural measure of auditory processing and cortical excitatory-inhibitory balance, has yielded mixed results in ASD. This study uses high density electroencephalography (EEG) to evaluate ASSR in ASD and unaffected siblings to clarify neural mechanisms underlying auditory deficits in autism. Methods: High-density 70-channel EEG was recorded in children (8-12 years, IQ >80) with ASD (n=53), typically developing (TD) peers (n=35), and unaffected biological siblings (n=26) during 500-ms binaural click trains (27- and 40-Hz) in an active oddball task. Results: No group differences were observed in frequency-following responses (FFR) to 27- or 40-Hz stimuli, although higher 40-Hz power was associated with older age and better behavioral performance in ASD. The broad-band response from 180-250 ms was reduced in ASD for both stimulation frequencies, particularly in the low-frequency (<8 Hz) range, and significantly correlated with IQ and age. Siblings showed intermediate broad-band responses. Discussion: While FFRs appeared intact in ASD, we observed reduced broad-band response in the transition period to the steady state FFR, which was specific to low (<8-Hz) frequencies, potentially reflecting reduced synchronization at timescales that correspond with slower, syllabic rhythms (~4-8 Hz) occurring in natural speech. Intermediate responses in first-degree relatives suggest that this is related to genetic vulnerability for ASD and highlights its clinical relevance. These findings suggest intact sensory processing in ASD alongside possible top-down auditory feedback deficits, which may serve as heritable neurophysiological markers.

">Basal forebrain and neural correlates of self-regulation traits in sustained attention</a></h4>

              
                Self-regulation is a human trait consistently associated with success in both academic and professional settings and to better mental health. Based on previous findings, we used functional imaging data in a sustained attention tasks to test three hypotheses on neural substrates associated with individual differences in self-regulation. The first linked higher self-regulation and cognitive control, predicting modulation of recruitment of prefrontal substrates. The second, originating in the animal literature, suggests increased recruitment of cholinergic substrates in the basal forebrain. The third predicted higher modulation of reward-sensitive regions in the brainstem in less regulated individuals for differences in reward levels during the task. The second hypothesis was confirmed by our study, which also provided suggestive evidence for the third hypothesis. Our data suggest that one mechanism of higher self-regulation in man may ensue from greater activity in the cholinergic system to sustain attention during a cognitively simple task.

">Music Scaffolds Visual Statistical Sequence Learning Through Network-Level Reorganization in the Brain</a></h4>

              
                Statistical learning - the ability to extract patterns from noisy continuous experiences - is fundamental to human cognition. Yet, how contextual factors shape this process remains poorly understood. Music is an important example of such contextual factors, because it is ubiquitous in human experience and provides a rich temporally-structured stimulus that can co-occur with other learning processes. Here we demonstrate that pairing music fundamentally enhances visual statistical learning, and this is correlated with systematic reorganization of large-scale brain networks. Using fMRI and a novel probabilistic sequence learning paradigm, we show that familiar melodies significantly improved participants' ability to segment continuous visual streams into events and learn sequential relationships. Neuroimaging analyses revealed that the presence of music fundamentally altered the neural network organization that coordinates learning mechanisms: while sequence learning in silence engaged frontal-parietal networks associated with explicit pattern extraction, providing musical temporal structure as a context shifted learning toward MTL-vmPFC circuits recently implicated in schema-guided memory processing. Machine learning analyses confirmed these architectural differences, with the music condition achieving optimal neural prediction of behavioral performance through distributed connectivity patterns while control condition relied on concentrated processing. Our findings support a Cross-Modal Temporal Scaffolding Theory, demonstrating that structured temporal context signals from one modality (here, music) can create more efficient neural states for sequence processing in another through dual mechanisms: enhanced memory integration through schema-guided learning and reduced demands on explicit control resources. These results identify network-level principles for optimizing statistical learning, with broad implications for understanding how environmental context shapes human learning capacity.

">A functional trade-off between executive control and implicit statistical learning is dynamically gated by mind wandering</a></h4>

              
                Human cognition must balance goal-directed behavior with the need to learn from environmental regularities. Mind wandering (MW), a state of attentional decoupling from the task at hand, is paradoxically associated with both executive failures and enhanced implicit statistical learning, yet the direct relationship between these phenomena remains unclear. Here, we provide direct behavioral evidence for a functional trade-off between these competing demands. Using a task that concurrently measured response inhibition, statistical learning, and self-reported task focus, we show that MW is associated with impaired inhibitory control but enhanced learning of probabilistic sequences. Critically, we reveal that these effects are mechanistically linked: the magnitude of the learning enhancement during MW is quantitatively modulated by the efficacy of response inhibition. These findings demonstrate that transient lapses in top-down executive control directly facilitate the implicit extraction of environmental statistics, supporting neurocompetition models and framing MW as a cognitive state that may be evolutionarily preserved to promote the unsupervised acquisition of predictive models.

">Silent Speech Recognition with Wearable Magnetometers</a></h4>

              
                Next-generation human-computer interaction (HCI) is moving towards more seamless, intuitive, and personal modes of communication, redefining how we interact with technology and one another. Within this landscape, silent speech recognition (SSR) offers a powerful new interaction paradigm, enabling hands-free, private interaction while supporting individuals with speech impairments and enabling communication in noisy or sensitive environments. Recent advances in miniaturized sensors and artificial intelligence (AI) have accelerated the development of more sophisticated wearable SSR systems, driven by growing demand for effortless and accessible communication. Although electrophysiological (ExG) modalities, particularly electromyography (EMG), have dominated early efforts in developing wearable SSR, critical challenges remain. Limited generalizability across users, sensor-skin interface issues, and difficulties with the comfort of use are all current roadblocks to reliable, high-fidelity signals in a wearable form factor. We propose that magnetometers offer a promising alternative to ExG and have the potential to unlock more robust, generalizable, and user-friendly SSR systems. We demonstrate that magnetometers embedded in a headphone form factor achieve a per-user SSR accuracy of 86%, significantly outperforming previously reported state-of-the-art wearable headphones combining ExG and inertial measurement units (IMUs). In addition, we show that wearable magnetometry enables generalization across individuals for SSR. Extending beyond headphones, we also introduce a necklace form factor with magnetometers that is capable of decoding both silent and overt speech in ambient conditions, further showcasing the versatility of magnetometers across different wearable designs in real-world conditions.

">Single-neuron encoding of rapidly learned visual information reshapes human perception</a></h4>

              
                Humans can swiftly learn to recognize visual objects after minimal exposure. Integrating new information with existing knowledge requires forming enduring neuronal representations to enable future recognition. Yet, the neuronal mechanisms in the human brain underlying such rapid perceptual changes remain unclear. We recorded single-neuron activity in occipital (OC) and medial temporal lobe (MTL) regions as participants rapidly learned to recognize degraded images. OC and MTL neurons modulated their activity to encode newly learned visual information and reshape perception. Population decoding revealed that OC neurons required additional processing time to resolve the identity of learned images, delaying neuronal responses in the MTL. Our findings indicate that OC supports recognition after rapid learning via extensive recurrent processing, potentially involving higher-order neocortical areas, without relying on feedback from MTL. These results provide mechanistic constraints for biologically plausible models of visual recognition and few-shot visual learning.

                Cellular transplantation therapies have been extensively used in experimental spinal cord injury research. However, there is no consensus as to what the most effective cellular controls for the therapeutic cell of interest are. For this reason, we examined if dead cells obtained through pro-longed heat treatment can act as an appropriate cellular control for intravenously injected Sca-1+ mesenchymal precursor cells (MPCs) in C5 unilateral contusion cervical spinal cord injury. This was tested in single intravenous MPCs injection alone or intravenous MPCs plus intraspinal neural stem cells (NSCs) combinatory transplantation studies. MPCs were isolated from the compact bone of FVB mice while NSCs were isolated from the subventricular zone of luciferase-GFP transgenic FVB mice. Dead MPCs were obtained by heating at 72C for at least 12 hours. In the MPCs only transplant study, injured mice received an injection of 1x106 dead or live MPCs D1 post-injury. Mice were then sacrificed at 8 weeks post-injury. In this study, intravenous injections of dead MPCs showed no statistical difference in injured paw usage compared to live MPCs, but behavior was improved compared to the media vehicle only control at D7 and D21. In the combinatory MPCs plus NSCs transplant study, injured mice received an intravenous injection of 1x106 dead or live MPCs D1 post-injury followed by intraspinal injection of 100,000 NSCs at D3 or D7 post-injury. Another two cohorts of mice received only NSCs at D3 or D7 post-injury. Mice were then sacrificed at 6 weeks post-injury. In this study, there was no functional difference in any of the groups in the dual injection study. Morphologically, mice receiving IV injection of dead MPCs had a smaller lesion size compared to the vehicular control, but the lesion size was larger than that of the lesion size in mice receiving live MPC injection. Dead cells elicited functional and anatomical benefits for the spinal cord injured mouse. In summary, dead cells obtained through prolonged heat treatment proved to be inconsistent and not optimal for use as cellular controls for cell transplantation studies in spinal cord injury but provides positive evidence for non-transplantation based cell therapies.

                The current growth of artificial intelligence (AI) tools provides an unprecedented opportunity to extract deeper insights from neurophysiological data while also enabling the reproduction and prediction of brain responses to a wide range of events and situations. Here, we introduce the Concept2Brain model, a deep network architecture designed to generate synthetic electrophysiological responses to semantic/emotional information conveyed through pictures or text. Leveraging AI solutions like CLIP from OpenAI, the model generates a representation of pictorial or language input and maps it into an electrophysiological latent space. We demonstrate that this openly available resource generates synthetic neural responses that closely resemble those observed in studies of naturalistic scene perception. The Concept2Brain model is provided as a web service tool for creating open and reproducible EEG datasets, allowing users to predict brain responses to any semantic concept or picture. Beyond its applied functionality, it also paves the way for AI-driven modeling of brain activity, offering new possibilities for studying how the brain represents the world.

">Degeneracy and bifurcation diversity at the single neuron level</a></h4>

              
                Degeneracy, the capacity of structurally distinct systems to achieve similar functions, is a fundamental property of living organisms, enabling adaptability and resilience. Neurons can maintain stable activity patterns despite wide variability in ion channel expression, highlighting how distinct internal configurations can yield equivalent electrophysiological behaviors. However, it remains unclear how degeneracy manifests in the context of bifurcations, the critical transitions between activity regimes that underlie phenomena such as different firing patterns, seizures, and depolarization block. Here, we investigate how different biophysical parameter sets can lead to equivalent bifurcation sequences. Using a minimal neuron model with three variable conductances, we systematically explore how changes in extracellular potassium, mimicking physiological and pathological conditions, affect neuronal dynamics. Our results reveal that neurons with distinct intrinsic properties can traverse the same bifurcation pathways, entering regimes of bursting, seizure-like activity, and depolarization block. Yet, the specific parameter set determines the sensitivity and thresholds for these transitions. This work clarifies how degeneracy extends to the dynamical landscape of neurons, with implications for understanding resilience and vulnerability in neural circuits

                Using simulation and a simple mathematical argument we argue that the refresh rate of overhead projectors, used in experiments on the visual system, may impact the perception of fast moving objects at the retinal and cortical level (V1), and thereby at the level of psychophysics.

">Polyadic synapses introduce unique wiring architectures in T5 cells of Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Connectomes provide neuronal wiring diagrams and allow for investigating the detailed synaptic morphology of each connection. In the visual system of Drosophila, T5 cells are the primary motion-sensing neurons in the OFF-pathway. On their dendrites, they receive input from the excitatory Tm1, Tm2, Tm4, Tm9 and the inhibitory CT1 neurons in a spatial arrangement which depends on their preferred direction. This connectivity, however, has not yet been investigated with respect to specific types of polyadic synapses which are known to be abundant in the fly nervous system. In this study, we use the FlyWire database and identify that Tm and CT1 cells wire on T5a dendrites via eight polyadic synapse types. We then explore the distribution of the different synapse types on T5a dendrites and find differences in their spatial patterns. Finally, we show that the polyadic morphology is setting a directional wiring architecture at the T5 network level. Our work showcases the complexity that polyadic synapses introduce in T5 connectivity.

">Noisy neural systems with static and dynamic Hopf bifurcation parameters</a></h4>

              
                Stochastic neural oscillations may be quasi-cycles or stochastic limit cycles. Here we discuss how and when these arise in stochastic dynamical systems with Hopf bifurcations, and point to relevant mathematical results. We describe a new type of oscillation, quasi-limit-cycles, which are limit cycles stirred up by noise during time periods called  bifurcation delays in deterministic models. We define a class of models of neural activity all of which display Hopf bifurcations in their base (fixed bifurcation parameter) deterministic form. We then introduce a two-time, slow-fast, version of our model class, in which the bifurcation parameter, instead of being fixed, changes on a time scale slower than the time scale of the state variables. We demonstrate the effects of the slowly changing bifurcation parameter on the deterministic dynamics of the state variables, in particular  delayed bifurcation. We find a new understanding about the length of the delay. Most importantly, we display with simulations the effect of noise on the dynamics of both base system and slow-fast system models in our class. Adding noise to a slow-fast model eliminates the bifurcation delay and induces what we call  quasi-limit-cycles during the delay period. We measure the sizes of the quasi-limit-cycles and show that they are closely related to the sizes of the limit cycles that would arise from the same values of the bifurcation parameter in the deterministic base system. We conclude that, given the similarities of the dynamics of these models under moderate noise, there is little reason to favour one model over another when studying the behaviour of large groups of neurons, i.e., when used as neural mass models.

                <p>by Bengi Ruken Yavuz, Ugur Sahin, Hyunbum Jang, Ruth Nussinov, Nurcan Tuncbag</p>

Effective identification of oncogenic mutations is essential for diagnosis, forecasting resistance, and metastasis in remission. It is required for an optimal drug regimen. We develop a framework to discover mutations that <i>co-exist</i> in different oncoproteins, and those that are <i>excluded</i>, likely encoding oncogene-induced senescence. For the first, mapping the proteins onto pathways assist combinatorial drug selections and help detect metastases. The second provides the molecular basis for synthetic lethality, to date investigated at the genome level. Our pan-cancer profiles of ~60,000 tumor sequences, detect 3424 co-existing tumor-specific mutations. Mapping them onto pathways indicates that they preferentially promote specific primary tumors. We uncover metastatic mutations and provide metastatic breast-cancer markers. This work not only clarifies the mechanistic basis of intratumor mutational diversity but usefully reveals markers for metastasis in patients’ genomes and introduces a novel computational framework for detecting metastasis based on tumor mutational profiles. Mapping the mutations onto pathways provides an invaluable metastasis-targeting resource, guiding drug combinations.

                <p>by Oswaldo Gressani, Niel Hens</p>

The serial interval of an infectious disease is a key instrument to understand transmission dynamics. Estimation of the serial interval distribution from illness onset data extracted from transmission pairs is challenging due to the presence of censoring and state-of-the-art methods mostly rely on parametric models. We present a fully data-driven methodology to estimate the serial interval distribution based on interval-censored serial interval data. The proposed nonparametric estimator of the cumulative distribution function of the serial interval is based on the class of uniform mixtures. Closed-form solutions are available for point estimates of different serial interval features and the bootstrap is used to construct confidence intervals. Algorithms underlying our approach are simple, stable, and computationally inexpensive, making them easily implementable in a programming language that is most familiar to a potential user. The nonparametric user-friendly routine is included in the EpiDelays package for ease of implementation. Our method complements existing parametric approaches for serial interval estimation and permits to analyze past, current, or future illness onset data streams following a set of best practices in epidemiological delay modeling.

                <p>by Michele Tizzani, Laetitia Gauvin</p>

Socioeconomic inequalities significantly influence infectious disease outcomes, as seen with COVID-19, but the pathways through which socioeconomic conditions affect transmission dynamics remain unclear. To address this, we conducted a survey representative of the Italian population, stratified by age, gender, geographical area, city size, employment status, and education level. The survey’s final aim was to estimate differences in contact and protective behaviors across various population strata, both of which are crucial for understanding transmission dynamics. Our initial insights based on the survey indicate that years after the pandemic began, the perceived impact of COVID-19 on professional, economic, social, and psychological dimensions varied across socioeconomic strata, extending beyond the epidemiological outcomes. This reinforces the need for approaches that systematically consider socioeconomic determinants. In this context, using generalized linear models, we identified associations between socioeconomic factors and vaccination status for both COVID-19 and influenza, as well as the influence of socioeconomic conditions on mask-wearing and social distancing. Importantly, we also observed differences in contact behaviors based on employment status while education level did not show a significant association. These findings highlight the complex interplay of socioeconomic and demographic factors in shaping protective behavior and contact patterns. Understanding these dynamics can contribute to the improvement of epidemic models and better guide public health efforts for at-risk groups.

                <p>by Dini Wang, Peng Yi, Yiguang Hong, Jie Chen, Gang Yan</p>

Cooperation is fundamental to human societies, and the interaction structure among individuals profoundly shapes its emergence and evolution. In real-world scenarios, cooperation prevails in multi-group (higher-order) populations, beyond just dyadic behaviors. Despite recent studies on group dilemmas in higher-order networks, the exploration of cooperation driven by higher-order strategy updates remains limited due to the intricacy and indivisibility of group-wise interactions. Here we investigate four categories of higher-order mechanisms for strategy updates in public goods games and establish their mathematical conditions for the emergence of cooperation. Such conditions uncover the impact of both higher-order strategy updates and network properties on evolutionary outcomes, notably highlighting the enhancement of cooperation by overlaps between groups. Interestingly, we discover that the group-mutual comparison update – selecting a high-fitness group and then imitating a random individual within this group – can prominently promote cooperation. Our analyses further unveil that, compared to pairwise interactions, higher-order strategy updates generally improve cooperation in most higher-order networks. These findings underscore the pivotal role of higher-order strategy updates in fostering collective cooperation in complex social systems.

                <p>by Franco Gino Brunello, Lorenzo Erra, Juan Nicola, Marcelo Adrián Martí</p>

Short Linear Motifs (SLiMs) are protein functionally relevant regions that mediate reversible protein-protein interactions. Variants that disrupt SLiMs can lead to numerous Mendelian diseases. Although various bioinformatic tools have been developed to identify SLiMs, most suffer from low specificity. In our previous work, we demonstrated that integrating sequence variant information with structural analysis can enhance the prediction of true functional SLiMs while simultaneously generating tolerance matrices that indicate whether each of the 19 possible single amino acid substitutions (SASs) is tolerated. However, the scarcity of representative crystallographic structures of SLiM-receptor complexes posed a significant limitation. In this study, we demonstrate that these interactions can be modeled using AlphaFold2 (AF2) to generate high-quality structures that serve as input for our MotSASi method. These AF2-derived structures show robust performance, both in reproducing known structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and in reflecting the deleterious effects of known sequence variants. This updated version of MotSASi expands the repertoire of high-confidence predicted SLiMs and provides a comprehensive catalog of variants located within SLiMs, along with their respective deleteriousness assessments. When compared to AlphaMissense, MotSASi demonstrates superior performance in predicting variant deleteriousness. By contributing to the accurate identification and interpretation of variants, this work aligns with ACMG/AMP standards and aims to improve diagnostic rates in clinical genomics.

                <p>by Ismael Hernández-Núñez, Alaina Urman, Xiaodong Zhang, William Jacobs, Christy Hoffmann, Ellen G. Harding, Shiming Chen, Meelad M. Dawlaty, Philip A. Ruzycki, John R. Edwards, Brian S. Clark</p>

Retinal cell fate specification from multipotent retinal progenitors is governed by dynamic changes in chromatin structure and gene expression. Methylation at cytosines in DNA (5mC) is actively regulated for proper control of gene expression and chromatin architecture. Numerous genes display active DNA demethylation across retinal development; a process that requires oxidation of 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and is controlled by the ten-eleven translocation (TET) methylcytosine dioxygenase enzymes. Using an allelic series of conditional TET enzyme mutants in mice, we determine that DNA demethylation is required upstream of NRL and NR2E3 expression for the establishment of rod-photoreceptor fate. Using histological, behavioral, transcriptomic, and base-pair resolution DNA methylation analyses, we establish that inhibition of active DNA demethylation results in global changes in gene expression and methylation patterns that prevent photoreceptor precursors from adopting a rod-photoreceptor fate, instead producing a retina in which all photoreceptors specify as cones. Our results establish the TET enzymes and DNA demethylation as critical regulators of retinal development and cell fate specification, elucidating a novel mechanism required for the specification of rod-photoreceptors.

These factors result in major difficulties in the processing of contextual information in social and non-social situations. To assess divergence in autistic traits, it is critical to consider sex- and age-related variability. Nevertheless, these differences remain largely elusive. Animal models of autism offer the possibility to examine contextual processing at the single-neuron level. Here, we investigated predictive processing of contextual auditory cues in the auditory midbrain of control and prenatally valproic acid-induced rats, a well-established animal model of autism. The rats were prepubertal and adult female and male animals. We performed single-unit recordings in the inferior colliculus of control and prenatally, or in utero, exposed rats under the classical oddball paradigm and non-repetitive cascade control sequences to study neuronal mismatch. This is the neuronal correlate of mismatch negativity, the brain’s automatic response to interruptions in environmental regularity. When comparing control and exposed rats, our results demonstrated a reduction in neuronal mismatch in rats exposed to valproic acid. However, exposed adult females exhibited an increased neuronal mismatch compared to their control counterparts. With respect to sex distinctions, valproic acid induced sex differences in neuronal mismatch of prepubertal and adult rats that are not observable in control animals. Moreover, we detected an age-dependent refinement in prediction error that is not affected by the drug. But valproic acid altered typical developmental trajectory of neuronal mismatch in both sexes. Such observations support sex- and age-related effects of in utero valproic acid exposure in contextual auditory processing at the neural level of the inferior colliculus. In autism, atypical predictive processing of environmental regularities underlies unusual responses to novel experiences. The present study highlights the importance of sex and age, that confer heterogeneity to these challenges.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The dorsal and ventral hippocampus have distinct processing properties, but it remains unclear if interneuron subtypes differ in connectivity along the dorsoventral axis. Oriens lacunosum-moleculare (OLM) interneurons, identified by the <i>Chrna2</i> gene, are known to regulate memory processes differently along this axis. OLMɑ2 cells bidirectionally modulate risk-taking behavior, while ventral hippocampal medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)-projecting neurons regulate approach and avoidance behaviors. Using rabies virus-mediated monosynaptic retrograde tracing, we show that OLMɑ2 cells receive differential innervation across the dorsal, intermediate, and ventral hippocampus. We find that CA1 and CA3 inputs differ between hippocampal poles, suggesting that OLMɑ2 cells may have distinct feedback and feed-forward inhibitory roles in the hippocampal microcircuit. Intermediate OLMɑ2 cells uniquely receive substantial input from the subiculum and dorsal/medial raphe nuclei, as well as widespread CA2 inputs potentially linked to social memory. The medial septum and diagonal band of Broca provide cholinergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic inputs across the axis, likely influencing disinhibition and oscillatory activity during various behavioral states. Excitatory input to intermediate-ventral OLMɑ2 cells partly arises from CA1 projection neurons targeting the mPFC. This suggests a gate-switching function that favors CA3 input to projection neurons by two different mechanisms related to feedback and feed-forward inhibition. In conclusion, OLMɑ2 cells exhibit distinct presynaptic input profiles along the dorsoventral axis, with major differences in the proportions of intrahippocampal inputs, highlighting their diverse roles in hippocampal microcircuits.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Personalized approaches to ischemic stroke diagnosis are needed. We determine differences in proteomic signatures of incident embolic (EIS) and thrombotic stroke (TIS) by age and resultant pathways using large-scale proteomics.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC) from visit 2 (V2, 1990–1992) until 2020 without prevalent stroke with available SomaScan data (4,955 protein targets) at V2 (mid-life, n = 10,929), and then again at visit 5 (V5, 2011–2013, n = 4,463) were included. Covariate adjusted Cox hazard models determined the association between proteins, and adjudicated incident EIS or TIS from V2 to V5 and from V5 to 2020.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 10,929 participants (56% female, 23% Black, follow-up ~20 years), 20 proteins measured in mid-life were associated with either EIS (n = 168) or TIS (n = 459) in mid-life, and 4 measured in late-life were associated with late-life stroke (73 EIS and 124 TIS events) at the Bonferroni threshold <i>p</i> &lt; 1E−5. In mid-life, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NPPB) was significantly associated with EIS, but not TIS (<i>p</i>-difference = 9.14E−7). Nineteen mid-life proteins were strongly associated with TIS; 7 strongly associated with TIS and only nominally (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) with EIS and the remaining 12 with TIS only. In late-life, NPPB, serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 4, oligodendrocyte-myelin-glycoprotein, and neurocan-core protein were significantly associated with EIS, but not TIS. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tools implicated cancer for EIS-associated proteins, whereas TIS pathways reflected cell-structure and atherogenesis.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We identified plasma proteins associated with risk of EIS versus TIS reflecting distinct stroke mechanisms: cardiac dysfunction protein in EIS (eg, NPPB) and inflammation dysregulation in TIS (eg, interleukins). ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

We show in <i>Drosophila</i> that odors alone activate gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs), trigger proboscis extension reflex (PER), a canonical taste-evoked feeding behavior, and enhance food intake. Odor-evoked PER requires the function of sugar-sensing GRNs but not olfactory organs. Calcium imaging and electrophysiological recording show that GRNs directly respond to odors. Odor-evoked PER is mediated by the Gr5a receptor, and is bidirectionally modulated by olfactory binding proteins. Finally, odors and sucrose co-applied to GRNs synergistically enhance PER and food consumption. These results reveal a cell-intrinsic mechanism for odor-taste multimodal integration that takes place as early as in GRNs, indicating that unified chemosensory experience is a product of layered integration in peripheral neurons and in the brain.

">A synaptic mechanism for encoding the learned value of action-derived safety</a></h4>

              
                Motivated behavior is often framed in terms of biologically grounded outcomes, such as food or threat. Yet many motivated actions, like the pursuit of safety or agency, depend on outcomes that lack explicit sensory value and must instead be inferred from experience. Here, we identify a thalamostriatal circuit mechanism by which such internally constructed outcomes acquire motivational value. In mice performing an active avoidance task, neurons in the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) projecting to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) develop a safety-encoding signal that emerges following successful avoidance. This signal is experience-dependent and value-sensitive, diminishing upon devaluation of the instrumental contingency. Selective silencing of the PVT[-&gt;]NAc projection at safety onset disrupts avoidance persistence without impairing action-outcome learning, as confirmed by computational modeling of value updating based on prediction error. Mechanistically, PVT input recruits cholinergic interneurons (CINs) to modulate dopamine release and this influence depends on synaptic potentiation mediated by GluA2-lacking AMPA receptor insertion at PVT-CIN synapses. Disrupting this plasticity selectively impairs the avoidance response by blunting the motivational value of safety without affecting acquisition. These findings reveal how thalamic circuits assign value to abstract, internal outcomes, providing a framework for understanding how goals like safety are inferred, stabilized, and rendered behaviorally effective.

">Precision Functional Neuroimaging Reveals Individually Specific Auditory Responses in Infants</a></h4>

              
                Adaptively responding to salient stimuli in the environment is a fundamental feature of cognitive development in early life, which is enabled by the developing brain. Understanding individual variability in how the brain supports this fundamental process is essential for uncovering neurodevelopmental trajectories and potential neurodevelopmental risks. In the present study, we used a precision functional imaging approach to probe activation in response to salient auditory stimuli and its relation to brain functional networks in individual infants. A minimum of 60 minutes of fMRI BOLD data with an auditory oddball paradigm were collected in ten infants with a mean postmenstrual age of 48 weeks. Results demonstrate the feasibility of performing a precision functional imaging study to investigate individual specific responses to salient stimuli in infants. While responses to the auditory oddball were consistent between individuals in auditory processing areas, responses across the rest of the brain differed across individuals in their magnitude and shape. Individual specific response patterns appeared to be relatively stable and differed from other participant's response patterns, despite fluctuations across runs. Commonalities and differences between individuals demonstrated in this sample contribute to our understanding of how the developing brain instantiates processing of salient stimuli. Our findings suggest that during early development, early unimodal processing is well conserved across individuals, however subsequent perceptual processing is still being personally defined. In this context, individual specific response patterns could be a promising target for biomarkers of normative brain and cognitive development.

">Early Reprogramming Intermediates Enable Direct Neuronal Conversion via NGN2</a></h4>

              
                The generation of engineered neurons via Neurogenin-2 (NGN2) overexpression, starting from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), is a powerful tool for modeling neurological diseases. However, using stabilized hiPSCs as a starting point significantly increases the time required to obtain a valuable human neuronal model in vitro. Here, we demonstrated that as little as 3 days of transient expression of reprogramming factors in human fibroblasts can unlock the ability of these cells to transdifferentiate into neurons upon overexpression of NGN2. We used single-cell transcriptomic data to dissect the distinct cell identities that emerge during reprogramming. We identified three distinct reprogramming intermediate populations responsive to NGN2-mediated neuronal induction and found that partial reprogramming for only 3 days is sufficient to mediate NGN2 neuronal conversion of human fibroblasts. Moreover, we found that the efficiency in neuronal fate acquisition mediated by NGN2 overexpression is strictly correlated with the stage of reprogramming used as a starting point.

">Emotional and Linguistic Features Predict Prefrontal Functional Connectivity during Ongoing Dialogues: An fNIRS Investigation</a></h4>

              
                Identifying the neural bases of language has been a central focus in neuroscience since the pioneering case studies by Broca and Wernicke. Contemporary research has moved beyond classical modular models to conceptualize language as supported by a distributed network of anatomically and functionally interconnected brain regions. Yet, few studies have explored how these networks operate during spontaneous, real-life speech, limiting our understanding of language in natural contexts. In this study, we collected data from 84 individuals engaged in live conversations. Participants' prefrontal brain activity was recorded using functional near-infrared spectroscopy hyperscanning, and functional connectivity was quantified via wavelet transform coherence. Dialogues were manually transcribed, and computational methods were applied to extract emotional and semantic/syntactic features from the speech data. Using linear mixed-effects models, we found that emotional content significantly predicted prefrontal functional connectivity (R^2 marginal = 0.04). Among all emotional predictors, expressed anger was the most robust: higher anger levels were associated with reduced connectivity between the left middle frontal gyrus and the right inferior frontal gyrus (q = .032, R^2 marginal = 0.07). While other semantic and syntactic features did not predict overall connectivity, degree assortativity - an index of linguistic structure - was negatively associated with connectivity between the superior frontal gyri and the left inferior frontal gyrus (q = .026, R^2 marginal = 0.08). These findings highlight how both affective and structural properties of speech modulate prefrontal connectivity during real-life interaction. More broadly, this work demonstrates the potential of integrating computational linguistics with social neuroscience to uncover the neural mechanisms of real-life social interactions.

">Rational Expectations and Kinematic Information in Coordination Games</a></h4>

              
                Successful coordination often requires integrating strategic reasoning with real-time observations of others' actions, yet how humans resolve conflicts between these information sources remains unclear. This study aimed to fill this gap by examining how people coordinate in a strategic game when observing partial kinematic information from their partner's actions. Participants played a HI-LO game with a virtual partner, choosing payoffs based on grasping movements toward invisible large and small targets. Hand movements were presented as schematic animations, with partners grasping targets linked to higher or lower payoffs across two configurations. Participants relied exclusively on kinematic cues from hand shape changes in maximum grip aperture to infer their partner's choices. There were two main findings. While participants preferred higher payoffs consistent with rational game-theoretic expectations, reliable kinematic cues overrode these expectations. When early grip aperture changes indicated the partner was reaching for a large target associated with a lower payoff, participants abandoned their default preference for higher payoffs. They chose the lower option instead, achieving a high coordination success rate. These findings demonstrate that people prioritize kinematic cues about others' choices over theoretical assumptions about rational behavior when coordinating. This suggests that movement-based inferences about others' actions in natural social interactions may be weighted more heavily than strategic reasoning when the two sources of information conflict.

">Distinct Motor Cortex Interneuron Plasticity and Its Association with Prefrontal Brain Volume in Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by motor and cognitive deficits, including abnormal primary motor cortex (M1) excitability and diminished sensorimotor neuroplasticity. While paired associative stimulation (PAS) can induce M1 plasticity, people with PD (PwPD) demonstrate variability that cannot be accounted for by disease progression or medication status. Distinct M1 interneuron populations and attention-related brain structures may influence the reduced PAS-induced neuroplasticity. We aimed to characterize M1 interneuron plasticity in PwPD using attention-modulated PAS and identify neurostructural correlates. PwPD underwent MRI, then a PAS protocol with task-relevant attention. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) assessments of corticospinal excitability using posterior-to-anterior (PA) and anterior-to-posterior (AP) current directions were employed before and three post-PAS time-points. PAS induced distinct time-dependent M1 interneuron excitability changes. PA TMS showed increased corticospinal excitability at all post-PAS time-points; AP TMS increased only at 30 minutes. Rostral middle frontal gyrus volume uniquely explained variance in PA-sensitive M1 interneuron plasticity. In contrast, AP-sensitive plasticity was associated with baseline AP TMS excitability and age. These findings highlight that M1 interneuron circuits show unique neuroplasticity patterns in PwPD and relate to prefrontal brain volume. Our results suggest a complex interplay between motor and cognition-related deficits as interrelated pathophysiological features in PD.

">Musical complexity governs a tradeoff between reliability and dimensionality in the neural code</a></h4>

              
                The rich experience of listening to music depends on the neural integration of its constituent elements within the early auditory pathway. Here, we performed the first large-scale study of neural responses to complex music to characterize the neural coding of individual instruments and mixtures with both normal hearing and mild-to-moderate hearing loss. Using coherence and manifold analyses along with deep learning, we identified strong nonlinear interactions in mixed music that impacted the fidelity and geometry of the neural code. We found that increasing musical complexity resulted in the creation of new neural modes, but this increased dimensionality was associated with decreased reliability. This tradeoff persisted even after hearing loss, the effects of which were largely corrected with suitable amplification. These results suggest that the neural coding of music is governed by an inherent tradeoff and highlight a fundamental challenge in maintaining fidelity while processing sensory inputs with increasing complexity.

">ACTION ENHANCEMENT DRIVES THE EMBODIMENT OF A SUPERNUMERARY ROBOTIC DIGIT</a></h4>

              
                Wearable robotic supernumerary limbs enhance motor capabilities by leveraging principles from both engineering and neuroscience. Despite extensive research, how supernumerary limbs become embodied and the relationship between embodiment and artificially enhanced action possibilities remain largely unexplored. This gap has implications for device design and clinical adoption, as embodiment likely promotes patients' acceptance and daily use of their supernumerary limb. Using an adapted proprioceptive drift paradigm from rubber hand illusion research, we investigated the embodiment of a robotic Soft Sixth Finger (SSF). Participants performed grasp-to-lift actions versus mere lift actions without object interaction, wearing the SSF on two different configurations: the palm and back of the hand. The Palm condition involved achievable actions without the SSF, while the Dorsal condition enabled otherwise anatomically impossible actions, extending beyond the physiological motor repertoire. Hand proprioceptive drift was measured before and after each task. Results showed that the SSF impacted body representation only when dorsally mounted. Proprioceptive drift was significantly higher for grasp-to-lift actions in Dorsal versus Palm conditions and higher for grasp-to-lift versus mere lift in the Dorsal condition only. This proves that SSF embodiment relates to extending, rather than substituting, users' action possibilities. Future research must integrate behavioral, cognitive, and neural measurements across healthy and patient populations. Our study provides an ideal model for clinical application, demonstrating how enabling otherwise impossible actions drives robotic supernumerary finger embodiment.

">Unfolding spatiotemporal representations of 3D visual perception in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Although visual input is initially recorded in two dimensions on our retinas, we perceive and interact with the world in three dimensions. Achieving 3D perception requires the brain to integrate 2D spatial representations with multiple depth cues, such as binocular disparity. However, most studies typically examine 2D and depth information in isolation, leaving the integrated nature of 3D spatial encoding largely underexplored. In this study, we collected a large-scale, multimodal neuroimaging dataset consisting of multiple EEG and fMRI sessions while participants viewed stereoscopic 3D stimuli through red-green anaglyph glasses. Participants first completed a behavioral session including depth judgement tasks and a novel cube adjustment task to quantify and calibrate individual depth perception in units of binocular disparity. Then during two EEG and two fMRI sessions, participants passively viewed stimuli presented at 64 systematically sampled 3D locations, yielding over 66,000 trials in total across ten participants. Combining this large-scale EEG-fMRI dataset with computational methods via representational similarity analysis, we not only systematically characterized the spatiotemporal representation of multiple spatial features in 3D perception but also explored how different coordinate systems (e.g., Cartesian or Polar) might be employed across brain regions and time. Our results reveal that human brains employ multiple types of spatial feature representations and coordinate systems to encode spatial locations at different temporal stages and across distinct cortical regions. In addition to strong representations of 2D space throughout visual cortex, we find unique representations for depth and 3D features in later timepoints and visual areas, including some evidence for 3D processing in parahippocampus. These findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the spatiotemporal organization of neural representations that support 3D perception. Additionally, our novel large dataset will be made openly available to support future research on 3D perception and spatial cognition.

">Oxytocin neurons in the anterior and posterior paraventricular nucleus have distinct behavioral functions and electrophysiological profiles</a></h4>

              
                Oxytocin is a neuropeptide that can either promote or inhibit affiliative social behaviors. Recent evidence suggests that these diverse effects are mediated by distinct oxytocin receptor-expressing neuron. An outstanding question is whether these behavioral effects are also driven by distinct or overlapping populations of oxytocin-producing neurons. The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus is a major source of oxytocin and sends projections to the mesolimbic dopamine system and the extended amygdala. Previous work found that social defeat increased oxytocin neuron activity in the anterior PVN (aPVN) but not posterior PVN (pPVN). We reduced oxytocin synthesis with antisense morpholino oligonucleotides in either anterior or posterior PVN in California mice (Peromyscus californicus), a strong model system for studying effects of social stress on brain function and behavior. Antisense morpholinos in aPVN had no effect on behavior in unstressed females but increased social approach and reduced social vigilance in females exposed to social defeat stress. In pPVN, antisense morpholinos reduced social approach in unstressed male and female California mice. We then used OxtCre mice to compare electrophysiological profiles of oxytocin in aPVN and pPVN with a population of oxytocin neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). Oxytocin neurons in aPVN and BNST oxytocin neurons had higher post-synaptic potentials and responded more strongly to current injections versus oxytocin neurons in pPVN. These findings shed light onto functional and physiological heterogeneity of PVN oxytocin neurons. Our results suggest that context dependent effects of oxytocin are mediated by different populations of oxytocin neurons.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Subjective well-being has been implicated in the regulation of aggressive behavior, potentially through its influence on mood and neural processing. However, the underlying neuropsychological mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. This study aimed to elucidate the neural correlates of subjective well-being and examine its potential association with aggression using a two-part investigation. The first involved a functional MRI study (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 111), focusing on amygdala responses to emotional face processing and broader cortical activation related to subjective well-being. The second involved a larger behavioral sample (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 627) to assess the relationship between subjective well-being and aggression, as well as the mediating role of emotional variables. Behaviorally, subjective well-being was inversely associated with anger, hostility, and overall aggression, and with negative affect, anxiety, and depression. Mediation analyses demonstrated significant effects of mood (negative affect, depression, and anxiety) in linking subjective well-being to aggression. Neuroimaging results revealed that individuals with higher subjective well-being displayed attenuated amygdala reactivity to fearful faces. Additionally, intersubject representational similarity analyses demonstrated that individuals with similar subjective well-being levels shared more convergent neural activation patterns in visual (e.g., occipital pole, lateral occipital cortex, middle temporal gyrus, and fusiform) and the emotional network (e.g., insula), but not within the amygdala. These findings provide novel insights into the neuropsychological mechanisms linking well-being to emotional regulation and aggression.</span>

A coordinate-based meta-analysis of gray matter alterations was performed utilizing the anisotropic effect size–based signed differential mapping. Subgroup analyses were also conducted to further validate these findings and identify specificities. Twenty-two studies including 913 idiopathic generalized epilepsy patients and 887 healthy controls were enrolled. Patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy exhibited increased gray matter in the right cuneus cortex, precuneus, superior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, and fusiform gyrus, while exhibiting decreased gray matter in the bilateral thalami, left caudate nucleus, and right insula. Subgroup analyses revealed overlapping gray matter alterations in the bilateral thalami, with specific involvement of frontal lobe and insula in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, right superior temporal gyrus in generalized tonic–clonic seizures alone, and bilateral paracentral lobules in absence epilepsy. This meta-analysis identified that both cortical and subcortical structural abnormalities especially thalamo-cortical circuit was involved in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy, while overlapped and disassociated gray matter alterations were identified across different idiopathic generalized epilepsy subsyndromes.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>To manage life’s stressors, we can self-regulate our emotions or seek social regulatory support.

Here, we compared the neural mechanisms underlying self- and social-reappraisal of negative autobiographical memories using standard univariate contrasts, Bayes factor, and multivariate classifier approaches. Both self- and social-reappraisal recruited regions associated with control and mentalizing, such as dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. However, social-reappraisal was qualitatively different from self-reappraisal in its recruitment of additional control and mentalizing regions, such as the right lateral prefrontal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and right temporal pole. Notably, multivariate patterns within regions associated with mentalizing—but not control—were distinguishable between self- and social-reappraisal, suggesting that different kinds of information are drawn upon when reappraising for self vs. others. Finally, both self- and social-reappraisal modulated activity in regions associated with affective responding and the perceptual representation of remembered scenes, including the mid-orbital frontal cortex, left insula, and posterior parahippocampal gyrus.

">Defining and measuring proximity to criticality</a></h4>

              
                Over the half century since the renormalization group (RG) brought about deep understanding of critical phenomena in condensed matter physics, it has been claimed that diverse social, engineered, astrophysical, and biological systems operate close to criticality. However, these systems do not afford the neat phase diagrams and exquisite control available in condensed matter physics. How can one assess proximity to criticality when control parameters are unknown, difficult to manipulate experimentally, and fluctuating in response to changing environmental or internal conditions? Here we meet this challenge with a rigorous theoretical framework and data-analytic strategy for measuring proximity to criticality from observed system dynamics. We developed a temporal RG, well-suited to commonly measured time series, and an information theoretic quantification of proximity to criticality that is independent of model parameterization. After benchmarking our approach on diverse ground-truth cases, we apply it to recordings of spiking activity in the mammalian brain, addressing a long-standing controversy. We show that brain dynamics shift closer to criticality during wakefulness and shift away during deep sleep.

">Large-scale wearable data reveal spatiotemporal organization of annual sleep patterns</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is fundamental to health, yet large-scale, objective data on how geography shapes sleep behavior remain scarce. We analyzed over 45 million nights of sensor data from 105,741 German adults wearing consumer-grade wearables across 2.7 years. Sleep timing displayed a continuous east-west gradient, with later onset, midsleep, and offset in western regions, consistent with solar progression. This effect was strongest on weekends and in rural areas, where midsleep was delayed by 2.2 minutes per degree longitude and sleep duration increased by 1.0 minute. A north-south gradient also emerged. Weekday midsleep advanced by 0.9 minutes per degree latitude, while weekend midsleep was delayed by 0.2 minutes, resulting in greater social jetlag in the north. Sleep duration declined toward higher latitudes across both day types. Seasonal analyses revealed consistent annual rhythms. Sleep duration increased by 24.7 minutes in winter relative to summer, and sleep offset closely followed sunrise. These patterns highlight the joint influence of solar and social time on sleep, with implications for regionally tailored public health strategies.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Early-life stress and depression among youths are linked to hippocampal gray- and white-matter alterations. Less is known about hippocampal alterations in adolescent anxiety disorders (Anx) or the role that stress or comorbid depressive disorders (Anx + Dep) might play. Here, structural- and diffusion-MRI along with early-life stress-exposure reports were acquired from 197 adolescents (13.58–17.00 years) with Anx, Anx + Dep, and those without (Controls). A normative model externally validated on a large, healthy sample revealed that Anx were more likely than Controls and Anx + Dep to exhibit undersized hippocampal gray-matter volumes for their ages. Volume reductions among Anx were further localized to subfield CA1. No significant gray-matter differences were observed between Anx + Dep and Controls. Standardized probabilistic tractography in hippocampal white-matter pathways demonstrated that, relative to Controls, Anx and Anx + Dep exhibited lower fractional anisotropy specifically in the cingulum-temporal branch. All effects were specific to hippocampal structures. Group differences were not accounted for by early-life stress exposures, despite Anx and Anx + Dep reporting more than Controls. Findings indicated that gray-matter expansion, principally within CA1, may be disrupted among adolescents with anxiety disorders, but not those with comorbid depression. The progressive strengthening of hippocampal-cortical circuits occurring during adolescence may also be disrupted in adolescents with anxiety disorders, regardless of depression.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine whether established heart rate parameters of exercise, related to cardiac autonomic function, are associated with incident Parkinson's disease, independent of both clinical and autonomic prodromal features.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A study of UK Biobank participants who performed a standardized bicycle exercise test (2009–2013), followed until November 2022, and analyzed in January 2024, was carried out. Heart rate increase from rest to exercise, and heart rate decrease from peak exercise to recovery were associated with incident Parkinson's disease. Multivariable adjustment was performed both for clinical characteristics and for prodromal non-cardiac autonomic features.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 69,288 eligible participants (men 48%, mean age 56.8 years [SD 8.2 years]) were followed for 12.5 years: among the 319 (0.5%) who developed Parkinson's disease, recognized prodromal markers (constipation, bladder dysfunction) were more common at baseline. The median lag time to diagnosis was 9.3 years (interquartile range 4.4). Both heart rate increase (37.5 [SD 11.5] vs 40.8 [SD 12.4] b.p.m., <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and recovery (23.4 [SD 8.8] vs. 27.8 [SD 10.3] b.p.m., <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) were significantly lower in incident cases compared with controls. Heart rate recovery was independently associated with incident Parkinson's disease, whereas heart rate increase was not. Specifically, a blunted heart rate lowering during recovery was associated with a 30% higher risk of incident Parkinson's disease (HR 1.3; 95% CI 1.1–1.4; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001 per 10 beats less recovery).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Collectively, this suggests that cardiac autonomic involvement precedes clinically manifest Parkinson's disease, and that heart rate recovery might serve as a quantitative prodromal marker. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Ischemic stroke (IS) is a prevalent and serious neurological disorder, and is one of the major contributors to mortality and disability worldwide. The activation of autophagy and the inflammatory response following cerebral ischemia are crucial in the progression of IS. Protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 15A (PPP1R15A), as a stress-responsive protein, has been proven to be closely associated with autophagy. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism of PPP1R15A in IS remains to be fully understood. Our study screened PPP1R15A as a candidate gene by bioinformatics analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in IS and autophagy-related genes (ARGs). Functionally, experiments uncovered that down-regulation of PPP1R15A alleviated oxygen–glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-mediated inhibition of cell viability and promotion of LDH release, cell apoptosis, autophagy, and inflammation in A172 and SH-SY5Y cells. Simultaneously, silencing PPP1R15A ameliorated the IS progression in the middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) rat model. Furthermore, PPP1R15A activated the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway in vivo and in vitro. Rescue experiments indicated that TLR4 inhibitors TAK-242 and NF-κB inhibitors BAY-11-7082 effectively alleviated the malignant progression of IS mediated by overexpression of PPP1R15A. Our data illustrated that PPP1R15A promoted OGD/R-induced cytotoxicity, apoptosis, autophagy, and inflammation by activating the TLR4/NF-κB pathway.</p>

<p>In the hippocampus of AD rats, MT1 expression was slightly increased while MT2 expression was reduced. Ketogenic diet enhanced the immunoreactivity and protein expression of both MT1 and MT2 receptors, as shown by immunofluorescence staining and Western blotting.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Melatonin and its receptors play a primary role in regulating circadian rhythms, which are frequently disrupted in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that the use of a ketogenic diet (KD) delays the onset of AD. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether KD has an ameliorative effect on AD through the regulation of melatonin receptors. In this study, male Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into three groups: sham, AD, and KD. At the end of KD supplementation, behavioral parameters were determined by the Morris Water Maze. Melatonin levels, protein expression levels, and immunoreactivity of MT1–MT2 in thehippocampus and striatum were determined by ELISA, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence staining, respectively. As a result, KD improved memory decline in AD rats. Also, KD increased melatonin levels in the hippocampus but did not affect striatum melatonin levels. MT1 expression tended to increase in the hippocampus of the AD group, while MT2 expression decreased. On the contrary, KD treatment increased both MT1 and MT2 expressions. In the striatum, there was no change in MT1 expression in the AD and KD groups, but MT2 expression increased in the AD group compared with the sham group and was suppressed in the KD group. In addition, KD treatment reduced streptozotocin-induced apoptosis and neuroinflammation in the hippocampus and striatum. Our results suggest that KD may improve AD-associated inflammation and apoptosis by altering melatonin levels and the expression of MT2 receptors in the hippocampus and striatum. Therefore, KD may be a promising preventive and therapeutic option for AD.</p>

Shimba et al. show that stress-associated hormone glucocorticoids enhance the glycolysis, proliferation, and differentiation of Th17 cells.

However, the exact information content of these representations is still unclear, as is their degree of specificity. Here, we acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data while blindfolded human participants listened to 36 natural sounds, hierarchically organized into semantic categories. Multivoxel pattern analysis revealed that animate and inanimate sounds, as well as human, animal, vehicle, and object sounds could be decoded from fMRI activity patterns in early visual regions V1, V2, and V3. Further, pairwise classification of the different sound categories demonstrated that sounds produced by humans were represented in early visual cortex more distinctively than other semantic categories. Whole-brain searchlight analysis showed that sounds could be decoded also in higher level visual and multisensory brain regions. Our findings extend our understanding of early visual cortex function beyond visual feature processing and show that semantic and categorical sound information is represented in early visual cortex, potentially used to predict visual input.</span>

Male and female Long Evans rats completed 6-odor IST and DST. No differences in total exploration times or stimuli visits were observed in either test or sex. During the sample phase of the DST, a heightened response and a sustained increase in mPFC neuronal activity occurred during the first stimulus interaction. A sustained increase in mPFC neuronal activity during interaction with the novel stimulus was also observed in the test phase of the DST, but not the IST. Activation of inhibitory DREADDs expressed in mPFC CaMKII-expressing neurons impaired novelty preference in the DST, but not IST, and significantly decreased c-Fos + cells in the mPFC.

This study employed electroencephalogram (EEG) to investigate the temporal dynamics of TIS-induced modulation, with a particular focus on hemispheric lateralization, an aspect often overlooked. Using a delayed recognition task, we categorized WM into high-load and low-load conditions and applied TIS to the left and right hemispheres with sham stimulation as a control. The results revealed a robust right-lateralized effect of TIS under high-load conditions, characterized by increased N200 amplitude and decreased P300 amplitude at the right parietal site post-stimulation, whereas no significant effects emerged under low-load conditions. This pattern of results contrasts sharply with the null effects in low-load conditions, highlighting the influence of TIS on verbal WM under high-load conditions. Furthermore, our study uncovered distinct activation patterns between the 2 hemispheres, suggesting a complex interplay between hemispheric lateralization and TIS-induced neural modulation. Supporting the attention-memory model, our results indicated that the right parietal TIS facilitates cognitive resource redistribution through attentional modulation. This study fills a critical gap in understanding the impact of TIS on verbal WM and provides novel insights into its cognitive enhancement potential.</span>

                <p>Neurodevelopmental disorders disproportionately affect males compared with females. The biological mechanisms of this male susceptibility or female protection have not been identified. There is evidence that fetal/neonatal gonadal hormones, which play a pivotal role in many aspects of development, may contribute. Here, we investigate the effects of excess testosterone (T) during a critical period of sex-specific brain organization on social approach and fear learning behaviors in C57BL/6J wild-type mice. Male, but not female, mice treated with T on the day of birth (Postnatal Day 0; PN0) exhibited decreased social approach as juveniles and decreased contextual fear memory as adults, compared with vehicle (veh)-treated controls. These deficits were not driven by anxiety-like behavior or changes in locomotion or body weight. Mice treated with the same dose of T on PN18, which is outside of the critical period of brain masculinization, did not demonstrate impairments compared with the veh group. These findings indicate that excess T during a critical period of early development, but not shortly after, induces long-term deficits relevant to the male sex bias in neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

                <p>by Shugang Zhang, Yuntong Li, Wenjian Ma, Qing Cai, Jing Qin, Xiangpeng Bi, Huasen Jiang, Xiaoyu Huang, Zhiqiang Wei</p>

Understanding the functions of proteins is of great importance for deciphering the mechanisms of life activities. To date, there have been over 200 million known proteins, but only 0.2% of them have well-annotated functional terms. By measuring the contacts among residues, proteins can be described as graphs so that the graph leaning approaches can be applied to learn protein representations. However, existing graph-based methods put efforts in enriching the residue node information and did not fully exploit the edge information, which leads to suboptimal representations considering the strong association of residue contacts to protein structures and to the functions. In this article, we propose SuperEdgeGO, which introduces the supervision of edges in protein graphs to learn a better graph representation for protein function prediction. Different from common graph convolution methods that uses edge information in a plain or unsupervised way, we introduce a <i>supervised</i> attention to encode the residue contacts <i>explicitly</i> into the protein representation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SuperEdgeGO achieves state-of-the-art performance on all three categories of protein functions. Additional ablation analysis further proves the effectiveness of the devised edge supervision strategy. The implementation of edge supervision in SuperEdgeGO resulted in enhanced graph representations for protein function prediction, as demonstrated by its superior performance across all the evaluated categories. This superior performance was confirmed through ablation analysis, which validated the effectiveness of the edge supervision strategy. This strategy has a broad application prospect in the study of protein function and related fields.

                <p>by Viktoria Zemliak, Gordon Pipa, Pascal Nieters</p>

Familiarity memory enables recognition of previously encountered inputs as familiar without recalling detailed stimuli information, which supports adaptive behavior across various timescales. We present a spiking neural network model with lateral connectivity shaped by unsupervised spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) that encodes familiarity via local plasticity events. We show that familiarity can be decoded from network activity using both frequency (spike count) and temporal (spike synchrony) characteristics of spike trains. Temporal coding demonstrates enhanced performance under sparse input conditions, consistent with the principles of sparse coding observed in the brain. We also show how connectivity structure supports each decoding strategy, revealing different plasticity regimes. Our approach outperforms LSTM in temporal generalizability on the continual familiarity detection task, with input stimuli being naturally encoded in the recurrent connectivity without a separate training stage.

                <p>by Gaurav Mendiratta, Kodye Abbott, Yao-Cheng Li, Jingting Yu, Peter Carlip, Melinda Tong, Jianfeng Huang, Maxim N. Shokhirev, Thomas McFall, Geoffrey M. Wahl, Edward C. Stites</p>

RAF inhibitor “paradoxical activation” (PA) is a phenomenon where RAF kinase inhibitors increase RAF kinase signaling. Through mathematical modeling and experimental data analysis, we recently demonstrated that the combination of conformational autoinhibition (CA) with the disruption of CA by RAF inhibitors plays an important role in PA. 14-3-3 proteins are known to modulate RAF CA and RAF dimerization. We here extend our mathematical model to include both roles of 14-3-3 proteins, and we derive rigorous analytical expressions of RAF signal regulation as modulated by 14-3-3 proteins. We then use the model to investigate how 14-3-3 proteins may modulate PA. We mathematically show 14-3-3 protein stabilization of the autoinhibited form of RAF should potentiate PA, while 14-3-3 protein stabilization of the active RAF dimer should reduce PA. Our analysis suggests that the net-effect will often be a potentiation of PA, and that 14-3-3 proteins may be capable of inducing PA for RAF inhibitors that normally show little to no PA. We test model-based insights experimentally with two different approaches: forced increases in 14-3-3 expression (which we find amplifies PA) and evolved resistance assays (which suggest increased 14-3-3 expression may contribute to resistance to RAF inhibitors). Overall, this work supports a role for 14-3-3 in modulating RAF-inhibitor mediated paradoxical activation.
