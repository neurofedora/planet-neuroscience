<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2: SARS-CoV-2), which originated from Wuhan, China, has spread to the other countries in a short period of time. We report a 47-year-old male who was admitted to our hospital due to suffering from progressive vertigo and ataxia for 7 days prior to the admission. Neurological examination revealed cerebellar dysfunction, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) depicted edema of the cerebellar hemisphere associated with leptomeningeal enhancement. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed mild lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and lactate dehydrogenase. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal and CSF specimens. As a result, treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir was initiated, and patient symptoms and signs improved significantly during the course of hospitalization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of acute cerebellitis associated with COVID-19 disease which is reported in the literature so far.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD) can be associated with impaired cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) and poor clinical outcome, but whether this holds true for patients with diffuse glioma is unknown. With blood oxygenation level–dependent (BOLD)-CVR imaging, we determined the presence of CCD in patients with diffuse glioma and investigated its relationship with cerebrovascular reactivity and clinical outcome. For eighteen enrolled subjects (nineteen datasets) with diffuse glioma, CCD was deferred from BOLD-CVR using a predetermined cerebellar asymmetry index (CAI) cutoff value of 6.0%. A FET-PET study was done as a verification of the CCD diagnosis. BOLD-CVR values as well as clinical performance scores (i.e., Karnofsky performance score (KPS), disability rating scale (DRS), and modified Rankin scale (mRS)) by BOLD-CVR scan at 3-month clinical follow-up were assessed and compared for the CCD-positive and CCD-negative group. CCD was present in 26.3% of subjects and strongly associated with impaired BOLD-CVR of the affected (i.e., the hemisphere harboring the glioma) and unaffected supratentorial hemisphere (CCD(+) vs. CCD(−): 0.08 ± 0.11 vs. 0.18 ± 0.04; <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.007 and 0.08 ± 0.12 vs. 0.19 ± 0.04; <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.007, respectively). This finding was independent of tumor volume (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.48). Furthermore, poorer initial (by scan) clinical performance scores at follow-up were found for the CCD(+) group. The presence of crossed cerebellar diaschisis in patients with diffuse glioma is associated with impaired supratentorial cerebrovascular reactivity and worse clinical outcome.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is primarily characterized by migraine, stroke, mood disturbances, and cognitive decline. Ataxia has seldom been reported as a presenting symptom. Here, we review reports of CADASIL presenting as ataxia and compare these to the first pathologically confirmed case of CADASIL presenting with progressive ataxia. A 50-year-old woman presented with progressive truncal ataxia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed white matter hyperintensities in the bilateral anterior temporal lobes, external capsules, and periventricular areas, but not the cerebellum. Electron microscopy of skin biopsy material revealed multiple granular osmiophilic materials. Genetic testing confirmed a c.4552C &gt; A mutation in exon 25 of the <em class="a-plus-plus">NOTCH3</em> gene. CADASIL is a rare cause of progressive ataxia, and only four cases of CADASIL presenting with ataxia have been reported in the literature. We also discuss the possible pathophysiology of cerebellar ataxia associated with CADASIL.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Balance control is essential to maintain a stable body position and to prevent falls. The aim of this study was to determine whether balance control could be improved by using cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and visual feedback in a combined approach. A total of 90 healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to six groups defined by the delivery of tDCS (cathodal or anodal or sham) and the provision or not of visual feedback on balance during the acquisition phase. tDCS was delivered over the cerebellar hemisphere ipsilateral to the dominant leg for 20 min at 2 mA during a unipedal stance task. Body sway (i.e., ankle angle and hip position) was measured as an overall maximal unit in anteroposterior and mediolateral direction, together with participant rating of perception of stability, before (baseline), during (acquisition), and after (final) the intervention. We found a reduction in body sway during the acquisition session when visual feedback alone was provided. When the visual feedback was removed (final session), however, body sway increased above baseline. Differently, the reduction in overall maximal body sway was maintained during the final session when the delivery of cathodal tDCS and visual feedback was combined. These findings suggest that cathodal tDCS may support the short-term maintenance of the positive effects of visual feedback on balance and provide the basis for a new approach to optimize balance control, with potential translational implications for the elderly and patients with impaired posture control.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Predictive coding accounts of action perception sustain that kinematics information is compared with contextual top-down predictions (i.e., priors) to understand actions in conditions of perceptual ambiguity. It has been previously shown that the cerebellum contributes to motor simulation of observed actions. Here, we tested the hypothesis that a specific contribution of the cerebellum to action perception is to provide contextual priors that guide the sampling of perceptual kinematic information. To this aim, we compared the performance of 42 patients with childhood brain tumor affecting infratentorial (ITT) or supratentorial (STT) areas with that of peers with typical development in an action prediction task. First, participants were exposed to videos depicting a child performing different reaching-to-grasp actions, which were associated with contextual cues in a probabilistic fashion. Then, they were presented with shortened versions of the same videos and asked to infer the action outcome; since kinematics was ambiguous, we expected their responses would be biased toward the previously learned contextual priors. We found that patients with brain tumor were impaired in predicting actions when compared to healthy controls. However, STT patients presented a reliable probabilistic effect, while ITT patients, who had cerebellar damage, did not rely on contextual priors in predicting actions. Furthermore, we found an association between the use of contextual priors and the ability to infer others’ mental states as assessed by a standardized test. These results suggest that the cerebellum provides contextual priors to understand others’ actions and this predictive function might underlie complex social cognition abilities.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is caused by unstable expanded CAG repeats (expCAGs) in <em class="a-plus-plus">ATXN3</em>. Factors associated with intergenerational instability (delta-expCAG) and genetic anticipation in SCA3 have never been reported in Chinese mainland. Here, we demonstrated that unstable transmissions occurred more often in sons than in daughters (91% vs 72%, Fisher’s exact test, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.012). The extended delta-expCAG of father-son transmissions was greater than that of mother-son transmissions (3.8 ± 2.3 repeats vs 1.6 ± 1.0 repeats, Mann-Whitney <em class="a-plus-plus">U</em>, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.001).

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Difficulties in gait and balance disorders are among the most common mobility limitations in multiple sclerosis (MS), mainly due to a damage of cerebellar circuits. Moreover, the cerebellum plays a critical role in promoting new motor tasks, which is an essential function for neurorehabilitation. In this study, we investigated the effects of cerebellar intermittent theta burst stimulation (c-iTBS), a high-frequency rTMS protocol able to increase cerebellar activity, on gait and balance in a sample of 20 hospitalized participants with MS, undergoing vestibular rehabilitation (VR), an exercise-based program primarily designed to reduce vertigo and dizziness, gaze instability, and/or imbalance and falls in MS. Patients were assigned to receive either c-iTBS or sham iTBS before being treated with VR during 2 weeks. VR consisted of two types of training: gaze stability and postural stability exercises. The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline in the Tinetti Balance and Gait scale (TBG). The secondary outcome measures were changes from baseline in Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Two Minute Walking Test (2MWT), and Timed 25-ft walk test (T25FW) scales. MS patients treated with c-iTBS-VR showed a significant improvement in the TBG as compared to patients treated with sham iTBS-VR. Moreover, MS patients in the c-iTBS groups showed better performances in the vestibular-ocular reflex exercises. Combined c-iTBS and VR improves gait and balance abilities more than standard VR treatment in MS patients with a high level of disability.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Response inhibition as an executive function refers to the ability to suppress inappropriate but prepotent responses. Several brain regions have been implicated in the process underlying inhibitory control, including the cerebellum. The aim of the present study was to explore the role of the cerebellum in executive functioning, particularly in response inhibition. For this purpose, we transitorily inhibited cerebellar activity by means of cathodal tDCS and studied the effects of this inhibition on ERP components elicited during a Go/NoGo task in healthy subjects. Sixteen healthy subjects underwent a Go/NoGo task prior to and after cathodal and sham cerebellar tDCS in separate sessions. A reduction in N2-NoGo amplitude and a prolongation in N2-NoGo latency emerged after cathodal tDCS whereas no differences were detected after sham stimulation. Moreover, commission errors in NoGo trials were significantly higher after cathodal tDCS than at the basal evaluation. No differences emerged between performances in Go trials and those after sham stimulation. These data indicate that cerebellar inhibition following cathodal stimulation alters the ability to allocate attentional resources to stimuli containing conflict information and the inhibitory control. The cerebellum may regulate the attentional mechanisms of stimulus orientation and inhibitory control both directly, by making predictions of errors or behaviors related to errors, and indirectly, by controlling the functioning of the cerebral cortical areas involved in the perception of conflict signals and of the basal ganglia involved in the inhibitory control of movement.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Two recent studies have demonstrated that the dendritic Ca<sup class="a-plus-plus">2+</sup> signal associated with a climbing fibre (CF) input to the cerebellar Purkinje neuron (PN) depends on the membrane potential (<em class="a-plus-plus">V</em><sub class="a-plus-plus">m</sub>). Specifically, when the cell is hyperpolarised, this signal is mediated by T-type voltage-gated Ca<sup class="a-plus-plus">2+</sup> channels; in contrast, when the cell is firing, the CF-PN signal is mediated by P/Q-type voltage-gated Ca<sup class="a-plus-plus">2+</sup> channels.

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The objective of this study was to investigate lobule-specific cerebellar structural alterations relevant to clinical behavioral characteristics of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). We performed a case-control study of 21 Japanese individuals with PWS (age; median 21.0, range 13–50 years, 14 males, 7 females) and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy controls with typical development. Participants underwent 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging. Three-dimensional T<sub class="a-plus-plus">1</sub>-weighted images were assessed for cerebellar lobular volume and adjusted for total intracerebellar volume (TIV) using a spatially unbiased atlas template to give a relative volume ratio. A region of interest analysis included the deep cerebellar nuclei. A correlation analysis was performed between the volumetric data and the clinical behavioral scores derived from the standard questionnaires (hyperphagia, autism, obsession, and maladaptive index) for global intelligence assessment in paired subgroups. In individuals with PWS, TIV was significantly reduced compared with that of controls (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.05, family-wise error corrected; mean [standard deviation], 1014.1 [93.0] mm<sup class="a-plus-plus">3</sup>). Decreased relative lobular volume ratios were observed in posterior inferior lobules with age, sex, and TIV as covariates (Crus I, Crus II, lobules VIIb, VIIIa, VIIIb, and IX). However, increased ratios were found in the dentate nuclei bilaterally in individuals with PWS (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.01); the mean (standard deviation) × 10<sup class="a-plus-plus">−3</sup> was as follows: left, 1.58 (0.26); right, 1.67 (0.30). The altered lobular volume ratios showed negative correlations with hyperphagic and autistic characteristics and positive correlations with obsessive and intellectual characteristics. This study provides the first objective evidence of topographic patterns of volume differences in cerebellar structures consistent with clinical behavioral characteristics in individuals with PWS and strongly suggests a cerebellar contribution to altered functional brain connectivity in PWS.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Reading in children has been associated with microstructural properties of the cerebellar peduncles, the white matter pathways connecting the cerebellum to the cerebrum. In this study, we used two independent neuroimaging modalities to assess which features of the cerebellar peduncles would be associated with reading. Twenty-three 8-year-old children were evaluated on word reading efficiency and imaged using diffusion MRI (dMRI) and quantitative T1 relaxometry (qT1). We segmented the superior (SCP), middle, and inferior cerebellar peduncles and extracted two metrics: fractional anisotropy (FA) from dMRI and R1 from qT1. Tract-FA was significantly correlated with tract-R1 in left and right SCPs (left: <em class="a-plus-plus">r</em><sub class="a-plus-plus"><em class="a-plus-plus">P</em></sub>(21) = .63, right: <em class="a-plus-plus">r</em><sub class="a-plus-plus"><em class="a-plus-plus">P</em></sub>(21) = .76, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> ≤ .001) suggesting that FA of these peduncles, at least in part, indexed myelin content. Tract-FA and tract R1 were not correlated in the other cerebellar peduncles. Reading efficiency negatively correlated with tract-FA of the left (<em class="a-plus-plus">r</em><sub class="a-plus-plus"><em class="a-plus-plus">P</em></sub>(21) = − .43, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = .040) and right SCP (<em class="a-plus-plus">r</em><sub class="a-plus-plus"><em class="a-plus-plus">P</em></sub>(21) = − .37, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = .079). Reading efficiency did not correlate with tract-R1 in the SCPs. The negative association of reading efficiency with tract-FA and the lack of association of reading efficiency with tract-R1 implicate properties other than myelin content as relevant to the information flow between the cerebellum and the cerebrum for individual differences in reading skills in children.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Essential tremor (ET) has recently been reconceptualized by many as a degenerative disease of the cerebellum. Until now, though, there has been no attempt to frame it within the context of these diseases. Here, we compare the clinical and postmortem features of ET with other cerebellar degenerations, thereby placing it within the broader context of these diseases. Action tremor is the hallmark feature of ET. Although often underreported in the spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), action tremors occur, and it is noteworthy that in SCA12 and 15, they are highly prevalent, often severe, and can be the earliest disease manifestation, resulting in an initial diagnosis of ET in many cases. Intention tremor, sometimes referred to as “cerebellar tremor,” is a common feature of ET and many SCAs. Other features of cerebellar dysfunction, gait ataxia and eye motion abnormalities, are seen to a mild degree in ET and more markedly in SCAs. Several SCAs (e.g., SCA5, 6, 14, and 15), like ET, follow a milder and more protracted disease course. In ET, numerous postmortem changes have been localized to the cerebellum and are largely confined to the cerebellar cortex, preserving the cerebellar nuclei. Purkinje cell loss is modest. Similarly, in SCA3, 12, and 15, Purkinje cell loss is limited, and in SCA12 and 15, there is preservation of cerebellar nuclei and relative sparing of other central nervous system regions. Both clinically and pathologically, there are numerous similarities and intersection points between ET and other disorders of cerebellar degeneration.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels contribute to the resting membrane potential of many neurons and play an important role in controlling neuronal excitability. Although previous studies have revealed a high expression of GIRK subunits in the cerebellum, their functional role has never been clearly described. Using patch-clamp recordings in mice cerebellar slices, we examined the properties of the GIRK currents in Purkinje cells (PCs) and investigated the effects of a selective agonist of GIRK1-containing channels, ML297 (ML), on PC firing and synaptic plasticity. We demonstrated that GIRK channel activation decreases the PC excitability by inhibiting both sodium and calcium spikes and, in addition, modulates the complex spike response evoked by climbing fiber stimulation. Our results indicate that GIRK channels have also a marked effect on synaptic plasticity of the parallel fiber-PC synapse, as the application of ML297 increased the expression of LTP while preventing LTD. We, therefore, propose that the recruitment of GIRK channels represents a crucial mechanism by which neuromodulators can control synaptic strength and membrane conductance for proper refinement of the neural network involved in memory storage and higher cognitive functions.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Cerebellar involvement in major depressive disorder (MDD) has been demonstrated by a growing number of studies, but it is unknown whether cognitive functioning in depressed individuals is related to cerebellar gray matter volume (GMV) abnormalities. Impaired attention and executive dysfunction are characteristic cognitive deficits in MDD, and critically, they often persist despite remission of mood symptoms. In this study, we investigated cerebellar GMV in patients with remitted MDD (rMDD) that showed persistent cognitive impairment. We applied cerebellum-optimized voxel-based morphometry in 37 patients with rMDD and with cognitive deficits, in 12 patients with rMDD and without cognitive deficits, and in 36 healthy controls (HC). Compared with HC, rMDD patients with cognitive deficits had lower GMV in left area VIIA, crus II, and in vermal area VIIB. In patients with rMDD, regression analyses demonstrated significant associations between GMV reductions in both regions and impaired attention and executive dysfunction. Compared with HC, patients without cognitive deficits showed increased GMV in bilateral area VIIIB. This study supports cerebellar contributions to the cognitive dimension of MDD. The data also point towards cerebellar area VII as a potential target for non-invasive brain stimulation to treat cognitive deficits related to MDD.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The traditional view on the cerebellum is that it controls motor behavior. Although recent work has revealed that the cerebellum supports also nonmotor functions such as cognition and affect, only during the last 5 years it has become evident that the cerebellum also plays an important social role. This role is evident in social cognition based on interpreting goal-directed actions through the movements of individuals (social “mirroring”) which is very close to its original role in motor learning, as well as in social understanding of other individuals’ mental state, such as their intentions, beliefs, past behaviors, future aspirations, and personality traits (social “mentalizing”). Most of this mentalizing role is supported by the posterior cerebellum (e.g., Crus I and II). The most dominant hypothesis is that the cerebellum assists in learning and understanding social action sequences, and so facilitates social cognition by supporting optimal predictions about imminent or future social interaction and cooperation. This consensus paper brings together experts from different fields to discuss recent efforts in understanding the role of the cerebellum in social cognition, and the understanding of social behaviors and mental states by others, its effect on clinical impairments such as cerebellar ataxia and autism spectrum disorder, and how the cerebellum can become a potential target for noninvasive brain stimulation as a therapeutic intervention. We report on the most recent empirical findings and techniques for understanding and manipulating cerebellar circuits in humans. Cerebellar circuitry appears now as a key structure to elucidate social interactions.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Vision is one of the most robust sensory inputs used for the execution of goal-directed actions. Despite a history of extensive visuomotor research, how individuals process visual context for the execution of movements continues to be debated. This experiment examines how early, middle and late visuomotor control is impacted by illusory characteristics in a reaching and grasping task. Participants either manually estimated or reached out and picked up a three-dimensional target bar resting on a two-dimensional picture of the Sander parallelogram illusion. Participants performed their grasps within a predefined time movement window based on their own average grasp time, allowing for the manipulation of visual feedback. On some trials, vision was only available before the response cue (an auditory tone), while on others vision was occluded until the response cue, becoming available for either the full, early, middle or late portions of the movement. While results showed that the effect of the illusion was stronger on manual estimations than on grasping, maximum grip apertures in the occluded vision and early vision grasping conditions were also consistent to a lesser extent with the illusion. The late vision condition showed longer movement time, wrist deceleration period, time to maximum grip aperture and lower maximum velocity. These findings indicate that visual context affects visuomotor control distinctly depending on when vision is available, and supports the notion that human vision is comprised of two functionally and anatomically distinct systems.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Pole walking (PW) has received attention not only as a whole-body exercise that can be adapted for elderly people with poor physical fitness but also as a possible intervention for the restoration of gait function in normal walking without the use of poles (i.e., conventional walking CW). However, the characteristics of PW, especially how and why PW training affects CW, remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the characteristics of locomotor adaptation in PW from the perspective of kinematic variables. For this purpose, we compared the locomotor adaptation in PW and CW to that when walking on a split-belt treadmill in terms of spatial and temporal coordination. The result showed that adaptations to the split-belt treadmill in PW and CW were found only in interlimb parameters (step length and double support time ratios (fast/slow limb)), not in intralimb parameters (stride length and stance time ratios). In these interlimb parameters, the movement patterns acquired through split-belt locomotor adaptations (i.e., the aftereffects) were transferred between CW and PW regardless of whether the novel movement patterns were learned in CW or PW. The aftereffects of double support time and step length learned in CW were completely washed out by the subsequent execution in PW. On the other hand, the aftereffect of double support time learned in PW was not completely washed out by the subsequent execution in CW, whereas the aftereffect of step length learned in PW was completely washed out by the subsequent execution in CW. These results suggest that the neural mechanisms related to controlling interlimb parameters are shared between CW and PW, and it is possible that, in interlimb coordination, temporal coordination is preferentially stored in adaptation during PW.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) maintains stable vision during rapid head rotations by rotating the eyes in the opposite direction to the head. The latency between onset of the head rotation and onset of the eye rotation is 5–8 ms in healthy humans. However, VOR latency can be 3–4 times larger in patients treated with intra-tympanic gentamicin. A prior study showed that latency can be trained with head rotations at 0.2 Hz. We sought to determine how the VOR is affected when a delay between vestibular and visual stimuli is added during adaptation training with high-frequency head rotations (impulses), where the VOR is the main vision-stabilizing system. Using a variant of the incremental VOR adaptation technique, the delay between head rotation onset and movement onset of a visual target was gradually increased. With this training, the instantaneous VOR gain demand (= target/head velocity) varied from less than unity to greater than unity during each head impulse, albeit in a consistent and repeatable way. We measured the active and passive VOR gain and latency before and after VOR adaptation training in healthy normal subjects. There was no significant change in VOR latency across subjects; however, there was a significant decrease in VOR gain of − 6.0 ± 4.5%. These data suggest that during high-frequency head rotations delay/latency is interpreted as a changing instantaneous VOR gain demand. Although the gain demand in this study had a complex trajectory, adaptation was evident with the VOR seeming to use an average of the instantaneous gain demand.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Functional reorganization in a musician’s brain has long been considered strong evidence of experience-dependent neuroplasticity. Highly coordinated bimanual movements require abundant communication between bilateral hemispheres. Interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) is the communication between bilateral primary motor cortices, and there is beginning evidence to suggest that IHI is modified according to instrument type, possibly due to instrument-dependent motor training. However, it is unknown whether IHI adaptations are associated with non-musical bimanual tasks that resemble specific musical instruments. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the relationship between IHI and bimanual coordination in keyboard players compared with string players. Bimanual coordination was measured by a force tracking task, categorized as symmetric and asymmetric conditions. Ipsilateral silent period (iSP) was obtained using transcranial magnetic stimulation to index IHI in both left (L) and right (R) hemispheres. Canonical correlation analysis was performed to identify linear relationships between the IHI and bimanual coordination outcomes. There was no difference in bimanual coordination outcomes between keyboard and string players. Increased iSP from the L to R hemisphere was found in string players compared to keyboard players. There appeared to be different instrument-dependent relationships between IHI and bimanual coordination, regardless of symmetric or asymmetric task. Laboratory motor assessments resembling specific features of musical instruments (symmetric vs. asymmetric hand use) did not distinctly characterize bimanual motor skills between keyboard and string players. The relationships between IHI and bimanual coordination in these two instrument types were independent of task condition. Instrument-dependent neuroplasticity may be evident only within the context of musical instrument playing.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Sepsis-related encephalopathy (SAE), which causes a series of brain injuries and long-term, potentially irreversible cognitive dysfunction, is closely associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Hydrogen (H<sub class="a-plus-plus">2</sub>) is a new type of medical gas molecule that has been widely used in the treatment of various diseases in recent years. The aim of the present study was to explore the protective effects of H<sub class="a-plus-plus">2</sub> inhalation on brain injury and long-term cognitive impairment in an improved chronic septic mouse model. Male C57BL/6J mice were randomized into four groups: Control, Control + H<sub class="a-plus-plus">2</sub>, SAE and SAE + H<sub class="a-plus-plus">2</sub>. The SAE and Control models were established by intraperitoneal injection of human stool suspension or saline in mice. H<sub class="a-plus-plus">2</sub> (2%) was inhaled for 60 min at 1 h and 6 h after SAE or Control treatment. The survival rates were recorded for 14 days (days 1–14) and the Morris Water Maze was performed for 7 days (days 8–14). To assess the severity of the brain injury, hematoxylin and eosin staining, Nissl staining, Evans blue (EB) extravasation and the wet/dry weight ratio of brain tissue were detected 24 h after SAE or Control treatment. In addition, inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin 6 (IL-6), high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), as well as the protein levels of nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and Occludin, were measured 6, 12 and 24 h after SAE or Control treatment. The results showed that H<sub class="a-plus-plus">2</sub> treatment increased survival rates, mitigated cognitive impairment, reduced hippocampal histological damage, decreased EB and water content, and decreased the levels of TNF-α, IL-6, HMGB1, Nrf2, HO-1, ZO-1 and Occludin, as compared with the SAE group. These data revealed that 2% H<sub class="a-plus-plus">2</sub> could suppress brain damage and improve cognitive function in septic mice by inhibiting oxidative stress, inflammatory response and the sepsis-induced blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Neural feedback plays a key role in maintaining locomotor stability in the face of perturbations. In this study, we systematically identified properties of neural feedback that contribute to stabilizing human walking by examining how the nervous system responds to small kinematic deviations away from the desired gait pattern. We collected data from 20 participants (9 men and 11 women). We simultaneously applied (1) small continuous mechanical perturbations, forces at the ankles that affected foot placement, and (2) small continuous sensory perturbations, movement of a virtual visual scene that produced the illusion of change in walking speed, to compare how neural feedback responds to actual and illusory kinematic deviations. We computed phase-dependent impulse response functions that describe kinematic and muscular responses to small brief perturbations to identify critical phases of the gait cycle when the nervous system modulates muscle activity. In addition to the known foot-placement strategies that counteract kinematic displacement, such as the modulation of the hamstring muscle group during swing, we identified phase-specific muscle modulations that compensated for the perturbations. In particular, our results suggested that an early-stance modulation of anterior leg muscles (i.e., dorsiflexors and quadriceps) is a general control mechanism that serves to control forward body propulsion and compensates for errors in foot placement. Another detected general compensatory strategy was the late-stance modulation of the rectus femoris and gastrocnemius muscles, which controls walking speed in the next cycle.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Action and vision are known to be tightly coupled with each other. In a previous study, we found that repeatedly grasping an object without any visual feedback might result in a perceptual aftereffect when the object was visually presented in the context of a perceptual judgement task. In this study, we explored whether and how such an effect could be modulated by presenting the object behind a transparent barrier. Our conjecture was that if perceptual judgment relies, in part at least, on the same processes and representations as those involved in action, then one should expect to find a slowdown in judgment performance when the target object looks to be out of reach. And this was what we actually found. This indicates that not only acting upon an object but also being prevented from acting upon it can affect how the object is perceptually judged.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Williams syndrome (WS) is a genetically based neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability and impaired visuospatial recognition. The aim of this study was to analyze the gait characteristics of WS children with impaired visuospatial recognition using a three-dimensional gait analysis (3DGA) to clarify the gait adaptation needed to compensate for it. 3DGA was performed in 8 WS children with impaired visuospatial recognition (mean age, 11.8 years) and 9 age-, sex-, height-, and weight-matched controls. Clinical data, fundamental motor tests, and gait variables while walking on a flat surface and walking up a mat were compared between the two groups, and the correlations between variables were analyzed in the WS children. WS children showed impairment of balance function without muscle weakness. In walking on a flat surface, the WS group showed reduced walking speed, short step length, increased variability of step length, increased knee flexion throughout the stance phase, increased horizontal pelvic range of motion (ROM), and a low Gait Deviation Index and a high Gait Profile Score, which are indices of gait quality. In walking up a mat, the WS group showed further reduced walking speed and decreased sagittal hip flexion and ankle dorsiflexion ROM in the swing phase. Impaired balance function was significantly correlated with increased variability of step length and decreased sagittal ankle dorsiflexion ROM in the swing phase. The detailed gait pattern of WS children with impaired visuospatial recognition was presented. These findings show that impaired visuospatial recognition and balance function contribute to gait adaptation.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Vision of the body has been reported to improve tactile acuity even when vision is not informative about the actual tactile stimulation. However, it is currently unclear whether this effect is limited to body parts such as hand, forearm or foot that can be normally viewed, or it also generalizes to body locations, such as the shoulder, that are rarely before our own eyes. In this study, subjects consecutively performed a detection threshold task and a numerosity judgment task of tactile stimuli on the shoulder. Meanwhile, they watched either a real-time video showing their shoulder or simply a fixation cross as control condition. We show that non-informative vision improves tactile numerosity judgment which might involve tactile acuity, but not tactile sensitivity. Furthermore, the improvement in tactile accuracy modulated by vision seems to be due to an enhanced ability in discriminating the number of adjacent active electrodes. These results are consistent with the view that bimodal visuotactile neurons sharp tactile receptive fields in an early somatosensory map, probably via top-down modulation of lateral inhibition.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">This study explores the involvement of substance P (SP) in the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) and central amygdaloid nucleus (CeA) in the nociception–emotion link and of rats with masticatory myofascial pain (MMP) induced by chronic tetanic eccentric muscle contraction. A total of 18 rats were randomly and equally assigned for MMP (MMP group) and sham-MMP induction (sMMP group). MMP was induced by electrical-stimulated repetitive tetanic eccentric contraction of the masseter muscle for 14 consecutive days. Myofascial trigger points in the masseter muscle were identified by palpable taut bands, increased prevalence of endplate noise (EPN), focal hypoechoic nodules on ultrasound and restricted jaw opening. All animals were killed for morphological and SP immunohistochemical analyses. Chronic tetanic eccentric contraction induced significantly thicker masseter muscle confirmed by hypoechogenicity, increased prevalence and amplitudes of EPN, and limited jaw opening. Immunohistochemically, the SP-like positive neurons increased significantly in PBN and CeA of the MMP group. Our results suggested that MMP increases the SP protein levels in PBN and CeA, which play important roles in MMP-mediated chronic pain processing as well as MMP-related emotional processes.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">During social interactions, perception of emotions affects motor behaviour by triggering responses like freezing or approach and avoidance reactions. It is however difficult to get a clear picture of the relationship between emotion and posture as previous studies showed inconsistent results, due to methodological differences on stimuli and/or the postural measures used. In this study, we thoroughly investigate how the perception of emotions affects postural control and action tendencies, by contrasting two types of stimuli (emotional static faces or emotional videos) expressing different types of basic emotions (happy, fear, angry, sad, disgust and neutral). We also take into account some other contributing factors relying on stable individual traits (e.g., extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness, empathy, etc) and emotional state (e.g., anxiety). Our results show that dynamic stimuli have a greater impact than static stimuli on postural control. Moreover, a crucial aspect of our work lay in the modulation of the relationship between emotions and posture, by stable individual traits.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Motor imagery is suggested to be functionally equivalent to physical execution as they each utilise a common neural representation. The present study examined whether motor imagery correspondingly reflects the spatial characteristics of physically executed movements, including the signal-dependent noise that typically manifests in more variable end locations (as indicated by effective target width; W<sub class="a-plus-plus">e</sub>). Participants executed or imagined a single, upper-limb target-directed aim in the horizontal medio-lateral direction. The start and end of the imagined movements were indexed by the lifting and lowering of the limb over the home position, respectively. Following each imagined movement, participants had to additionally estimate their imagined end location relative to the target. All the movements had to be completed at a pre-specified criterion time (400 ms, 600 ms, 800 ms). The results indicated that the W<sub class="a-plus-plus">e</sub> increased following a decrease in movement time for execution, but not imagery. Moreover, the total error of imagined movements was greater than the actual error of executed movements. While motor imagery may comprise a neural representation that also contributes to the execution of movements, it is unable to closely reflect the random sources of variability. This limitation of motor imagery may be attributed to the comparatively limited efferent motor signals.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Early-life stress is correlated with the development of anxiety-related behavior in adolescence, but underlying mechanisms remain poorly known. The α<sub class="a-plus-plus">1A</sub>-adrenergic receptor (AR) is linked to mood regulation and its function is assumed to be regulated by β-arrestins (βArrs) via desensitization and downregulation. Here, we investigated correlation between changes in α<sub class="a-plus-plus">1A</sub>-AR and βArr2 levels in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus of adolescent and adult male rats subjected to maternal separation (MS) and their relationship with anxiety-like behavior in adolescence. MS was performed 3 h per day from postnatal days 2–11 and anxiety-like behavior was evaluated in the elevated plus-maze and open field tests. The protein levels were examined using western blot assay. MS decreased α<sub class="a-plus-plus">1A</sub>-AR expression and increased βArr2 expression in both brain regions of adolescent rats, while induced reverse changes in adulthood. MS adolescent rats demonstrated higher anxiety-type behavior and lower activity in behavioral tests than controls. Decreased α<sub class="a-plus-plus">1A</sub>-AR levels in MS adolescence strongly correlated with reduced time spent in the open field central area, consistent with increased anxiety-like behavior. An anxiety-like phenotype was mimicked by acute and chronic treatment of developing rats with prazosin, an α<sub class="a-plus-plus">1A</sub>-AR antagonist, suggesting α<sub class="a-plus-plus">1A</sub>-AR downregulation may facilitate anxiety behavior in MS adolescent rats. Together, our results indicate a negative correlation between α<sub class="a-plus-plus">1A</sub>-AR neurotransmission and βArr2 levels in both adults and anxious-adolescent rats and suggest that increased βArr2 levels may contribute to posttranslational regulation of α<sub class="a-plus-plus">1A</sub>-AR and modulation of anxiety-like behavior in adolescent rats. This may provide a path to develop more effective anxiolytic treatments.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Childhood obesity is associated with negative physiological and cognitive health outcomes. The hippocampus is a diverse subcortical structure involved in learned feeding behaviors and energy regulation, and research has shown that the hippocampus is vulnerable to the effects of excess adiposity. Previous studies have demonstrated reduced hippocampal volume in overweight and obese children; however, it is unclear if certain subregions are selectively affected. The purpose of this study was to determine how excess body weight influences regional hippocampal surface morphology and memory performance in a large cross‐sectional cohort of 588 children and adolescents between 8.33 and 19.92 years of age using body mass index expressed as a percentage of the 95th percentile cutoff (%BMIp95). We demonstrate %BMIp95 is associated with reduced radial thickness in the superior anterior region of the left hippocampus, and this relationship is predominantly driven by children younger than 14 years. We also found %BMIp95 was associated with worse performance on a spatial episodic memory task and this relationship was partially mediated by the radial thickness of the significant shape cluster. These results demonstrate the differential influence of excess body weight on regional hippocampal structure and hippocampal‐dependent behavior in children and adolescents.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Adaptive memory requires the organism to form associations that bridge between events separated in time. Many studies show interactions between hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) during formation of such associations. We analyze neural recording from monkey HPC and PFC during a memory task that requires the monkey to associate stimuli separated by about a second in time. After the first stimulus was presented, large numbers of units in both HPC and PFC fired in sequence. Many units fired only when a particular stimulus was presented at a particular time in the past. These results indicate that both HPC and PFC maintain a temporal record of events that could be used to form associations across time. This temporal record of the past is a key component of the temporal coding hypothesis, a hypothesis in psychology that memory not only encodes what happened, but when it happened.</p>

<p>Attention Schema Theory (AST) is a recent proposal to provide a scientific
explanation for the basis of subjective awareness. Essentially, AST posits that
conscious experience in the minds of humans and some other animals is the
result of evolution having provided the mind with its own internal model of
attention taking place within their own (and others') mind (the 'attention
schema'). However, the inability of humans to understand how their own
subjective awareness arises (related to the so-called 'hard problem' of
consciousness) is because the attention schema is inherently incomplete. In
this short note, we ask to what extent it is possible, in principle, for a mind
(either human or machine-based) to have an attention schema that is complete in
the sense of being able to faithfully represent streams of attention. Using a
simple model and a mathematical argument based on classical topology, we
describe some limits of the extent to which an attention schema could be
complete.

<p>A stochastic optimal control based model with velocity tracking and internal
feedback for saccadic eye movements is presented in this paper. Recent evidence
from neurophysiological studies of superior colliculus suggests the presence of
a dynamic input to the saccade generation system that encodes saccade velocity,
rather than just the saccade amplitude and direction. The new evidence makes it
imperative to test if saccade control can use a desired velocity input which is
the basis for the proposed velocity tracking model. The model is validated
using behavioral data of saccades generated by healthy human subjects. It
generates trajectories of horizontal saccades made to different amplitudes as
well as predicts vertical and oblique saccade behavior. This paper presents the
first-ever model of the saccadic system in an optimal control framework using
an alternate interpretation of velocity-based control, contrary to the dominant
end-point based models available in the literature.

<p>Autonomous spacecraft maneuver planning using an evolutionary algorithmic
approach is investigated. Simulated spacecraft were placed into four different
initial orbits. Each was allowed a string of thirty delta-v impulse maneuvers
in six cartesian directions, the positive and negative x, y and z directions.
The goal of the spacecraft maneuver string was to, starting from some non-polar
starting orbit, place the spacecraft into a polar, low eccentricity orbit. A
genetic algorithm was implemented, using a mating, fitness, mutation and
crossover scheme for impulse strings. The genetic algorithm was successfully
able to produce this result for all the starting orbits. Performance and future
work is also discussed.

<p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are promising in a bio-plausible coding for
spatio-temporal information and event-driven signal processing, which is very
suited for energy-efficient implementation in neuromorphic hardware. However,
the unique working mode of SNNs makes them more difficult to train than
traditional networks. Currently, there are two main routes to explore the
training of deep SNNs with high performance. The first is to convert a
pre-trained ANN model to its SNN version, which usually requires a long coding
window for convergence and cannot exploit the spatio-temporal features during
training for solving temporal tasks. The other is to directly train SNNs in the
spatio-temporal domain. But due to the binary spike activity of the firing
function and the problem of gradient vanishing or explosion, current methods
are restricted to shallow architectures and thereby difficult in harnessing
large-scale datasets (e.g. ImageNet). To this end, we propose a
threshold-dependent batch normalization (tdBN) method based on the emerging
spatio-temporal backpropagation, termed "STBP-tdBN", enabling direct training
of a very deep SNN and the efficient implementation of its inference on
neuromorphic hardware. With the proposed method and elaborated shortcut
connection, we significantly extend directly-trained SNNs from a shallow
structure ( &lt; 10 layer) to a very deep structure (50 layers). Furthermore, we
theoretically analyze the effectiveness of our method based on "Block Dynamical
Isometry" theory. Finally, we report superior accuracy results including 93.15
% on CIFAR-10, 67.8 % on DVS-CIFAR10, and 67.05% on ImageNet with very few
timesteps. To our best knowledge, it's the first time to explore the
directly-trained deep SNNs with high performance on ImageNet.

<p>Neural network realizes multi-parameter optimization and control by
simulating certain mechanisms of the human brain. It can be used in many fields
such as signal processing, intelligent driving, optimal combination, vehicle
abnormality detection, and chemical process optimization control. Supercritical
extraction is a new type of high-efficiency chemical separation process, which
is mainly used in the separation and purification of natural substances. There
are many influencing factors. The neural network model can quickly optimize the
process parameters and predict the experimental results under different process
conditions. It is helpful to understand the inner law of the experiment and
determine the optimal experimental conditions. This paper briefly describes the
basic concepts and research progress of neural networks and supercritical
extraction, and summarizes the application of neural network algorithms in
supercritical extraction, aiming to provide reference for the development and
innovation of industry technology.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05277">Qualities, challenges and future of genetic algorithms: a literature review. (arXiv:2011.05277v1 [cs.NE])</a></h4>

<p>This review intends to summarise the key qualities, current challenges and
future perspectives faced by the GA technique. Their implicit parallelism and
evolutionary operators allow an optimal balance between exploration and
exploitation. They thrive in identifying good solutions in large, rugged search
spaces. They have desirable convergence properties, offer high flexibility, and
impose very few assumptions on the nature of the solutions being evolved. They
allow a realistic modelling of evolutionary systems and innovation dynamics.
Often criticised for their computational complexity, GAs' computational
efficiency is a first challenge to address to handle dynamic or more complex
problems, likely with further use of parallelism and GPU computing. The
difficult configuration of GAs parameters, determinant to their performance,
remains an open area of investigation. The specifications of the canonical GA,
notably the choice of individual representation, the design of the fitness
landscape, and initial population sampling, impose some implicit constraints on
the search space being explored, and the solutions being evolved, requiring
further innovations to achieve open-ended evolution and robustness. Most of GAs
achievements have so far been achieved from a restricted subset of our
knowledge on natural evolution and genetics. We argue that a deeper, renewed
inspiration from the state of the art of biology and genetic research, carries
the potential for fundamental discoveries in GA design. The evolution of
evolvability, the ability to produce the most improving kind of variation for
selection, interactions between mutations, pleiotropy, the modularity of
biological networks, are only few examples of such many promising future
directions. By expanding self-adaptation, a novel class of GAs oriented towards
artificial life and open ended evolution can emerge.

<p>Victor Vasarely (1906-1997)and his important legacy to the study of human
perception are brought to the forefront and discussed. A large part of his
impressive work conveys the appearance of striking three-dimensional shapes and
structures in a large-scale pictorial plane. Current perception science
explains such effects by invoking brain mechanisms for the processing of
monocular (2D) depth cues. Here in this study, we illustrate and explain local
effects of 2D color and contrast cues on the perceptual organization in terms
of figure-ground assignments, i.e. which local surfaces are likely to be seen
as nearer or bigger in the image plane. Paired configurations are embedded in a
larger, structurally ambivalent pictorial context inspired by some of Vasarelys
creations. The figure-ground effects the configurations produce reveal a
significant correlation between perceptual solutions for nearer and bigger when
other monocular depth cues are not provided. In consistency with previous
findings on similar, albeit simpler visual displays, a specific color may
compete with luminance contrast to resolve the planar ambiguity of a complex
pattern context at a critical point in the hierarchical resolution of
figure-ground uncertainty. The potential role of color temperature in this
process is brought forward here. Vasarely intuitively understood and
successfully exploited the subtle context effects accounted for in this paper,
well before empirical investigation had set out to study and explain them in
terms of information processing by the visual brain.

<p>Large openly available neuroimaging datasets, although highly valuable, do
not typically provide the community with subject-level whole-brain connectivity
matrices that are ready to be used brain connectivity analysis. In the pursuit
of open science, we have made available fully processed and parcellated
connectomes and timeseries for the Human Connectome Project - Young Adult
(HCP-YA) dataset to the neuroimaging and computational neuroscience community.
We have processed and parcellated the 8 fMRI conditions for the 1200 from
subjects part of the HCP-YA dataset into to the Schaefer parcellations, which
are further subdivisions of the resting state functional networks. We also
provide a detailed fingerprinting analysis of these parcellated connectomes and
timeseries data using the differential identifiability framework on three
different cohorts: Unrelated subjects, monozygotic twins, and dizygotic twins.
Overall, results indicate that combining fine-grained parcellations with the
differential identifiability framework uncovers fingerprints for all cohorts
and fMRI conditions evaluated.

<p>We introduce a soft computing approach for automatically selecting and
combining indices from remote sensing multispectral images that can be used for
classification tasks. The proposed approach is based on a Genetic-Programming
(GP) framework, a technique successfully used in a wide variety of optimization
problems. Through GP, it is possible to learn indices that maximize the
separability of samples from two different classes. Once the indices
specialized for all the pairs of classes are obtained, they are used in
pixelwise classification tasks. We used the GP-based solution to evaluate
complex classification problems, such as those that are related to the
discrimination of vegetation types within and between tropical biomes. Using
time series defined in terms of the learned spectral indices, we show that the
GP framework leads to superior results than other indices that are used to
discriminate and classify tropical biomes.

<p>Many real-world optimization problems have multiple interacting components.
Each of these can be NP-hard and they can be in conflict with each other, i.e.,
the optimal solution for one component does not necessarily represent an
optimal solution for the other components. This can be a challenge for
single-objective formulations, where the respective influence that each
component has on the overall solution quality can vary from instance to
instance. In this paper, we study a bi-objective formulation of the traveling
thief problem, which has as components the traveling salesperson problem and
the knapsack problem. We present a weighted-sum method that makes use of
randomized versions of existing heuristics, and that would have won two recent
optimization competitions.

<p>Evolutionary algorithms have long been used for optimization problems where
the appropriate size of solutions is unclear a priori. The applicability of
this methodology is here investigated on the problem of designing a
nano-particle (NP) based drug delivery system targeting cancer tumours.
Utilizing a treatment comprising of multiple types of NPs is expected to be
more effective due to the higher complexity of the treatment. This paper begins
by utilizing the well-known NK model to explore the effects of fitness
landscape ruggedness upon the evolution of genome length and, hence, solution
complexity. The size of a novel sequence and the absence or presence of
sequence deletion are also considered. Results show that whilst landscape
ruggedness can alter the dynamics of the process, it does not hinder the
evolution of genome length. These findings are then explored within the
aforementioned real-world problem. In the first known instance, treatments with
multiple types of NPs are used simultaneously, via an agent-based open source
physics-based cell simulator. The results suggest that utilizing multiple types
of NPs is more efficient when the solution space is explored with the
evolutionary techniques under a predefined computational budget.

<p>The ability to record activities from hundreds of neurons simultaneously in
the brain has placed an increasing demand for developing appropriate
statistical techniques to analyze such data. Recently, deep generative models
have been proposed to fit neural population responses. While these methods are
flexible and expressive, the downside is that they can be difficult to
interpret and identify. To address this problem, we propose a method that
integrates key ingredients from latent models and traditional neural encoding
models. Our method, pi-VAE, is inspired by recent progress on identifiable
variational auto-encoder, which we adapt to make appropriate for neuroscience
applications. Specifically, we propose to construct latent variable models of
neural activity while simultaneously modeling the relation between the latent
and task variables (non-neural variables, e.g. sensory, motor, and other
externally observable states). The incorporation of task variables results in
models that are not only more constrained, but also show qualitative
improvements in interpretability and identifiability. We validate pi-VAE using
synthetic data, and apply it to analyze neurophysiological datasets from rat
hippocampus and macaque motor cortex. We demonstrate that pi-VAE not only fits
the data better, but also provides unexpected novel insights into the structure
of the neural codes.

<p>Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has proven to be remarkably effective in
optimizing deep neural networks that employ ever-larger numbers of parameters.
Yet, improving the efficiency of large-scale optimization remains a vital and
highly active area of research. Recent work has shown that deep neural networks
can be optimized in randomly-projected subspaces of much smaller dimensionality
than their native parameter space. While such training is promising for more
efficient and scalable optimization schemes, its practical application is
limited by inferior optimization performance. Here, we improve on recent random
subspace approaches as follows: Firstly, we show that keeping the random
projection fixed throughout training is detrimental to optimization. We propose
re-drawing the random subspace at each step, which yields significantly better
performance. We realize further improvements by applying independent
projections to different parts of the network, making the approximation more
efficient as network dimensionality grows. To implement these experiments, we
leverage hardware-accelerated pseudo-random number generation to construct the
random projections on-demand at every optimization step, allowing us to
distribute the computation of independent random directions across multiple
workers with shared random seeds. This yields significant reductions in memory
and is up to 10 times faster for the workloads in question.

<p>Neural network dynamics emerge from the interaction of spiking cells. One way
to formulate the problem is through a theoretical framework inspired by ideas
coming from statistical physics, the so-called mean-field theory. In this
document, we investigate different issues related to the mean-field description
of an excitatory network made up of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. The
description is written in the form a nonlinear partial differential equation
which is known to blow up in finite time when the network is strongly
connected. We prove that in a moderate coupling regime the equation is globally
well-posed in the space of measures, and that there exist stationary solutions.
In the case of weak connectivity we also demonstrate the uniqueness of the
steady state and its global exponential stability. The method to show those
mathematical results relies on a contraction argument of Doeblin's type in the
linear case, which corresponds to a population of non-interacting units.

<p>The ability to learn new tasks and generalize performance to others is one of
the most remarkable characteristics of the human brain and of recent AI
systems. The ability to perform multiple tasks simultaneously is also a
signature characteristic of large-scale parallel architectures, that is evident
in the human brain, and has been exploited effectively more traditional,
massively parallel computational architectures. Here, we show that these two
characteristics are in tension, reflecting a fundamental tradeoff between
interactive parallelism that supports learning and generalization, and
independent parallelism that supports processing efficiency through concurrent
multitasking. We formally show that, while the maximum number of tasks that can
be performed simultaneously grows linearly with network size, under realistic
scenarios (e.g. in an unpredictable environment), the expected number that can
be performed concurrently grows radically sub-linearly with network size.
Hence, even modest reliance on shared representation strictly constrains the
number of tasks that can be performed simultaneously, implying profound
consequences for the development of artificial intelligence that optimally
manages the tradeoff between learning and processing, and for understanding the
human brains remarkably puzzling mix of sequential and parallel capabilities.

<p>Detecting changes in the environment is fundamental for our survival. According to predictive coding theory, detecting these irregularities relies both on incoming sensory information and our top–down prior expectations (or internal generative models) about the world. Prediction errors (PEs), detectable in event-related potentials (ERPs), occur when there is a mismatch between the sensory input and our internal model (i.e., a surprise event). Many changes occurring in our environment are irrelevant for survival and may remain unseen. Such changes, even if subtle, can nevertheless be detected by the brain without emerging into consciousness. What remains unclear is how these changes are processed in the brain at the network level. Here, we used a visual oddball paradigm in which participants engaged in a central letter task during electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings while presented with task-irrelevant high- or low-coherence background, random-dot motion. Critically, once in a while, the direction of the dots changed. After the EEG session, we confirmed that changes in motion direction at high- and low-coherence were visible and invisible, respectively, using psychophysical measurements. ERP analyses revealed that changes in motion direction elicited PE regardless of the visibility, but with distinct spatiotemporal patterns. To understand these responses, we applied dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to the EEG data. Bayesian Model Averaging showed visible PE relied on a release from adaptation (repetition suppression) within bilateral MT+, whereas invisible PE relied on adaptation at bilateral V1 (and left MT+). Furthermore, while feedforward upregulation was present for invisible PE, the visible change PE also included downregulation of feedback between right MT+ to V1. Our findings reveal a complex interplay of modulation in the generative network models underlying visible and invisible motion changes.</p>

<p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a highly variable and complex set of neurological disorders that alter neurodevelopment and cognitive function, which usually presents with social and learning impairments accompanied with other comorbid symptoms like hypersensitivity or hyposensitivity, or repetitive behaviors. Autism can be caused by genetic and/or environmental factors and unraveling the etiology of ASD has proven challenging, especially given that different genetic mutations can cause both similar and different phenotypes that all fall within the autism spectrum. Furthermore, the list of ASD risk genes is ever increasing making it difficult to synthesize a common theme. The use of rodent models to enhance ASD research is invaluable and is beginning to unravel the underlying molecular mechanisms of this disease. Recently, zebrafish have been recognized as a useful model of neurodevelopmental disorders with regards to genetics, pharmacology and behavior and one of the main foundations supporting autism research (SFARI) recently identified 12 ASD risk genes with validated zebrafish mutant models. Here, we describe what is known about those 12 ASD risk genes in human, mice and zebrafish to better facilitate this research. We also describe several non-genetic models including pharmacological and gnotobiotic models that are used in zebrafish to study ASD.</p>

<p>Background: It has been consistently reported that the deficiency of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) sensitive purinergic receptor P2X7 (P2X7R) ameliorates symptoms in animal models of brain diseases.</p><p>Objective: This study aimed to investigate the role of P2X7R in rodent models of acute and subchronic schizophrenia based on phencyclidine (PCP) delivery in animals lacking or overexpressing P2X7R, and to identify the underlying mechanisms involved.</p><p>Methods: The psychotomimetic effects of acute i.p. PCP administration in C57Bl/6J wild-type, P2X7R knockout (P2rx7<sup>−/−</sup>) and overexpressing (P2X7-EGFP) young adult mice were quantified. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of P2rx7<sup>−/−</sup> and heterozygous P2X7-EGFP acutely treated animals was characterized through immunohistochemical staining. The prefrontal cortices of young adult P2rx7<sup>−/−</sup> and P2rx7<sup>tg/+</sup> mice were examined with tritiated dopamine release experiments and the functional properties of the mPFC pyramidal neurons in layer V from P2rx7<sup>−/−</sup> mice were assessed by patch-clamp recordings. P2rx7<sup>−/−</sup> animals were subjected to a 7 days subchronic systemic PCP treatment. The animals working memory performance and PFC cytokine levels were assessed.</p><p>Results: Our data strengthen the hypothesis that P2X7R modulates schizophrenia-like positive and cognitive symptoms in NMDA receptor antagonist models in a receptor expression level-dependent manner. P2X7R expression leads to higher medial PFC susceptibility to PCP-induced circuit hyperactivity. The mPFC of P2X7R knockout animals displayed distinct alterations in the neuronal activation pattern, microglial organization, specifically around hyperactive neurons, and were associated with lower intrinsic excitability of mPFC neurons.</p><p>Conclusions: P2X7R expression exacerbated PCP-related effects in C57Bl/6J mice. Our findings suggest a pleiotropic role of P2X7R in the mPFC, consistent with the observed behavioral phenotype, regulating basal dopamine concentration, layer-specific neuronal activation, intrinsic excitability of neurons in the mPFC, and the interaction of microglia with hyperactive neurons. Direct measurements of P2X7R activity concerning microglial ramifications and dynamics could help to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved.</p>

<p>The degeneration of light-detecting rod and cone photoreceptors in the human retina leads to severe visual impairment and ultimately legal blindness in millions of people worldwide. Multiple therapeutic options at different stages of degeneration are being explored but the majority of ongoing clinical trials involve adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-based gene supplementation strategies for select forms of inherited retinal disease. Over 300 genes are associated with inherited retinal degenerations and only a small proportion of these will be suitable for gene replacement therapy. However, while the origins of disease may vary, there are considerable similarities in the physiological changes that occur in the retina. When early therapeutic intervention is not possible and patients suffer loss of photoreceptor cells but maintain remaining layers of cells in the neural retina, there is an opportunity for a universal gene therapy approach that can be applied regardless of the genetic origin of disease. Optogenetic therapy offers such a strategy by aiming to restore vision though the provision of light-sensitive molecules to surviving cell types of the retina that enable light perception through the residual neurons. Here we review the recent progress in attempts to restore visual function to the degenerate retina using optogenetic therapy. We focus on multiple pre-clinical models used in optogenetic strategies, discuss their strengths and limitations, and highlight considerations including vector and transgene designs that have advanced the field into two ongoing clinical trials.</p>

<p>Numerous studies find that creativity is not only associated with low effort and flexible processes but also associated with high effort and persistent processes especially when defensive behavior is induced by negative emotions. The important role of self-esteem is to buffer negative emotions, and individuals with low self-esteem are prone to instigating various forms of defensive behaviors. Thus, we thought that the relationships between trait creativity and executive control brain networks might be modulated by self-esteem. The resting-state electroencephalogram (RS-EEG) microstates can be divided into four classical types (MS1, MS2, MS3, and MS4), which can reflect the brain networks as well as their dynamic characteristic. Thus, the Williams Creative Tendency Scale (WCTS) and Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale (RSES) were used to investigate the modulating role of self-esteem on the relationships between trait creativity and the RS-EEG microstates. As our results showed, self-esteem consistently modulated the relationships between creativity and the duration and contribution of MS2 related to visual or imagery processing, the occurrence of MS3 related to cingulo-opercular networks, and transitions between MS2 and MS4, which were related to frontoparietal control networks. Based on these results, we thought that trait creativity was related to the executive control of bottom-up processing for individuals with low self-esteem, while the bottom-up information from vision or visual imagery might be related to trait creativity for individuals with high self-esteem.</p>

<p>Our understanding of the neurofunctional mechanisms of speech production and their pathologies is still incomplete. In this paper, a comprehensive model of speech production based on the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) is presented. This model is able to activate sensorimotor plans based on cognitive-functional processes (i.e., generation of the intention of an utterance, selection of words and syntactic frames, generation of the phonological form and motor plan; feedforward mechanism). Since the generation of different states of the utterance are tied to different levels in the speech production hierarchy, it is shown that different forms of speech errors as well as speech disorders can arise at different levels in the production hierarchy or are linked to different levels and different modules in the speech production model. In addition, the influence of the inner feedback mechanisms on normal as well as on disordered speech is examined in terms of the model. The model uses a small number of core concepts provided by the NEF, and we show that these are sufficient to create this neurobiologically detailed model of the complex process of speech production in a manner that is, we believe, clear, efficient, and understandable.</p>

<p>Olfaction plays an important role in the evaluation, motivation, and palatability of food. The chemical identity of odorants is coded by a spatial combination of activated glomeruli in the olfactory bulb, which is referred to as the odor map. However, the functional roles of the olfactory cortex, a collective region that receives axonal projections from the olfactory bulb, and higher olfactory centers in odor-guided eating behaviors are yet to be elucidated. The olfactory tubercle (OT) is a component of the ventral striatum and forms a node within the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway. Recent studies have revealed the anatomical domain structures of the OT and their functions in distinct odor-guided motivated behaviors. Another component of the ventral striatum, the nucleus accumbens, is well known for its involvement in motivation and hedonic responses for foods, which raises the possibility of functional similarities between the OT and nucleus accumbens in eating. This review first summarizes recent findings on the domain- and neuronal subtype-specific roles of the OT in odor-guided motivated behaviors and then proposes a model for the regulation of eating behaviors by the OT.</p>

<p>SARS-CoV-2, which causes the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has a brain neurotropism through binding to the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expressed by neurones and glial cells, including astrocytes and microglia. Systemic infection which accompanies severe cases of COVID-19 also triggers substantial increase in circulating levels of chemokines and interleukins that compromise the blood-brain barrier, enter the brain parenchyma and affect its defensive systems, astrocytes and microglia. Brain areas devoid of a blood-brain barrier such as the circumventricular organs are particularly vulnerable to circulating inflammatory mediators. The performance of astrocytes and microglia, as well as of immune cells required for brain health, is considered critical in defining the neurological damage and neurological outcome of COVID-19. In this review, we discuss the neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2, the implication of neuroinflammation, adaptive and innate immunity, autoimmunity, as well as astrocytic and microglial immune and homeostatic functions in the neurological and psychiatric aspects of COVID-19. The consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection during ageing, in the presence of systemic comorbidities, and for the exposed pregnant mother and foetus are also covered.</p>

<p>Neurons have been long regarded as the basic functional cells of the brain, whereas astrocytes and microglia have been regarded only as elements of support. However, proper intercommunication among neurons–astrocytes–microglia is of fundamental importance for the functional organization of the brain. Perturbation in the regulation of brain energy metabolism not only in neurons but also in astrocytes and microglia may be one of the pathophysiological mechanisms of neurodegeneration, especially in hypoxia/ischemia. Glial activation has long been considered detrimental for survival of neurons, but recently it appears that glial responses to an insult are not equal but vary in different brain areas. In this review, we first take into consideration the modifications of the vascular unit of the glymphatic system and glial metabolism in hypoxic conditions. Using the method of triple-labeling fluorescent immunohistochemistry coupled with confocal microscopy (TIC), we recently studied the interplay among neurons, astrocytes, and microglia in chronic brain hypoperfusion. We evaluated the quantitative and morpho-functional alterations of the neuron–astrocyte–microglia triads comparing the hippocampal CA1 area, more vulnerable to ischemia, to the CA3 area, less vulnerable. In these contiguous and interconnected areas, in the same experimental hypoxic conditions, astrocytes and microglia show differential, finely regulated, region-specific reactivities. In both areas, astrocytes and microglia form triad clusters with apoptotic, degenerating neurons. In the neuron–astrocyte–microglia triads, the cell body of a damaged neuron is infiltrated and bisected by branches of astrocyte that create a microscar around it while a microglial cell phagocytoses the damaged neuron. These coordinated actions are consistent with the scavenging and protective activities of microglia. In hypoxia, the neuron–astrocyte–microglia triads are more numerous in CA3 than in CA1, further indicating their protective effects. These data, taken from contiguous and interconnected hippocampal areas, demonstrate that glial response to the same hypoxic insult is not equal but varies significantly. Understanding the differences of glial reactivity is of great interest to explain the differential susceptibility of hippocampal areas to hypoxia/ischemia. Further studies may evidence the differential reactivity of glia in different brain areas, explaining the higher or lower sensitivity of these areas to different insults and whether glia may represent a target for future therapeutic interventions.</p>

<p>Maternal exposure to the valproate short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) during pregnancy is known to possibly induce autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) in the offspring. By contrast, case studies have evidenced positive outcomes of this anticonvulsant drug in children with severe autism. Interestingly, the same paradoxical pattern applies to the IL-17a inflammatory cytokine involved in the immune system regulation. Such joint apparent contradictions can be overcome by pointing out that, among their respective signaling pathways, valproate and IL-17a share an enhancement of the “type A monoamine oxidase” (MAOA) enzyme carried by the X chromosome. In the Guided Propagation (GP) model of autism, such enzymatic rise triggers a prenatal epigenetic downregulation, which, without possible X-inactivation, and when coinciding with genetic expression variants of other brain enzymes, results in the delayed onset of autistic symptoms. The underlying imbalance of synaptic monoamines, serotonin in the first place, would reflect a mismatch between the environment to which the brain metabolism was prepared during gestation and the postnatal actual surroundings. Following a prenatal exposure to molecules that significantly elicit the MAOA gene expression, a daily treatment with the same metabolic impact would tend to recreate the fetal environment and contribute to rebalance monoamines, thus allowing proper neural circuits to gradually develop, provided behavioral re-education. Given the multifaceted other players than MAOA that are involved in the regulation of serotonin levels, potential compensatory effects are surveyed, which may underlie the autism heterogeneity. This explanatory framework opens up prospects regarding autism prevention and treatment, strikingly in line with current advances along the gut microbiome–brain axis.</p>

<p>Selective negative allosteric modulators (NAMs), targeting α5 subunit-containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) as potential therapeutic targets for disorders associated with cognitive deficits, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), continually fail clinical trials. We investigated whether this was due to the change in the expression of α5 GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs, consequently altering synaptic function during AD pathogenesis. Using medicinal chemistry and computational modeling, we developed aqueous soluble hybrids of 6,6-dimethyl-3-(2-hydroxyethyl) thio-1-(thiazol-2-yl)-6,7-dihydro-2-benzothiophene-4(5H)-one, that demonstrated selective binding and high negative allosteric modulation, specifically for the α5 GABA<sub>A</sub>R subtypes in constructed HEK293 stable cell-lines. Using a knock-in mouse model of AD (APP<sup>NL−F/NL−F</sup>), which expresses a mutant form of human amyloid-β (Aβ), we performed immunofluorescence studies combined with electrophysiological whole-cell recordings to investigate the effects of our key molecule, α5-SOP002 in the hippocampal CA1 region. In aged APP<sup>NL−F/NL−F</sup> mice, selective preservation of α5 GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs was observed in, calretinin- (CR), cholecystokinin- (CCK), somatostatin- (SST) expressing interneurons, and pyramidal cells. Previously, we reported that CR dis-inhibitory interneurons, specialized in regulating other interneurons displayed abnormally high levels of synaptic inhibition in the APP<sup>NL−F/NL−F</sup> mouse model, here we show that this excessive inhibition was “normalized” to control values with bath-applied α5-SOP002 (1 μM). However, α5-SOP002, further impaired inhibition onto CCK and pyramidal cells that were already largely compromised by exhibiting a deficit of inhibition in the AD model. In summary, using a multi-disciplinary approach, we show that exposure to α5 GABA<sub>A</sub>R NAMs may further compromise aberrant synapses in AD. We, therefore, suggest that the α5 GABA<sub>A</sub>R is not a suitable therapeutic target for the treatment of AD or other cognitive deficits due to the widespread neuronal-networks that use α5 GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs.</p>

<p>Progression of neuronal deterioration within specific brain regions is considered as one of the principal bases for the development of major depressive disorders. Therefore, protects and promotes the maintaining of normal structure and function of neurons might be a potential therapeutic strategy in the treatment of depression. Here, we report that the antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), inhibited neuronal injury through its capacity to reduce oxidative stress and exerted antidepressant effects. Specifically, we show that antioxidant enzyme activity was significantly decreased in the hippocampal CA1 region of depressive rats, while treatment with NAC (300 mg/kg, i.p.) produced neuroprotective effects against mitochondrial oxidative stress injuries and oxidative DNA damage in CA1 neurons of these rats. Moreover, NAC treatment alleviated neuronal injury resulting from neuroinflammation and apoptosis in depressed rats, effects that were associated with reductions in dendritic spine atrophy, and synapse deficits. These effects appear to involve a down-regulation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-JNK signaling along with an up-regulation of ERK signaling within the hippocampal CA1 region. Moreover, this NAC treatment significantly ameliorated depression-like behaviors as indicated by performance in the sucrose preference and forced swim tests (FST). Taken together, these results reveal the potential involvement of oxidative stress in the generation of depression. And, the antidepressant-like effects exerted by NAC may involve reductions in this oxidative stress that can result in neuronal deterioration. Such neuroprotective effects of NAC may indicate a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of stress-related depression.</p>

<p>Background: Intrinsically organized large-scale brain networks and their interactions support complex cognitive function. Investigations suggest that the default network (DN) is the earliest disrupted network and that the frontoparietal control network (FPCN) and dorsal attention network (DAN) are subsequently impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD). These large-scale networks comprise different subsystems (DN: medial temporal lobe (MTL), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DM) subsystems and a Core; FPCN: FPCNA and FPCNB). Our previous research has indicated that different DN subsystems are not equally damaged in AD. However, changes in the patterns of interactions among these large-scale network subsystems and the underlying cause of the alterations in AD remain unclear. We hypothesized that disrupted DN subsystems cause specific impairments in inter-system interactions and a higher regulatory burden for the FPCNA.</p><p>Method: To test this hypothesis, Granger causality analysis (GCA) was performed to explore effective functional connectivity (FC) pattern of these networks. The regional information flow strength (IFS) was calculated and compared across groups to explore changes in the subsystems and their inter-system interactions and the relationship between them. To investigate specific inter-system changes, we summed the inter-system IFS and performed correlation analyses of the bidirectional inter-system IFS, which was compared across groups. Additionally, correlation analyses of dynamic effective FC patterns were performed to reveal alterations in the temporal co-evolution of sets of inter-subsystem interactions. Furthermore, we used partial correlation analysis to quantify the FPCN's regulatory effects. Finally, we applied a support vector machine (SVM) linear classifier to probe which network most effectively discriminated patients from controls.</p><p>Results: Compared with controls, AD patients showed a decreased intra-DN regional IFS, which was significantly related to the inter-network's IFS. The IFS between the DN subsystems and FPCN subsystems/DAN decreased. Critically, the correlation values of the decreased bidirectional IFS between the DN subsystems and FPCNA diminished. Additionally, the Core and DM play pivotal roles in disordered temporal co-evolution. Furthermore, the FPCNA showed enhanced regulation of the Core. Finally, the MTL subsystem and Core were effective at discriminating patients from controls.</p><p>Conclusion: The predominantly disrupted DN subsystems caused impaired inter-system interactions and created a higher regulatory burden for the FPCNA.</p>

<p>Evidence suggests that extracellular vesicles (EVs) act as mediators and biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases. Two distinct forms of Alzheimer disease (AD) are known: a late-onset sporadic form (SAD) and an early-onset familial form (FAD). Recently, neurovascular dysfunction and altered systemic immunological components have been linked to AD neurodegeneration. Therefore, we characterized systemic-EVs from postmortem SAD and FAD patients and evaluated their effects on neuroglial and endothelial cells. We found increase CLN-5 spots with vesicular morphology in the abluminal portion of vessels from SAD patients. Both forms of AD were associated with larger and more numerous systemic EVs. Specifically, SAD patients showed an increase in endothelial- and leukocyte-derived EVs containing mitochondria; in contrast, FAD patients showed an increase in platelet-derived EVs. We detected a differential protein composition for SAD- and FAD-EVs associated with the coagulation cascade, inflammation, and lipid-carbohydrate metabolism. Using mono- and cocultures (endothelium-astrocytes-neurons) and human cortical organoids, we showed that AD-EVs induced cytotoxicity. Both forms of AD featured decreased neuronal branches area and astrocytic hyperreactivity, but SAD-EVs led to greater endothelial detrimental effects than FAD-EVs. In addition, FAD- and SAD-EVs affected calcium dynamics in a cortical organoid model. Our findings indicate that the phenotype of systemic AD-EVs is differentially defined by the etiopathology of the disease (SAD or FAD), which results in a differential alteration of the NVU cells implied in neurodegeneration.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63230">Optimized Vivid-derived Magnets photodimerizers for subcellular optogenetics in mammalian cells</a></h4>

Light-inducible dimerization protein modules enable precise temporal and spatial control of biological processes in non-invasive fashion. Among them, Magnets are small modules engineered from the <i>Neurospora crassa </i>photoreceptor Vivid by orthogonalizing the homodimerization interface into complementary heterodimers. Both Magnets components, which are well-tolerated as protein fusion partners, are photoreceptors requiring simultaneous photoactivation to interact, enabling high spatiotemporal confinement of dimerization with a single-excitation wavelength. However, Magnets require concatemerization for efficient responses and cell preincubation at 28<sup>o</sup>C to be functional. Here we overcome these limitations by engineering an optimized Magnets pair requiring neither concatemerization nor low temperature preincubation. We validated these 'enhanced' Magnets (eMags) by using them to rapidly and reversibly recruit proteins to subcellular organelles, to induce organelle contacts, and to reconstitute OSBP-VAP ER-Golgi tethering implicated in phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate transport and metabolism. eMags represent a very effective tool to optogenetically manipulate physiological processes over whole cells or in small subcellular volumes.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62105">Asynchrony between virus diversity and antibody selection limits influenza virus evolution</a></h4>

Seasonal influenza viruses create a persistent global disease burden by evolving to escape immunity induced by prior infections and vaccinations. New antigenic variants have a substantial selective advantage at the population level, but these variants are rarely selected within-host, even in previously immune individuals. Using a mathematical model, we show that the temporal asynchrony between within-host virus exponential growth and antibody-mediated selection could limit within-host antigenic evolution. If selection for new antigenic variants acts principally at the point of initial virus inoculation, where small virus populations encounter well-matched mucosal antibodies in previously infected individuals, there can exist protection against reinfection that does not regularly produce observable new antigenic variants within individual infected hosts. Our results provide a theoretical explanation for how virus antigenic evolution can be highly selective at the global level but nearly neutral within host. They also suggest new avenues for improving influenza control.

Intracellular transport relies on multiple kinesins, but it is poorly understood which kinesins are present on particular cargos, what their contributions are and whether they act simultaneously on the same cargo. Here, we show that Rab6-positive secretory vesicles are transported from the Golgi apparatus to the cell periphery by kinesin-1 KIF5B and kinesin-3 KIF13B, which determine the location of secretion events. KIF5B plays a dominant role, whereas KIF13B helps Rab6 vesicles to reach freshly polymerized microtubule ends, to which KIF5B binds poorly, likely because its cofactors, MAP7-family proteins, are slow in populating these ends. Sub-pixel localization demonstrated that during microtubule plus-end directed transport, both kinesins localize to the vesicle front and can be engaged on the same vesicle. When vesicles reverse direction, KIF13B relocates to the middle of the vesicle, while KIF5B shifts to the back, suggesting that KIF5B but not KIF13B undergoes a tug-of-war with a minus-end directed motor.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59770">Alpha-satellite RNA transcripts are repressed by centromere-nucleolus associations</a></h4>

Although originally thought to be silent chromosomal regions, centromeres are instead actively transcribed. However, the behavior and contributions of centromere-derived RNAs have remained unclear. Here, we used single-molecule fluorescence in-situ hybridization (smFISH) to detect alpha-satellite RNA transcripts in intact human cells. We find that alpha-satellite RNA smFISH foci levels vary across cell lines and over the cell cycle, but do not remain associated with centromeres, displaying localization consistent with other long non-coding RNAs. Alpha-satellite expression occurs through RNA Polymerase II-dependent transcription, but does not require established centromere or cell division components. Instead, our work implicates centromere-nucleolar interactions as repressing alpha-satellite expression. The fraction of nucleolar-localized centromeres inversely correlates with alpha-satellite transcripts levels across cell lines and transcript levels increase substantially when the nucleolus is disrupted. The control of alpha-satellite transcripts by centromere-nucleolar contacts provides a mechanism to modulate centromere transcription and chromatin dynamics across diverse cell states and conditions.

Signaling molecules activate distinct patterns of gene expression to coordinate embryogenesis, but how spatiotemporal expression diversity is generated is an open question. In zebrafish, a BMP signaling gradient patterns the dorsal-ventral axis. We systematically identified target genes responding to BMP and found that they have diverse spatiotemporal expression patterns. Transcriptional responses to optogenetically delivered high- and low-amplitude BMP signaling pulses indicate that spatiotemporal expression is not fully defined by different BMP signaling activation thresholds. Additionally, we observed negligible correlations between spatiotemporal expression and transcription kinetics for the majority of analyzed genes in response to BMP signaling pulses. In contrast, spatial differences between BMP target genes largely collapsed when FGF and Nodal signaling were inhibited. Our results suggest that, similar to other patterning systems, combinatorial signaling is likely to be a major driver of spatial diversity in BMP-dependent gene expression in zebrafish.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58360">A new no-report paradigm reveals that face cells encode both consciously perceived and suppressed stimuli</a></h4>

A powerful paradigm to identify neural correlates of consciousness is binocular rivalry, wherein a constant visual stimulus evokes a varying conscious percept. It has recently been suggested that activity modulations observed during rivalry may represent the act of report rather than the conscious percept itself. Here, we performed single-unit recordings from face patches in macaque inferotemporal (IT) cortex using a no-report paradigm in which the animal's conscious percept was inferred from eye movements. We found that high proportions of IT neurons represented the conscious percept even without active report. Furthermore, on single trials we could decode both the conscious percept and the suppressed stimulus. Together, these findings indicate that (1) IT cortex possesses a true neural correlate of consciousness, and (2) this correlate consists of a population code wherein single cells multiplex representation of the conscious percept and veridical physical stimulus, rather than a subset of cells perfectly reflecting consciousness.

There are many psychiatric medications targeting the activity of SLC transporters. Therefore, further research is needed to elucidate the expression profiles of the Slc* genes, which may serve as markers of altered brain metabolic processes and neurotransmitter activities in psychoneurological disorders. We studied differentially expressed Slc genes using the transcriptomic profiles in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens (NAcc), and prefrontal cortex (PFC) of male mice with psychosis-like behavior induced by repeated aggression experience in daily agonistic interactions which are accompanied by wins. Most of differentially expressed Slc genes in the VTA and NAcc (12 of 17 and 25 of 26, respectively) were downregulated, which was not the case in the PFC (6 and 5, up- and down, respectively). Also, the majority of these genes were shown to have brain region-specific expression profiles. In the VTA and NAcc altered expression was observed for the genes encoding the transporters of neurotransmitters as well as inorganic and organic ions, amino acids, metals, glucose, etc. This means alteration in transport functions for many substrates, which results in complete disruption of all cellular and neurotransmitter processes. The neurotransmitter systems, especially, the dopaminergic one, in male mice with positive fighting experience in daily agonistic interactions undergo changes leading to profound genomic modifications which include downregulated expression of the majority of the Slc* genes at least in the VTA and NAcc, which is attributable to chronic stimulation of the reward systems.

<p>by Tiina Manninen, Ausra Saudargiene, Marja-Leena Linne</p>

Astrocytes have been shown to modulate synaptic transmission and plasticity in specific cortical synapses, but our understanding of the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms remains limited. Here we present a new biophysicochemical model of a somatosensory cortical layer 4 to layer 2/3 synapse to study the role of astrocytes in spike-timing-dependent long-term depression (t-LTD) <i>in vivo</i>. By applying the synapse model and electrophysiological data recorded from rodent somatosensory cortex, we show that a signal from a postsynaptic neuron, orchestrated by endocannabinoids, astrocytic calcium signaling, and presynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors coupled with calcineurin signaling, induces t-LTD which is sensitive to the temporal difference between post- and presynaptic firing. We predict for the first time the dynamics of astrocyte-mediated molecular mechanisms underlying t-LTD and link complex biochemical networks at presynaptic, postsynaptic, and astrocytic sites to the time window of t-LTD induction. During t-LTD a single astrocyte acts as a delay factor for fast neuronal activity and integrates fast neuronal sensory processing with slow non-neuronal processing to modulate synaptic properties in the brain. Our results suggest that astrocytes play a critical role in synaptic computation during postnatal development and are of paramount importance in guiding the development of brain circuit functions, learning and memory.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hl6PJIbIOEc" width="1" />

<p>by Daniel Nüst, Vanessa Sochat, Ben Marwick, Stephen J. Eglen, Tim Head, Tony Hirst, Benjamin D. Evans</p>

Computational science has been greatly improved by the use of containers for packaging software and data dependencies. In a scholarly context, the main drivers for using these containers are transparency and support of reproducibility; in turn, a workflow’s reproducibility can be greatly affected by the choices that are made with respect to building containers. In many cases, the build process for the container’s image is created from instructions provided in a Dockerfile format. In support of this approach, we present a set of rules to help researchers write understandable Dockerfiles for typical data science workflows. By following the rules in this article, researchers can create containers suitable for sharing with fellow scientists, for including in scholarly communication such as education or scientific papers, and for effective and sustainable personal workflows.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4EN5XLEWE9Q" width="1" />

Hypertension is the most important cause of death and disability in the elderly. In 9 out of 10 cases, the molecular cause, however, is unknown. One mechanistic hypothesis involves impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation through reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. Indeed, ROS forming NADPH oxidase (<i>Nox</i>) genes associate with hypertension, yet target validation has been negative. We re-investigate this association by molecular network analysis and identify NOX5, not present in rodents, as a sole neighbor to human vasodilatory endothelial nitric oxide (NO) signaling. In hypertensive patients, endothelial microparticles indeed contained higher levels of NOX5—but not NOX1, NOX2, or NOX4—with a bimodal distribution correlating with disease severity. Mechanistically, mice expressing human <i>N</i>ox5 in endothelial cells developed—upon aging—severe systolic hypertension and impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation due to uncoupled NO synthase (NOS). We conclude that NOX5-induced uncoupling of endothelial NOS is a causal mechanism and theragnostic target of an age-related hypertension endotype. <i>N</i>ox5 knock-in (KI) mice represent the first mechanism-based animal model of hypertension.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OYrIOvWWwEA" width="1" />

<p>by Silvio Macias, Kushal Bakshi, Francisco Garcia-Rosales, Julio C. Hechavarria, Michael Smotherman</p>

Echolocating bats rely upon spectral interference patterns in echoes to reconstruct fine details of a reflecting object’s shape. However, the acoustic modulations required to do this are extremely brief, raising questions about how their auditory cortex encodes and processes such rapid and fine spectrotemporal details. Here, we tested the hypothesis that biosonar target shape representation in the primary auditory cortex (A1) is more reliably encoded by changes in spike timing (latency) than spike rates and that latency is sufficiently precise to support a synchronization-based ensemble representation of this critical auditory object feature space. To test this, we measured how the spatiotemporal activation patterns of A1 changed when naturalistic spectral notches were inserted into echo mimic stimuli. Neurons tuned to notch frequencies were predicted to exhibit longer latencies and lower mean firing rates due to lower signal amplitudes at their preferred frequencies, and both were found to occur. Comparative analyses confirmed that significantly more information was recoverable from changes in spike times relative to concurrent changes in spike rates. With this data, we reconstructed spatiotemporal activation maps of A1 and estimated the level of emerging neuronal spike synchrony between cortical neurons tuned to different frequencies. The results support existing computational models, indicating that spectral interference patterns may be efficiently encoded by a cascading tonotopic sequence of neural synchronization patterns within an ensemble of network activity that relates to the physical features of the reflecting object surface.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/3FZBnVuZ3uI" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Theta oscillations in the hippocampus have many behavioral correlates, with the magnitude and vigor of ongoing movement being the most salient. Many consider correlates of locomotion with hippocampal theta to be a confound in delineating theta contributions to cognitive processes. Theory and empirical experiments suggest theta‐movement relationships are important if spatial navigation is to support higher cognitive processes. In the current study, we tested if variations in speed modulation of hippocampal theta can predict spatial learning rates in the water maze. Using multi‐step regression, we find that the magnitude and robustness of hippocampal theta frequency versus speed scaling can predict water maze learning rates. Using a generalized linear model, we also demonstrate that speed and water maze learning are the best predictors of hippocampal theta frequency and amplitude. Our findings suggest movement‐speed correlations with hippocampal theta frequency may be actively used in spatial learning.</p>

<p>WIDE AWAKE (WAKE) was first identified in <i>Drosophila</i> as a clock‐output molecule that regulates the timing of sleep and arousal. There is a single homolog of WAKE (mWAKE/ANKFN1/NMF9) in mice, which has previously shown to be enriched in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the master circadian pacemaker. This present work surveys the brain expression pattern of mWAKE using multiple approaches. First, <i>mWake</i> mRNA expression is examined using RNAscope in situ hybridization. Second, mWAKE protein expression is investigated using two different transgenic animal models: an <i>mWake</i>
<sup>
   <i>V5</i>
</sup> mouse where a V5 tag is fused directly to the end of the protein and an <i>mWake</i>
<sup>
   <i>tdTomato‐2A‐Cre</i>
</sup> mouse where tdTomato is inserted in‐frame within the gene. Third, we analyze scRNA‐Seq data to characterize the molecular identity of <i>mWake</i> neurons in the hypothalamus. These data reveal that mWAKE labels a distributed subset of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons across the brainstem, subcortical regions, and cortex, with significant expression in the hypothalamus. This study may provide a potential roadmap for future studies of the circadian regulation of distinct circuits and behaviors.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Structure–function analyses of the mammalian brain have historically relied on anatomically‐based approaches. In these investigations, physical, chemical, or electrolytic lesions of anatomical structures are applied, and the resulting behavioral or physiological responses assayed. An alternative approach is to focus on the expression pattern of a molecule whose function has been characterized and then use genetic intersectional methods to optogenetically or chemogenetically manipulate distinct circuits. We previously identified WIDE AWAKE (WAKE) in <i>Drosophila</i>, a clock output molecule that mediates the temporal regulation of sleep onset and sleep maintenance. More recently, we have studied the mouse homolog, mWAKE/ANKFN1, and our data suggest that its basic role in the circadian regulation of arousal is conserved. Here, we perform a systematic analysis of the expression pattern of <i>mWake</i> mRNA, protein, and cells throughout the adult mouse brain. We find that mWAKE labels neurons in a restricted, but distributed manner, in multiple regions of the hypothalamus (including the suprachiasmatic nucleus, dorsomedial hypothalamus, and tuberomammillary nucleus region), the limbic system, sensory processing nuclei, and additional specific brainstem, subcortical, and cortical areas. Interestingly, mWAKE is also observed in non‐neuronal ependymal cells. In addition, to describe the molecular identities and clustering of <i>mWake</i>
<sup>+</sup> cells, we provide detailed analyses of single cell RNA sequencing data from the hypothalamus, a region with particularly significant mWAKE expression. These findings lay the groundwork for future studies into the potential role of mWAKE<sup>+</sup> cells in the rhythmic control of diverse behaviors and physiological processes.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Members of the POU4F/Brn3 transcription factor family have an established role in the development of retinal ganglion cell (RGCs) types, the main transducers of visual information from the mammalian eye to the brain. Our previous work using sparse random recombination of a conditional knock‐in reporter allele expressing alkaline phosphatase (AP) and intersectional genetics had identified three types of Brn3c positive (Brn3c<sup>+</sup>) RGCs. Here, we describe a novel Brn3c<sup>Cre</sup> mouse allele generated by serial Dre to Cre recombination and use it to explore the expression overlap of Brn3c with Brn3a and Brn3b and the dendritic arbor morphologies and visual stimulus response properties of Brn3c<sup>+</sup> RGC types. Furthermore, we explore brain nuclei that express Brn3c or receive input from Brn3c<sup>+</sup> neurons. Our analysis reveals a much larger number of Brn3c<sup>+</sup> RGCs and more diverse set of RGC types than previously reported. Most RGCs expressing Brn3c during development are still Brn3c positive in the adult, and all express Brn3a while only about half express Brn3b. Genetic Brn3c‐Brn3b intersection reveals an area of increased RGC density, extending from dorsotemporal to ventrolateral across the retina and overlapping with the mouse binocular field of view. In addition, we report a Brn3c<sup>+</sup> RGC projection to the thalamic reticular nucleus, a visual nucleus that was not previously shown to receive retinal input. Furthermore, Brn3c<sup>+</sup> neurons highlight a previously unknown subdivision of the deep mesencephalic nucleus. Thus, our newly generated allele provides novel biological insights into RGC type classification, brain connectivity, and cytoarchitectonic.</p>

Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) catalyzes the conversion of guanosine triphosphate into cyclic guanosine-3′,5′-monophosphate, a key second messenger in cell signaling and tissue homeostasis. It was recently demonstrated that sGC stimulation is associated with a marked antiinflammatory effect in the liver of mice with experimental nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

<p>Insects use UV light as navigation signals to locate the position of the sun. In this study, we construct a comprehensive map of the downstream circuitry of UV‐sensing R7 neurons by analyzing large‐scale 3D neural data at the single‐neuron resolution in <i>Drosophila</i>. We find six families of visual projection neurons that connect the optic lobe to the central brain. Our imaging study reveals the morphological diversity of these visual projection neurons of the medulla layer 6 (M<sub>6</sub>) downstream circuitry suggests the multi‐dimensional processing of UV information via hierarchical, multiple‐layer, parallel, and bilateral circuits in the brain. Furthermore, we describe a detailed neuroanatomical description of the lateral anterior optic tubercle (L‐AOTU) and the bulb (BU).

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The brain perceives visual information and controls behavior depending on its underlying neural circuits. How UV information is represented and processed in the brain remains poorly understood. In <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, UV light is detected by the R7 photoreceptor that project exclusively into the medulla layer 6 (M<sub>6</sub>). Herein, we imaged 28,768 single neurons and identified 238 visual projection neurons linking M<sub>6</sub> to the central brain. Based on morphology and connectivity, these visual projection neurons were systematically classified into 94 cell types belonging to 12 families. Three tracts connected M<sub>6</sub> in each optic lobe to the central brain: One dorsal tract linking to the ipsilateral lateral anterior optic tubercle (L‐AOTU) and two medial tracts linking to the ipsilateral ventral medial protocerebrum (VMP) and the contralateral VMP. The M<sub>6</sub> information was primarily represented in the L‐AOTU. Each L‐AOTU consisted of four columns that each contained three glomeruli. Each L‐AOTU glomerulus received inputs from M<sub>6</sub> subdomains and gave outputs to a glomerulus within the ellipsoid body dendritic region, suggesting specific processing of spatial information through the dorsal pathway. Furthermore, the middle columns of the L‐AOTUs of both hemispheres were connected via the intertubercle tract, suggesting information integration between the two eyes. In contrast, an ascending neuron linked each VMP to all glomeruli in the bulb and the L‐AOTU, bilaterally, suggesting general processing of information through the ventral pathway. Altogether, these diverse morphologies of the visual projection neurons suggested multi‐dimensional processing of UV information through parallel and bilateral circuits in the <i>Drosophila</i> brain.</p>

<p>Previous work on convexity of neural codes has produced codes that are
open-convex but not closed-convex -- or vice-versa. However, why a code is one
but not the other, and how to detect such discrepancies are open questions. We
tackle these questions in two ways. First, we investigate the concept of
degeneracy introduced by Cruz et al., and extend their results to show that
nondegeneracy precisely captures the situation when taking closures or
interiors of open or closed realizations, respectively, yields another
realization of the code. Second, we give the first general criteria for
precluding a code from being closed-convex (without ruling out open-convexity),
unifying ad-hoc geometric arguments in prior works. One criterion is built on a
phenomenon we call a rigid structure, while the other can be stated
algebraically, in terms of the neural ideal of the code. These results
complement existing criteria having the opposite purpose: precluding
open-convexity but not closed-convexity. Finally, we show that a family of
codes shown by Jeffs to be not open-convex is in fact closed-convex and
realizable in dimension two.

<p>Neuromorphic engineering is a rapidly developing field that aims to take
inspiration from the biological organization of neural systems to develop novel
technology for computing, sensing and actuating. The unique properties of such
systems call for new signal processing and control paradigms. The article
introduces the mixed feedback organization of excitable neuronal systems,
consisting of interlocked positive and negative feedback loops acting in
distinct timescales. The principles of biological neuromodulation suggest a
methodology for designing and controlling mixed-feedback systems
neuromorphically. The proposed design consists of a parallel interconnection of
elementary circuit elements that mirrors the organization of biological neurons
and utilizes the hardware components of neuromorphic electronic circuits. The
interconnection structure endows the neuromorphic systems with a simple control
methodology that reframes the neuronal control as an input-output shaping
problem. The potential of neuronal control is illustrated on simple network
examples that suggest the scalability of the mixed-feedback principles.

<p>We present a computational method for empirically characterizing the training
loss level-sets of deep neural networks. Our method numerically constructs a
path in parameter space that is constrained to a set with a fixed near-zero
training loss. By measuring regularization functions and test loss at different
points within this path, we examine how different points in the parameter space
with the same fixed training loss compare in terms of generalization ability.
We also compare this method for finding regularized points with the more
typical method, that uses objective functions which are weighted sums of
training loss and regularization terms. We apply dimensionality reduction to
the traversed paths in order to visualize the loss level sets in a
well-regularized region of parameter space. Our results provide new information
about the loss landscape of deep neural networks, as well as a new strategy for
reducing test loss.

<p>One of the strengths of traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is
their inherent translational invariance. However, for the task of speech
enhancement in the time-frequency domain, this property cannot be fully
exploited due to a lack of invariance in the frequency direction. In this paper
we propose to remedy this inefficiency by introducing a method, which we call
Frequency Gating, to compute multiplicative weights for the kernels of the CNN
in order to make them frequency dependent. Several mechanisms are explored:
temporal gating, in which weights are dependent on prior time frames, local
gating, whose weights are generated based on a single time frame and the ones
adjacent to it, and frequency-wise gating, where each kernel is assigned a
weight independent of the input data. Experiments with an autoencoder neural
network with skip connections show that both local and frequency-wise gating
outperform the baseline and are therefore viable ways to improve CNN-based
speech enhancement neural networks. In addition, a loss function based on the
extended short-time objective intelligibility score (ESTOI) is introduced,
which we show to outperform the standard mean squared error (MSE) loss
function.

<p>Electrophysiological time series were taken simultaneously in two locations
in the hippocampus of a rat brain previously described as receiving innervation
from the osmosensitive vasopressinergic neurons of the hypothalamus. A
hyperosmotic saline solution injection was administered during the time of the
experiment. We analyze the recorded time series using different methods. We
detect a modification of the delta and theta oscillations just after the
perturbation caused by the injection. We compare the quality and information
that each one of the methods exhibit and we analyze the characteristics of the
perturbation based on a hypothesis that the strength of the functional
connections between the vasopressinergic hypothalamic magnocellular neurons and
their target in the hippocampus is modified by the perturbation. We built a
model of the hypothetic neural connections and numerically calculate the time
series produced by the system when simulating the perturbation caused by the
saline injection. The theoretical results resemble the experimental findings
concerning the frequency and amplitude alterations of the delta and theta
bands.

<p>Functional connectome extends the anatomical connectome by capturing the
relations between neurons according to their activity and interactions. When
these relations are causal, the functional connectome maps how neural activity
flows within neural circuits and provides the possibility for inference of
functional neural pathways, such as sensory-motor-behavioral pathways. While
there exist various information approaches for non-causal estimations of the
functional connectome, approaches that characterize the causal functional
connectivity - the causal relationships between neuronal time series, are
scarce. In this work, we develop the Neuro-PC algorithm which is a novel
methodology for inferring the causal functional connectivity between neurons
from multi-dimensional time series, such as neuronal recordings. The core of
our methodology relies on a novel adaptation of the PC algorithm, a
state-of-the-art method for statistical causal inference, to the
multi-dimensional time-series of neural dynamics. We validate the performance
of the method on network motifs with various interactions between their neurons
simulated using continuous-time artificial network of neurons. We then consider
the application of the method to obtain the causal functional connectome for
recent multi-array electrophysiological recordings from the mouse visual cortex
in the presence of different stimuli. We show how features of the mapping can
be used for quantification of the similarities between neural responses subject
to different stimuli.

<p>The perceptual experience of architecture is enacted by the sensory and motor
system. When we act, we change the perceived environment according to a set of
expectations that depend on our body and the built environment. The continuous
process of collecting sensory information is thus based on bodily affordances.
Affordances characterize the fit between the physical structure of the body and
capacities for movement in the built environment. Since little has been done
regarding the role of architectural design in the emergence of perceptual
experience on a neuronal level, this paper offers a first step towards the role
of architectural design in perceptual experience. An approach to synthesize
concepts from computational neuroscience with architectural phenomenology into
a computational neurophenomenology is considered. The outcome is a framework
under which studies of architecture and cognitive neuroscience can be cast.

<p>This article proposes a Universal Activation Function (UAF) that achieves
near optimal performance in quantification, classification, and reinforcement
learning (RL) problems. For any given problem, the optimization algorithms are
able to evolve the UAF to a suitable activation function by tuning the UAF's
parameters. For the CIFAR-10 classification and VGG-8, the UAF converges to the
Mish like activation function, which has near optimal performance $F_{1} =
0.9017\pm0.0040$ when compared to other activation functions. For the
quantification of simulated 9-gas mixtures in 30 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
environments, the UAF converges to the identity function, which has near
optimal root mean square error of $0.4888 \pm 0.0032$ $\mu M$. In the
BipedalWalker-v2 RL dataset, the UAF achieves the 250 reward in $961 \pm 193$
epochs, which proves that the UAF converges in the lowest number of epochs.
Furthermore, the UAF converges to a new activation function in the
BipedalWalker-v2 RL dataset.

<p>This paper proposes a novel neural model for the understudied task of
generating text from keywords. The model takes as input a set of un-ordered
keywords, and part-of-speech (POS) based template instructions. This makes it
ideal for surface realization in any NLG setup. The framework is based on the
encode-attend-decode paradigm, where keywords and templates are encoded first,
and the decoder judiciously attends over the contexts derived from the encoded
keywords and templates to generate the sentences. Training exploits weak
supervision, as the model trains on a large amount of labeled data with
keywords and POS based templates prepared through completely automatic means.
Qualitative and quantitative performance analyses on publicly available
test-data in various domains reveal our system's superiority over baselines,
built using state-of-the-art neural machine translation and controllable
transfer techniques. Our approach is indifferent to the order of input
keywords.

<p>We address the problem of building theoretical models that help elucidate the
function of the visual brain at computational/algorithmic and
structural/mechanistic levels. We seek to understand how the receptive fields
and topographic maps found in visual cortical areas relate to underlying
computational desiderata. We view the development of sensory systems from the
popular perspective of probability density estimation; this is motivated by the
notion that an effective internal representational scheme is likely to reflect
the statistical structure of the environment in which an organism lives. We
apply biologically based constraints on elements of the model.
</p>
<p>The thesis begins by surveying the relevant literature from the fields of
neurobiology, theoretical neuroscience, and machine learning. After this review
we present our main theoretical and algorithmic developments: we propose a
class of probabilistic models, which we refer to as "energy-based models", and
show equivalences between this framework and various other types of
probabilistic model such as Markov random fields and factor graphs; we also
develop and discuss approximate algorithms for performing maximum likelihood
learning and inference in our energy based models. The rest of the thesis is
then concerned with exploring specific instantiations of such models. By
performing constrained optimisation of model parameters to maximise the
likelihood of appropriate, naturalistic datasets we are able to qualitatively
reproduce many of the receptive field and map properties found in vivo, whilst
simultaneously learning about statistical regularities in the data.

<p>Over the past decade there has been a growing interest in the development of
parallel hardware systems for simulating large-scale networks of spiking
neurons. Compared to other highly-parallel systems, GPU-accelerated solutions
have the advantage of a relatively low cost and a great versatility, thanks
also to the possibility of using the CUDA-C/C++ programming languages.
NeuronGPU is a GPU library for large-scale simulations of spiking neural
network models, written in the C++ and CUDA-C++ programming languages, based on
a novel spike-delivery algorithm. This library includes simple LIF
(leaky-integrate-and-fire) neuron models as well as several multisynapse AdEx
(adaptive-exponential-integrate-and-fire) neuron models with current or
conductance based synapses, user definable models and different devices. The
numerical solution of the differential equations of the dynamics of the AdEx
models is performed through a parallel implementation, written in CUDA-C++, of
the fifth-order Runge-Kutta method with adaptive step-size control. In this
work we evaluate the performance of this library on the simulation of a
cortical microcircuit model, based on LIF neurons and current-based synapses,
and on a balanced network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, using AdEx
neurons and conductance-based synapses. On these models, we will show that the
proposed library achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of simulation
time per second of biological activity. In particular, using a single NVIDIA
GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU board, the full-scale cortical-microcircuit model,
which includes about 77,000 neurons and $3 \cdot 10^8$ connections, can be
simulated at a speed very close to real time, while the simulation time of a
balanced network of 1,000,000 AdEx neurons with 1,000 connections per neuron
was about 70 s per second of biological activity.

<p>Conventional reinforcement learning (RL) typically determines an appropriate
primitive action at each timestep. However, by using a proper macro action,
defined as a sequence of primitive actions, an agent is able to bypass
intermediate states to a farther state and facilitate its learning procedure.
The problem we would like to investigate is what associated beneficial
properties that macro actions may possess. In this paper, we unveil the
properties of reusability and transferability of macro actions. The first
property, reusability, means that a macro action generated along with one RL
method can be reused by another RL method for training, while the second one,
transferability, means that a macro action can be utilized for training agents
in similar environments with different reward settings. In our experiments, we
first generate macro actions along with RL methods. We then provide a set of
analyses to reveal the properties of reusability and transferability of the
generated macro actions.

<p>Parameter control aims at realizing performance gains through a dynamic
choice of the parameters which determine the behavior of the underlying
optimization algorithm. In the context of evolutionary algorithms this research
line has for a long time been dominated by empirical approaches. With the
significant advances in running time analysis achieved in the last ten years,
the parameter control question has become accessible to theoretical
investigations. A number of running time results for a broad range of different
parameter control mechanisms have been obtained in recent years. This book
chapter surveys these works, and puts them into context, by proposing an
updated classification scheme for parameter control.

<p>Visual metacognition—the introspection and evaluation of one’s own visual perceptual processes—is measured through both decision confidence and “metacognitive efficiency.” Metacognitive efficiency refers to an individual’s ability to accurately judge incorrect and correct decisions through confidence ratings given their task performance. Previous imaging studies in humans and nonhuman primates reported widely distributed brain regions being involved in decision confidence and metacognition. However, the neural correlates of metacognition are remarkably inconsistent across studies concerning spatial outline. Therefore, this study investigates the neural correlates of visual metacognition by examining co-activation across regions that scale with visual decision confidence. We hypothesized that interacting processes of perceptual and metacognitive performance contribute to the arising decision confidence in distributed, but segregable co-activating brain regions. To test this hypothesis, we performed task-fMRI in healthy humans during a visual backward masking task with four-scale, post-decision confidence ratings. We measured blood oxygenation covariation patterns, which served as a physiological proxy for co-activation across brain regions. Decision confidence ratings and an individual’s metacognitive efficiency served as behavioral measures for metacognition. We found three distinct co-activation clusters involved in decision confidence: the first included right-centered fronto-temporal-parietal regions, the second included left temporal and parietal regions, and the left basal forebrain (BF), and the third included cerebellar regions. The right fronto-temporal-parietal cluster including the supplementary eye field and the right basal forebrain showed stronger co-activation in subjects with higher metacognitive efficiency. Our results provide novel evidence for co-activation of widely distributed fronto-parieto-temporal regions involved in visual confidence. The supplementary eye field was the only region that activated for both decision confidence and metacognitive efficiency, suggesting the supplementary eye field plays a key role in visual metacognition. Our results link findings in electrophysiology studies and human fMRI studies and provide evidence that confidence estimates arise from the integration of multiple information processing pathways.</p>

<p>Oscillations in the granule cell layer (GCL) of the cerebellar cortex have been related to behavior and could facilitate communication with the cerebral cortex. These local field potential (LFP) oscillations, strong at 4–12 Hz in the rodent cerebellar cortex during awake immobility, should also be an indicator of an underlying influence on the patterns of the cerebellar cortex neuronal firing during rest. To address this hypothesis, cerebellar cortex LFPs and simultaneous single-neuron activity were collected during LFP oscillatory periods in the GCL of awake resting rats. During these oscillatory episodes, different types of units across the GCL and Purkinje cell layers showed variable phase-relation with the oscillatory cycles. Overall, 74% of the Golgi cell firing and 54% of the Purkinje cell simple spike (SS) firing were phase-locked with the oscillations, displaying a clear phase relationship. Despite this tendency, fewer Golgi cells (50%) and Purkinje cell’s SSs (25%) showed an oscillatory firing pattern. Oscillatory phase-locked spikes for the Golgi and Purkinje cells occurred towards the peak of the LFP cycle. GCL LFP oscillations had a strong capacity to predict the timing of Golgi cell spiking activity, indicating a strong influence of this oscillatory phenomenon over the GCL. Phase-locking was not as prominent for the Purkinje cell SS firing, indicating a weaker influence over the Purkinje cell layer, yet a similar phase relation. Overall, synaptic activity underlying GCL LFP oscillations likely exert an influence on neuronal population firing patterns in the cerebellar cortex in the awake resting state and could have a preparatory neural network shaping capacity serving as a neural baseline for upcoming cerebellar operations.</p>

<p>Neural systems involved in processing natural rewards and drugs of abuse overlap and exposure to drugs of abuse induce neuroadaptations that can cause compulsive-like behavior. For example, the recruitment of the orexin (Orx) system by drugs of abuse has been proposed to induce neuroadaptations that in turn alter its function, reflected by maladaptive, compulsive, and addictive behavior. Orexin neurons project to the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT)—particularly the posterior part (pPVT), a structure that plays a key role in stress regulation. This study investigated whether Orx transmission in the pPVT plays a role in stress-induced reinstatement of reward-seeking behavior toward ethanol (EtOH) and a highly palatable food reward [sweetened condensed milk (SCM)] in rats and whether this role changes with EtOH dependence. After being trained to orally self-administer EtOH or SCM, the rats were made dependent (EtOH<sub>D</sub> and SCM<sub>D</sub>) by chronic intermittent EtOH vapor exposure. The control nondependent groups (EtOH<sub>ND</sub> and SCM<sub>ND</sub>) were exposed to air. Following extinction, the rats were tested for stress-induced reinstatement of EtOH- and SCM-seeking behavior. Stress reinstated EtOH- and SCM-seeking behavior in all groups (EtOH<sub>D/ND</sub> and SCM<sub>D/ND</sub>). Administration of the dual Orx receptor (OrxR) antagonist TCS1102 (15 μg) in the pPVT prevented stress-induced reinstatement only in dependent rats (EtOH<sub>D</sub> and SCM<sub>D</sub>). In parallel, the qPCR analysis showed that Orx mRNA expression in the hypothalamus and OrxR1/R2 mRNA expression in the pPVT were increased at the time of testing in the EtOH<sub>D</sub> and SCM<sub>D</sub> groups. These results are the first to implicate Orx transmission in the pPVT in the stress-induced reinstatement of reward-seeking behavior in EtOH dependent rats and indicate the maladaptive recruitment of Orx transmission in the pPVT by EtOH dependence.</p>

<p>A large variety of methods exist to estimate brain coupling in the frequency domain from electrophysiological data measured, e.g., by EEG and MEG. Those data are to reasonable approximation, though certainly not perfectly, Gaussian distributed. This work is based on the well-known fact that for Gaussian distributed data, the cross-spectrum completely determines all statistical properties. In particular, for an infinite number of data, all normalized coupling measures at a given frequency are a function of complex coherency. However, it is largely unknown what the functional relations are. We here present those functional relations for six different measures: the weighted phase lag index, the phase lag index, the absolute value and imaginary part of the phase locking value (PLV), power envelope correlation, and power envelope correlation with correction for artifacts of volume conduction. With the exception of PLV, the final results are simple closed form formulas. In an excursion we also discuss differences between short time Fourier transformation and Hilbert transformation for estimations in the frequency domain. We tested in simulations of linear and non-linear dynamical systems and for empirical resting state EEG on sensor level to what extent a model, namely the respective function of coherency, can explain the observed couplings. For empirical data we found that for measures of phase-phase coupling deviations from the model are in general minor, while power envelope correlations systematically deviate from the model for all frequencies. For power envelope correlation with correction for artifacts of volume conduction the model cannot explain the observed couplings at all. We also analyzed power envelope correlation as a function of time and frequency in an event related experiment using a stroop reaction task and found significant event related deviations mostly in the alpha range.</p>

<p>One major challenge in medical imaging analysis is the lack of label and annotation which usually requires medical knowledge and training. This issue is particularly serious in the brain image analysis such as the analysis of retinal vasculature, which directly reflects the vascular condition of Central Nervous System (CNS). In this paper, we present a novel semi-supervised learning algorithm to boost the performance of random forest under limited labeled data by exploiting the local structure of unlabeled data. We identify the key bottleneck of random forest to be the information gain calculation and replace it with a graph-embedded entropy which is more reliable for insufficient labeled data scenario. By properly modifying the training process of standard random forest, our algorithm significantly improves the performance while preserving the virtue of random forest such as low computational burden and robustness over over-fitting. Our method has shown a superior performance on both medical imaging analysis and machine learning benchmarks.</p>

<p>Previous studies have reported that some objects evoke a sense of local three-dimensional space (space-defining; SD), while others do not (space-ambiguous; SA), despite being imagined or viewed in isolation devoid of a background context. Moreover, people show a strong preference for SD objects when given a choice of objects with which to mentally construct scene imagery. When deconstructing scenes, people retain significantly more SD objects than SA objects. It, therefore, seems that SD objects might enjoy a privileged role in scene construction. In the current study, we leveraged the high temporal resolution of magnetoencephalography (MEG) to compare the neural responses to SD and SA objects while they were being used to build imagined scene representations, as this has not been examined before using neuroimaging. On each trial, participants gradually built a scene image from three successive auditorily-presented object descriptions and an imagined 3D space. We then examined the neural dynamics associated with the points during scene construction when either SD or SA objects were being imagined. We found that SD objects elicited theta changes relative to SA objects in two brain regions, the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the right superior temporal gyrus (STG). Furthermore, using dynamic causal modeling, we observed that the vmPFC drove STG activity. These findings may indicate that SD objects serve to activate schematic and conceptual knowledge in vmPFC and STG upon which scene representations are then built.</p>

<p>Neuroimaging studies have revealed a multitude of brain regions associated with self- and other-referential processing, but the question how the distinction between self, close other, and distant other is processed in the brain still remains unanswered. The default mode network (DMN) is the primary network associated with the processing of self, whereas task-positive networks (TPN) are indispensable for the processing of external objects. We hypothesize that self- and close-other-processing would engage DMN more than TPN, whereas distant-other-processing would engage TPN to a greater extent. To test this hypothesis, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) functional connectivity data obtained in the course of a trait adjective judgment task while subjects evaluated themselves, the best friend, a neutral stranger, and an unpleasant person. A positive association between the degree of self-relatedness and the degree of DMN dominance was revealed in cortical midline structures (CMS) and the left lateral prefrontal cortex. Relative to TPN, DMN showed greater connectivity in me than in friend, in friend than in stranger, and in stranger than in unpleasant conditions. These results show that the less the evaluated person is perceived as self-related, the more the balance of activity in the brain shifts from the DMN to the TPN.</p>

<p>Background: Antagonistic tasks are cognitive-motor task trainings. Intervention programs involving antagonistic exercise tasks are being employed to help prevent falls and reduce the need for nursing care in older populations. Meanwhile, the effects of such tasks on blood flow in the brain remain obscure. This study aimed to clarify the effects of antagonistic tasks on prefrontal cortical cerebral hemodynamics.</p><p>Materials and Methods: We assessed 13 healthy adults (two men, 11 women; mean age, 21.4 ± 1.0 years). Participants imitated each of the antagonistic tasks presented on a PC monitor placed at a 120-mm viewing distance. All participants performed six tasks, consisting of upper-limb tasks (non-antagonism, simple antagonism, and complex antagonism) and upper- and lower-limb tasks (tasks combining lower-limb opening and closing movements with each upper-limb task). We used near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to measure cerebral blood flow dynamics, with oxygenated hemoglobin (Oxy-Hb) concentration changes as the main outcome. A 10-channel probe was placed on the participants’ forehead, focusing on the prefrontal cortex. We first obtained a baseline NIRS measurement for 10 s; the participants then imitated the task presented on the PC monitor for 90 s. We measured the number of errors and the subjective difficulty of each task.</p><p>Results: The increase in prefrontal cortex Oxy-Hb concentration was significantly higher in the complex antagonist conditions than in the non-antagonistic and simple antagonistic conditions. There were no significant prefrontal cortex Oxy-Hb differences between the upper limb and upper- and lower-limb conditions (increasing number of motor limbs).</p><p>Conclusions: The study findings support that an increase in finger-shaped complexity has a greater effect on cerebral blood flow dynamics in the prefrontal cortex than does an increase in the number of motor limbs involved in the task.</p>

<p>Facial trustworthiness and feedback information of trustees can influence trustors’ investment behavior in trust games. This study investigated the temporal features of outcome evaluation (evaluation of feedback) and how they influence the processing of facial trustworthiness. A total of 25 college students participated in a decision-making task in which feedback was presented prior to a face stimulus. The decision of participants to continue investing was evaluated. We observed that trustors were more inclined to keep investing in trustworthy trustees or those appearing after positive feedback (gains). Event-related potential (ERP) results revealed that in the face presentation stage, trustworthy faces with losses induced more negative feedback-related negativity (FRN) than did trustworthy faces with gains and untrustworthy faces with losses. Further, faces that did not meet expectations induced more negative FRN. Trustworthy faces with gains induced more positive late positive component (LPC) than did trustworthy faces with losses and generated more motivated attention. Bottom–up and top–down processes were integrated for facial trustworthiness perception at different stages. In sum, top–down processing exerted a greater impact during the early stage of facial trustworthiness perception, both top–down and bottom–up processing were involved in the medium term, and bottom–up processing exerted a greater impact in the later stage.</p>

<p>The radial dimension expands during central nervous system development after the proliferative neuroepithelium is molecularly patterned. The process is associated with neurogenesis, radial glia scaffolding, and migration of immature neurons into the developing mantle stratum. Radial histogenetic units, defined as a delimited neural polyclone whose cells share the same molecular profile, are molded during these processes, and usually become roughly stratified into periventricular, intermediate, and superficial (subpial) strata wherein neuronal cell types may differ and be distributed in various patterns. Cell-cell adhesion or repulsion phenomena together with interaction with local intercellular matrix cues regulate the acquisition of nuclear, reticular, or layer histogenetic forms in such strata. Finally, the progressive addition of inputs and outputs soon follows the purely neurogenetic and radial migratory phase. Frequently there is heterochrony in the radial development of adjacent histogenetic units, apart of peculiarities in differentiation due to non-shared aspects of the respective molecular profiles. Tangential migrations may add complexity to radial unit cytoarchitecture and function. The study of the contributions of such genetically controlled radial histogenetic units to the emerging complex neural structure is a key instrument to understand central nervous system morphology and function. One recent example in this scenario is the recently proposed radial model of the mouse pallial amygdala. This is theoretically valid generally in mammals (Garcia-Calero et al., 2020), and subdivides the nuclear complex of the pallial amygdala into five main radial units. The approach applies a novel ad hoc amygdalar section plane, given the observed obliquity of the amygdalar radial glial framework. The general relevance of radial unit studies for clarifying structural analysis of all complex brain regions such as the pallial amygdala is discussed, with additional examples.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, for which aging remains the major risk factor. Aging is under a consistent pressure of increasing brain entropy (BEN) due to the progressive brain deteriorations. Noticeably, the brain constantly consumes a large amount of energy to maintain its functional integrity, likely creating or maintaining a big “reserve” to counteract the high entropy. Malfunctions of this latent reserve may indicate a critical point of disease progression. The purpose of this study was to characterize BEN in aging and AD and to test an inverse-U-shape BEN model: BEN increases with age and AD pathology in normal aging but decreases in the AD continuum. BEN was measured with resting state fMRI and compared across aging and the AD continuum. Associations of BEN with age, education, clinical symptoms, and pathology were examined by multiple regression. The analysis results highlighted resting BEN in the default mode network, medial temporal lobe, and prefrontal cortex and showed that: (1) BEN increased with age and pathological deposition in normal aging but decreased with age and pathological deposition in the AD continuum; (2) AD showed catastrophic BEN reduction, which was related to more severe cognitive impairment and daily function disability; and (3) BEN decreased with education years in normal aging, but not in the AD continuum. BEN evolution follows an inverse-U trajectory when AD progresses from normal aging to AD dementia. Education is beneficial for suppressing the entropy increase potency in normal aging.</p>

<p>Recent research regards the electroencephalogram (EEG) as a promising method to study real-time brain dynamic changes in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), but a deeper understanding is needed to discern coincident pathophysiology, patterns of changes, and diagnosis. This review summarized recent research on EEG characterization related to the cognitive and motor functions in PD patients and discussed its potential to be used as diagnostic biomarkers. Thirty papers out of 220 published from 2010 to 2020 were reviewed. Movement abnormalities and cognitive decline are related to changes in EEG spectrum and event-related potentials (ERPs) during typical oddball paradigms and/or combined motor tasks. Abnormalities in β and δ frequency bands are, respectively the main manifestation of dyskinesia and cognitive decline in PD. The review showed that PD patients have noteworthy changes in specific EEG characterizations, however, the underlying mechanism of the interrelation between gait and cognitive is still unclear. Understanding the specific nature of the relationship is essential for development of novel invasive clinical diagnostic and therapeutic methods.</p>

<p>Cell-based screening of bioactive compounds has served as an important gateway in drug discovery. In the present report, using human neuroblastoma cells and enrolling an extensive three-step screening of 57 phytochemicals, we have identified caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) as a potent neurodifferentiating natural compound. Analyses of control and CAPE-induced neurodifferentiated cells revealed: (i) modulation of several key proteins (NF200, MAP-2, NeuN, PSD95, Tuj1, GAP43, and GFAP) involved in neurodifferentiation process; and (ii) attenuation of neuronal stemness (HOXD13, WNT3, and Msh-2) and proliferation-promoting (CDC-20, CDK-7, and BubR1) proteins. We anticipated that the neurodifferentiation potential of CAPE may be beneficial for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and tested it using the Drosophila model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and mice model of amnesia/loss of memory. In both models, CAPE exhibited improved disease symptoms and activation of physiological functions. Remarkably, CAPE-treated mice showed increased levels of neurotrophin-BDNF, neural progenitor marker-Nestin, and differentiation marker-NeuN, both in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Taken together, we demonstrate the differentiation-inducing and therapeutic potential of CAPE for neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>Human epidemiological evidence and animal experimental data suggest that chronic manganese (Mn) exposure increases the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and amyloid plaques, a hallmark of AD brain pathology, but the underlying mechanisms were not fully understood. Using the transgenic APP/PS1/Tau triple transgenic AD (3×Tg-AD) mouse model and mouse-derived microglia and neuroblastoma cell lines, we found that chronic 5-month Mn treatment increased beta amyloid peptide (Aβ) expression and Aβ plaques in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus in these 3×Tg-AD mice. Furthermore, we found that the β- and γ-secretase cleavage activities were markedly increased, while α-secretase cleavage activity was reduced in the brain of Mn-treated AD mice; these effects increase Aβ production and thus are amyloidogenic. Equally important, Mn treatment alone did not alter β-secretase 1 (BACE1) gene expression or Aβ production in amyloidogenic mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene hAPPsw-transfected N2a cells (APPsw-N2a), but in APPsw-N2a cells either co-cultured with microglia or cultured with microglia-conditioned media, Mn exposure increased BACE1 expression and amyloidogenesis. We further determined that Mn exposure promoted the activation of microglia both in 3×Tg-AD mouse brains and in cultured microglia cells, and increased the secretion of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Taken together, these results suggest that Mn may increase the release of IL-1β and TNF-α from microglia that in turn stimulates the expression of BACE1 gene and protein and consequently Aβ production; this novel molecular mechanism not only advances our understanding about the amyloidogenic effect of chronic Mn exposure reported for special human populations but also indicates Mn dyshomeostasis as a potential contributor to AD pathogenesis.</p>

<p>Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is characterised by the progressive accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) in the walls of cerebral capillaries and arteries representing a major cause of haemorrhagic stroke including lobar intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) and convexity subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). Haemorrhaging from CAA predominantly involves smaller arteries rather than arterial aneurysm. Restricted bleeding into the subarachnoid space in CAA results in asymptomatic or mild symptomatic SAH. Herein, we present an autopsied case of massive SAH related to CAA. An 89-year-old male with a history of mild Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and advanced pancreatic cancer with liver metastasis developed sudden onset of coma. Head CT illustrated ICH located in the right frontal lobe and right insula, as well as SAH bilaterally spreading from the basal cistern to the Sylvian fissure, with hydrocephalus and brain herniation. He died about 24 h after onset and the post-mortem examination showed no evidence of arterial aneurysm. The substantial accumulation of Aβ in the vessels around the haemorrhagic lesions led to the diagnosis of ICH related to CAA and secondary SAH, which may have been aggravated by old age and malignancy. This case suggests that CAA can cause severe SAH resembling aneurysmal origin and thus may be overlooked when complicated by atypical cerebral haemorrhage.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63368">Innovation of heterochromatin functions drives rapid evolution of essential ZAD-ZNF genes in <i>Drosophila</i></a></h4>

Contrary to dogma, evolutionarily young and dynamic genes can encode essential functions. We find that evolutionarily dynamic <i>ZAD-ZNF</i> genes, which encode the most abundant class of insect transcription factors, are more likely to encode essential functions in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> than ancient, conserved <i>ZAD-ZNF</i> genes. We focus on the <i>Nicknack ZAD-ZNF</i> gene, which is evolutionarily young, poorly retained in <i>Drosophila</i> species, and evolves under strong positive selection. Yet we find that it is necessary for larval development in <i>D. melanogaster.</i> We show that <i>Nicknack</i> encodes a heterochromatin-localizing protein like its paralog <i>Oddjob</i>, also an evolutionarily dynamic yet essential <i>ZAD-ZNF</i> gene. We find that the divergent <i>D. simulans</i> Nicknack protein can still localize to <i>D. melanogaster</i> heterochromatin and rescue viability of female but not male <i>Nicknack-</i>null <i>D. melanogaster</i>. Our findings suggest that innovation for rapidly changing heterochromatin functions might generally explain the essentiality of many evolutionarily dynamic <i>ZAD-ZNF</i> genes in insects.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62420">The effects of age and systemic metabolism on anti-tumor T cell responses</a></h4>

Average age and obesity prevalence are increasing globally. Both aging and obesity are characterized by profound systemic metabolic and immunologic changes and are cancer risk factors. The mechanisms linking age and body weight to cancer are incompletely understood, but recent studies have provided evidence that the anti-tumor immune response is reduced in both conditions, while responsiveness to immune checkpoint blockade, a form of cancer immunotherapy, is paradoxically intact. Dietary restriction, which promotes health and lifespan, may enhance cancer immunity. These findings illustrate that the systemic context can impact anti-tumor immunity and immunotherapy responsiveness. Here, we review the current knowledge of how age and systemic metabolic state affect the anti-tumor immune response, with an emphasis on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which are key players in anti-tumor immunity. A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms may lead to novel therapies enhancing anti-tumor immunity in the context of aging or metabolic dysfunction.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61834">SpikeInterface, a unified framework for spike sorting</a></h4>

Much development has been directed towards improving the performance and automation of spike sorting. This continuous development, while essential, has contributed to an over-saturation of new, incompatible tools that hinders rigorous benchmarking and complicates reproducible analysis. To address these limitations, we developed SpikeInterface, a Python framework designed to unify preexisting spike sorting technologies into a single codebase and to facilitate straightforward comparison and adoption of different approaches. With a few lines of code, researchers can reproducibly run, compare, and benchmark most modern spike sorting algorithms; pre-process, post-process, and visualize extracellular datasets; validate, curate, and export sorting outputs; and more. In this paper, we provide an overview of SpikeInterface and, with applications to real and simulated datasets, demonstrate how it can be utilized to reduce the burden of manual curation and to more comprehensively benchmark automated spike sorters.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61393">Biochemical patterns of antibody polyreactivity revealed through a bioinformatics-based analysis of CDR loops</a></h4>

Antibodies are critical components of adaptive immunity, binding with high affinity to pathogenic epitopes. Antibodies undergo rigorous selection to achieve this high affinity, yet some maintain an additional basal level of low affinity, broad reactivity to diverse epitopes, a phenomenon termed 'polyreactivity'. While polyreactivity has been observed in antibodies isolated from various immunological niches, the biophysical properties that allow for promiscuity in a protein selected for high affinity binding to a single target remain unclear. Using a database of over 1,000 polyreactive and non-polyreactive antibody sequences, we created a bioinformatic pipeline to isolate key determinants of polyreactivity. These determinants, which include an increase in inter-loop crosstalk and a propensity for a neutral binding surface, are sufficient to generate a classifier able to identify polyreactive antibodies with over 75% accuracy. The framework from which this classifier was built is generalizable, and represents a powerful, automated pipeline for future immune repertoire analysis.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60939">Reprogramming of bone marrow myeloid progenitor cells in patients with severe coronary artery disease</a></h4>

Atherosclerosis is the major cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Monocyte-derived macrophages are the most abundant immune cells in atherosclerotic plaques. In patients with atherosclerotic CVD, leukocytes have a hyperinflammatory phenotype. We hypothesize that immune cell reprogramming in these patients occurs at the level of myeloid progenitors. We included 13 patients with coronary artery disease due to severe atherosclerosis and 13 subjects without atherosclerosis in an exploratory study. Cytokine production capacity after <i>ex vivo</i> stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNCs) and bone marrow MNCs was higher in patients with atherosclerosis. In BM-MNCs this was associated with increased glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. The BM composition was skewed towards myelopoiesis and transcriptome analysis of HSC/GMP cell populations revealed enrichment of neutrophil- and monocyte-related pathways. These results show that in patients with atherosclerosis, activation of innate immune cells occurs at the level of myeloid progenitors, which adds exciting opportunities for novel treatment strategies.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60031">The SSVEP tracks attention, not consciousness, during perceptual filling-in</a></h4>

Research on the neural basis of conscious perception has almost exclusively shown that becoming aware of a stimulus leads to increased neural responses. By designing a novel form of perceptual filling-in (PFI) overlaid with a dynamic texture display, we frequency-tagged multiple disappearing targets as well as their surroundings. We show that in a PFI paradigm the disappearance of a stimulus and subjective invisibility are associated with increases in neural activity, as measured with steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP), in electroencephalography (EEG). We also find that this increase correlates with alpha-band activity, a well-established neural measure of attention. These findings cast doubt on the direct relationship previously reported between the strength of neural activity and conscious perception, at least when measured with current tools, such as the SSVEP. Instead we conclude that SSVEP strength more closely measures changes in attention.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59902">Group size and composition influence collective movement in a highly social terrestrial bird</a></h4>

A challenge of group-living is to maintain cohesion while navigating through heterogeneous landscapes. Larger groups benefit from information pooling, translating to greater ‘collective intelligence’, but face increased coordination challenges. If these facets interact, we should observe a non-linear relationship between group size and collective movement. We deployed high-resolution GPS tags to vulturine guineafowl from 21 distinct social groups and used continuous-time movement models to characterize group movements across five seasons. Our data revealed a quadratic relationship between group size and movement characteristics, with intermediate-sized groups exhibiting the largest home-range size and greater variation in space use. Intermediate-sized groups also had higher reproductive success, but having more young in the group reduced home-range size. Our study suggests the presence of an optimal group size, and composition, for collective movement.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59889">Cohesin residency determines chromatin loop patterns</a></h4>

The organization of chromatin into higher order structures is essential for chromosome segregation, the repair of DNA-damage, and the regulation of gene expression. Using Micro-C XL to detect chromosomal interactions, we observed the pervasive presence of cohesin-dependent loops with defined positions throughout the genome of budding yeast, as seen in mammalian cells. In early S phase, cohesin stably binds to cohesin associated regions (CARs) genome-wide. Subsequently, positioned loops accumulate with CARs at the bases of the loops. Cohesin regulators Wpl1 and Pds5 alter the levels and distribution of cohesin at CARs, changing the pattern of positioned loops. From these observations, we propose that cohesin with loop extrusion activity is stopped by preexisting CAR-bound cohesins, generating positioned loops. The patterns of loops observed in a population of wild-type and mutant cells can be explained by this mechanism, coupled with a heterogeneous residency of cohesin at CARs in individual cells.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59426">A physical mechanism of TANGO1-mediated bulky cargo export</a></h4>

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein TANGO1 assembles into a ring around ER exit sites (ERES), and links procollagens in the ER lumen to COPII machinery, tethers, and ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) in the cytoplasm (Raote <i>et al.</i>, 2018). Here we present a theoretical approach to investigate the physical mechanisms of TANGO1 ring assembly and how COPII polymerization, membrane tension, and force facilitate the formation of a transport intermediate for procollagen export. Our results indicate that a TANGO1 ring, by acting as a linactant, stabilizes the open neck of a nascent COPII bud. Elongation of such a bud into a transport intermediate commensurate with bulky procollagens is then facilitated by two complementary mechanisms: <i>(i)</i> by relieving membrane tension, possibly by TANGO1-mediated fusion of retrograde ERGIC membranes; and <i>(ii) </i>by force application. Altogether, our theoretical approach identifies key biophysical events in TANGO1-driven procollagen export.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58891">Belief updating in bipolar disorder predicts time of recurrence</a></h4>

Bipolar disorder is a chronic relapsing condition in which mood episodes are interspersed with periods of wellbeing (euthymia). Shorter periods of euthymia are associated with poorer functioning, so it is crucial to identify predictors of relapse to facilitate treatment. Here, we test the hypothesis that specific valence-dependent learning patterns emerge prior to the clinical manifestation of a relapse, predicting its timing. The ability to update beliefs in response to positive and negative information was quantified in bipolar patients during euthymia, who were then monitored for 5 years. We found that reduced tendency to update beliefs in response to positive relative to negative information predicted earlier relapse. Less updating in response to positive information may generate pessimistic beliefs, which in turn can lead to more severe prodromal symptoms (e.g. sleep disturbance, irritability etc.). The results suggest that measuring valence-dependent belief updating could facilitate risk prediction in bipolar disorder.

Here, we have developed DIAMonDS (<i>Drosophila</i> Individual Activity Monitoring and Detection System) comprising time-lapse imaging by a charge-coupled device (CCD) flatbed scanner and Sapphire, a novel algorithm and web application. DIAMonDS automatically and sequentially identified the transition time points of multiple life cycle events such as pupariation, eclosion, and death in individual flies at high temporal resolution and on a large scale. DIAMonDS performed simultaneous multiple scans to measure individual deaths (≤1152 flies per scanner) and pupariation and eclosion timings (≤288 flies per scanner) under various chemical exposures, environmental conditions, and genetic backgrounds. DIAMonDS correctly identified 74–85% of the pupariation and eclosion events and ~ 92% of the death events within ± 10 scanning frames. This system is a powerful tool for studying the influences of genetic and environmental factors on fruit flies and efficient, high-throughput genetic and chemical screening in drug discovery.

Microdeletions and microduplications of the 16p11.2 chromosomal locus are associated with syndromic neurodevelopmental disorders and reciprocal physiological conditions such as macro/microcephaly and high/low body mass index. To facilitate cellular and molecular investigations into these phenotypes, 65 clones of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) were generated from 13 individuals with 16p11.2 copy number variations (CNVs). To ensure these cell lines were suitable for downstream mechanistic investigations, a customizable bioinformatic strategy for the detection of random integration and expression of reprogramming vectors was developed and leveraged towards identifying a subset of 'footprint'-free hiPSC clones. Transcriptomic profiling of cortical neural progenitor cells derived from these hiPSCs identified alterations in gene expression patterns which precede morphological abnormalities reported at later neurodevelopmental stages. Interpreting clinical information—available with the cell lines by request from the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative—with this transcriptional data revealed disruptions in gene programs related to both nervous system function and cellular metabolism. As demonstrated by these analyses, this publicly available resource has the potential to serve as a powerful medium for probing the etiology of developmental disorders associated with 16p11.2 CNVs.

Adapting to the environment statistics by reducing brain responses to repetitive sensory information is key for efficient information processing. Yet, the fine-scale computations that support this adaptive processing in the human brain remain largely unknown. Here, we capitalize on the sub-millimetre resolution of ultra-high field imaging to examine fMRI signals across cortical depth and discern competing hypotheses about the brain mechanisms (feedforward vs. feedback) that mediate adaptive processing. We demonstrate layer-specific suppressive processing within visual cortex, as indicated by stronger BOLD decrease in superficial and middle than deeper layers for gratings that were repeatedly presented at the same orientation. Further, we show altered functional connectivity for adaptation: enhanced feedforward connectivity from V1 to higher visual areas, short-range feedback connectivity between V1 and V2 and long-range feedback occipito-parietal connectivity. Our findings provide evidence for a circuit of local recurrent and feedback interactions that mediate rapid brain plasticity for adaptive information processing.

The Pro47Ser variant of p53 (S47) exists in African-descent populations and is associated with increased cancer risk in humans and mice. Due to impaired repression of the cystine importer <i>Slc7a11</i>, S47 cells show increased glutathione (GSH) accumulation compared to cells with wild -type p53. We show that mice containing the S47 variant display increased mTOR activity and oxidative metabolism, as well as larger size, improved metabolic efficiency, and signs of superior fitness. Mechanistically, we show that mTOR and its positive regulator Rheb display increased association in S47 cells; this is due to an altered redox state of GAPDH in S47 cells that inhibits its ability to bind and sequester Rheb. Compounds that decrease glutathione normalize GAPDH-Rheb complexes and mTOR activity in S47 cells. This study reveals a novel layer of regulation of mTOR by p53, and raises the possibility that this variant may have been selected for in early Africa.

A novel, pleasant taste stimulus becomes aversive if associated with gastric malaise, a form of learning known as conditioned taste aversion (CTA). CTA is common to vertebrates and invertebrates and is an important survival response: eating the wrong food may be deadly. CTA depends on the gustatory portion of the insular cortex (GC) and the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) however, its synaptic underpinnings are unknown. Here we report that CTA was associated with decreased expression of immediate early genes in rat GC of both sexes, and with reduced amplitude of BLA-GC synaptic responses, pointing to long-term depression (LTD) as a mechanism for learning. Indeed, association of a novel tastant with induction of LTD at the BLA-GC input in vivo was sufficient to change the hedonic value of a taste stimulus. Our results demonstrate a direct role for amygdalocortical LTD in taste aversion learning.

Since the 1960s, a single class of agent has been licensed targeting virus-encoded ion channels, or 'viroporins', contrasting the success of channel blocking drugs in other areas of medicine. Although resistance arose to these prototypic adamantane inhibitors of the influenza A virus (IAV) M2 proton channel, a growing number of clinically and economically important viruses are now recognised to encode essential viroporins providing potential targets for modern drug discovery. We describe the first rationally designed viroporin inhibitor with a comprehensive structure-activity relationship (SAR). This step-change in understanding not only revealed a second biological function for the p7 viroporin from hepatitis C virus (HCV) during virus entry, but also enabled the synthesis of a labelled tool compound that retained biological activity. Hence, p7 inhibitors (p7i) represent a unique class of HCV antiviral targeting both the spread and establishment of infection, as well as a precedent for future viroporin-targeted drug discovery.

Adolescence is a critical period of development with increased sensitivity toward psychological stressors. Many psychiatric conditions emerge during adolescence and animal studies have shown that that acute stress has long-term effects on hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis function and behavior. We recently demonstrated that acute stress produces long-term electrophysiological changes in locus coeruleus and long-lasting anxiety-like behavior in adolescent male rats. Based on prior reports of increased stress sensitivity during adolescence and increased sensitivity of female locus coeruleus toward corticotropin releasing factor, we hypothesized that the same acute stressor would cause different behavioral and physiological responses in adolescent female and adult male rats one week after stressor exposure. In this study, we assessed age and sex differences in how an acute psychological stressor affects corticosterone release, anxiety-like behavior, and locus coeruleus physiology at short- and long-term intervals. All groups of animals responded to stress with elevated corticosterone levels at the acute time point. One week after stressor exposure, adolescent females showed decreased firing of locus coeruleus neurons upon current injection and increased exploratory behavior compared to controls. The results were in direct contrast to changes observed in adolescent males, which showed increased anxiety-like behavior and increased spontaneous and induced firing locus coeruleus neurons a week after stressor exposure. Adult males were both behaviorally and electrophysiologically resilient to the long-term effects of acute stress. Therefore, there may be a normal developmental trajectory for locus coeruleus neurons which promotes stress resilience in adults, but stressor exposure during adolescence perturbs their function. Furthermore, while locus coeruleus neurons are more sensitive to stressor exposure during adolescence, the effect varies between adolescent males and females. These findings suggest that endocrine, behavioral, and physiological responses to stress vary among animals of different age and sex, and therefore these variables should be taken into account when selecting models and designing experiments to investigate the effects of stress. These differences in animals may also allude to age and sex differences in the prevalence of various psychiatric illnesses within the human population.

Extended space travel, such as crewed missions to Mars and beyond, is a goal for both government space agencies and private companies. Research over the past decades, however, has shown that spaceflight poses risks to human health, including negative effects on musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and immune systems. Details regarding effects on the nervous system have been less well described. The use of animal models holds great potential to identify and dissect conserved mechanisms of neuronal response to spaceflight. Here, we exploited the unique experimental advantages of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to explore how spaceflight affects adult neurons in vivo, at the single-cell level. We found that animals that lived 5 days of their adult life on the International Space Station exhibited considerable dendritic remodeling of the highly branched PVD neuron and modest morphological changes in touch receptor neurons when compared to ground control animals. Our results indicate hyperbranching as a common response of adult neurons to spaceflight. We also found that, in the presence of a neuronal proteotoxic stress, spaceflight promotes a remarkable accumulation of neuronal-derived waste in the surrounding tissues (especially hypodermis), suggesting an impaired transcellular degradation of debris that is released from neurons. Overall, our data reveal that spaceflight can significantly affect adult neuronal morphology and clearance of neuronal trash, highlighting the need to carefully assess the risks of long-duration spaceflight on the nervous system and to develop countermeasures to protect human health during space exploration.

The immediate-early gene Arc is a master regulator of synaptic plasticity and plays a critical role in memory consolidation. However, there has not been a comprehensive analysis of the itinerary of Arc protein, linking its function at different subcellular locations with corresponding time points after neuronal network activation. When cultured hippocampal neurons are treated with a combination of pharmacological agents to induce long term potentiation, they express high levels of Arc, allowing to study its spatiotemporal distribution. Our experiments show that neuronal activity-induced Arc expression was not restricted to neurons, but that its spatiotemporal dynamics involved a shift to astrocytes at a later timepoint. Specifically, astrocytic Arc is not due to endogenous transcription, but is dependent on the production of neuronal Arc and accumulates potentially via the recently reported intercellular transfer mechanism through Arc capsids. In conclusion, we found that Arc accumulates within astrocytes in a neuronal activity-dependent manner, which is independent of endogenous astrocytic Arc transcription, therefore highlighting the need to study the purpose of this pool of Arc, especially in learning and memory.

To make optimal decisions in uncertain circumstances flexible adaption of behaviour is required; exploring alternatives when the best choice is unknown, exploiting what is known when that is best. Using a detailed computational model of the basal ganglia, we propose that switches between exploratory and exploitative decisions can be mediated by the interaction between tonic dopamine and cortical input to the basal ganglia. We show that a biologically detailed action selection circuit model of the basal ganglia, endowed with dopamine dependant striatal plasticity, can optimally solve the explore-exploit problem, estimating the true underlying state of a noisy Gaussian diffusion process. Critical to the model's performance was a fluctuating level of tonic dopamine which increased under conditions of uncertainty. With an optimal range of tonic dopamine, explore-exploit decision making was mediated by the effects of tonic dopamine on the precision of the model action selection mechanism. Under conditions of uncertain reward pay-out, the model's reduced selectivity allowed disinhibition of multiple alternative actions to be explored at random. Conversely, when uncertainly about reward pay-out was low, enhanced selectivity of the action selection circuit was enhanced, facilitating exploitation of the high value choice. When integrated with phasic dopamine dependant influences on cortico-striatal plasticity, the model's performance was at the level of the Kalman filter which provides an optimal solution for the task. Our model provides an integrative account of the relationship between phasic and tonic dopamine and the action selection function of the basal ganglia. It supports the idea that this subcortical neural circuit may have evolved to facilitate decision making in non-stationary reward environments, allowing a number of experimental predictions with relevance to abnormal decision making in neuropsychiatric and neurological disease.

In language, stored representations of lexical items combine into an infinitude of complex expressions. While the neuroscience of composition has begun to mature, we do not yet understand how the stored representations evolve and morph during composition. New decoding techniques allow us to crack open this very hard question: we can train a model to recognize a representation in one context or time-point and assess its accuracy in another. We combined the decoding approach with magnetoencephalography recorded during a picture naming task to investigate the temporal evolution of noun and adjective representations during speech planning. We tracked word representations as they combined into simple two-word phrases, using single words and two-word lists as non-combinatory controls. We found that nouns were generally more decodable than adjectives, suggesting that noun representations were stronger and/or more consistent across trials than those of adjectives. When training and testing across contexts and times, the representations of isolated nouns were recoverable when those nouns were embedded in phrases, but not so if they were embedded in lists. Adjective representations did not show a similar consistency across isolated and phrasal contexts. Noun representations in phrases also sustained over time in a way that was not observed for any other pairing of word class and context. These findings offer a new window into the temporal evolution and context sensitivity of word representations during composition, revealing a clear asymmetry between adjectives and nouns. The impact of phrasal contexts on the decodability of nouns may be due to the nouns status as head of phrase--an intriguing hypothesis for future research.

Humans are constantly exposed to a rich tapestry of visual information in a potentially changing environment. To cope with the computational burden this engenders, our perceptual system must use prior context to simultaneously prioritise stimuli of importance and suppress irrelevant surroundings. This study investigated the influence of prediction and attention in visual perception by investigating event-related potentials (ERPs) often associated with these processes, N170 and N2pc for prediction and attention respectively. A contextual trajectory paradigm was used which violated visual predictions and neglected to predetermine areas of spatial interest, to account for the potentially unpredictable nature of a real-life visual scene. Participants (N=36) viewed a visual display of cued and non-cued shapes rotating in a five-step predictable trajectory, with the fifth and final position of either the cued or non-cued shape occurring in a predictable or unpredictable spatial location. Results showed both enhanced N170 and N2pc amplitudes to unpredictable compared to predictable stimuli, and furthermore the N170 was larger to cued than non-cued stimuli. In accordance with previous research these results suggest the N170 is in part a visual prediction error response with respect to higher-level visual processes, and furthermore the N2pc may index attention reorientation. The results demonstrate prior context influences the sensitivity of the N170 and N2pc electrophysiological responses. The findings suggest attention boosts the precision of prediction error signals, furthering our understanding of how expectation can modulate prediction in selective visuospatial attention. Implications of this research provide insight into how prior context in visuospatial motion guides attention in a visual scene.

Background: Alzheimers disease (AD) and other tauopathies are neurodegenerative disorders characterized by cellular accumulation of aggregated tau protein. Tau pathology within these disorders is accompanied by chronic neuroinflammation, such as activation of the classical complement pathway by complement initiation factor C1q. Additionally, about half of the AD cases present with inclusions composed of aggregated alpha-synuclein called Lewy bodies. Lewy bodies in disorders such as Parkinsons disease and Lewy body dementia also frequently occur together with tau pathology. Immunotherapy is currently the most promising treatment strategy for tauopathies. However, the presence of multiple pathological processes within tauopathies makes it desirable to simultaneously target more than one disease pathway. Methods: Herein, we have developed three bispecific antibodies based on published antibody binding region sequences. One bispecific antibody binds to tau plus alpha-synuclein and two bispecific antibodies bind to tau plus C1q. Results: The affinity of the bispecific antibodies to their targets compared to their monospecific counterparts ranged from nearly identical to one order of magnitude lower. All bispecific antibodies retained binding to aggregated protein in patient-derived brain sections. The bispecific antibodies also retained their ability to inhibit aggregation of recombinant tau, regardless of whether the tau binding sites were in IgG or scFv format. Mono- and bispecific antibodies inhibited cellular seeding induced by AD-derived pathological tau with similar efficacy. Finally, both Tau-C1q bispecific antibodies completely inhibited the classical complement pathway. Conclusion: Bispecific antibodies that bind to multiple pathological targets may therefore present a promising approach to treat tauopathies and other neurodegenerative disorders.

Neurotransmitter release occurs either synchronously to action potentials or spontaneously, yet whether molecular machineries underlying evoked and spontaneous release are identical, especially whether voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) can trigger spontaneous events has been in debate. To elucidate this issue, we characterized Ca2+ dependency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in autaptic cultured hippocampal neurons. We found that 58 % mEPSC frequency was dependent on extracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]o), and Ca2+ cooperativity of spontaneous release was comparable to that of evoked release. Moreover, most (&gt; 90 %) of [Ca2+]o-dependent mEPSCs was attributable to VGCCs. Coupling distance between VGCCs and Ca2+ sensors was estimated as tight for both spontaneous and evoked release (~22 nm). In hippocampal slices, VGCC-dependence on spontaneous release was also observed, but to a different extent, at different areas and ages. At the calyx of Held synapses, mEPSCs showed VGCC-dependence in type 1 mature synapses where VGCCs and Ca2+ sensors are tightly coupled, but not in immature synapses. These data strongly suggest that the distance between VGCCs and Ca2+ sensors is the key factor to determine VGCC dependence of spontaneous release.

The new aggregate data analyses revealed the earlier missing role played by the cerebellum long-term electrical stimulation in the absence epilepsy. Neurophysiologic data gained by authors favor that cerebellar serial deep brain stimulation (DBS) (100 Hz) causes the transformation of penicillin-induced cortical focal discharges into prolonged 3,5-3,75 sec oscillations resembling spike-wave discharges (SWD) in cats. Such SWDs were not organized in the form of bursts and persisted continuously after stimulation. Therefore the appearance of prolonged periods of SWD is regarded as a tonic cerebellar influence upon pacemaker of SWD and might be caused by the long-lasting DBS-induced increase of GABA-ergic extrasynaptic inhibition in forebrain networks. At the same time, cerebellar DBS high-frequency (100 Hz) suppressed bursts of SWD observed during the phase of stimulation. Different types of cerebellar DBS upon epileptic activity emphasized the absence seizure facilitation discussed with the reviewed data on optogenetic stimulation, neuronal activity of cerebellar structures, and functional magnetic resonance imaging data.

Objectives: The goal of the present study was to identify the role of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) in the detection and later processing of novelty stimuli. Methods: Twenty-one epilepsy patients with unilateral MTL resection (10 left-sided; 11 right-sided) performed an adapted visual novelty oddball task. In this task two streams of stimuli were presented on the left and right of fixation while the patients' electroencephalogram was measured. Patients responded to infrequent target stimuli, while ignoring frequent standard, and infrequent novel stimuli that could appear either contra- or ipsilateral to the resected side. Results: Novelty detection, as indexed by the N2 ERP component elicited by novels, was not affected by the MTL resections. Later processing of novels, however, as indexed by the novelty P3 ERP component, was reduced for novels presented contra- versus ipsilateral to the resected side. Target processing, as indexed by the P3b, was unaffected. Conclusions: The current results suggest that MTL structures play a role in novelty processing, but that the novelty signal may originate from a distinct neural source.

Nerve regeneration is associated with plasticity of sensory neurons, so that even muscle afferents directed to skin form mechanosensitive receptive fields appropriate for the new target. STOML3 is an essential mechanotransduction component in many cutaneous mechanoreceptors. Here we asked whether STOML3 is required for functional and anatomical plasticity following peripheral nerve regeneration. We used a cross-anastomosis model adapted to the mouse in which the medial gastrocnemius nerve was redirected to innervate hairy skin previously occupied by the sural nerve. We recorded from muscle afferents innervating the skin and found that in wild-type mice their receptive properties were largely identical to normal skin mechanoreceptors. However, in mice lacking STOML3, muscle afferents largely failed to form functional mechanosensitive receptive fields, despite making anatomically appropriate endings in the skin. Our tracing experiments demonstrated that muscle afferents from both wild-type and stoml3 mutant mice display remarkable anatomically plasticity, forming new somatotopically appropriate synaptic terminals in the region of the dorsal horn representing the sural nerve territory. The dramatic reduction in stimulus evoked activity from the cross-anastomosed gastrocnemius nerve in stoml3 mutant mice did not prevent central anatomical plasticity. Our results have identified a molecular factor that is required for functional plasticity following peripheral nerve injury.

Sexual stimuli processing is a key element in the repertoire of human affective and motivational states. Previous neuroimaging studies of sexual stimulus processing have revealed a complicated mosaic of activated regions, leaving unresolved questions about their sensitivity and specificity to sexual stimuli per se, generalizability across individuals, and potential utility as neuromarkers for sexual stimulus processing. In this study, data on sexual, negative, non-sexual positive, and neutral images from Wehrum et al. (2013) (N = 100) were re-analyzed with multivariate Support Vector Machine models to create the Brain Activation-based Sexual Image Classifier (BASIC) model. This model was tested for sensitivity, specificity, and generalizability in cross-validation (N = 100) and an independent test cohort (N = 18; Kragel et al. 2019). The BASIC model showed highly accurate performance (94-100%) in classifying sexual versus neutral or nonsexual affective images in both datasets. Virtual lesions and test of individual large-scale networks (e.g. 'visual' or 'attention' networks) show that these individual networks are neither necessary nor sufficient to capture sexual stimulus processing. These findings suggest that brain responses to sexual stimuli constitute a category of mental event that is distinct from general affect and involves multiple brain networks. It is, however, largely conserved across individuals, permitting the development of neuromarkers for sexual processing in individual persons. Future studies could assess performance of BASIC to a broader array of affective/motivational stimuli and link brain responses with physiological and subjective measures of sexual arousal.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.09.375840v1?rss=1">Plasticity after cortical stroke involves potentiating responses of pre-existing circuits but not functional remapping to new circuits</a></h4>

Functional recovery after stroke is thought to be mediated by adaptive circuit plasticity, whereby surviving neurons assume the roles of those that died. This "remapping" hypothesis is based on human brain mapping studies showing apparent reorganization of cortical sensorimotor maps and animal studies documenting molecular and structural changes that could support circuit rewiring. However, definitive evidence of remapping is lacking, and other studies have suggested that maladaptive plasticity mechanisms, such as enhanced inhibition in peri-infarct cortex, might actually limit plasticity after stroke. Here we sought to directly test whether neurons can change their response selectivity after a stroke that destroys a single barrel (C1) within mouse primary somatosensory cortex. Using multimodal in vivo imaging approaches, including two-photon calcium imaging to longitudinally record sensory-evoked activity in peri-infarct cortex before and after stroke, we found no evidence to support the remapping hypothesis. In an attempt to promote plasticity via rehabilitation, we also tested the effects of forced use therapy by plucking all whiskers except the C1 whisker. Again, we failed to detect an increase in the number of C1 whisker-responsive neurons in surrounding barrels even 2 months after stroke. Instead, we found that forced use therapy potentiated sensory-evoked responses in a pool of surviving neurons that were already C1 whisker responsive by significantly increasing the reliability of their responses. Together, our results argue against the long-held theory of functional remapping after stroke, but support a plausible circuit-based mechanism for how rehabilitation may improve recovery of function.

People with central vision loss (CVL) due to macular degeneration are forced to rely on their residual peripheral vision and often develop a preferred retinal locus (PRL), a region of intact peripheral retina that is used for fixation. At the PRL, visual processing is impaired due to crowding (cluttering of visual objects). The problem of crowding still persists when images are magnified to account for the lower resolution of peripheral vision. We assessed whether anodal transcranial direct stimulation (a-tDCS), a neuro-modulation technique that alters cortical inhibition, would reduce collinear inhibition (an early component of crowding) when applied to the visual cortex in patients with CVL. Our results showed that applying a-tDCS to the visual cortex for 20mins reduced crowding in three patients with CVL and that the effect was sustained for up to 30mins. Sham stimulation delivered in a separate session had no effect. These initial observations mandate further research into the use of a-tDCS to enhance the cortical processing of residual retinal input in patients with CVL.

Visual illusions have long been studied because the illusory effect they induce is believed to tell us something important on how the visual system processes visual information. Here, we modified a classic visual illusion, the Delboeuf illusion, so that it resembled a type of stimulus commonly used in experiments investigating surround modulation. We then performed a small set of psychophysical experiments in order to determine if the classical Delboeuf illusion effect, i.e. a change in the perceived size of an object, could be observed in these altered stimuli. In four conditions, we created stimuli that either had a high or low frequency surround in addition to being presented with a proximal thin surround or a distal thick surround. We found a significant difference in perceived object size for all four conditions compared to control indicating the presence of an illusion, and we discuss these findings in relation to existing literature from electrophysiological animal studies.

Odor perception in non-humans is poorly understood. Here, we generated the most comprehensive murine olfactory ethological atlas to date, consisting of behavioral responses to a diverse panel of 73 odorants, including 12 at multiple concentrations. These data revealed that the mouse behavior is incredibly diverse, and changes in response to odor identity and intensity. Using only behavioral responses, ~30% of the 73 odorants could be identified with high accuracy (&gt;96%) by a trained classifier. Mouse behavior occupied a low-dimensional space, consistent with analyses of human olfactory perception. While mouse olfactory behavior is difficult to predict from the corresponding human olfactory percept, three fundamental properties are shared: odor valence is the primary axis of olfactory perception; the physicochemical properties of odorants can predict the olfactory percept; and odorant concentration quantitatively and qualitatively impacts olfactory perception. These results provide a template for future comparative studies of olfactory percepts among species.

The flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through perivascular spaces surrounding the vasculature is thought to be an important part of the brain's mechanism for clearing metabolic waste products, including those associated with disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Experiments that track tracer particles injected into the cisterna magna of mouse brains have shown evidence of pulsatile CSF flow in perivascular spaces around pial (surface) arteries, with a bulk (average) flow in the same direction as the blood flow. Although measurements are consistent with the idea that this flow is driven primarily by arterial pulsations, the driving mechanism is still not completely understood, and several published articles have suggested that the bulk flow might be an artifact, driven by the injection itself. Here we address this hypothesis with new in vivo experiments in which the injection of suspended tracer particles into the cisterna magna is done with a dual-syringe system, with simultaneous injection and withdrawal of equal amounts of fluid. This method produces no net increase in CSF volume and no significant increase in intracranial pressure, and yet particle-tracking reveals flows in the pial periarterial spaces that are completely consistent with the flows observed in earlier experiments with single-syringe injection.

Objective: Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (rt-fMRI-NF) is a non-invasive MRI procedure allowing examined participants to learn to self-regulate brain activity by performing mental tasks. A novel two-step rt-fMRI-NF procedure is proposed whereby the feedback display is updated in real-time based on high level (semantic) representations of experimental stimuli via real-time representational similarity analysis of multi-voxel patterns of brain activity. Approach: In a localizer session, the stimuli become associated with anchored points on a two-dimensional representational space where distances approximate between-pattern (dis)similarities. In the NF session, participants modulate their brain response, displayed as a movable point, to engage in a specific neural representation. The developed method pipeline is verified in a proof-of-concept rt-fMRI-NF study at 7 Tesla using imagery of concrete objects. The dependence on noise is more systematically assessed on artificial fMRI data with similar (simulated) spatio-temporal structure and variable (injected) signal and noise. A series of brain activity patterns from the ventral visual cortex is evaluated via on-line and off-line analyses and the performances of the method are reported under different noise conditions. Main results: The participant in the proof-of-concept study exhibited robust activation patterns in the localizer session and managed to control the neural representation of a stimulus towards the selected target, in the NF session. The offline analyses validated the rt-fMRI-NF results, showing that the rapid convergence to the target representation is noise-dependent. Significance: Our proof-of-concept study demonstrates the potential of semantic NF designs where the participant navigates among different mental states. Compared to traditional NF designs (e.g. using a thermometer display to set the level of the neural signal), the proposed approach provides content-specific feedback to the participant and extra degrees of freedom to the experimenter enabling real-time control of the neural activity towards a target brain state without suggesting a specific mental strategy to the subject.

The cellular protein quality control machinery is important for preventing protein misfolding and aggregation, and decline in protein homeostasis (proteostasis) is believed to play a crucial role in age-related neurodegenerative disorders. However, how proteostasis capacity of neurons changes in different diseases is not yet sufficiently understood, and progress in this area has been hampered by the lack of tools to monitor proteostasis in mammalian models. Here, we have developed reporter mice for in vivo analysis of neuronal proteostasis. The mice express EGFP-fused firefly luciferase (Fluc), a conformationally unstable protein that requires chaperones for proper folding and sensitively reacts to proteotoxic stress by formation of intracellular Fluc-EGFP foci and by reduced luciferase activity. Using these mice, we provide evidence for proteostasis decline in the aging brain. Moreover, we find a marked impairment in proteostasis in tauopathy mice, but not in Huntington's disease mice. Mechanistic investigations in primary neuronal cultures demonstrate that cytoplasmic, but not nuclear, aggregates cause defects of cellular protein quality control. Thus, the Fluc-EGFP reporter mice enable new insights into proteostasis alterations in different diseases.

Identification of the perivascular compartment as the point of exchange between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and interstitial fluid mediating solute clearance in the brain, named the glymphatic system, has emerged as an important clearance pathway for neurotoxic peptides such as amyloid-beta. However, the foundational science of the glymphatic system is based on rodent studies. Here we investigated whether the glymphatic system exists in a large mammal with a highly gyrified brain. CSF penetration into the brain via perivascular pathways, a hallmark of glymphatic function, was seen throughout the gyrencephalic cortex and subcortical structures, validating the conservation of the glymphatic system in a large mammal. Macroscopic CSF tracer distribution followed the sulci and fissures showing that the gyri enhance CSF dispersion. Three-dimensional renditions from light sheet microscopy showed that CSF influx through perivascular spaces was 4-fold more extensive in the pig brain than in mice. This demonstrates the existence of an advanced solute transport system in the gyrencephalic brain that could be utilised therapeutically for enhancing waste clearance.

For over 60 years, the masculinization hypothesis dominates our understanding of sex effects on the brain. According to this view, the male distribution for single brain measures and for the brain as a whole is shifted away from the female distribution. In the last decade this view has been challenged by evidence that sex effects on single brain features may be opposite under different conditions, resulting in brains comprised of unique mosaics of female-typical and male-typical features. Analysis of 289 MRI-derived measures of grey and white matter from 23935 brains revealed only three brain measures for which the masculinization hypothesis was not rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis that women and men sample from the same two phenotypes. Moreover, at the individual level, sampling was not consistent across brain measures, as some measures were likely sampled from the female-favored phenotype while others were likely sampled from the male-favored phenotype. Last, considering the relations between brain measures, the brain architecture of women and men was remarkably similar. These results do not support the masculinization hypothesis but are consistent with the mosaic hypothesis as well as with other lines of evidence showing that the brain architectures typical of women are also typical of men, and vice versa, and that sex category explains a very small part of the variability in human brain structure.

In this paper, we describe the results of a single subject study attempting at a better understanding of the subjective state during musical improvisation. In a first experiment, we setup an ecological paradigm measuring EEG on a musician in free improvised concerts with an audience, followed by retrospective rating of the mental state of the improviser. We introduce Subjective Temporal Resolution (STR), a retrospective rating assessing the instantaneous attention of the musician towards short or long musical events. We identified high and low STR states using Hidden Markov Models in two performances, and were able to decode those states using supervised learning on instantaneous EEG power spectrum, showing increases in theta and alpha power with high STR values. In a second experiment, we found an increase of theta and beta power when experimentally manipulating STR in a musical improvisation imagery experiment. These results are interpreted with respect to previous research on flow state in creativity, as well as with the temporal processing literature. We suggest that a component of the subjective state of musical improvisation may be reflected in an underlying mechanism responsible for modulating subjective temporal processing of musical events.

Hypothalamic arginine vasopressin (AVP)-containing magnocellular neurosecretory neurons (AVPMNN) emit collaterals to synaptically innervate limbic regions influencing learning, motivational behavior and fear responses. The purpose of the present work is to characterize the dynamics of expression changes of two postsynaptic density (PSD) proteins, AMPAR subunit GluA1 and PSD scaffolding protein 95 (PSD95), which are known to be key determinants for synaptic strength, in response to in vivo and ex vivo manipulations of AVPMNN neuronal activation state, or exposure to exogenous AVP, metabolites and some signaling pathway inhibitors. Both long term water deprivation in vivo, which powerfully upregulates AVPMNN activity, and exogenous APV application ex vivo in brain slices, increased GluA1 and PSD95 expression and enhanced neuronal excitability in ventral hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Involvement of PI3k signaling in AVP-dependent plasticity is suggested by blockade of both AVP-induced protein up-regulation and enhanced neuronal excitability by the PI3k blocker wortmannin in hippocampal slices. We interpret these results as part of vasopressin's central effects on synaptic organization in limbic regions modulating the strength of a specific set of synaptic proteins in hypothalamic-limbic circuits.

The cell type-specific molecular pathology of post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) in the hippocampus has not been thoroughly elucidated. We analyzed 27,069 cells by using single-cell RNA sequencing, and four oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) subtypes were identified, Vcan+ OPCs, which were determined to be the primary cluster among them. Additionally, we examined the features of endothelial cells (ECs) and found that Lcn2+ ECs might play neuroprotective roles via Vwf after stroke. These results may facilitate further studies attempting to identify new avenues of research and novel targets for PSCI treatment.

<p>by Elif Köksal Ersöz, Julien Modolo, Fabrice Bartolomei, Fabrice Wendling</p>

Epilepsy is a dynamic and complex neurological disease affecting about 1% of the worldwide population, among which 30% of the patients are drug-resistant. Epilepsy is characterized by recurrent episodes of paroxysmal neural discharges (the so-called seizures), which manifest themselves through a large-amplitude rhythmic activity observed in depth-EEG recordings, in particular in local field potentials (LFPs). The signature characterizing the transition to seizures involves complex oscillatory patterns, which could serve as a marker to prevent seizure initiation by triggering appropriate therapeutic neurostimulation methods. To investigate such protocols, neurophysiological lumped-parameter models at the mesoscopic scale, namely neural mass models, are powerful tools that not only mimic the LFP signals but also give insights on the neural mechanisms related to different stages of seizures. Here, we analyze the multiple time-scale dynamics of a neural mass model and explain the underlying structure of the complex oscillations observed before seizure initiation. We investigate population-specific effects of the stimulation and the dependence of stimulation parameters on synaptic timescales. In particular, we show that intermediate stimulation frequencies (&gt;20 Hz) can abort seizures if the timescale difference is pronounced. Those results have the potential in the design of therapeutic brain stimulation protocols based on the neurophysiological properties of tissue.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ikp9WQjg7DQ" width="1" />

<p>by Hai Yang, Qiang Wei, Dongdong Li, Zhe Wang</p>

Given the complexity and diversity of the cancer genomics profiles, it is challenging to identify distinct clusters from different cancer types. Numerous analyses have been conducted for this propose. Still, the methods they used always do not directly support the high-dimensional omics data across the whole genome (Such as ATAC-seq profiles). In this study, based on the deep adversarial learning, we present an end-to-end approach ClusterATAC to leverage high-dimensional features and explore the classification results. On the ATAC-seq dataset and RNA-seq dataset, ClusterATAC has achieved excellent performance. Since ATAC-seq data plays a crucial role in the study of the effects of non-coding regions on the molecular classification of cancers, we explore the clustering solution obtained by ClusterATAC on the pan-cancer ATAC dataset. In this solution, more than 70% of the clustering are single-tumor-type-dominant, and the vast majority of the remaining clusters are associated with similar tumor types. We explore the representative non-coding loci and their linked genes of each cluster and verify some results by the literature search. These results suggest that a large number of non-coding loci affect the development and progression of cancer through its linked genes, which can potentially advance cancer diagnosis and therapy.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tZDTEu1VwSY" width="1" />

<p>by Richard Wilton, Alexander S. Szalay</p>

In large DNA sequence repositories, archival data storage is often coupled with computers that provide 40 or more CPU threads and multiple GPU (general-purpose graphics processing unit) devices. This presents an opportunity for DNA sequence alignment software to exploit high-concurrency hardware to generate short-read alignments at high speed. Arioc, a GPU-accelerated short-read aligner, can compute WGS (whole-genome sequencing) alignments ten times faster than comparable CPU-only alignment software. When two or more GPUs are available, Arioc's speed increases proportionately because the software executes concurrently on each available GPU device. We have adapted Arioc to recent multi-GPU hardware architectures that support high-bandwidth peer-to-peer memory accesses among multiple GPUs. By modifying Arioc's implementation to exploit this GPU memory architecture we obtained a further 1.8x-2.9x increase in overall alignment speeds. With this additional acceleration, Arioc computes two million short-read alignments per second in a four-GPU system; it can align the reads from a human WGS sequencer run–over 500 million 150nt paired-end reads–in less than 15 minutes. As WGS data accumulates exponentially and high-concurrency computational resources become widespread, Arioc addresses a growing need for timely computation in the short-read data analysis toolchain.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GoN8bqwwA6Q" width="1" />

The tumor mutational burden (TMB) is increasingly recognized as an emerging biomarker that predicts improved outcomes or response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer. A multitude of technical and biological factors make it difficult to compare TMB values across platforms, histologies, and treatments. Here, we present a mechanistic model that explains the association between panel size, histology, and TMB threshold with panel performance and survival outcome and demonstrate the limitations of existing methods utilized to harmonize TMB across platforms.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SChzzr3NQOM" width="1" />

The cell is compartmentalised into complex micro-environments allowing an array of specialised biological processes to be carried out in synchrony. Determining a protein’s sub-cellular localisation to one or more of these compartments can therefore be a first step in determining its function. High-throughput and high-accuracy mass spectrometry-based sub-cellular proteomic methods can now shed light on the localisation of thousands of proteins at once. Machine learning algorithms are then typically employed to make protein-organelle assignments. However, these algorithms are limited by insufficient and incomplete annotation. We propose a semi-supervised Bayesian approach to novelty detection, allowing the discovery of additional, previously unannotated sub-cellular niches. Inference in our model is performed in a Bayesian framework, allowing us to quantify uncertainty in the allocation of proteins to new sub-cellular niches, as well as in the number of newly discovered compartments. We apply our approach across 10 mass spectrometry based spatial proteomic datasets, representing a diverse range of experimental protocols. Application of our approach to <i>hyper</i>LOPIT datasets validates its utility by recovering enrichment with chromatin-associated proteins without annotation and uncovers sub-nuclear compartmentalisation which was not identified in the original analysis. Moreover, using sub-cellular proteomics data from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, we uncover a novel group of proteins trafficking from the ER to the early Golgi apparatus. Overall, we demonstrate the potential for novelty detection to yield biologically relevant niches that are missed by current approaches.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/t8e8t0V_BtA" width="1" />

Although less common than the evolution of antimicrobial drug resistance, vaccine resistance can and has evolved. How likely is it that COVID-19 vaccines currently in development will be undermined by viral evolution? We argue that this can be determined by repurposing samples that are already being collected as part of clinical trials. Such information would be useful for prioritizing investment among candidate vaccines and maximizing the potential long-term impact of COVID-19 vaccines.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/hUFF69rQUeg" width="1" />

<p>by Rebekah C. Kading, Tigga Kingston</p>

Human perturbation of natural systems is accelerating the emergence of infectious diseases, mandating integration of disease and ecological research. Bats have been associated with recent zoonoses, but our bibliometric analysis of coauthor relationships identified a separation of bat ecologists and infectious disease researchers with few cross-disciplinary relationships. Of 5,645 papers, true interdisciplinary collaborations occurred primarily in research focused on White Nose Syndrome (WNS). This finding is important because it illustrates how research with outcomes favoring both bat conservation and disease mitigation promotes domain integration and network connectivity. We advocate for increased engagement between ecology and infectious researchers to address such common causes and suggest that efforts focus on leveraging existing activities, building interdisciplinary projects, and networking individuals and networks to integrate domains and coordinate resources. We provide specific opportunities for pursuing these strategies through the Bat One Health Research Network (BOHRN).<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/2Ti93dMGzO0" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to analyze longitudinal changes of retinal thickness and their predictive value as biomarkers of disease progression in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with Lewy body diseases were enrolled and prospectively evaluated at 3 years, including patients with iPD (n = 42), dementia with Lewy bodies (n = 4), E46K‐<i>SNCA</i> mutation carriers (n = 4), and controls (n = 17). All participants underwent Spectralis retinal optical coherence tomography and Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score was obtained in patients. Macular ganglion cell–inner plexiform layer complex (GCIPL) and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness reduction rates were estimated with linear mixed models. Risk ratios were calculated to evaluate the association between baseline GCIPL and pRNFL thicknesses and the risk of subsequent cognitive and motor worsening, using clinically meaningful cutoffs.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>GCIPL thickness in the parafoveal region (1‐ to 3‐mm ring) presented the largest reduction rate. The annualized atrophy rate was 0.63μm in iPD patients and 0.23μm in controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). iPD patients with lower parafoveal GCIPL and pRNFL thickness at baseline presented an increased risk of cognitive decline at 3 years (relative risk [RR] = 3.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.10–11.1, <i>p</i> = 0.03 and RR = 3.28, 95% CI = 1.03–10.45, <i>p</i> = 0.045, respectively). We did not identify significant associations between retinal thickness and motor deterioration.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results provide evidence of the potential use of optical coherence tomography–measured parafoveal GCIPL thickness to monitor neurodegeneration and to predict the risk of cognitive worsening over time in iPD. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>The central complex plays a key role in goal directed orientation of insects.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The central complex is a group of highly interconnected neuropils in the insect brain. It is involved in the control of spatial orientation, based on external compass cues and various internal needs. The functional and neurochemical organization of the central complex has been studied in detail in the desert locust <i>Schistocerca gregaria</i>. In addition to classical neurotransmitters, immunocytochemistry has provided evidence for a major contribution of neuropeptides to neural signaling within the central complex. To complement these data, we have identified all orcokinin‐immunoreactive neurons in the locust central complex and associated brain areas. About 50 bilateral pairs of neurons innervating all substructures of the central complex exhibit orcokinin immunoreactivity. Among these were about 20 columnar neurons, 33 bilateral pairs of tangential neurons of the central body, and seven pairs of tangential neurons of the protocerebral bridge. In silico transcript analysis suggests the presence of eight different orcokinin‐A type peptides in the desert locust. Double label experiments showed that all orcokinin‐immunostained tangential neurons of the lateral accessory lobe cluster were also immunoreactive for GABA and the GABA‐synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase. Two types of tangential neurons of the upper division of the central body were, furthermore, also labeled with an antiserum against Dip‐allatostatin I. No colocalization was found with serotonin immunostaining. The data provide additional insights into the neurochemical organization of the locust central complex and suggest that orcokinin‐peptides of the orcokinin‐A gene act as neuroactive substances at all stages of signal processing in this brain area.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The neural retina is organized along central‐peripheral, dorsal‐ventral, and laminar planes. Cellular density and distributions vary along the central‐peripheral and dorsal‐ventral axis in species including primates, mice, fish, and birds. Differential distribution of cell types within the retina is associated with sensitivity to different types of damage that underpin major retinal diseases, including macular degeneration and glaucoma. Normal variation in retinal distribution remains unreported for multiple cell types in widely used research models, including mouse. Here we map the distribution of all known OFF bipolar cell (BC) populations and horizontal cells. We report significant variation in the distribution of OFF BC populations and horizontal cells along the dorsal‐ventral and central‐peripheral axes of the retina. Distribution patterns are much more pronounced for some populations of OFF BC cells than others and may correspond to the cell type's specialized functions.</p>

<p>We demonstrate a deep learning framework which is inherently based in the
highly expressive language of relational logic, enabling to, among other
things, capture arbitrarily complex graph structures. We show how Graph Neural
Networks and similar models can be easily covered in the framework by
specifying the underlying propagation rules in the relational logic. The
declarative nature of the used language then allows to easily modify and extend
the propagation schemes into complex structures, such as the molecular rings
which we choose for a short demonstration in this paper.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03459">Complex Query Answering with Neural Link Predictors. (arXiv:2011.03459v1 [cs.LG])</a></h4>

<p>Neural link predictors are immensely useful for identifying missing edges in
large scale Knowledge Graphs. However, it is still not clear how to use these
models for answering more complex queries that arise in a number of domains,
such as queries using logical conjunctions, disjunctions, and existential
quantifiers, while accounting for missing edges. In this work, we propose a
framework for efficiently answering complex queries on incomplete Knowledge
Graphs. We translate each query into an end-to-end differentiable objective,
where the truth value of each atom is computed by a pre-trained neural link
predictor. We then analyse two solutions to the optimisation problem, including
gradient-based and combinatorial search. In our experiments, the proposed
approach produces more accurate results than state-of-the-art methods --
black-box neural models trained on millions of generated queries -- without the
need of training on a large and diverse set of complex queries. Using orders of
magnitude less training data, we obtain relative improvements ranging from 8%
up to 40% in Hits@3 across different knowledge graphs containing factual
information. Finally, we demonstrate that it is possible to explain the outcome
of our model in terms of the intermediate solutions identified for each of the
complex query atoms.

<p>Nature Communications, Published online: 09 November 2020; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19471-9">doi:10.1038/s41467-020-19471-9</a></p>Strong excitonic effects and spin-orbit coupling in all-inorganic halide perovskite is promising for spintronic application, yet the spin-dependent phenomenon is not well understood. Here, the authors reveal that many-body interactions between spin-polarized excitons act like pseudo-magnetic field, lifting the degeneracy and resulting in circular dichroism.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/GQX2tOswVO0" width="1" />

Background<p>To explore an expression profile in plasma exosomal miRNAs of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (mTLE + HS) patients and investigate the associated clinical significance and putative pathways involved.</p>Methods<p>Plasma exosomal miRNAs were measured in six mTLE + HS patients who were confirmed with pre-surgical stereo-electroencephalography and six without hippocampal sclerosis (mTLE−HS) using Illumina HiSeq 2500. Then six dysregulated miRNAs were chosen for validation in an independent sample of 18 mTLE + HS patients and 18 mTLE−HS controls using RT-qPCR. Receiver operating characteristic curve was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic value of miRNAs in HS. Bioinformatic analyses were conducted to reveal in which pathways these miRNAs were involved.</p>Results<p>We revealed that a total of 42 exosomal miRNAs were differentially expressed in mTLE + HS. Among them, 25 were increased and 17 decreased. After validation, hsa-miR-129-5p, -214-3p, -219a-5p, and -34c-5p were confirmed as being upregulated, while hsa-miR-421 and -184 were significantly downregulated in mTLE + HS. Moreover, hsa-miR-184 had the best diagnostic value for discriminating mTLE + HS with 88.9% sensitivity and 83.3% specificity. These six miRNAs regulated several genes from neurotrophin-, hippo-, p53-, TGF- beta-, HIF- 1-, mTOR-related pathways.</p>Conclusion<p>Six miRNAs were dysregulated in mTLE + HS patients and targeted several genes. This result might facilitate pathological mechanistic studies of miRNAs in HS and represent potential diagnostic biomarkers. These provided the rationale for further confirmation studies in larger cohorts of prospective patients.</p>

<p>In neuroscience, much attention is paid to intercellular interactions, in particular, to synapses. However, many researchers do not pay due attention to the contribution of intracellular contacts to the work of intercellular interactions. Nevertheless, along with synapses, intracellular contacts also have complex organization and a tremendous number of regulatory elements. Mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum contacts (MERCs) are a specific site of interaction between the two organelles; they provide a basis for a large number of cellular functions, such as calcium homeostasis, lipid metabolism, autophagy, and apoptosis. Despite the presence of these contacts in various parts of neurons and glial cells, it is yet not known whether they fulfill the same functions. There are still many unsolved questions about the work of these intracellular contacts, and one of the most important among them is if MERCs, with their broad implication into synaptic events, can be considered the assistant to neurotransmission?</p>

<p>We report a qualitative study on central nervous system (CNS) damage that demonstrates the ability of X-ray phase contrast tomography (XPCT) to confirm data obtained with standard 2D methodology and permits the description of additional features that are not detected with 2D or other 3D techniques. In contrast to magnetic resonance or computed tomography, XPCT makes possible the high-resolution 3D imaging of soft tissues classically considered “invisible” to X-rays without the use of additional contrast agents, or without the need for intense processing of the tissue required by 2D techniques. Most importantly for studies of CNS diseases, XPCT enables a concomitant multi-scale 3D biomedical imaging of neuronal and vascular networks ranging from cells through to the CNS as a whole. In the last years, we have used XPCT to investigate neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and multiple sclerosis (MS), to shed light on brain damage and extend the observations obtained with standard techniques. Here, we show the cutting-edge ability of XPCT to highlight in 3D, concomitantly, vascular occlusions and damages, close associations between plaques and damaged vessels, as well as dramatic changes induced at neuropathological level by treatment in AD mice. We corroborate data on the well-known blood-brain barrier dysfunction in the animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and further show its extent throughout the CNS axis and at the level of the single vessel/capillary.</p>

<p>The extensible neuroimaging archive toolkit (XNAT) is a common platform for storing and distributing neuroimaging data and is used by many key repositories of public neuroimaging data. Some examples include the Neuroimaging Informatics Tools and Resources Clearinghouse (NITRC, https://nitrc.org/), the ConnectomeDB for the Human Connectome Project (https://db.humanconnectome.org/), and XNAT Central (https://central.xnat.org/). We introduce Rxnat (https://github.com/adigherman/Rxnat), an open-source R package designed to interact with any XNAT-based repository. The program has similar capabilities with PyXNAT and XNATpy, which were developed for Python users. Rxnat was developed to address the increased popularity of R among neuroimaging researchers. The Rxnat package can query multiple XNAT repositories and download all or a specific subset of images for further processing. This provides a lingua franca for the large community of R analysts to interface with multiple XNAT-based publicly available neuroimaging repositories. The potential of Rxnat is illustrated using an example of neuroimaging data normalization from two neuroimaging repositories, NITRC and HCP.</p>

<p>Epilepsy is a serious hazard to human health. Minimally invasive surgery is currently an extremely effective treatment to refractory epilepsy. However, it is challenging to localize the lesion for most patients because they are MRI negative. The identification of epileptic foci in local brain region will be helpful to the localization of epileptic foci because we can infer whether there is a lesion from the results of the classification. For the sake of simplicity and the data we collected, only the hippocampus was segmented as a local brain region and classified in this paper. We recruited 59 children with hippocampus epilepsy and 70 age- and sex-matched normal controls, and diffusion kurtosis images (DKI) for all subjects were collected because DKI can understand the pathological changes of local tissues and other regions of epileptic foci at the molecular level. Then, a mask of hippocampus was made to segment the hippocampus of FA, MD, and MK images for all subjects, which are the parameter images of DKI and were used to perform the independent-sample t-test and the classification task. At last, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on transfer learning technique was developed to extract features of FA, MD, MK, and the fusion of FA and MK, and support vector machine was employed to classify epilepsy and normal control. Finally, the classifier produced 90.8% accuracy for patient vs. normal controls. Experimental results showed that the features extraction based on CNN is very effective, and the high accuracy of classification means that FA and MK are two remarkable features to identify epilepsy, which indicates that DKI images can act as an important biomarker for epilepsy from the point of view of clinical diagnosis.</p>

<p>Objectives: To study whether and to what extent the therapeutic impedance and current change under long-term deep brain stimulation (DBS) with constant stimulation settings, which could inform the role of constant current stimulation.</p><p>Methods: Therapy impedance and current measurements were retrospectively collected from patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) undergoing DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or essential tremor (ET) undergoing ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM). Baseline and follow-up measurements were obtained for intervals of at least 6 months without changes in stimulation settings. The single longest interval of constant stimulation for each electrode was included. Temporal trends in impedance and current were analyzed as absolute and relative differences and as the rate of change.</p><p>Results: Impedance and current data from 79 electrodes (60 in STN, 19 in VIM) in 44 patients (32 with PD, 12 with ET) met inclusion criteria. The duration between baseline and follow-up measurements with constant stimulation settings was 17 months (median, with an interquartile range of 12–26 months) in the mixed group. Therapy impedance decreased by 27 ± 12 Ω/year (mean ± 2 standard errors; p &lt; 0.0001), and therapy current increased at a rate of 0.142 ± 0.063 mA/year (p &lt; 0.0001). Similar results were observed in the STN and VIM subgroups.</p><p>Conclusions: Impedance decreases gradually over time, even when stimulation settings are kept constant. The rate of decrease is smaller than previously reported, suggesting that changes in stimulation settings contribute to impedance drift. Stimulation-independent impedance drift is gradual but relevant to constant-current programming.</p>

<p>Introduction:Typing on a keyboard requires complex collaboration between visuospatial/procedural memory, language, and motor function. The impaired ability to type, independent of motor deficits, apraxia, or aphasia has been coined “dystypia.”</p><p>Case Presentation: A 68-year-old woman with a history of blepharospasm, oromandibular, and segmental dystonia underwent bilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation (DBS) because of a waning response to botulinum toxin therapy. Following DBS, she discovered she no longer “remembered” how to type fluidly and had to “hunt and peck” for letters on the keyboard. This issue persisted at a 2-year follow-up. The patient underwent serial typing tests with the DBS ON vs. OFF. Post-operative lead reconstruction was performed using Lead-DBS. The volume of tissue activation (VTA) modeling was combined with whole-brain tractography.</p><p>Results: Typing improved when the device was switched to the DBS OFF state. Cortical mapping revealed strong modulation of the right angular gyrus, left calcarine fissure, and left cuneus. There was also activation of bilateral supplemental motor areas and superior parietal gyri.</p><p>Discussion: Shared lesion topography analysis of dystypia cases in the literature has suggested the involvement of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). The SLF involves the superior parietal lobe, angular gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, and arcuate fasciculus. Our patient’s connectivity pattern suggested SLF involvement. The improvement in OFF state typing and her imaging together suggested that the dystypia in her case was a stimulation-induced side effect.</p><p>Conclusion: Dystypia is a rare side effect of Globus Pallidus Internus (GPi) DBS therapy and may be associated with SLF involvement.</p>

<p>Several studies have implied gender differences in startle reaction to emotional facial expressions. However, few studies have been designed to investigate the difference between responding to emotional female vs. male faces, nor gender differences in responses. The present experiment investigated startle EMG responses to a startle probe while viewing pictures of neutral, happy, angry, fearful, and sad facial expressions presented by female and male models. Participants were divided into female and male groups. Results showed that emotional facial expressions interact with model gender to produce startle potentiation to a probe: greater responses were found while viewing angry expressions by male models, and while viewing happy faces by female models. There were no differences in responses between male and female participants. We argue that these findings underline theimportance of controlling for model gender in research using facial expressions as stimuli.</p>

<p>Whether brain function is altered in patients with dry eye disease (DED) remains unclear. Twenty patients with DED and 23 healthy controls (HCs) were scanned using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) and support vector machine (SVM) were used to analyze the imaging data. Relative to the HCs, the patients with DED showed significantly increased ReHo values in the left inferior occipital gyrus (IOG), left superior temporal gyrus, and right superior medial prefrontal cortex, and significantly decreased ReHo values in the right superior frontal gyrus/middle frontal gyrus and bilateral middle cingulum (MC). SVM results indicated that the combination of ReHo values in the left MC and the left IOG in distinguishing patients with DED from HCs had a sensitivity of 95.00%, a specificity of 91.30%, and an accuracy of 93.02%. The present study found that the patients with DED had abnormal ReHo values in the limbic-cortical circuits. A combination of ReHo values in the left MC and the left IOG could be applied as a potential imaging biomarker to distinguish patients with DED from HCs. The dysfunction of limbic-cortical circuits may play an important role in the pathophysiology of DED.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.569519">Streptococcal Infection as a Major Historical Cause of Stuttering: Data, Mechanisms, and Current Importance</a></h4>

<p>Stuttering is one of the most well-known speech disorders, but the underlying neurological mechanisms are debated. In addition to genetic factors, there are also major non-genetic contributions. It is here proposed that infection with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GAS) was a major underlying cause of stuttering until the mid-1900s when penicillin was introduced in 1943. The main mechanism proposed is an autoimmune reaction from tonsillitis, targeting specific molecules, for example within the basal ganglia. It is here also proposed that GAS infections may have continued to cause stuttering to some extent, to the present date, though more rarely. If so, early diagnosis of such cases would be of importance. Childhood cases with sudden onset of stuttering after throat infection may be particularly important to assess for possible GAS infection. The support for this hypothesis primarily comes from three lines of argument. First, medical record data from the 1930s strongly indicates that there was one type of medical event in particular that preceded the onset of childhood stuttering with unexpected frequency: diseases related to GAS throat infections. In particular, this included tonsillitis and scarlet fever, but also rheumatic fever. Rheumatic fever is a childhood autoimmune sequela of GAS infection, which was a relatively widespread medical problem until the early 1960s. Second, available reports of changes of the childhood prevalence of stuttering indicate striking parallels between stuttering and the incidence of rheumatic fever, with: (1) decline from the early 1900s; (2) marked decline from the introduction of penicillin in the mid 1940s; and (3) reaching a more stable level in the 1960s. The correlations between the data for stuttering and rheumatic fever after the introduction of penicillin are very high, at about 0.95. Third, there are established biological mechanisms linking GAS tonsillitis to immunological effects on the brain. Also, a small number of more recent case reports have provided further support for the hypothesis linking stuttering to GAS infection. Overall, it is proposed that the available data provides strong evidence for the hypothesis that GAS infection was a major cause of stuttering until the mid-1900s, interacting with genetic predisposition.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.564969">Neural Signatures of Handgrip Fatigue in Type 1 Diabetic Men and Women</a></h4>

<p>Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is associated with reduced muscular strength and greater muscle fatigability. Along with changes in muscular mechanisms, T1D is also linked to structural changes in the brain. How the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying muscle fatigue is altered with T1D and sex related differences of these mechanisms are still not well investigated. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of T1D on the neural correlates of handgrip fatigue and examine sex and T1D related differences in neuromuscular performance parameters, neural activation and functional connectivity patterns between the motor regions of the brain. Forty-two adults, balanced by condition (healthy vs T1D) and sex (male vs female), and performed submaximal isometric handgrip contractions until voluntary exhaustion. Initial strength, endurance time, strength loss, force variability, and complexity measures were collected. Additionally, hemodynamic responses from motor-function related cortical regions, using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), were obtained. Overall, females exhibited lower initial strength (p &lt; 0.0001), and greater strength loss (p = 0.023) than males. While initial strength was significantly lower in the T1D group (p = 0.012) compared to the healthy group, endurance times and strength loss were comparable between the two groups. Force complexity, measured as approximate entropy, was found to be lower throughout the experiment for the T1D group (p = 0.0378), indicating lower online motor adaptability. Although, T1D and healthy groups fatigued similarly, only the T1D group exhibited increased neural activation in the left (p = 0.095) and right (p = 0.072) supplementary motor areas (SMA) over time. A sex × condition × fatigue interaction effect (p = 0.044) showed that while increased activation was observed in both T1D females and healthy males from the Early to Middle phase, this was not observed in healthy females or T1D males. These findings demonstrate that T1D adults had lower adaptability to fatigue which they compensated for by increasing neural effort. This study highlights the importance of examining both neural and motor performance signatures when investigating the impact of chronic conditions on neuromuscular fatigue. Additionally, the findings have implications for developing intervention strategies for training, rehabilitation, and ergonomics considerations for individuals with chronic conditions.</p>

<p>The diversity and dense interconnectivity of cells in the nervous system present a huge challenge to understanding how brains work. Recent progress toward such understanding, however, has been fuelled by the development of techniques for selectively monitoring and manipulating the function of distinct cell types—and even individual neurons—in the brains of living animals. These sophisticated techniques are fundamentally genetic and have found their greatest application in genetic model organisms, such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila combines genetic tractability with a compact, but cell-type rich, nervous system and has been the incubator for a variety of methods of neuronal targeting. One such method, called Split Gal4, is playing an increasingly important role in mapping neural circuits in the fly. In conjunction with functional perturbations and behavioral screens, Split Gal4 has been used to characterize circuits governing such activities as grooming, aggression, and mating. It has also been leveraged to comprehensively map and functionally characterize cells composing important brain regions, such as the central complex, lateral horn, and the mushroom body—the latter being the insect seat of learning and memory. With connectomics data emerging for both the larval and adult brains of Drosophila, Split Gal4 is also poised to play an important role in characterizing neurons of interest based on their connectivity. We summarize the history and current state of the Split Gal4 method and indicate promising areas for further development or future application.</p>

<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is behaviorally defined and diagnosed by delayed and/or impeded language, stereotyped repetitive behaviors, and difficulties with social interactions. Additionally, there are disruptions in motor processing, which includes the intent to execute movements, interrupted/inhibited action chain sequences, impaired execution of speech, and repetitive motor behaviors. Cortical loops through basal ganglia (BG) structures are known to play critical roles in the typical functioning of these actions. Specifically, corticostriate projections to the dorsal striatum (caudate and putamen) convey abundant input from motor, cognitive and limbic cortices and subsequently project to other BG structures. Excitatory dopamine (DA) type 1 receptors are predominantly expressed on GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the dorsal striatum as part of the “direct pathway” to GPi and SNpr whereas inhibitory DA type 2 receptors are predominantly expressed on MSNs that primarily project to GPe. This study aimed to better understand how this circuitry may be altered in ASD, especially concerning the neurochemical modulation of GABAergic MSNs within the two major BG pathways. We utilized two classical methods to analyze the postmortem BG in ASD in comparison to neurotypical cases: ligand binding autoradiography to quantify densities of GABA-A, GABA-B, 5-HT<sub>2</sub>, and DA type 1 and 2 receptors and in situ hybridization histochemistry (ISHH) to quantify mRNA for D1, D2 receptors and three key GABAergic subunits (α1, β2, and γ2), as well as the GABA synthesizing enzymes (GAD65/67). Results demonstrated significant increases in D2 mRNA within MSNs in both the caudate and putamen, which was further verified by proenkephalin mRNA that is co-expressed with the D2 receptor in the indirect pathway MSNs. In contrast, all other GABAergic, serotonergic and dopaminergic markers in the dorsal striatum had comparable labeling densities. These results indicate alterations in the indirect pathway of the BG, with possible implications for the execution of competing motor programs and E/I imbalance in the direct/indirect motor feedback pathways through thalamic and motor cortical areas. Results also provide insights regarding the efficacy of FDA-approved drugs used to treat individuals with ASD acting on specific DA and 5-HT receptor subtypes.</p>

<p>Golgi-Cox staining has been used extensively in neuroscience. Despite its unique ability to identify neuronal interconnections and neural processes, its lack of consistency and time-consuming nature reduces its appeal to researchers. Here, using a spared nerve injury (SNI) mouse model and control mice, we present a modified Golgi-Cox staining protocol that can stain mouse hippocampal neurons within 8 days. In this improved procedure, the mouse brain was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then stored in a modified Golgi-Cox solution at 37 ± 2°C. The impregnation period was reduced from 5–14 days to 36–48 h. Brain slices prepared in this way could be preserved long-term at –80°C for up to 8 weeks. In addition to minimizing frequently encountered problems and reducing the time required to conduct the method, our modified protocol maintained, and even improved, the quality of traditional Golgi-Cox staining as applied to hippocampal neuronal morphology in SNI mice.</p>

<p>Immunofluorescence staining is the most frequently applied technique to detect and visualize various molecules in biological samples. Many protocols can be found in the literature and the websites of commercial antibody producers. This can result in a time-consuming and costly methodical work to establish “simple” antibody staining. We here summarize in a stepwise manner an easy-to-follow immunofluorescence staining protocol with an improved specific fluorescent signal and a reduced background and non-specific binding signal. This will help scientists to save time, effort, and antibody costs during the application of such a valuable technique.</p>

<p>In the absence of an effective treatment to alter the progressive course of cognitive decline and dementia, identification of modifiable risk factors that could promote healthy cognitive aging has become a public health research priority. This study seeks to comprehensively determine the contemporaneous associations of a broad spectrum of time-varying modifiable lifestyle factors with age-related cognitive decline in a large population-based cohort of older adults. A total of 5,711 subjects aged 50 and older from the WHO Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) in Shanghai were studied. Repeated measures of lifestyle factors and cognitive performance were conducted in 2009–2010 and 2014–2015. Linear random slope models were used to evaluate the contemporaneous associations between time-varying lifestyle factors and cognitive performance. Person-mean centering method was used to disaggregate the between- and within-person effects in the time-varying lifestyle factors in the random slope models. We found that higher vegetable and fruit consumption, as well as higher level of physical activity were positively associated with all cognitive domains. Body mass index (BMI) was negatively associated with all cognitive domains, whereas waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was negatively associated with verbal fluency score only. Sedentary time was negatively associated with digit span score but positively associated with verbal fluency score. The between-person effects seem to be more dominant than within-person effects. Overall, our findings suggest better management of multiple lifestyle factors may protect against cognitive decline in later life. Higher vegetable and fruit consumption and physical activity are protective, whereas obesity is detrimental to cognitive decline in older adults. This study underpins the development of multi-domain lifestyle recommendations to promote healthy cognitive aging.</p>

<p>Introduction: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) might not only be circumscribed to the motor system but also involves other neuronal systems including sensory abnormalities. In line with this notion, we aimed to assess the pathophysiology of sensory disturbances in the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse model of ALS, focusing on the satellite glial cells (SGCs) at the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) as a new potential target of the disease.</p><p>Material and Methods: The presence of sensory disturbances was evaluated using von Frey, hot plate, and hot water tail immersion tests at 75 days old, which represented the motor-pre-symptomatic stage. Cell biology analysis was performed at 75 and 95 days old and included conventional histology, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy of sensory neuron-SGC unit dissociates as a well as western blotting from DRG lysates.</p><p>Results: At 75 days old, von Frey and hot plate tests demonstrated clear thermoalgesic disturbances in ALS transgenic mice. Histological studies of the SN-SGC units revealed abnormal SOD1 accumulation, which was associated with nitro-oxidative stress and biogenesis of lipid droplets in SGCs. Interestingly, these alterations led to a progressive lysosomal storage disorder and occasionally vacuolar degeneration in SGCs.</p><p>Conclusions: SGCs emerge as a primary pathophysiological target in the SOD1 transgenic murine model of ALS, clearly reinforcing the pathogenic role of glial cells in motor neuron disease. Presymptomatic alterations of SGCs, might not only be responsible of sensory disturbances in ALS, but due to spinal cord sensory-motor circuits could also contribute to anterior horn motor disturbances.</p>

Background<p>Sensory peripheral neuropathy (PN) is associated with gait, balance problems and high fall risk. The walk2Wellness trial investigates effects of long-term, home-based daily use of a wearable sensory prosthesis on gait function, balance, quality of life and fall rates in PN patients. The device (Walkasins<sup>®</sup>, RxFunction Inc., MN, United States) partially substitutes lost nerve function related to plantar sensation providing directional tactile cues reflecting plantar pressure measurements during standing and walking. We tested the null hypothesis that the Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) score would remain unchanged after 10 weeks of use.</p>Methods<p>Participants had PN with lost plantar sensation, gait and balance problems, an FGA score &lt; 23 (high fall risk), and ability to sense tactile stimuli above the ankle. Clinical outcomes included FGA, Gait Speed, Timed Up&amp;Go (TUG) and 4-Stage Balance Test. Patient-reported outcomes included Activities-Specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale, Vestibular Disorders Activities of Daily Living Scale, PROMIS participation and satisfaction scores, pain rating, and falls. Evaluations were performed at baseline and after 2, 6, and 10 weeks. Subjects were not made aware of changes in outcomes. No additional balance interventions were allowed.</p>Results<p>Forty-five participants of 52 enrolled across four sites completed in-clinic assessments. FGA scores improved from 15.0 to 19.1 (p &lt; 0.0001), normal and fast gait speed from 0.86 m/s to 0.95 m/s (p &lt; 0.0001) and 1.24 m/s to 1.33 m/s (p = 0.002), respectively, and TUG from 13.8 s to 12.5 s (p = 0.012). Four-Stage Balance Test did not improve. Several patient-reported outcomes were normal at baseline and remained largely unchanged. Interestingly, subjects with baseline ABC scores lower than 67% (high fall risk cut-off) increased their ABC scores (49.9% to 59.3%, p = 0.01), whereas subjects with ABC scores above 67% showed a decrease (76.6% to 71.8%, p = 0.019). Subjects who reported falls in the prior 6 months (n = 25) showed a decrease in the number of fall-risk factors (5.1 to 4.3, p = 0.023) and a decrease in fall rate (13.8 to 7.4 falls/1000 days, p = 0.014). Four pre-study non-fallers (n = 20) fell during the 10 weeks.</p>Conclusion<p>A wearable sensory prosthesis presents a new way to treat gait and balance problems and manage falls in high fall-risk patients with PN.</p>Trial registration<p>ClinicalTrials.gov (#NCT03538756).</p>

Respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 has placed focus on the lung. Here, we present single-nucleus accessible chromatin profiles of 90,980 nuclei and matched single-nucleus transcriptomes of 46,500 nuclei in non-diseased lung from donors of ~30 weeks gestation, ~3 years and ~30 years. We mapped candidate <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements (cCREs) and linked them to putative target genes. We identified distal cCREs with age-increased activity linked to SARS-CoV-2 host entry gene <i>TMPRSS2</i> in alveolar type 2 cells which had immune regulatory signatures and harbored variants associated with respiratory traits. At the 3p21.31 COVID-19 risk locus, a candidate variant overlapped a distal cCRE linked to <i>SLC6A20</i>, a gene expressed in alveolar cells and with known functional association with the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. Our findings provide insight into regulatory logic underlying genes implicated in COVID-19 in individual lung cell types across age. More broadly, these datasets will facilitate interpretation of risk loci for lung diseases.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62506">Distinct insulin granule subpopulations implicated in the secretory pathology of diabetes types 1 and 2</a></h4>

Insulin secretion from β-cells is reduced at the onset of type-1 and during type-2 diabetes. Although inflammation and metabolic dysfunction of β-cells elicit secretory defects associated with type-1 or type-2 diabetes, accompanying changes to insulin granules have not been established. To address this, we performed detailed functional analyses of insulin granules purified from cells subjected to model treatments that mimic type-1 and type-2 diabetic conditions and discovered striking shifts in calcium affinities and fusion characteristics. We show that this behavior is correlated with two subpopulations of insulin granules whose relative abundance is differentially shifted depending on diabetic model condition. The two types of granules have different release characteristics, distinct lipid and protein compositions, and package different secretory contents alongside insulin. This complexity of β-cell secretory physiology establishes a direct link between granule subpopulation and type of diabetes and leads to a revised model of secretory changes in the diabetogenic process.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62039">New capsaicin analogs as molecular rulers to define the permissive conformation of the mouse TRPV1 ligand-binding pocket</a></h4>

The capsaicin receptor TRPV1 is an outstanding representative of ligand-gated ion channels in ligand selectivity and sensitivity. However, molecular interactions that stabilize the ligand-binding pocket in its permissive conformation, and how many permissive conformations the ligand-binding pocket may adopt, remain unclear. To answer these questions, we designed a pair of novel capsaicin analogs to increase or decrease the ligand size by about 1.5 Å without altering ligand chemistry. Together with capsaicin, these ligands form a set of molecular rulers for investigating ligand-induced conformational changes. Computational modeling and functional tests revealed that structurally these ligands alternate between drastically different binding poses but stabilize the ligand-binding pocket in nearly identical permissive conformations; functionally they all yielded a stable open state despite varying potencies. Our study suggests the existence of an optimal ligand-binding pocket conformation for capsaicin-mediated TRPV1 activation gating, and reveals multiple ligand-channel interactions that stabilize this permissive conformation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61390">ACE2: Evidence of role as entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and implications in comorbidities</a></h4>

Pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus 19 disease (COVID-19) which presents a large spectrum of manifestations with fatal outcomes in vulnerable people over 70-years-old and with hypertension, diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, COPD, and smoking status. Knowledge of the entry receptor is key to understand SARS-CoV-2 tropism, transmission and pathogenesis. Early evidence pointed to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor. Here, we provide a critical summary of the current knowledge highlighting the limitations and remaining gaps that need to be addressed to fully characterize ACE2 function in SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated pathogenesis. We also discuss ACE2 expression and potential role in the context of comorbidities associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes. Finally, we discuss the potential co-receptors/attachment factors such as neuropilins, heparan sulfate and sialic acids and the putative alternative receptors, such as CD147 and GRP78.

Mutations in the polycystin proteins, PC-1 and PC-2, result in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and ultimately renal failure. PC-1 and PC-2 enrich on primary cilia, where they are thought to form a heteromeric ion channel complex. However, a functional understanding of the putative PC-1/PC-2 polycystin complex is lacking due to technical hurdles in reliably measuring its activity. Here, we successfully reconstitute the PC-1/PC-2 complex in the plasma membrane of mammalian cells and show that it functions as an outwardly rectifying channel. Using both reconstituted and ciliary polycystin channels, we further show that a soluble fragment generated from the N-terminal extracellular domain of PC-1 functions as an intrinsic agonist that is necessary and sufficient for channel activation. We thus propose that autoproteolytic cleavage of the N-terminus of PC-1, a hotspot for ADPKD mutations, produces a soluble ligand <i>in vivo. </i>These findings establish a mechanistic framework for understanding the role of PC-1/PC-2 heteromers in ADPKD and suggest new therapeutic strategies that would expand upon the limited symptomatic treatments currently available for this progressive, terminal disease.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59980">Integration of genomics and transcriptomics predicts diabetic retinopathy susceptibility genes</a></h4>

We determined differential gene expression in response to high glucose in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from matched individuals with type 1 diabetes with and without retinopathy. Those genes exhibiting the largest difference in glucose response were assessed for association to diabetic retinopathy in a genome-wide association study meta-analysis. Expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTLs) of the glucose response genes were tested for association with diabetic retinopathy. We detected an enrichment of the eQTLs from the glucose response genes among small association p-values and identified <i>FLCN</i> as a susceptibility gene for diabetic retinopathy. Expression of <i>FLCN </i>in response to glucose was greater in individuals with diabetic retinopathy. Independent cohorts of individuals with diabetes revealed an association of <i>FLCN</i> eQTLs to diabetic retinopathy. Mendelian randomization confirmed a direct positive effect of increased <i>FLCN</i> expression on retinopathy. Integrating genetic association with gene expression implicated <i>FLCN </i>as a disease gene for diabetic retinopathy.

Visually guided behavior relies on the integration of sensory input with information held in working memory. Yet it remains unclear how this is accomplished at the level of neural circuits. We studied the direct visual cortical inputs to neurons within a visuomotor area of prefrontal cortex in behaving monkeys. We show that the synaptic efficacy of visual cortical input to prefrontal cortex is gated by information held in working memory. Surprisingly, visual input to prefrontal neurons was found to target those with both visual and motor properties, rather than preferentially targeting other visual neurons. Furthermore, activity evoked from visual cortex was larger in magnitude, more synchronous, and more rapid, when monkeys remembered locations that matched the location of visual input. These results indicate that working memory directly influences the circuitry that transforms visual input into visually guided behavior.

Oligodendrocytes form myelin for central nervous system axons and release factors which signal to neurons during myelination. Here, we ask how oligodendroglial factors influence hippocampal GABAergic neuron physiology. In mixed hippocampal cultures GABAergic neurons fired action potentials of short duration and received high frequencies of excitatory synaptic events. In purified neuronal cultures without glial cells, GABAergic neuron excitability increased and the frequency of synaptic events decreased. These effects were largely reversed by adding oligodendrocyte conditioned medium. We compared the transcriptomic signature with the electrophysiological phenotype of single neurons in these three culture conditions. Genes expressed by single pyramidal or GABAergic neurons largely conformed to expected cell-type specific patterns. Multiple genes of GABAergic neurons were significantly downregulated by the transition from mixed cultures containing glial cells to purified neuronal cultures. Levels of these genes were restored by the addition of oligodendrocyte conditioned medium to purified cultures. Clustering genes with similar changes in expression between different culture conditions revealed processes affected by oligodendroglial factors. Enriched genes are linked to roles in synapse assembly, action potential generation and transmembrane ion transport, including of zinc. These results provide new insight into the molecular targets by which oligodendrocytes influence neuron excitability and synaptic function.

Memory formation and reinstatement are thought to lock to the hippocampal theta rhythm, predicting that encoding and retrieval processes appear rhythmic themselves. Here, we show that rhythmicity can be observed in behavioral responses from memory tasks, where participants indicate, using button presses, the timing of encoding or retrieval of cue-object associative memories. We found no evidence for rhythmicity in button presses for visual tasks using the same stimuli, or for questions about already retrieved objects. The oscillations for correctly remembered trials center in the slow theta frequency range (1-5 Hz), while responses from later forgotten trials do not lock to the behavioral oscillation. Using intracranial EEG recordings, we show that the memory task induces temporally extended phase consistency in hippocampal local field potentials at slow theta frequencies, but only for correctly remembered trials, providing a mechanistic underpinning for the theta oscillations found in behavioral responses.

Study objective. Previous neuroimaging studies have highlighted differences in white matter microstructure among individuals with different chronotypes, but it is unclear whether those differences are due to genetic or environmental factors. Methods. Here we leverage summary statistics from recent large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of chronotype and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures to examine the genetic overlap and infer causal relationships between these traits. Results. We identified 29 significant pairwise genetic correlations, of which 13 also had evidence for a causal association. Negative genetic correlations were identified between chronotype and brain-wide mean, axial and radial diffusivities. When exploring individual tracts, ten negative genetic correlations were observed with mean diffusivities, 10 with axial diffusivities, 4 with radial diffusivities and 2 with mode of anisotropy. We found evidence for a possible causal association of chronotype with white matter microstructure in individual tracts including the posterior limb and retrolenticular part of the internal capsule; the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum and the posterior, superior and anterior regions of the corona radiata. Conclusions. Our results suggest that eveningness is associated with variation in tract-specific white matter microstructure and, for an evening person, increases in axial and / or radial diffusivities may influence a higher mean diffusivity. These findings add to our understanding of circadian preference and its relationship with the brain, providing new perspectives on the genetic neurological underpinnings of chronotype's role in health and disease.

Lower function of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) has a strong relationship with the development of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in humans. One characteristic of ASD is the repetitive and restrictive behavior, which may form the basis for better memory and savant skills in some people with ASD. This characteristic in ASD may reflect a tendency towards an exploitation strategy rather than an exploration strategy during learning. Using a rat model, we developed a touchscreen-based task for testing 5-HTT knockout effects on stimulus category learning. By analyzing the data with a reinforcement learning drift diffusion model, we find that 5-HTT knockout rats show a lower learning rate and apply more of an exploitation versus exploration strategy compared to WT rats during category learning. The decision bound of decision-making during stimulus generalization indicates that more 5-HTT knockout rats than WT rats exploit irrelevant information to categorize stimuli. The touchscreen-based task we developed greatly increases the translational value from animals to humans and helps to understand the behavioral mechanisms underlying repetitive behavior in ASD.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>With global increases in the aging population, the number of patients with dementia is greatly increasing, which has become a big social problem. Many studies have shown strong associations between oral disorders and systemic disorders, such as diabetes, arthritis, sepsis, aspiration pneumonia, arteriosclerosis, bacterial endocarditis, and other cardiovascular diseases. Similarly, numerous cross‐sectional studies showed that patients with dementia usually have poor oral conditions and tooth loss. These have long been considered as a result of difficulty with oral care due to impaired cognitive function, memory, and physical ability in patients with dementia. Indeed, even in patients with mild cognitive impairment, oral care becomes insufficient owing to decreases in spontaneity of grooming and finger dexterity. However, recent studies have shown that tooth loss and occlusal dysfunction may affect brain function and trigger the onset of dementia found in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease. In this review, we highlight the relationships among aging, oral dysfunction, and the development of dementia. Increasing evidence suggests that oral dysfunction is not only a result of dementia in the elderly people, but could also be a causative factor for the onset of dementia.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25948?af=R">Socioeconomic Status Mediates Racial Differences Seen Using the AT(N) Framework</a></h4>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>African Americans are at greater risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia than non‐Hispanic whites. In addition to biological considerations (eg, genetic influences and comorbid disorders), social and environmental factors may increase the risk of AD dementia. This paper (1) assesses neuroimaging biomarkers of amyloid (A), tau (T), and neurodegeneration (N) for potential racial differences and (2) considers mediating effects of socioeconomic status (SES) and measures of small vessel and cardiovascular disease on observed race differences.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Imaging measures of AT(N) (amyloid and tau positron emission tomography [PET]) structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and resting state functional connectivity (rs‐fc) were collected from African American (n = 131) and white (n = 685) cognitively normal participants age 45 years and older. Measures of small vessel and cardiovascular disease (white matter hyperintensities [WMHs] on MRI, blood pressure, and body mass index [BMI]) and area‐based SES were included in mediation analyses.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared to white participants, African American participants had greater neurodegeneration, as measured by decreased cortical volumes (Cohen's <i>f</i>
<sup>
   <i>2</i>
</sup> = 0.05, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). SES mediated the relationship between race and cortical volumes. There were no significant race effects for amyloid, tau, or rs‐fc signature.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Modifiable factors, such as differences in social contexts and resources, particularly area‐level SES, may contribute to observed racial differences in AD. Future studies should emphasize collection of relevant psychosocial factors in addition to the development of intentional diversity and inclusion efforts to improve the racial/ethnic and socioeconomic representativeness of AD studies.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine whether a low residual quantity of dystrophin protein is associated with delayed clinical milestones in patients with <i>DMD</i> mutations.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a retrospective multicentric cohort study by using molecular and clinical data from patients with <i>DMD</i> mutations registered in the UMD‐DMD‐France database. Patients with intronic, splice site, or nonsense <i>DMD</i> mutations, with available muscle biopsy western blot data, were included irrespective of whether they presented with severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) or milder Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). Patients were separated into three groups based on dystrophin protein levels. Clinical outcomes were ages at appearance of first symptoms; loss of ambulation; fall in vital capacity and left ventricular ejection fraction; interventions such as spinal fusion, tracheostomy, and noninvasive ventilation; and death.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 3880 patients with <i>DMD</i> mutations, 90 with mutations of interest were included. 42 patients expressed no dystrophin (group A), and 31/42 (74%) developed DMD. 34 patients had dystrophin quantities &lt;5<i>%</i> (group B), and 21/34 (61%) developed BMD. 14 patients had dystrophin quantities ≥5% (group C), and all but 4 who lost ambulation beyond 24 years of age were ambulant. Dystrophin quantities &lt;5%, as low as &lt;0.5%, were associated with milder phenotype for most of the evaluated clinical outcomes, including age at loss of ambulation (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Very low residual dystrophin protein quantity can cause a shift in disease phenotype from DMD towards BMD.</p>

<p>Advances in genetic discoveries have created substantial opportunities for precision medicine in neurodevelopmental disorders. Many of the genes implicated in these diseases encode proteins that regulate gene expression, such as chromatin associated proteins, transcription factors, and RNA‐binding proteins. The identification of targeted therapeutics for individuals carrying mutations in these genes remains a challenge, as the encoded proteins can theoretically regulate thousands of downstream targets in a considerable number of cell types. Here, we propose the application of a drug discovery approach originally developed for cancer called “transcriptome reversal” for these neurodevelopmental disorders. This approach attempts to identify compounds that reverse gene‐expression signatures associated with disease states.</p>

<p>by Toshiyuki Ishii, Toshihiko Hosoya</p>

Neurons in various regions of the brain generate spike bursts. While the number of spikes within a burst has been shown to carry information, information coding by interspike intervals (ISIs) is less well understood. In particular, a burst with <i>k</i> spikes has <i>k−</i>1 intraburst ISIs, and these <i>k−</i>1 ISIs could theoretically encode <i>k−</i>1 independent values. In this study, we demonstrate that such combinatorial coding occurs for retinal bursts. By recording ganglion cell spikes from isolated salamander retinae, we found that intraburst ISIs encode oscillatory light sequences that are much faster than the light intensity modulation encoded by the number of spikes. When a burst has three spikes, the two intraburst ISIs combinatorially encode the amplitude and phase of the oscillatory sequence. Analysis of trial-to-trial variability suggested that intraburst ISIs are regulated by two independent mechanisms responding to orthogonal oscillatory components, one of which is common to bursts with a different number of spikes. Therefore, the retina encodes multiple stimulus features by exploiting all degrees of freedom of burst spike patterns, i.e., the spike number and multiple intraburst ISIs.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/w8_kA1Ixbko" width="1" />

<p>by Pei-Yau Lung, Dongrui Zhong, Xiaodong Pang, Yan Li, Jinfeng Zhang</p>

Reusability is part of the FAIR data principle, which aims to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. One of the current efforts to increase the reusability of public genomics data has been to focus on the inclusion of quality metadata associated with the data. When necessary metadata are missing, most researchers will consider the data useless. In this study, we developed a framework to predict the missing metadata of gene expression datasets to maximize their reusability. We found that when using predicted data to conduct other analyses, it is not optimal to use all the predicted data. Instead, one should only use the subset of data, which can be predicted accurately. We proposed a new metric called Proportion of Cases Accurately Predicted (PCAP), which is optimized in our specifically-designed machine learning pipeline. The new approach performed better than pipelines using commonly used metrics such as F1-score in terms of maximizing the reusability of data with missing values. We also found that different variables might need to be predicted using different machine learning methods and/or different data processing protocols. Using differential gene expression analysis as an example, we showed that when missing variables are accurately predicted, the corresponding gene expression data can be reliably used in downstream analyses.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/F6Pjad6S8o0" width="1" />

The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to unprecedented social and economic consequences. The risk of morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 increases dramatically in the presence of coexisting medical conditions, while the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Furthermore, there are no approved therapies for COVID-19. This study aims to identify SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, disease manifestations, and COVID-19 therapies using network medicine methodologies along with clinical and multi-omics observations. We incorporate SARS-CoV-2 virus–host protein–protein interactions, transcriptomics, and proteomics into the human interactome. Network proximity measurement revealed underlying pathogenesis for broad COVID-19-associated disease manifestations. Analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing data show that co-expression of <i>ACE2</i> and <i>TMPRSS2</i> is elevated in absorptive enterocytes from the inflamed ileal tissues of Crohn disease patients compared to uninflamed tissues, revealing shared pathobiology between COVID-19 and inflammatory bowel disease. Integrative analyses of metabolomics and transcriptomics (bulk and single-cell) data from asthma patients indicate that COVID-19 shares an intermediate inflammatory molecular profile with asthma (including <i>IRAK3</i> and <i>ADRB2</i>). To prioritize potential treatments, we combined network-based prediction and a propensity score (PS) matching observational study of 26,779 individuals from a COVID-19 registry. We identified that melatonin usage (odds ratio [OR] = 0.72, 95% CI 0.56–0.91) is significantly associated with a 28% reduced likelihood of a positive laboratory test result for SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction assay. Using a PS matching user active comparator design, we determined that melatonin usage was associated with a reduced likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 positive test result compared to use of angiotensin II receptor blockers (OR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.54–0.92) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (OR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.52–0.90). Importantly, melatonin usage (OR = 0.48, 95% CI 0.31–0.75) is associated with a 52% reduced likelihood of a positive laboratory test result for SARS-CoV-2 in African Americans after adjusting for age, sex, race, smoking history, and various disease comorbidities using PS matching. In summary, this study presents an integrative network medicine platform for predicting disease manifestations associated with COVID-19 and identifying melatonin for potential prevention and treatment of COVID-19.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/uvpeSBS7OcA" width="1" />

Cues of maternal and paternal origins interact to control seed development, and the underlying molecular mechanisms are still far from clear. Here, we show that <i>TOPOISOMERASE Iα</i> (<i>TOP1α</i>), <i>UP-FRAMESHIFT SUPPRESSOR 1</i> (<i>UPF1</i>), and <i>TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA2</i> (<i>TTG2</i>) gametophytically, biparentally regulate seed size in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. <i>TOP1α</i> and <i>UPF1</i> are mainly expressed in antipodal cells, and loss of their function leads to ectopic <i>TTG2</i> expression in these female gametophytic cells. We further demonstrate that TOP1α and UPF1 directly repress <i>TTG2</i> expression through affecting its chromatin status and determine its relative expression in antipodal cells versus sperm cells, which controls seed size in a dosage-dependent and parent-of-origin-dependent manner. The molecular interplay among these three genes explains their biparental gametophytic effect during diploidy and interploidy reciprocal crosses. Taken together, our findings reveal a molecular framework of parental interaction for seed size control.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/c7D7CMFvyYo" width="1" />

<p>by Zvi N. Roth, Minyoung Ryoo, Elisha P. Merriam</p>

The brain exhibits widespread endogenous responses in the absence of visual stimuli, even at the earliest stages of visual cortical processing. Such responses have been studied in monkeys using optical imaging with a limited field of view over visual cortex. Here, we used functional MRI (fMRI) in human participants to study the link between arousal and endogenous responses in visual cortex. The response that we observed was tightly entrained to task timing, was spatially extensive, and was independent of visual stimulation. We found that this response follows dynamics similar to that of pupil size and heart rate, suggesting that task-related activity is related to arousal. Finally, we found that higher reward increased response amplitude while decreasing its trial-to-trial variability (i.e., the noise). Computational simulations suggest that increased temporal precision underlies both of these observations. Our findings are consistent with optical imaging studies in monkeys and support the notion that arousal increases precision of neural activity.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/v9y0OkBopAc" width="1" />

There is a great need for antiviral drugs to treat enterovirus (EV) and rhinovirus (RV) infections, which can be severe and occasionally life-threatening. The conserved nonstructural protein 2C, which is an AAA+ ATPase, is a promising target for drug development. Here, we present a structure-activity relationship study of a previously identified compound that targets the 2C protein of EV-A71 and several EV-B species members, but not poliovirus (PV) (EV-C species). This compound is structurally related to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug fluoxetine—which also targets 2C—but has favorable chemical properties. We identified several compounds with increased antiviral potency and broadened activity. Four compounds showed broad-spectrum EV and RV activity and inhibited contemporary strains of emerging EVs of public health concern, including EV-A71, coxsackievirus (CV)-A24v, and EV-D68. Importantly, unlike (<i>S</i>)-fluoxetine, these compounds are no longer neuroactive. By raising resistant EV-A71, CV-B3, and EV-D68 variants against one of these inhibitors, we identified novel 2C resistance mutations. Reverse engineering of these mutations revealed a conserved mechanism of resistance development. Resistant viruses first acquired a mutation in, or adjacent to, the α2 helix of 2C. This mutation disrupted compound binding and provided drug resistance, but this was at the cost of viral fitness. Additional mutations at distantly localized 2C residues were then acquired to increase resistance and/or to compensate for the loss of fitness. Using computational methods to identify solvent accessible tunnels near the α2 helix in the EV-A71 and PV 2C crystal structures, a conserved binding pocket of the inhibitors is proposed.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/GgWFfF1rxno" width="1" />

<p>by Benjamin D. Knapp, Lillian Zhu, Kerwyn Casey Huang</p>

Single-cell imaging, combined with recent advances in image analysis and microfluidic technologies, have enabled fundamental discoveries of cellular responses to chemical perturbations that are often obscured by traditional liquid-culture experiments. Temperature is an environmental variable well known to impact growth and to elicit specific stress responses at extreme values; it is often used as a genetic tool to interrogate essential genes. However, the dynamic effects of temperature shifts have remained mostly unstudied at the single-cell level, due largely to engineering challenges related to sample stability, heatsink considerations, and temperature measurement and feedback. Additionally, the few commercially available temperature-control platforms are costly. Here, we report an inexpensive (&lt;$110) and modular Single-Cell Temperature Controller (SiCTeC) device for microbial imaging—based on straightforward modifications of the typical slide-sample-coverslip approach to microbial imaging—that controls temperature using a ring-shaped Peltier module and microcontroller feedback. Through stable and precise (±0.15°C) temperature control, SiCTeC achieves reproducible and fast (1–2 min) temperature transitions with programmable waveforms between room temperature and 45°C with an air objective. At the device’s maximum temperature of 89°C, SiCTeC revealed that <i>Escherichia coli</i> cells progressively shrink and lose cellular contents. During oscillations between 30°C and 37°C, cells rapidly adapted their response to temperature upshifts. Furthermore, SiCTeC enabled the discovery of rapid morphological changes and enhanced sensitivity to substrate stiffness during upshifts to nonpermissive temperatures in temperature-sensitive mutants of cell-wall synthesis enzymes. Overall, the simplicity and affordability of SiCTeC empowers future studies of the temperature dependence of single-cell physiology.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/HHvrzfx-gmo" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Metals have been suggested as a risk factor for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but only retrospective studies are available to date. We compared metal levels in prospectively collected blood samples from ALS patients and controls, to explore whether metals are associated with ALS mortality.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A nested ALS case–control study was conducted within the prospective EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) cohort. Cases were identified through death certificates. We analyzed metal levels in erythrocyte samples obtained at recruitment, as a biomarker for metal exposure from any source. Arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, manganese, mercury, selenium, and zinc concentrations were measured by inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry. To estimate ALS risk, we applied conditional logistic regression models.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The study population comprised 107 cases (65% female) and 319 controls matched for age, sex, and study center. Median time between blood collection and ALS death was 8 years (range = 1–15). Comparing the highest with the lowest tertile, cadmium (odds ratio [OR] = 2.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.08–3.87) and lead (OR = 1.89, 95% CI = 0.97–3.67) concentrations suggest associations with increased ALS risk. Zinc was associated with a decreased risk (OR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.27–0.94). Associations for cadmium and lead remained when limiting analyses to noncurrent smokers.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This is the first study to compare metal levels before disease onset, minimizing reverse causation. The observed associations suggest that cadmium, lead, and zinc may play a role in ALS etiology. Cadmium and lead possibly act as intermediates on the pathway from smoking to ALS. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25952?af=R">Timeline of REM Sleep Behavior Disorder in Overt Alpha‐Synucleinopathies</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To analyze the timeline, prevalence, and survival of REM sleep‐behavior disorder in patients who developed alpha‐synucleinopathies: Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and Parkinson disease dementia compared to age‐ and sex‐matched controls in a population‐based incident‐cohort study.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used a population‐based, 1991‐2010 incident‐cohort study of alpha‐synucleinopathies. A movement‐disorder specialist reviewed medical records to confirm diagnoses. REM sleep‐behavior disorder was diagnosed by reported dream‐enactment symptoms or polysomnography. Probable RBD and polysomnography‐ confirmed RBD were analyzed singularly and combined.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among the 444 incident cases of alpha‐synucleinopathy, 86 were clinically diagnosed with REM sleep‐behavior disorder (19.8%) including 30 (35%) by polysomnography and 56(65%) as probable. Idiopathic REM sleep‐behavior‐disorder prevalence at alpha‐synucleinopathy diagnosis was 3.4%, increasing to 23.8% after 15 years. Cumulative lifetime incidence was 53 times greater in alpha‐synucleinopathies patients than controls (OR=53.1, 95% CI: 13.0‐ 217.2, p&lt;.0001), higher in dementia with Lewy bodies than Parkinson's disease, (OR=2.57, 95% CI: 1.50–4.40, p=.0004), and men than women with PD/DLB/PDD (OR = 3.70, 95% CI: 2.07–6.62, p&lt;.0001) but did not increase mortality risk .</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our cohort had REM sleep‐behavior disorder incidence of 3.4%. Overall REM sleep‐behavior disorder increased to 23.8% after 15 years, with overall incidence of 2.5 cases/100 person years. With 53 times greater lifetime incidence in alpha‐synucleinopathies patients than controls, REM sleep‐behavior disorder was more likely to develop in dementia with Lewy bodies than Parkinson's disease or Parkinson's disease dementia, and in men than women but did not increase mortality risk within our cohort.</p>

Background<p>Investigations into the benefits of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) through pre-clinical and clinical research have led to promising findings for treating several disorders. Despite proven effectiveness of VNS on conditions such as epilepsy and depression, understanding of off-target effects and contributing factors such as sex differences can be beneficial to optimize therapy design.</p>New Methods<p>In this article, we assessed longitudinal effects of VNS on cardiovascular and immune systems, and studied potential sex differences using a rat model of long-term VNS. Rats were implanted with cuff electrodes around the left cervical vagus nerve for VNS, and wireless physiological monitoring devices for continuous monitoring of cardiovascular system using electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. ECG morphology and heart rate variability (HRV) features were extracted to assess cardiovascular changes resulting from VNS in short-term and long-term timescales. We also assessed VNS effects on expression of inflammatory cytokines in blood during the course of the experiment. Statistical analysis was performed to compare results between Treatment and Sham groups, and between male and female animals from Treatment and Sham groups.</p>Results<p>Considerable differences between male and female rats in cardiovascular effects of VNS were observed in multiple cardiovascular features. However, the effects seemed to be transient with approximately 1-h recovery after VNS. While short-term cardiovascular effects were mainly observed in male rats, females in general showed more significant long-term effects even after VNS stopped. We did not observe notable changes or sex differences in systemic cytokine levels resulting from VNS.</p>Comparison With Existing Methods<p>Compared to existing methods, our study design incorporated wireless physiological monitoring and systemic blood cytokine level analysis, along with long-term VNS experiments in unanesthetized rats to study sex differences.</p>Conclusion<p>The contribution of sex differences for long-term VNS off-target effects on cardiovascular and immune systems was assessed using awake behaving rats. Although VNS did not change the concentration of inflammatory biomarkers in systemic circulation for male and female rats, we observed significant differences in cardiovascular effects of VNS characterized using ECG morphology and HRV analyses.</p>

<p>To improve the spatial resolution of imaging and get more effective brain function information, a multi-distance probe configuration with three distances (28.2, 40, and 44.7 mm) and 52 channels is designed. At the same time, a data conversion method of modified Beer–Lambert law (MBLL) with partial pathlength (PPL) is proposed. In the experiment, three kinds of tasks, grip of left hand, grip of right hand, and rest, are performed with eight healthy subjects. First, with a typical single-distance probe configuration (30 mm, 24 channels), the feasibility of the proposed MBLL with PPL is preliminarily validated. Further, the characteristic of the proposed method is evaluated with the multi-distance probe configuration. Compared with MBLL with differential pathlength factor (DPF), the proposed MBLL with PPL is able to acquire more obvious concentration change and can achieve higher classification accuracy of the three tasks. Then, with the proposed method, the performance of the multi-distance probe configuration is discussed. Results show that, compared with a single distance, the combination of the three distances has better spatial resolution and could explore more accurate brain activation information. Besides, the classification accuracy of the three tasks obtained with the combination of three distances is higher than that of any combination of two distances. Also, with the combination of the three distances, the two-class classification between different tasks is carried out. Both theory and experimental results demonstrate that, using multi-distance probe configuration and the MBLL with PPL method, the performance of brain function detected by NIRS can be improved.</p>

<p>The genes involved in the metabolic pathways of amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau proteins significantly influence the etiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Various studies have explored the associations between some of these genes and AD in the Caucasian population; however, researches regarding these associations remain limited in the Chinese population. To systematically evaluate the associations of these genes with AD, we investigated 19 genes involved in the metabolism of Aβ and tau based on previous studies selected using the PubMed database. This study included 372 patients with sporadic late-onset AD (sLOAD) and 345 cognitively healthy individuals from southern China. The results were replicated in the International Genomics of Alzheimer’s Project (IGAP). Protein–protein interactions were determined using the STRING v11 database. We found that a single-nucleotide polymorphism, rs11682128, of BIN1 conferred susceptibility to sLOAD after adjusting for age, sex, and APOE ε4 status and performing the Bonferroni correction {corrected P = 0.000153, odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] = 1.403 (1.079–1.824)}, which was replicated in the IGAP. Protein–protein interactions indicated that BIN1 was correlated with MAPT. Moreover, rare variants of NEP and FERMT2 (0.0026 &lt; corrected P &lt; 0.05), and the Aβ degradation, tau pathology, and tau phosphatase pathways (0.01 &lt; corrected P &lt; 0.05), were nominally significantly associated with sLOAD. This study suggested that the genes involved in the metabolic pathways of Aβ and tau contributed to the etiology of sLOAD in the southern Han Chinese population.</p>

<p>by Carolin Zitzmann, Lars Kaderali, Alan S. Perelson</p>

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes acute hepatitis C and can lead to life-threating complications if it becomes chronic. The HCV genome is a single plus strand of RNA. Its intracellular replication is a spatiotemporally coordinated process of RNA translation upon cell infection, RNA synthesis within a replication compartment, and virus particle production. While HCV is mainly transmitted via mature infectious virus particles, it has also been suggested that HCV-infected cells can secrete HCV RNA carrying exosomes that can infect cells in a receptor independent manner. In order to gain insight into these two routes of transmission, we developed a series of intracellular HCV replication models that include HCV RNA secretion and/or virus assembly and release. Fitting our models to <i>in vitro</i> data, in which cells were infected with HCV, suggests that initially most secreted HCV RNA derives from intracellular cytosolic plus-strand RNA, but subsequently secreted HCV RNA derives equally from the cytoplasm and the replication compartments. Furthermore, our model fits to the data suggest that the rate of virus assembly and release is limited by host cell resources. Including the effects of direct acting antivirals in our models, we found that in spite of decreasing intracellular HCV RNA and extracellular virus concentration, low level HCV RNA secretion may continue as long as intracellular RNA is available. This may possibly explain the presence of detectable levels of plasma HCV RNA at the end of treatment even in patients that ultimately attain a sustained virologic response.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rQYSbDpFc8I" width="1" />

Resources are rarely distributed uniformly within a population. Heterogeneity in the concentration of a drug, the quality of breeding sites, or wealth can all affect evolutionary dynamics. In this study, we represent a collection of properties affecting the fitness at a given location using a color. A green node is rich in resources while a red node is poorer. More colors can represent a broader spectrum of resource qualities. For a population evolving according to the birth-death Moran model, the first question we address is which structures, identified by graph connectivity and graph coloring, are evolutionarily equivalent. We prove that all properly two-colored, undirected, regular graphs are evolutionarily equivalent (where “properly colored” means that no two neighbors have the same color). We then compare the effects of background heterogeneity on properly two-colored graphs to those with alternative schemes in which the colors are permuted. Finally, we discuss dynamic coloring as a model for spatiotemporal resource fluctuations, and we illustrate that random dynamic colorings often diminish the effects of background heterogeneity relative to a proper two-coloring.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3hN2z9vY2h4" width="1" />

Interactive digital notebooks provide an opportunity for researchers and educators to carry out data analysis and report the results in a single digital format. Further to just being digital, the format allows for rich content to be created in order to interact with the code and data contained in such a notebook to form an educational narrative. This primer introduces some of the fundamental aspects involved in using Jupyter notebooks in an educational setting for teaching in the bio/health informatics disciplines. We also provide 2 case studies that detail how we used Jupyter notebooks to teach non-coders programming skills on a blended Master’s degree module for a Health Informatics programme and a fully online distance learning unit on Programming for a postgraduate certificate (PG Cert) in Clinical Bioinformatics with a more technical audience.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kU7-jU-ioWY" width="1" />

In eukaryotes, polyadenylation (poly(A)) is an essential process during mRNA maturation. Identifying the <i>cis</i>-determinants of poly(A) signal (PAS) on the DNA sequence is the key to understand the mechanism of translation regulation and mRNA metabolism. Although machine learning methods were widely used in computationally identifying PAS, the need for tremendous amounts of annotation data hinder applications of existing methods in species without experimental data on PAS. Therefore, cross-species PAS identification, which enables the possibility to predict PAS from untrained species, naturally becomes a promising direction. In our works, we propose a novel deep learning method named Poly(A)-DG for cross-species PAS identification. Poly(A)-DG consists of a Convolution Neural Network-Multilayer Perceptron (CNN-MLP) network and a domain generalization technique. It learns PAS patterns from the training species and identifies PAS in target species without re-training. To test our method, we use three species and build cross-species training sets with two of them and evaluate the performance of the remaining one. Moreover, we test our method against insufficient data and imbalanced data issues and demonstrate that Poly(A)-DG not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods but also maintains relatively high accuracy when it comes to a smaller or imbalanced training set.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XwVqYO6XZ-M" width="1" />

Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations seek to provide atomic-level insights into conformationally dynamic biological systems at experimentally relevant time resolutions, such as those afforded by single-molecule fluorescence measurements. However, limitations in the time scales of MD simulations and the time resolution of single-molecule measurements have challenged efforts to obtain overlapping temporal regimes required for close quantitative comparisons. Achieving such overlap has the potential to provide novel theories, hypotheses, and interpretations that can inform idealized experimental designs that maximize the detection of the desired reaction coordinate. Here, we report MD simulations at time scales overlapping with <i>in vitro</i> single-molecule Förster (fluorescence) resonance energy transfer (smFRET) measurements of the amino acid binding protein LIV-BP<sup>SS</sup> at sub-millisecond resolution. Computationally efficient all-atom structure-based simulations, calibrated against explicit solvent simulations, were employed for sampling multiple cycles of LIV-BP<sup>SS</sup> clamshell-like conformational changes on the time scale of seconds, examining the relationship between these events and those observed by smFRET. The MD simulations agree with the smFRET measurements and provide valuable information on local dynamics of fluorophores at their sites of attachment on LIV-BP<sup>SS</sup> and the correlations between fluorophore motions and large-scale conformational changes between LIV-BP<sup>SS</sup> domains. We further utilize the MD simulations to inform the interpretation of smFRET data, including Förster radius (R<sub>0</sub>) and fluorophore orientation factor (κ<sup>2</sup>) determinations. The approach we describe can be readily extended to distinct biochemical systems, allowing for the interpretation of any FRET system conjugated to protein or ribonucleoprotein complexes, including those with more conformational processes, as well as those implementing multi-color smFRET.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NTOMs9cRepw" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Friedreich ataxia (FA) is a progressive genetic neurodegenerative disorder with no approved treatment. Omaveloxolone, an Nrf2 activator, improves mitochondrial function, restores redox balance, and reduces inflammation in models of FA. We investigated the safety and efficacy of omaveloxolone in patients with FA.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted an international, double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐group, registrational phase 2 trial at 11 institutions in the United States, Europe, and Australia (NCT02255435, EudraCT2015‐002762‐23). Eligible patients, 16 to 40 years of age with genetically confirmed FA and baseline modified Friedreich's Ataxia Rating Scale (mFARS) scores between 20 and 80, were randomized 1:1 to placebo or 150mg per day of omaveloxolone. The primary outcome was change from baseline in the mFARS score in those treated with omaveloxolone compared with those on placebo at 48 weeks.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>One hundred fifty‐five patients were screened, and 103 were randomly assigned to receive omaveloxolone (n = 51) or placebo (n = 52), with 40 omaveloxolone patients and 42 placebo patients analyzed in the full analysis set. Changes from baseline in mFARS scores in omaveloxolone (−1.55 ± 0.69) and placebo (0.85 ± 0.64) patients showed a difference between treatment groups of –2.40 ± 0.96 (<i>p</i> = 0.014). Transient reversible increases in aminotransferase levels were observed with omaveloxolone without increases in total bilirubin or other signs of liver injury. Headache, nausea, and fatigue were also more common among patients receiving omaveloxolone.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In the MOXIe trial, omaveloxolone significantly improved neurological function compared to placebo and was generally safe and well tolerated. It represents a potential therapeutic agent in FA. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>Exome sequencing was performed in 2 unrelated families with progressive myoclonus epilepsy. Affected individuals from both families shared a rare, homozygous c.191A &gt; G variant affecting a splice site in <i>SLC7A6OS</i>. Analysis of cDNA from lymphoblastoid cells demonstrated partial splice site abolition and the creation of an abnormal isoform. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blot showed a marked reduction of protein expression. Haplotype analysis identified a ~0.85cM shared genomic region on chromosome 16q encompassing the c.191A &gt; G variant, consistent with a distant ancestor common to both families. Our results suggest that biallelic loss‐of‐function variants in <i>SLC7A6OS</i> are a novel genetic cause of progressive myoclonus epilepsy. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Barrel subfields in rodent primary somatosensory cortex (SI) are important model systems for studying cortical organization and reorganization. During cortical reorganization that follows limb deafferentation, neurons in deafferented forelimb SI become responsive to previously unexpressed inputs from the lower jaw. Although the lower jaw barrel subfield (LJBSF) is a likely source of the input, this subfield has received little attention. Our aim was to describe the structural and functional organization of the normal LJBSF. To investigate LJBSF organization, a nomenclature for lower jaw skin surface was developed, cytochrome oxidase (CO) was used to label flattened‐cut LJBSF sections, microelectrodes were used to map the lower jaw skin surface representation in SI, and electrolytic lesions, recovered from electrode penetrations, were used to align the physiological map to the underlying barrel map. LJBSF is a tear‐shaped subfield containing approximately 24 barrels, arranged in eight mediolateral rows and a barrel‐free zone capping the anterior border. The representation of the lower jaw skin consisting of chin vibrissae and microvibrissae embedded in common fur is somatotopically organized in a single map in the contralateral SI. This physiological map shows that the activity from the vibrissae aligns with the CO‐staining of the underlying LJBSF. LJBSF barrels receive topographically ordered barrel‐specific input from individual vibrissa and microvibrissae in the lower jaw but not from trident whiskers. The barrel‐free zone receives topographically ordered input from the lower lip. These data demonstrating that the LJBSF is a highly organized subfield are essential for understanding its possible role in cortical reorganization.</p>

<p>The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is susceptible to continuous fibrillar beta amyloid plaque deposition in aged amyloid precursor protein/PS1 mice. In contrast, after 12 months of age, fibrillar plaque load plateaus in the primary motor cortex (M1) and somatosensory cortex (SS2). Midlife (6–12 months of age) environmental enrichment (EE) decreases the accumulation of fibrillar plaque in M1 and SS2, but not in the PFC region.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Environmentally enriched housing conditions can increase performance on cognitive tasks in amyloid precursor protein (APP)/PS1 mice; however, the potential effects of environmental enrichment (EE) on disease modification in terms of pathological change are inconclusive. We hypothesized that previous contrasting findings may be attributable to regional differences in susceptibility to amyloid beta (Aβ) plaque deposition in cortical regions that are functionally associated with EE. We characterized fibrillar plaque deposition in 6, 12, and 18–22 months old APP/PS1 mice in the prefrontal (PFC), somatosensory (SS2), and primary motor cortex (M1). We found a significant increase in plaque load between 6 and 12 months in all regions. In animals over 12 months, only the PFC region continued to significantly accumulate plaques. Additionally, 12 months old animals subjected to 6 months of EE showed improved spatial navigation and had significantly fewer plaques in M1 and SS2, but not in the PFC. These findings suggest that the PFC region is selectively susceptible to Aβ deposition and less responsive to the attenuating effects of EE. In contrast, M1 and SS2 regions plateau with respect to Aβ deposition by 12 months of age and are susceptible to amyloid pathology modification by midlife EE.</p>

<p>In comparison to conventional repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), theta burst stimulation is stronger and more effective as a brain stimulation approach within short periods. Although this deep rTMS technique is being applied in treating neuropsychiatric disorders, few animal studies have attempted to clarify the neurobiological mechanisms underlying its beneficial effects. This animal study examined the effects of deep rTMS on the cuprizone-induced neuropathologic and behavioral anomalies and explored the underlying mechanism. Adolescent male C57BL/6 mice were fed a rodent chow without or with cuprizone (CPZ; 0.2% w/w) for 5 weeks. Another two groups of mice were subjected to deep rTMS or sham rTMS once a day during weeks 2–5 of the CPZ-feeding period. The behaviors of all mice were assessed after the withdrawal of CPZ before neuropathological and immunological analyses. Compared to the CNT group, mice in CPZ and CPZ + Sham groups showed deficits in social recognition and spatial working memory as well as anxiety-like behavior, in addition to myelin breakdown and OL loss in the corpus callosum (CC), caudate putamen, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus of the brain. Deep rTMS effectively reduced behavioral anomalies and blocked myelin breakdown and OL loss in CPZ-fed mice. Besides, it also dampened microglia activation at lesion sites and rectified cytokines levels (IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10) in CPZ-affected regions. The most significant effect was seen in the cerebral cortex where alleviated neuropathology co-existed with less microglia activation and higher IL-10 level. These data provided experimental evidence for the beneficial effects of deep rTMS in CPZ-fed mice and revealed a neurobiological mechanism of the modality.</p>

<p>We previously reported that spinal cord transection (TX) in the lamprey causes mRNA to accumulate in the injured tips of large reticulospinal (RS) axons. We sought to determine whether this mRNA accumulation results from phosphorylation and transport of retrograde signals, similar to what has been reported in mammalian peripheral nerve. Extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (Erk), mediates the neurite outgrowth-promoting effects of many neurotrophic factors. To assess the role of Erk in retrograde signaling of RS axon injury, we used immunoblot and immunohistochemistry to determine the changes in phosphorylated Erk (p-Erk) in the spinal cord after spinal cord TX. Immunostaining for p-Erk increased within axons and local cell bodies, most heavily within the 1-2 mm closest to the TX site, at between 3 and 6 h post-TX. In axons, p-Erk was concentrated in 3-5 μm granules that became less numerous with distance from the TX. The retrograde molecular motor dynein colocalized with p-Erk, but vimentin, which in peripheral nerve was reported to participate with p-Erk as part of a retrograde signal complex, did not colocalize with p-Erk, even though vimentin levels were elevated post-TX. The results suggest that p-Erk, but not vimentin, may function as a retrograde axotomy signal in lamprey central nervous system neurons, and that this signal may induce transcription of mRNA, which is then transported down the axon to its injured tip.</p>

In this review, we summarize metabolic alterations in aging brain and AD-related metabolic deficits associated with glucose metabolism dysregulation, glycolysis dysfunction, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) deficits, and pentose phosphate pathway impairment. Additionally, we discuss recent treatment strategies targeting metabolic defects in AD, including their limitations, in an effort to encourage the development of novel therapeutic strategies.</p>

<p>Gait is one of the fundamental behaviors we use to interact with the world. The functionality of the locomotor system is thus related to enriching interactions with our environment. The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) has been found to contribute to motor adaptation during both visuomotor and postural adaptation tasks. Additionally, structural or functional deficits of the PPC lead to impairments in gaits such as shortened steps and increased step width. Based on the aforementioned roles of the PPC, and the importance of gait adaptability, the current investigation sought to identify the role of the PPC in gait adaptation. To achieve this, we performed transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the bilateral PPC before performing a split-belt treadmill gait adaptation paradigm. We used three stimulation conditions in a within-subject design. tDCS was administered in a randomized and double-blinded order. Following each stimulation session, subjects first performed baseline walking with both belts running at the same speed. Then, subjects walked for 15 min on an uncoupled treadmill, with the belts being driven at a 3:1 speed ratio. Last, they returned to normal (i.e., tied-belt) walking for 5 min. Results from 15 young and healthy subjects identified that subjects required more steps to adapt to split-belt walking following the suppression of the left hemisphere PPC, contralateral to the fast belt. Furthermore, while suppression of the left hemisphere PPC did not increase the number of steps required to re-adapt to tied-belt walking, this condition did lead to increased magnitude of after-effects. Together, these findings indicate that the PPC is involved in locomotor adaptation. These results support previous literature regarding the upper body or postural adaptation and extend these findings to the realm of gait. Results highlight the PPC as a potential target for neurorehabilitation designed to improve gait adaptability.</p>

<p>Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) offer unique windows into the cognitive processes underlying human-machine interaction. Identifying and analyzing the appropriate brain activity to have access to such windows is often difficult due to technical or psycho-physiological constraints. Indeed, studying interactions through this approach frequently requires adapting them to accommodate specific BCI-related paradigms which change the functioning of their interface on both the human-side and the machine-side. The combined examination of Electroencephalography and Eyetracking recordings, mainly by means of studying Fixation-Related Potentials, can help to circumvent the necessity for these adaptations by determining interaction-relevant moments during natural manipulation. In this contribution, we examine how properties contained within the bi-modal recordings can be used to assess valuable information about the interaction. Practically, three properties are studied which can be obtained solely through data obtained from analysis of the recorded biosignals. Namely, these properties consist of relative gaze metrics, being abstractions of the gaze patterns, the amplitude variations in the early brain activity potentials and the brain activity frequency band differences between fixations. Through their observation, information about three different aspects of the explored interface are obtained. Respectively, the properties provide insights about general perceived task difficulty, locate moments of higher attentional effort and discriminate between moments of exploration and moments of active interaction.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.576082">Vibration Alert to the Brain: Evoked and Induced MEG Responses to High-Frequency Vibrotactile Stimuli on the Index Finger of Dominant and Non-dominant Hand</a></h4>

<p>Background: In recent years, vibrotactile haptic feedback technology has been widely used for user interfaces in the mobile devices. Although functional neuroimaging studies have investigated human brain responses to different types of tactile inputs, the neural mechanisms underlying high-frequency vibrotactile perception are still relatively unknown. Our aim was to investigate neuromagnetic brain responses to high-frequency vibrotactile stimulation, using magnetoencephalography (MEG).</p><p>Methods: We measured 152-channel whole-head MEG in 30 healthy, right-handed volunteers (aged 20–28 years, 15 females). A total of 300 vibrotactile stimuli were presented at the tip of either the left index finger or the right index finger in two separate sessions. Sinusoidal vibrations at 150 Hz for 200 ms were generated with random inter-stimulus intervals between 1.6 and 2.4 s. Both time-locked analysis and time-frequency analysis were performed to identify peak responses and oscillatory modulations elicited by high-frequency vibrations. The significance of the evoked and induced responses for dominant and non-dominant hand stimulation conditions was statistically tested, respectively. The difference in responses between stimulation conditions was also statistically evaluated.</p><p>Results: Prominent peak responses were observed at 56 ms (M50) and at 100 ms (M100) for both stimulation conditions. The M50 response revealed clear dipolar field patterns in the contralateral side with significant cortical activations in the contralateral primary sensorimotor area, whereas the M100 response was not as prominent as the M50. Vibrotactile stimulation induced significant suppression of both alpha (8–12 Hz) and beta (20–30 Hz) band activity during the mid-latency period (0.2–0.4 s), primarily in sensorimotor areas contralateral to the stimulation side. In addition, a significant alpha enhancement effect in posterior regions was accompanied with alpha suppressions in sensorimotor regions. The alpha suppression was observed in a broader distribution of cortical areas for the non-dominant hand stimulation.</p><p>Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that high-frequency tactile vibrations, which is known to primarily activate Pacinian corpuscles, elicit somatosensory M50 and M100 responses in the evoked fields and induce modulations of alpha and beta band oscillations during mid-latency periods. Our study is also consistent with that the primary sensorimotor area is significantly involved in the processing of high-frequency vibrotactile information with contralateral dominance.</p>

<p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) and essential-tremor (ET). In adaptive DBS (aDBS) systems, online tuning of stimulation parameters as a function of neural signals may improve treatment efficacy and reduce side-effects. State-of-the-art aDBS systems use symptom surrogates derived from neural signals—so-called neural markers (NMs)—defined on the patient-group level, and control strategies assuming stationarity of symptoms and NMs. We aim at improving these aDBS systems with (1) a data-driven approach for identifying patient- and session-specific NMs and (2) a control strategy coping with short-term non-stationary dynamics. The two building blocks are implemented as follows: (1) The data-driven NMs are based on a machine learning model estimating tremor intensity from electrocorticographic signals. (2) The control strategy accounts for local variability of tremor statistics. Our study with three chronically implanted ET patients amounted to five online sessions. Tremor quantified from accelerometer data shows that symptom suppression is at least equivalent to that of a continuous DBS strategy in 3 out-of 4 online tests, while considerably reducing net stimulation (at least 24%). In the remaining online test, symptom suppression was not significantly different from either the continuous strategy or the no treatment condition. We introduce a novel aDBS system for ET. It is the first aDBS system based on (1) a machine learning model to identify session-specific NMs, and (2) a control strategy coping with short-term non-stationary dynamics. We show the suitability of our aDBS approach for ET, which opens the door to its further study in a larger patient population.</p>

<p>Purpose: To examine cerebral cortical activation differences in the frontal cortex and parietal lobe during the performance of two types of dumbbell exercise.</p><p>Methods: A total of 22 young healthy male adults (mean age, 23.8 ± 2.05 years; height, 1.75 ± 0.06 m; weight, 71.4 ± 8.80 kg) participated in a crossover design study that involved two experimental exercise conditions: momentum dumbbell and conventional dumbbell. Performance tasks included 10, 10-s sets of single-arm dumbbell exercise, with a rest interval of 60 s between sets and a 5-min washout period between conditions. The primary outcome was the cerebral concentrations of oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO<sub>2</sub>) in the frontal cortex and parietal lobe assessed during performance of both exercises using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The secondary outcome was upper-limb muscle activation measured using surface electromyography (sEMG). Outcome data were ascertained during exercise.</p><p>Results: A significant between-condition difference in HbO<sub>2</sub> was observed in the frontal and parietal regions with an increase in HbO<sub>2</sub> during momentum, relative to conventional, dumbbell exercise (p &lt; 0.05). Compared to conventional dumbbell exercise, performing a momentum dumbbell exercise led to a higher level of muscle activation in the anterior and posterior deltoids of the upper arm and in the flexor carpi radialis and extensor carpi radialis longus of the forearm (p &lt; 0.05). However, no between-condition differences were found in the biceps and triceps brachii (p &gt; 0.05).</p><p>Conclusion: Dynamic, compared with conventional, dumbbell exercise resulted in higher hemodynamic responses and greater upper-limb muscle activation in young healthy adults. The findings of this study showed differential cortical hemodynamic responses during performance of the two types of dumbbell exercise with a higher activation level produced during momentum-based dumbbell exercise.</p>

<p>Many current computational models that aim to simulate cortical and hippocampal modules of the brain depend on artificial neural networks. However, such classical or even deep neural networks are very slow, sometimes taking thousands of trials to obtain the final response with a considerable amount of error. The need for a large number of trials at learning and the inaccurate output responses are due to the complexity of the input cue and the biological processes being simulated. This article proposes a computational model for an intact and a lesioned cortico-hippocampal system using quantum-inspired neural networks. This cortico-hippocampal computational quantum-inspired (CHCQI) model simulates cortical and hippocampal modules by using adaptively updated neural networks entangled with quantum circuits. The proposed model is used to simulate various classical conditioning tasks related to biological processes. The output of the simulated tasks yielded the desired responses quickly and efficiently compared with other computational models, including the recently published Green model.</p>

<p>The ability of humans and animals to localize the source of a sound in a complex acoustic environment facilitates communication and survival. Two cues are used for sound localization at horizontal planes, interaural time and level differences (ITD and ILD), which are analyzed by distinct neural circuits in the brainstem. Here, we review the studies on metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-mediated neuromodulation of both intrinsic and synaptic properties of brainstem neurons in these circuits. Both mammalian and avian animal models have been used, with each having their advantages that are not present in the other. For the mammalian model, we discuss mGluR neuromodulation in the ILD circuit, with an emphasis on the recent discovery of differential modulation of synaptic transmission of different transmitter release modes. For the avian model, we focus on reviewing mGluR neuromodulation in the ITD pathway, with an emphasis on tonotopic distribution and synaptic plasticity of mGluR modulation in coincidence detector neurons. Future works are proposed to further investigate the functions and mechanisms of mGluRs in the sound localization circuits.</p>

<p>Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC) plays an essential role in the control of food intake and energy expenditure. Melanocortin-4 receptors (MC4Rs) are expressed in key areas that are implicated in regulating energy homeostasis. Although the importance of MC4Rs in the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) has been well documented, the role of MC4Rs in the medial amygdala (MeA) on feeding remains controversial. In this study, we specifically examine the role of a novel ARC<sup>POMC</sup>→MeA neural circuit in the regulation of short-term food intake. To map a local melanocortinergic neural circuit, we use monosynaptic anterograde as well as retrograde viral tracers and perform double immunohistochemistry to determine the identity of the neurons receiving synaptic input from POMC neurons in the ARC. To investigate the role of the ARC<sup>POMC</sup>→MeA projection on feeding, we optogenetically stimulate channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-expressing POMC fibers in the MeA. Anterograde viral tracing studies reveal that ARC POMC neurons send axonal projections to estrogen receptor-α (ER-α)- and MC4R-expressing neurons in the MeA. Retrograde viral tracing experiments show that the neurons projecting to the MeA is located mainly in the lateral part of the ARC. Optogenetic stimulation of the ARC<sup>POMC</sup>→MeA pathway reduces short-term food intake. This anorectic effect is blocked by treatment with the MC4R antagonist SHU9119. In addition to the melanocortinergic local circuits within the hypothalamus, this extrahypothalamic ARC<sup>POMC</sup>→MeA neural circuit would play a role in regulating short-term food intake.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.590299">Serotonergic Modulation of Locomotor Activity From Basal Vertebrates to Mammals</a></h4>

<p>During the last 50 years, the serotonergic (5-HT) system was reported to exert a complex modulation of locomotor activity. Here, we focus on two key factors that likely contribute to such complexity. First, locomotion is modulated directly and indirectly by 5-HT neurons. The locomotor circuitry is directly innervated by 5-HT neurons in the caudal brainstem and spinal cord. Also, indirect control of locomotor activity results from ascending projections of 5-HT cells in the rostral brainstem that innervate multiple brain centers involved in motor action planning. Second, each approach used to manipulate the 5-HT system likely engages different 5-HT-dependent mechanisms. This includes the recruitment of different 5-HT receptors, which can have excitatory or inhibitory effects on cell activity. These receptors can be located far or close to the 5-HT release sites, making their activation dependent on the level of 5-HT released. Here we review the activity of different 5-HT nuclei during locomotor activity, and the locomotor effects of 5-HT precursors, exogenous 5-HT, selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), electrical or chemical stimulation of 5-HT neurons, genetic deletions, optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations. We highlight both the coherent and controversial aspects of 5-HT modulation of locomotor activity from basal vertebrates to mammals. This mini review may hopefully inspire future studies aiming at dissecting the complex effects of 5-HT on locomotor function.</p>

<p>Neurons typically receive synaptic input in their dendritic arbor, integrate inputs in their soma, and send output action potentials through their axon, following Cajal’s law of dynamic polarization. Two notable exceptions are retinal amacrine cells and olfactory granule cells (GCs), which flout Cajal’s edict by providing synaptic output from the same dendrites that collect synaptic input. Amacrine cells, a diverse cell class comprising &gt;60 subtypes, employ various dendritic input/output strategies, but A17 amacrine cells (A17s) in particular share further interesting functional characteristics with GCs: both receive excitatory synaptic input from neurons in the primary glutamatergic pathway and return immediate, reciprocal feedback via GABAergic inhibitory synapses to the same synaptic terminals that provided input. Both neurons thereby process signals locally within their dendrites, shaping many parallels, signaling pathways independently. The similarities between A17s and GCs cast into relief striking differences that may indicate distinct processing roles within their respective circuits: First, they employ partially dissimilar molecular mechanisms to transform excitatory input into inhibitory output; second, GCs fire action potentials, whereas A17s do not. Third, GC signals may be influenced by cortical feedback, whereas the mammalian retina receives no such retrograde input. Finally, A17s constitute just one subtype within a diverse class that is specialized in a particular task, whereas the more homogeneous GCs may play more diverse signaling roles via multiple processing modes. Here, we review these analogies and distinctions between A17 amacrine cells and granule cells, hoping to gain further insight into the operating principles of these two sensory circuits.</p>

<p>Vision, hearing, smell, taste, and touch are the tools used to perceive and navigate the world. They enable us to obtain essential resources such as food and highly desired resources such as mates. Thanks to the investments in biomedical research the molecular unpinning’s of human sensation are rivaled only by our knowledge of sensation in the laboratory mouse. Humans rely heavily on vision whereas mice use smell as their dominant sense. Both modalities have many features in common, starting with signal detection by highly specialized primary sensory neurons—rod and cone photoreceptors (PR) for vision, and olfactory sensory neurons (OSN) for the smell. In this chapter, we provide an overview of how these two types of primary sensory neurons operate while highlighting the similarities and distinctions.</p>

<p>Injuries in the central nervous system (CNS) often causes neuronal loss and glial scar formation. We have recently demonstrated NeuroD1-mediated direct conversion of reactive glial cells into functional neurons in adult mouse brains. Here, we further investigate whether such direct glia-to-neuron conversion technology can reverse glial scar back to neural tissue in a severe stab injury model of the mouse cortex. Using an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapy approach, we ectopically expressed a single neural transcription factor NeuroD1 in reactive astrocytes in the injured areas. We discovered that the reactive astrocytes were efficiently converted into neurons both before and after glial scar formation, and the remaining astrocytes proliferated to repopulate themselves. The astrocyte-converted neurons were highly functional, capable of firing action potentials and establishing synaptic connections with other neurons. Unexpectedly, the expression of NeuroD1 in reactive astrocytes resulted in a significant reduction of toxic A1 astrocytes, together with a significant decrease of reactive microglia and neuroinflammation. Furthermore, accompanying the regeneration of new neurons and repopulation of new astrocytes, new blood vessels emerged and blood-brain-barrier (BBB) was restored. These results demonstrate an innovative neuroregenerative gene therapy that can directly reverse glial scar back to neural tissue, opening a new avenue for brain repair after injury.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.592213">Minimal Number of Required Inputs for Temporally Precise Action Potential Generation in Auditory Brainstem Nuclei</a></h4>

<p>The auditory system relies on temporal precise information transfer, requiring an interplay of synchronously activated inputs and rapid postsynaptic integration. During late postnatal development synaptic, biophysical, and morphological features change to enable mature auditory neurons to perform their appropriate function. How the number of minimal required input fibers and the relevant EPSC time course integrated for action potential generation changes during late postnatal development is unclear. To answer these questions, we used in vitro electrophysiology in auditory brainstem structures from pre-hearing onset and mature Mongolian gerbils of either sex. Synaptic and biophysical parameters changed distinctively during development in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB), the medial superior olive (MSO), and the ventral and dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (VNLL and DNLL). Despite a reduction in input resistance in most cell types, all required fewer inputs in the mature stage to drive action potentials. Moreover, the EPSC decay time constant is a good predictor of the EPSC time used for action potential generation in all nuclei but the VNLL. Only in MSO neurons, the full EPSC time course is integrated by the neuron’s resistive element, while otherwise, the relevant EPSC time matches only 5–10% of the membrane time constant, indicating membrane charging as a dominant role for output generation. We conclude, that distinct developmental programs lead to a general increase in temporal precision and integration accuracy matched to the information relaying properties of the investigated nuclei.</p>

<p>Increasing evidence foresees the secretome of neural stem cells (NSCs) to confer superimposable beneficial properties as exogenous NSC transplants in experimental treatments of traumas and diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Naturally produced secretome biologics include membrane-free signaling molecules and extracellular membrane vesicles (EVs) capable of regulating broad functional responses. The development of high-throughput screening pipelines for the identification and validation of NSC secretome targets is still in early development. Encouraging results from pre-clinical animal models of disease have highlighted secretome-based (acellular) therapeutics as providing significant improvements in biochemical and behavioral measurements. Most of these responses are being hypothesized to be the result of modulating and promoting the restoration of key inflammatory and regenerative programs in the CNS. Here, we will review the most recent findings regarding the identification of NSC-secreted factors capable of modulating the immune response to promote the regeneration of the CNS in animal models of CNS trauma and inflammatory disease and discuss the increased interest to refine the pro-regenerative features of the NSC secretome into a clinically available therapy in the emerging field of Regenerative Neuroimmunology.</p>

<p>Huntington disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene. Disrupted cortico-striatal transmission is an early event that contributes to neuronal spine and synapse dysfunction primarily in striatal medium spiny neurons, the most vulnerable cell type in the disease, but also in neurons of other brain regions including the cortex. Although striatal and cortical neurons eventually degenerate, these synaptic and circuit changes may underlie some of the earliest motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms. Moreover, synaptic dysfunction and spine loss are hypothesized to be therapeutically reversible before neuronal death occurs, and restoration of normal synaptic function may delay neurodegeneration. One of the earliest synaptic alterations to occur in HD mouse models is enhanced striatal extrasynaptic NMDA receptor expression and activity. This activity is mediated primarily through GluN2B subunit-containing receptors and is associated with increased activation of cell death pathways, inhibition of survival signaling, and greater susceptibility to excitotoxicity. Death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) is a pro-apoptotic kinase highly expressed in neurons during development. In the adult brain, DAPK1 becomes re-activated and recruited to extrasynaptic NMDAR complexes during neuronal death, where it phosphorylates GluN2B at S1303, amplifying toxic receptor function. Approaches to reduce DAPK1 activity have demonstrated benefit in animal models of stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and chronic stress, indicating that DAPK1 may be a novel target for neuroprotection. Here, we demonstrate that dysregulation of DAPK1 occurs early in the YAC128 HD mouse model, and contributes to elevated extrasynaptic GluN2B S1303 phosphorylation. Inhibition of DAPK1 normalizes extrasynaptic GluN2B phosphorylation and surface expression, and completely prevents YAC128 striatal spine loss in cortico-striatal co-culture, thus validating DAPK1 as a potential target for synaptic protection in HD and warranting further development of DAPK1-targeted therapies for neurodegeneration.</p>

<p>Microglia—the brain’s primary immune cells—exert a tightly regulated cascade of pro- and anti-inflammatory effects upon brain pathology, either promoting regeneration or neurodegeneration. Therefore, harnessing microglia emerges as a potential therapeutic concept in neurological research. Recent studies suggest that—besides being affected by chemokines and cytokines—various cell entities in the brain relevantly respond to the mechanical properties of their microenvironment. For example, we lately reported considerable effects of elasticity on neural stem cells, regarding quiescence and differentiation potential. However, the effects of elasticity on microglia remain to be explored.Under the hypothesis that the elasticity of the microenvironment affects key characteristics and functions of microglia, we established an in vitro model of primary rat microglia grown in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer-based cell culture system. This way, we simulated the brain’s physiological elasticity range and compared it to supraphysiological stiffer PDMS controls. We assessed functional parameters of microglia under “resting” conditions, as well as when polarized towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype (M1) by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or an anti-inflammatory phenotype (M2) by interleukin-4 (IL-4). Microglia viability was unimpaired on soft substrates, but we found various significant effects with a more than two-fold increase in microglia proliferation on soft substrate elasticities mimicking the brain (relative to PDMS controls). Furthermore, soft substrates promoted the expression of the activation marker vimentin in microglia. Moreover, the M2-marker CD206 was upregulated in parallel to an increase in the secretion of Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1). The upregulation of CD206 was abolished by blockage of stretch-dependent chloride channels. Our data suggest that the cultivation of microglia on substrates of brain-like elasticity promotes a basic anti-inflammatory activation state via stretch-dependent chloride channels. The results highlight the significance of the omnipresent but mostly overlooked mechanobiological effects exerted on microglia and contribute to a better understanding of the complex spatial and temporal interactions between microglia, neural stem cells, and glia, in health and disease.</p>

<p>Recent evidence highlighted the importance of white matter tracts in typical and atypical behaviors. White matter dynamically changes in response to learning, stress, and social experiences. Several lines of evidence have reported white matter dysfunction in psychiatric conditions, including depression, stress- and anxiety-related disorders. The mechanistic underpinnings of these associations, however, remain poorly understood. Here, we outline an integrative perspective positing a link between aberrant myelin plasticity and anxiety. Drawing on extant literature and emerging new findings, we suggest that in anxiety, unique changes may occur in response to threat and to safety learning and the ability to discriminate between both types of stimuli. We propose that altered myelin plasticity in the neural circuits underlying these two forms of learning relates to the emergence of anxiety-related disorders, by compromising mechanisms of neural network synchronization. The clinical and translational implications of this model for anxiety-related disorders are discussed.</p>

<p>Acute alcohol exposure impairs hippocampus-dependent spatial memory. However, there is little evidence for the effects of ethanol on the spike patterns of hippocampal cell populations. Here, we examined how the spatial firing patterns of place cells, neurons that encode specific locations, were altered in rats that were intraperitoneally injected with 1.5 g/kg ethanol. Ethanol administration partly reduced or abolished place-selective spiking of a subset of place cells during running periods in a spatial task, whereas a subset of place fields newly emerged, suggesting a partial reorganization of hippocampal spatial maps by ethanol. On the other hand, ethanol administration did not significantly alter the frequency of hippocampal sharp-wave ripple (SWRs) and synchronous spike patterns during resting periods, suggesting that offline memory consolidation and retrieval mechanisms underpinned by hippocampal neuronal synchronization are not strongly affected by ethanol. These results indicate that acute ethanol intake mainly affects the encoding of external information but has little impact on internal memory processing.</p>

<p>Objective: The association between hippocampal volume and memory is continuing to be characterized in healthy older adults. Prior research suggests smaller hippocampal volume in healthy older adults is associated with poorer episodic memory and processing speed, as well as working memory, verbal learning, and executive functioning as measured by the NIH Toolbox Fluid (Fluid Cognition Composite, FCC) and Crystalized Cognition Composites (CCC). This study aimed to replicate these findings and to evaluate the association between: (1) hippocampal asymmetry index and cognition; and (2) independent contributions of the left and right hippocampal volume and cognition in a large sample of healthy older adults.</p><p>Participants and Methods: One-hundred and eighty-three healthy older adults (M age = 71.72, SD = 5.3) received a T1-weighted sequence on a 3T scanner. Hippocampal subfields were extracted using FreeSurfer 6.0 and combined to provide left, right, and total hippocampal volumes. FCC subtests include Dimensional Change Card Sort, Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention, List Sorting, Picture Sequence Memory, and Pattern Comparison. CCC subtests include Picture Vocabulary and Oral Reading Recognition. Multiple linear regressions were performed predicting cognition composites from the total, left and right, and asymmetry of hippocampal volume, controlling for sex, education, scanner, and total intracranial volume. Multiple comparisons in primary analyses were corrected using a false discovery rate (FDR) of p &lt; 0.05.</p><p>Results: FCC scores were positively associated with total (β = 0.226, FDR q = 0.044) and left (β = 0.257, FDR q = 0.024) hippocampal volume. Within FCC, Picture Sequence Memory scores positively associated with total (β = 0.284, p = 0.001) and left (β = 0.98, p = 0.001) hippocampal volume. List Sorting scores were also positively associated with left hippocampal volume (β = 0.189, p = 0.029).</p><p>Conclusions: These results confirm previous research suggesting that bilateral hippocampal volume is associated with FCC, namely episodic memory. The present study also suggests the left hippocampal volume may be more broadly associated with both episodic and working memory. Studies should continue to investigate lateralized hippocampal contributions to aging processes to better identify predictors of cognitive decline.</p>

<p>Postoperative delirium (POD) is the most common postoperative complication affecting elderly patients, yet the underlying mechanism is elusive, and effective therapies are lacking. The neuroinflammation hypothesis for the pathogenesis of POD has recently emerged. Accumulating evidence is supporting the role of specialized proresolving lipid mediators (SPMs) in regulating inflammation. Neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1), a novel docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-derived lipid mediator, has shown potent immunoresolvent and neuroprotective effects in several disease models associated with inflammation. Here, using a mouse model of POD, we investigated the role of NPD1 in postoperative cognitive impairment by assessing systemic inflammatory changes, the permeability of the blood–brain barrier (BBB), neuroinflammation, and behavior in aged mice at different time points. We report that a single dose of NPD1 prophylaxis decreased the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF-α and interleukin (IL)-6 and upregulated the expression of IL-10 in peripheral blood, the hippocampus, and the prefrontal cortex. Additionally, NPD1 limited the leakage of the BBB by increasing the expression of tight junction (TJ)-associated proteins such as ZO-1, claudin-5, and occludin. NPD1 also abolished the activation of microglia and astrocytes in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, which is associated with improved general and memory function after surgery. In addition, NPD1 treatment modulated the inflammatory cytokine expression profile and improved the expression of the M2 marker CD206 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages, which may partly explain the beneficial effects of NPD1 on inflammation. Collectively, these findings shed light on the proresolving activities of NPD1 in the pro-inflammatory milieu both in vivo and in vitro and may bring a novel therapeutic approach for POD.</p>

Background<p>Excessive aggregation of α-synuclein is the key pathophysiological feature of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is also associated with synucleinopathies and considered as a powerful predictor of PD. Growing evidence suggests the diminished clearance of α-synuclein may be partly attributable to poor interstitial fluid drainage, which can be reflected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-visible enlarged perivascular space (EPVS). However, the effect of MRI-visible EPVS on iRBD and PD, and their correlation with clinical characteristics remain unclear.</p>Objective<p>To evaluate the clinical and neuroimaging significance of MRI-visible EPVS in iRBD and PD patients.</p>Methods<p>We enrolled 33 iRBD patients, 82 PD (with and without RBD) patients, and 35 healthy controls (HCs), who underwent clinical evaluation and 3.0 Tesla MRI. Two neurologists assessed MRI-visible EPVS in centrum semiovale (CSO), basal ganglia (BG), substantia nigra (SN), and brainstem (BS). Independent risk factors for iRBD and PD were investigated using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Spearman analysis was used to test the correlation of MRI-visible EPVS with clinical characteristics of patients.</p>Results<p>iRBD patients had significantly higher EPVS burdens (CSO, BG, SN, and BS) than PD patients. Higher CSO-EPVS and BS-EPVS burdens were independent risk factors for iRBD. Furthermore, higher CSO-EPVS and SN-EPVS burdens were positively correlated with the severity of clinical symptom in iRBD patients, and higher BG-EPVS burden was positively correlated with the severity of cognitive impairment in PD patients.</p>Conclusion<p>iRBD and PD patients have different MRI-visible EPVS burdens, which may be related with a compensatory mechanism in glymphatic system. Lower MRI-visible EPVS burden in PD patients may be a manifestation of severe brain waste drainage dysfunction. These findings shed light on the pathophysiologic relationship between iRBD and PD with respect to neuroimaging marker of PD.</p>

<p>Cognition emerges from coordinated processing among distributed cortical brain regions, enabled through interconnected white matter networks. Cortical disconnection caused by age-related decline in white matter integrity (WMI) is likely to contribute to age-related cognitive decline. Physical activity (PA) has been suggested to have beneficial effects on white matter structure. However, its potential to counteract age-related decline in WMI is not yet well established. The present explorative study analyzed if PA was associated with WMI in cognitively healthy older adults and if this association was modulated by age. Forty-four cognitively healthy older individuals (aged 60–88 years) with diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) and PA measurements were included from the AgeGain study. Voxelwise analysis using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) demonstrated that PA was associated with WMI in older adults. However, results emphasized that this association was restricted to high age. The association between PA and WMI was found in widespread white matter regions suggesting a global rather than a regional effect. Supplementary analyses demonstrated an association between the integrity of these regions and the performance in memory [verbal learning and memory test (VLMT)] and executive functioning (Tower of London).Results of the present explorative study support the assumption that PA is associated with WMI in older adults. However, results emphasize that this association is restricted to high age. Since cognitive decline in the elderly is typically most pronounced in later stages of aging, PA qualifies as a promising tool to foster resilience against age-related cognitive decline, via the preservation of the integrity of the brains WM.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s dementia (AD) begins many years before its clinical symptoms. Metabolic dysfunction represents a core feature of AD and cognitive impairment, but few metabolomic studies have focused on cognitive aging in midlife. Using an untargeted metabolomics approach, we identified metabolic predictors of cognitive aging in midlife using fasting plasma sample from 30 middle-aged (mean age 57.2), male-male twin pairs enrolled in the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging (VETSA). For all twin pairs, one twin developed incident MCI, whereas his co-twin brother remained to be cognitively normal during an average 5.5-year follow-up. Linear mixed model was used to identify metabolites predictive of MCI conversion or cognitive change over time, adjusting for traditional risk factors. Results from twins were replicated in an independent cohort of middle-aged adults (mean age 59.1) in the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention (WRAP). Results in twins showed that higher baseline levels of four plasma metabolites, including sphingomyelin (d18:1/20:1 and d18:2/20:0), sphingomyelin (d18:1/22:1, d18:2/22:0, and d16:1/24:1), DAG (18:2/20:4), and hydroxy-CMPF, were significantly associated with a slower decrease in one or more domains of cognitive function. The association of sphingomyelin (d18:1/20:1 and d18:2/20:0) was replicated in WRAP. Our results support that metabolic perturbation occurs many years before cognitive impairment and plasma metabolites may serve as early biomarkers for prediction or monitoring of cognitive aging and AD in midlife.</p>

<p>Aggregated tau is a hallmark neuropathological feature in numerous neurodegenerative disorders. Previous studies aiming to validate aggregated tau pathology as a pathogenic driver of neurodegeneration in correlation to characteristic behavioral phenotypes have had shortcomings. Although studies on soluble tau pathology have effectively addressed these shortcomings, the role of soluble tau in the molecular pathogenesis of neurodegeneration is not yet unequivocally established. In sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the relevance of soluble tau pathology in endolysosomal dysfunction and autophagic stress, some of the earliest disease manifestations, is unclear. In this study, we report that soluble 4R0N tau overexpression affects the expression levels of certain markers associated with the endolysosomal system and autophagy. Moreover, through live-cell imaging, we found that the vesicular dynamics of early endosomes were affected with respect to spatiotemporal parameters and vesicle maturation. Additionally, we observed the localization of amyloid precursor protein (APP) along the endocytic pathway and found that upon overexpression of soluble 4R0N tau, APP was preferentially localized to the endocytic compartments implicated in the amyloidogenic pathway. Overall, our observations indicate that soluble 4R0N tau abrogates the dynamics of the endolysosomal system, autophagy, and affects the trafficking of APP. Since the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs during its progression through the endocytic pathway, our results suggest that the generation of amyloid-β (Aβ) might also be modulated.</p>

<p>Aging is a lifelong process that starts at birth. Throughout the course of their life, individuals are exposed to various levels of stimulating activities. A higher level of engagement in such activities is suspected to protect against the normal course of cognitive aging or the cognitive manifestations of age-related brain diseases. However, the exact mechanism underlying such protective action remains unclear. The concept of the neurocognitive reserve was introduced to refer to the hypothesis that engagement in stimulating activities shapes brain structure and function, thus indirectly allowing for better preserved cognitive abilities. Although it is known that word production is among the best-preserved cognitive abilities in aging, the underlying neurofunctional mechanisms that allow this relative preservation are still unknown, and it is still unclear how engagement in stimulating activities affects these processes. The objective of this study is to describe the brain functional connectivity patterns associated with picture-naming abilities in younger and older adults with varying levels of engagement in stimulating activities, as a proxy for neurocognitive reserve. A mediation analysis was applied to determine whether the association between reserve proxies and naming accuracy is dependent on task FC. Results show that naming accuracy depends on the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) functional decoupling in both younger and older adults but through different pathways. While high-performing older adults rely on the asynchronization of this area from motor speech regions’ activity, the best-performing younger adults rely on the functional decoupling with language-related regions. Mediation analysis reveals that the PCC decoupling mediates the relationship between the level of engagement in stimulating activities and naming accuracy in younger adults, but not in older adults. These findings suggest that reserve-related mechanisms may be more critical for naming in early adult life, while older adults’ neurofunctional organization may benefit more from a lifetime of acquired knowledge.</p>

<p>by Joshua Kimrey, Theodore Vo, Richard Bertram</p>

The pumping of blood through the heart is due to a wave of muscle contractions that are in turn due to a wave of electrical activity initiated at the sinoatrial node. At the cellular level, this wave of electrical activity corresponds to the sequential excitation of electrically coupled cardiac cells. Under some conditions, the normally-long action potentials of cardiac cells are extended even further by small oscillations called early afterdepolarizations (EADs) that can occur either during the plateau phase or repolarizing phase of the action potential. Hence, cellular EADs have been implicated as a driver of potentially lethal cardiac arrhythmias. One of the major determinants of cellular EAD production and repolarization failure is the size of the overlap region between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activation and inactivation, called the window region. In this article, we interpret the role of the window region in terms of the fast-slow structure of a low-dimensional model for ventricular action potential generation. We demonstrate that the effects of manipulation of the size of the window region can be understood from the point of view of canard theory. We use canard theory to explain why enlarging the size of the window region elicits EADs and why shrinking the window region can eliminate them. We also use the canard mechanism to explain why some manipulations in the size of the window region have a stronger influence on cellular electrical behavior than others. This dynamical viewpoint gives predictive power that is beyond that of the biophysical explanation alone while also uncovering a common mechanism for phenomena observed in experiments on both atrial and ventricular cardiac cells.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Avz3Jy_sx2s" width="1" />

<p>by Peter M. C. Harrison, Roberta Bianco, Maria Chait, Marcus T. Pearce</p>

Statistical learning and probabilistic prediction are fundamental processes in auditory cognition. A prominent computational model of these processes is Prediction by Partial Matching (PPM), a variable-order Markov model that learns by internalizing <i>n</i>-grams from training sequences. However, PPM has limitations as a cognitive model: in particular, it has a perfect memory that weights all historic observations equally, which is inconsistent with memory capacity constraints and recency effects observed in human cognition. We address these limitations with PPM-Decay, a new variant of PPM that introduces a customizable memory decay kernel. In three studies—one with artificially generated sequences, one with chord sequences from Western music, and one with new behavioral data from an auditory pattern detection experiment—we show how this decay kernel improves the model’s predictive performance for sequences whose underlying statistics change over time, and enables the model to capture effects of memory constraints on auditory pattern detection. The resulting model is available in our new open-source R package, <i>ppm</i> (https://github.com/pmcharrison/ppm).<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wnRZs66WMSA" width="1" />

<p>The success of clinical trials of selective B‐cell depletion in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) and primary progressive MS has led to a conceptual shift in the understanding of MS pathogenesis, away from the classical model in which T cells were the sole central actors and toward a more complex paradigm with B cells having an essential role in both the inflammatory and neurodegenerative components of the disease process. The role of B cells in MS was selected as the topic of the 27th Annual Meeting of the European Charcot Foundation. Results of the meeting are presented in this concise review, which recaps current concepts underlying the biology and therapeutic rationale behind B‐cell–directed therapeutics in MS, and proposes strategies to optimize the use of existing anti–B‐cell treatments and provide future directions for research in this area.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Even though genetic predisposition has proven to be an important element in Parkinson's disease (PD) etiology, monozygotic (MZ) twins with PD displayed a concordance rate of only about 20% despite their shared identical genetic background.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We recruited 5 pairs of MZ twins discordant for idiopathic PD and established skin fibroblast cultures to investigate mitochondrial phenotypes in these cellular models against the background of a presumably identical genome. To test for genetic differences, we performed whole genome sequencing, deep mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequencing, and tested for mitochondrial deletions by multiplex real‐time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the fibroblast cultures. Further, the fibroblast cultures were tested for mitochondrial integrity by immunocytochemistry, immunoblotting, flow cytometry, and real‐time PCR to quantify gene expression.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Genome sequencing did not identify any genetic difference. We found decreased mitochondrial functionality with reduced cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, altered mitochondrial morphology, elevated protein levels of superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), and increased levels of peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor‐gamma coactivator‐α (<i>PPARGC1A</i>) messenger RNA (mRNA) in skin fibroblast cultures from the affected compared to the unaffected twins. Further, there was a tendency for a higher number of somatic mtDNA variants among the affected twins.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We demonstrate disease‐related differences in mitochondrial integrity in the genetically identical twins. Of note, the clinical expression matches functional alterations of the mitochondria. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Congenital heart disease (CHD) is associated with abnormal brain development in utero. We applied innovative fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to determine whether reduced fetal cerebral substrate delivery impacts the brain globally, or in a region‐specific pattern. Our novel design included two control groups, one with and the other without a family history of CHD, to explore the contribution of shared genes and/or fetal environment to brain development.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>From 2014 to 2018, we enrolled 179 pregnant women into 4 groups: “HLHS/TGA” fetuses with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) or transposition of the great arteries (TGA), diagnoses with lowest fetal cerebral substrate delivery; “CHD‐other,” with other CHD diagnoses; “CHD‐related,” healthy with a CHD family history; and “optimal control,” healthy without a family history. Two MRIs were obtained between 18 and 40 weeks gestation. Random effect regression models assessed group differences in brain volumes and relationships to hemodynamic variables.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>HLHS/TGA (n = 24), CHD‐other (50), and CHD‐related (34) groups each had generally smaller brain volumes than the optimal controls (71). Compared with CHD‐related, the HLHS/TGA group had smaller subplate (−13.3% [standard error = 4.3%], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) and intermediate (−13.7% [4.3%], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) zones, with a similar trend in ventricular zone (−7.1% [1.9%], <i>p</i> = 0.07). These volumetric reductions were associated with lower cerebral substrate delivery.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Fetuses with CHD, especially those with lowest cerebral substrate delivery, show a region‐specific pattern of small brain volumes and impaired brain growth before 32 weeks gestation. The brains of fetuses with CHD were more similar to those of CHD‐related than optimal controls, suggesting genetic or environmental factors also contribute. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Obesity is a chronic condition associated with adverse memory and emotional outcomes in humans and animal models. We have recently demonstrated that post‐weaning (i.e., periadolescent) high‐fat diet (HFD)‐induced obesity has opposite effect on hippocampal and amygdala‐dependent memory in rodents: while HFD consumption impairs spatial and relational memory, it enhances cue‐dependent emotional memory. However, it is still not clear whether this bidirectional HFD effect on memory is related to bidirectional alterations of hippocampal and amygdala synaptic plasticity and if it is influenced by the duration of diet intake. In the current study, we compared in male rats the impact of 2–3 and 6–7 months of HFD intake starting at weaning, thus covering adolescence, on in vivo long‐term potentiation (LTP) recorded simultaneously in the hippocampal area CA1 and the basolateral amygdala (BLA). As expected, 6–7 months of HFD intake abolished LTP in the CA1 and enhanced LTP in the BLA. However, 2–3 months of of HFD exposure enhanced LTP in both CA1 and BLA suggesting a transient compensatory mechanism in hippocampus. These results indicate that post‐weaning HFD intake progressively leads to bidirectional modulation of hippocampal and amygdala synaptic plasticity, as we previously demonstrated for related memory processes, yet with a different temporal dynamic.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus carries out multiple functions: spatial cognition dorsally (DH) and regulation of emotionality‐driven behavior ventrally (VH). Previously, we showed that dendrites of DH and VH pyramidal neurons of female rats are still developing robustly during adolescence and are altered by the experience of food restriction and voluntary exercise on a wheel. We tested whether such anatomical changes during adolescence impact anxiety‐like behavior and spatial cognition. Four groups of female rats were evaluated for these behaviors: those with wheel access in its cage from postnatal day (P) 36–44 (EX); those with food access restricted to 1 hr per day, from P40 to 44 (FR); those with EX from P36 to 44, combined with FR from P40 to 44, which we will refer to as EX + FR; and controls, CON (no EX, no FR). Open field test for anxiety‐like behavior and active place avoidance test for spatial cognition were conducted at P47–49, the age when food restricted animals have restored body weight, or at P54–56, to identify more enduring effects. Anxiety‐like behavior was elevated for the EX and FR groups at P47–49 but not for the EX + FR group. By P54–56, the EX + FR and EX groups exhibited less anxiety‐like behavior, indicating a beneficial delayed main effect of exercise. There was a beneficial main effect of food restriction upon cognition, as the FR group showed cognition superior to CONs' at P44–46 and P54–56, while the EX + FR animals also showed enhanced spatial learning at P54–56. EX + FR animals with best adaptation to the feeding schedule showed the best spatial learning performance but with a delay. The EX group exhibited only a transient improvement. These findings indicate that FR, EX, and EX + FR in mid‐adolescence are all beneficial in reducing anxiety‐like behavior and improving spatial cognition but with subtle differences in the timing of their manifestation, possibly reflecting the protracted maturation of the hippocampus.</p>

<p>Being widespread across different brain systems, the neuromodulatory action of acetylcholine plays a critical role in a vast range of neural processes such as learning and memory, attention, motor control, and sensory processing. In this study, we describe the spatial distribution of cholinergic neurons throughout the brain of the weakly electric fish, <i>Apteronotus leptorhynchus</i>, using in situ hybridization of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) mRNA. The presence of ChAT in brain nuclei harboring feedback projections directed to primary centers of the electrosensory pathway supports and extends our previous findings on a neuromodulatory effect of acetylcholine on the early stages of electrosensory processing.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Acetylcholine acts as a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator of many central nervous system processes such as learning and memory, attention, motor control, and sensory processing. The present study describes the spatial distribution of cholinergic neurons throughout the brain of the weakly electric fish, <i>Apteronotus leptorhynchus</i>, using in situ hybridization of choline acetyltransferase mRNA. Distinct groups of cholinergic cells were observed in the telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, and hindbrain. These included cholinergic cell groups typically identified in other vertebrate brains, for example, motor neurons. Using both in vitro and ex vivo neuronal tracing methods, we identified two new cholinergic connections leading to novel hypotheses on their functional significance. Projections to the nucleus praeeminentialis (nP) arise from isthmic nuclei, possibly including the nucleus lateralis valvulae (nLV) and the isthmic nucleus (nI). The nP is a central component of all electrosensory feedback pathways to the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL). We have previously shown that some neurons in nP, TS, and tectum express muscarinic receptors. We hypothesize that, based on nLV/nI cell responses in other teleosts and isthmic connectivity in <i>A</i>. <i>leptorhynchus</i>, the isthmic connections to nP, TS, and tectum modulate responses to electrosensory and/or visual motion and, in particular, to looming/receding stimuli. In addition, we found that the octavolateral efferent (OE) nucleus is the likely source of cholinergic fibers innervating the ELL. In other teleosts, OE inhibits octavolateral hair cells during locomotion. In gymnotiform fish, OE may also act on the first central processing stage and, we hypothesize, implement corollary discharge modulation of electrosensory processing during locomotion.</p>

<p>Early brain insult, interfering with its maturation, may result in psychotic-like disturbances in adult life. Redox dysfunctions and neuroinflammation contribute to long-term psychiatric consequences due to neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Here, we investigated the effects of early pharmacological modulation of the redox and inflammatory states, through celastrol, and indomethacin administration, on reactive oxygen species (ROS) amount, levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase 1, SOD1, glutathione, GSH, and catalase, CAT), as well as of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, TNF-α, interleukin-6, IL-6, and interleukin-1 beta, IL-1β), in the prefrontal cortex of adult mice exposed to a neurotoxic insult, i.e. ketamine administration, in postnatal life. Early celastrol or indomethacin prevented ketamine-induced elevations in cortical ROS production. MDA levels in ketamine-treated mice, also administered with celastrol, were comparable with the control ones. Indomethacin also prevented the increase in lipid peroxidation following early ketamine administration. Whereas no significant differences were detected in SOD1, GSH, and CAT levels between ketamine and saline-administered mice, celastrol elevated the cortical amount of these antioxidant enzymes and the same effect was induced by indomethacin per se. Both celastrol and indomethacin prevented ketamine-induced enhancement in TNF-α and IL-1β levels, however, they had no effects on increased IL-6 amount resulting from ketamine exposure in postnatal life. In conclusion, our data suggest that an early increase in cortical ROS scavenging and reduction of lipid peroxidation, via the enhancement of antioxidant defense, together with inhibition of neuroinflammation, may represent a therapeutic opportunity against psychotic-like disturbances resulting, later in life, from the effects of a neurotoxic insult on the developing brain.</p>

<p>Tauopathies are the most common type of neurodegenerative proteinopathy, being characterized by cytoplasmic aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. The formation and morphologies of these tau inclusions, the distribution of the lesions and related metabolic changes in cytoplasm differ among different tauopathies. The aim of this study was to examine whether there are differences in the post-translational modifications (PTMs) in the pathological tau proteins. We analyzed sarkosyl-insoluble pathological tau proteins prepared from brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease, Pick’s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, globular glial tauopathy, and frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonisms linked to chromosome 17 with tau inclusions using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. In pathological tau proteins associated with a wide range of tauopathies, 170 PTMs in total were identified including new PTMs. Among them, common PTMs were localized in the N- and C-terminal flanking regions of the microtubule binding repeats and PTMs, which were considered to be disease-specific, were found in microtubule binding repeats forming filament core. These suggested that the differences in PTMs reflected the differences in tau filament core structures in each disease.</p>

<p>How neurons in the eye feed signals back to photoreceptors to optimize sensitivity to patterns of light appears to be mediated by one or more unconventional mechanisms. Via these mechanisms, horizontal cells control photoreceptor synaptic gain and enhance key aspects of temporal and spatial center-surround receptive field antagonism. After the transduction of light energy into an electrical signal in photoreceptors, the next key task in visual processing is the transmission of an optimized signal to the follower neurons in the retina. For this to happen, the release of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate from photoreceptors is carefully regulated via horizontal cell feedback, which acts as a thermostat to keep the synaptic transmission in an optimal range during changes to light patterns and intensities. Novel findings of a recently described model that casts a classical neurotransmitter system together with ion transport mechanisms to adjust the alkaline milieu outside the synapse are reviewed. This novel inter-neuronal messaging system carries feedback signals using two separate, but interwoven regulated systems. The complex interplay between these two signaling modalities, creating synaptic modulation-at-a-distance, has obscured it’s being defined. The foundations of our understanding of the feedback mechanism from horizontal cells to photoreceptors have been long established: Horizontal cells have broad receptive fields, suitable for providing surround inhibition, their membrane potential, a function of stimulus intensity and size, regulates inhibition of photoreceptor voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, and strong artificial pH buffering eliminates this action. This review compares and contrasts models of how these foundations are linked, focusing on a recent report in mammals that shows tonic horizontal cell release of GABA activating Cl<sup>−</sup> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> permeable GABA autoreceptors. The membrane potential of horizontal cells provides the driving force for GABAR-mediated HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> efflux, alkalinizing the cleft when horizontal cells are hyperpolarized by light or adding to their depolarization in darkness and contributing to cleft acidification via NHE-mediated H<sup>+</sup> efflux. This model challenges interpretations of earlier studies that were considered to rule out a role for GABA in feedback to cones.</p>

<p>Glioblastoma (GBM) is the deadliest brain tumor. Its poor prognosis is due to cell heterogeneity, invasiveness, and high vascularization that impede an efficient therapeutic approach. In the past few years, several molecular links connecting GBM to neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) were identified at preclinical and clinical level. In particular, giving the increasing critical role that epigenetic alterations play in both GBM and NDDs, we deeply analyzed the role of miRNAs, small non-coding RNAs acting epigenetic modulators in several key biological processes. Specific miRNAs, transported by extracellular vesicles (EVs), act as intercellular communication signals in both diseases. In this way, miRNA-loaded EVs modulate GBM tumorigenesis, as they spread oncogenic signaling within brain parenchyma, and control the aggregation of neurotoxic protein (Tau, Aβ-amyloid peptide, and α-synuclein) in NDDs. In this review, we highlight the most promising miRNAs linking GBM and NDDs playing a significant pathogenic role in both diseases.</p>

<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by the progressive degeneration of the motor neurons that innervate muscle, resulting in gradual paralysis and culminating in the inability to breathe or swallow. This neuronal degeneration occurs in a spatiotemporal manner from a point of onset in the central nervous system (CNS), suggesting that there is a molecule that spreads from cell-to-cell. There is strong evidence that the onset and progression of ALS pathology is a consequence of protein misfolding and aggregation. In line with this, a hallmark pathology of ALS is protein deposition and inclusion formation within motor neurons and surrounding glia of the proteins TAR DNA-binding protein 43, superoxide dismutase-1, or fused in sarcoma. Collectively, the observed protein aggregation, in conjunction with the spatiotemporal spread of symptoms, strongly suggests a prion-like propagation of protein aggregation occurs in ALS. In this review, we discuss the role of protein aggregation in ALS concerning protein homeostasis (proteostasis) mechanisms and prion-like propagation. Furthermore, we examine the experimental models used to investigate these processes, including in vitro assays, cultured cells, invertebrate models, and murine models. Finally, we evaluate the therapeutics that may best prevent the onset or spread of pathology in ALS and discuss what lies on the horizon for treating this currently incurable disease.</p>

Background<p>Corticospinal tract impairment is no longer an absolute exclusion in the updated Movement Disorder Society Parkinson’s disease criteria. Triple stimulation technique (TST) is an accurate method to quantitatively assess the integrity and impairment of corticospinal pathway in a variety of neurological diseases. This study aims to evaluate the corticospinal tract impairment in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients using TST.</p>Methods<p>Ten PD patients, 19 multiple-system atrophy parkinsonian variant (MSA-P) patients, and 12 healthy controls (HC) were sequentially recruited in this study. Information of age, disease duration, pyramidal signs, and Hoehn and Yahr (H&amp;Y) stage was obtained from all patients. The TST was assessed at right abductor digiti minimi for HCs and both sides for patients. The Chi-square test was used for categorical variables, and variance analysis was performed for continuous variables in comparing the difference among PD, MSA-P, and HC, plus the post hoc tests for pairwise comparisons.</p>Results<p>All subjects were age and gender matched. There was no significant difference in disease duration (p = 0.855), H-Y stage (p = 0.067), and the percentage of pyramidal signs present (p = 0.581) between MSA-P and PD patients. The mean TST ratio was 55.5 ± 32.2%, 81.7 ± 19.8%, and 96.8 ± 3.0% for PD, MSA-P, and HCs, correspondingly. PD patients had a significant lower TST amplitude ratio than MSA-P and HCs. The TST ratio of MSA-P was lower than HCs, but there was no significant difference (p = 0.160). Additionally, it was significantly higher in percentage of abnormal TST ratio between PD patients and MSA-P (p = 0.010).</p>Conclusion<p>Corticospinal tract impairment is not a rare manifestation in PD and can be quantitatively evaluated with TST. The result needs to be verified in amplified sample.</p>

<p>The pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) remains elusive. Current thinking suggests that the activation of microglia and the subsequent release of inflammatory factors, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), are involved in the pathogenesis of PD. P2X4 receptor (P2X4R) is a member of the P2X superfamily of ion channels activated by ATP. To study the possible effect of the ATP-P2X4R signal axis on IL-6 in PD, lentivirus carrying the P2X4R-overexpression gene or empty vector was injected into the substantia nigra (SN) of rats, followed by treatment of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) or saline 1 week later. The research found the relative expression of P2X4R in the 6-OHDA-induced PD rat models was notably higher than that in the normal. And P2X4R overexpression could upregulate the expression of IL-6, reduce the amount of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the SN of PD rats, suggesting that P2X4R may mediate the production of IL-6 to damage DA neurons in the SN. Our data revealed the important role of P2X4R in modulating IL-6, which leads to neuroinflammation involved in PD pathogenesis.</p>

Background<p>The corpus callosum (CC) is an important feature of Parkinson’s disease (PD) not only in motor but also in non-motor functions.

According to their specific callosal–cortical connectivity, 3D CC was divided into five subsections (including prefrontal, premotor, motor, somatosensory, and temporal–parietal–occipital subsection). The fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and volume of whole CC and its subsections were computed and compared between groups. Regression model was constructed to explore the relationships between callosal structure and clinical performance.</p>Results<p>At baseline, PD did not show any significant macro/microstructural difference compared with NC. During disease course, there was a decreased FA and increased MD of whole CC as well as its subsections (except temporal–parietal–occipital subsection), and the volume of motor subsection was decreased. Moreover, the FA of temporal–parietal–occipital subsection and volume of motor subsection were correlated with the mood domain at baseline, and the MD of somatosensory subsection was associated with the motor domain at follow-up.</p>Conclusion<p>The structure of CC and its connectivity-specific subsections remain preserved at a relatively early stage in PD and are progressively disrupted during disease course. Besides, different callosal subsections possess specific associations with clinical performance in PD.</p>

<p>by Zhewei Zhang, Huzi Cheng, Tianming Yang</p>

The brain makes flexible and adaptive responses in a complicated and ever-changing environment for an organism’s survival. To achieve this, the brain needs to understand the contingencies between its sensory inputs, actions, and rewards. This is analogous to the statistical inference that has been extensively studied in the natural language processing field, where recent developments of recurrent neural networks have found many successes. We wonder whether these neural networks, the gated recurrent unit (GRU) networks in particular, reflect how the brain solves the contingency problem. Therefore, we build a GRU network framework inspired by the statistical learning approach of NLP and test it with four exemplar behavior tasks previously used in empirical studies. The network models are trained to predict future events based on past events, both comprising sensory, action, and reward events. We show the networks can successfully reproduce animal and human behavior. The networks generalize the training, perform Bayesian inference in novel conditions, and adapt their choices when event contingencies vary. Importantly, units in the network encode task variables and exhibit activity patterns that match previous neurophysiology findings. Our results suggest that the neural network approach based on statistical sequence learning may reflect the brain’s computational principle underlying flexible and adaptive behaviors and serve as a useful approach to understand the brain.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7aA5WRiolew" width="1" />

<p>by Mario Castro, Rob J. de Boer</p>

Successful mathematical modeling of biological processes relies on the expertise of the modeler to capture the essential mechanisms in the process at hand and on the ability to extract useful information from empirical data. A model is said to be structurally unidentifiable, if different quantitative sets of parameters provide the same observable outcome. This is typical (but not exclusive) of partially observed problems in which only a few variables can be experimentally measured. Most of the available methods to test the structural identifiability of a model are either too complex mathematically for the general practitioner to be applied, or require involved calculations or numerical computation for complex non-linear models. In this work, we present a new analytical method to test structural identifiability of models based on ordinary differential equations, based on the invariance of the equations under the scaling transformation of its parameters. The method is based on rigorous mathematical results but it is easy and quick to apply, even to test the identifiability of sophisticated highly non-linear models. We illustrate our method by example and compare its performance with other existing methods in the literature.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HAYuyv4tK4U" width="1" />

<p>by Silvia Moriano-Gutierrez, Clotilde Bongrand, Tara Essock-Burns, Leo Wu, Margaret J. McFall-Ngai, Edward G. Ruby</p>

The regulatory noncoding small RNAs (sRNAs) of bacteria are key elements influencing gene expression; however, there has been little evidence that beneficial bacteria use these molecules to communicate with their animal hosts. We report here that the bacterial sRNA SsrA plays an essential role in the light-organ symbiosis between <i>Vibrio fischeri</i> and the squid <i>Euprymna scolopes</i>. The symbionts load SsrA into outer membrane vesicles, which are transported specifically into the epithelial cells surrounding the symbiont population in the light organ. Although an SsrA-deletion mutant (Δ<i>ssrA</i>) colonized the host to a normal level after 24 h, it produced only 2/10 the luminescence per bacterium, and its persistence began to decline by 48 h. The host’s response to colonization by the Δ<i>ssrA</i> strain was also abnormal: the epithelial cells underwent premature swelling, and host robustness was reduced. Most notably, when colonized by the Δ<i>ssrA</i> strain, the light organ differentially up-regulated 10 genes, including several encoding heightened immune-function or antimicrobial activities. This study reveals the potential for a bacterial symbiont’s sRNAs not only to control its own activities but also to trigger critical responses promoting homeostasis in its host. In the absence of this communication, there are dramatic fitness consequences for both partners.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Ky-s1sD_AiM" width="1" />

<p>by Tim P. Castello-Waldow, Ghabiba Weston, Alessandro F. Ulivi, Alireza Chenani, Yonatan Loewenstein, Alon Chen, Alessio Attardo</p>

Experiences are represented in the brain by patterns of neuronal activity. Ensembles of neurons representing experience undergo activity-dependent plasticity and are important for learning and recall. They are thus considered cellular engrams of memory. Yet, the cellular events that bias neurons to become part of a neuronal representation are largely unknown. In rodents, turnover of structural connectivity has been proposed to underlie the turnover of neuronal representations and also to be a cellular mechanism defining the time duration for which memories are stored in the hippocampus. If these hypotheses are true, structural dynamics of connectivity should be involved in the formation of neuronal representations and concurrently important for learning and recall. To tackle these questions, we used deep-brain 2-photon (2P) time-lapse imaging in transgenic mice in which neurons expressing the Immediate Early Gene (IEG) <i>Arc</i> (activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein) could be permanently labeled during a specific time window. This enabled us to investigate the dynamics of excitatory synaptic connectivity—using dendritic spines as proxies—of hippocampal CA1 (cornu ammonis 1) pyramidal neurons (PNs) becoming part of neuronal representations exploiting <i>Arc</i> as an indicator of being part of neuronal representations. We discovered that neurons that will prospectively express <i>Arc</i> have slower turnover of synaptic connectivity, thus suggesting that synaptic stability prior to experience can bias neurons to become part of representations or possibly engrams. We also found a negative correlation between stability of structural synaptic connectivity and the ability to recall features of a hippocampal-dependent memory, which suggests that faster structural turnover in hippocampal CA1 might be functional for memory.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0J66rjU2rN0" width="1" />

<p>by Jonathan Andrew Cheung, Phillip Maire, Jinho Kim, Kiana Lee, Garrett Flynn, Samuel Andrew Hires</p>

During active tactile exploration, the dynamic patterns of touch are transduced to electrical signals and transformed by the brain into a mental representation of the object under investigation. This transformation from sensation to perception is thought to be a major function of the mammalian cortex. In primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of mice, layer 5 (L5) pyramidal neurons are major outputs to downstream areas that influence perception, decision-making, and motor control. We investigated self-motion and touch representations in L5 of S1 with juxtacellular loose-seal patch recordings of optogenetically identified excitatory neurons. We found that during rhythmic whisker movement, 54 of 115 active neurons (47%) represented self-motion. This population was significantly more modulated by whisker angle than by phase. Upon active touch, a distinct pattern of activity was evoked across L5, which represented the whisker angle at the time of touch. Object location was decodable with submillimeter precision from the touch-evoked spike counts of a randomly sampled handful of these neurons. These representations of whisker angle during self-motion and touch were independent, both in the selection of which neurons were active and in the angle-tuning preference of coactive neurons. Thus, the output of S1 transiently shifts from a representation of self-motion to an independent representation of explored object location during active touch.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/8D57Lxj_qPU" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess whether cerebral small vessel disease CT biomarkers are associated with long‐term outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a prospective, community‐based cohort study of adults diagnosed with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage between 1<sup>st</sup> June 2010 – 31<sup>st</sup> May 2013. A neuroradiologist rated the diagnostic brain CT for acute intracerebral hemorrhage features and small vessel disease biomarkers. We used severity of white matter lucencies and cerebral atrophy, and the number of lacunes to calculate the CT SVD score. We assessed the association between CT small vessel disease biomarkers and either death or death or dependence (modified Rankin scale scores 4‐6) one year after first‐ever intracerebral hemorrhage using logistic regression, adjusting for known predictors of outcome.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Within one year of intracerebral hemorrhage, 224 (56%) of 402 patients died. In separate models, one‐year death was associated with severe atrophy (aOR 2.54, 95%CI 1.44‐4.49, p=0.001) but not lacunes or severe white matter lucencies, and CT SVD sum score ≥1 (aOR 2.50, 95%CI 1.40‐4.45, p=0.002). Two hundred and seventy‐seven (73%) of 378 patients with modified Rankin scale data were dead or dependent at one year. In separate models, one‐year death or dependence was associated with severe atrophy (aOR 3.67, 95%CI 1.71‐7.89, p=0.001) and severe white matter lucencies (aOR 2.18, 95%CI 1.06‐4.51, p=0.035) but not lacunes, and CT SVD sum score ≥1 (aOR 2.81, 95%CI 1.45‐5.46, p=0.002).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Small vessel disease biomarkers on the diagnostic brain CT are associated with one‐year death and dependence after intracerebral hemorrhage, independent of known predictors of outcome.</p>

<p>Neurons derived from patient induced pluripotent stem cells harboring ACTL6B p.(Val421_Cys425del) variant display reduced expression and stability of ACTL6B protein and increased spontaneous neuronal activity <i>in vitro</i>.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>ACTL6B is a component of the neuronal BRG1/brm‐associated factor (nBAF) complex, which is required for chromatin remodeling in postmitotic neurons. We recently reported biallelic pathogenic variants in <i>ACTL6B</i> in patients diagnosed with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy, subtype 76 (EIEE‐76), presenting with severe, global developmental delay, epileptic encephalopathy, cerebral atrophy, and abnormal central nervous system myelination. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying their phenotype is unknown. Here, we investigate the molecular pathogenesis of ACTL6B p.(Val421_Cys425del) using <i>in silico</i> 3D protein modeling predictions and patient‐specific induced pluripotent stem cell‐derived neurons. We found neurons derived from EIEE‐76 patients showed impaired accumulation of ACTL6B compared to unaffected relatives, caused by reduced protein stability. Furthermore, EIEE‐76 patient‐derived neurons had dysregulated nBAF target gene expression, including genes important for neuronal development and disease. Multielectrode array system analysis unveiled elevated electrophysiological activity of EIEE‐76 patients‐derived neurons, consistent with the patient phenotype. Taken together, our findings validate a new model for EIEE‐76 and reveal how reduced ACTL6B expression affects neuronal function.</p>

<p>The ventral tegmental area (VTA) underlies motivation and reinforcement of natural rewards. The lateral preoptic area (LPO) is an anterior hypothalamic brain region that sends direct projections to the VTA and to other brain structures known to regulate VTA activity. Here, we investigated the functional connection between the LPO and subpopulations of VTA neurons and explored the reinforcing and valence qualities of the LPO in rats. We found that the LPO and the LPO→VTA pathway inhibit the activity of VTA GABA neurons and have mixed effects on VTA dopamine neurons. Furthermore, we found that the LPO supports operant responding but drives avoidance, and we explored the apparent discrepancy between these two results. Finally, using fiber photometry, we show that the LPO signals aversive events but not rewarding events. Together, our findings demonstrate that the LPO modulates the activity of the VTA and drives motivated behavior and represents an overlooked modulator of reinforcement.</p>

<p>Aging is associated with subjective memory complaints. Approximately half of those with subjective memory complaints have objective cognitive impairment. Previous studies have provided evidence of an association between genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and dementia progression. Also, aging is a significant risk factor for vascular pathology that may underlie at least some of the cognitive changes. This study investigates the relative contribution of subjective cognitive complaints (SCC), vascular function, and genetic risk for dementia in predicting objective cognitive performance. Multiple regression and relative importance analysis were used to investigate the relative contribution of vascular function, self-reported SCC, and dementia genetic risk, in predicting objective cognition in a sample of 238 healthy community-dwelling older adults. Age, sex, premorbid cognitive abilities, subjective verbal memory complaints, higher cerebrovascular blood flow during submaximal exercise, and certain dementia risk alleles were significant predictors of worse objective verbal memory performance (p &lt; 0.001, R<sup>2</sup> = 35.2–36.4%). Using relative importance analysis, subjective verbal memory complaints, and certain dementia risk alleles contributed more variance than cerebrovascular measures. These results suggest that age-related changes in memory in healthy older adults can be predicted by subjective memory complaints, genetic risk, and to a lesser extent, cerebrovascular function.</p>

Degree centrality (DC)—a graph theory-based measurement of global connectivity at the voxel level by measuring the number of instantaneous functional connections between one region and the rest of the brain—can map brain hubs with high sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility. DC was used to explore alterations in the centrality of PD-FOG correlated with brain node levels.

<p>Photoreceptor death contributes to 50% of irreversible vision loss in the western world. Pro23His (P23H) transgenic albino rat strains are widely used models for the most common rhodopsin gene mutation associated with the autosomal dominant form of retinitis pigmentosa. However, the mechanism(s) by which photoreceptor death occurs are not well understood and were the principal aim of this study. We first used electroretinogram recording and optical coherence tomography to confirm the time course of functional and structural loss. Electroretinogram analyses revealed significantly decreased rod photoreceptor (a-wave), bipolar cell (b-wave) and amacrine cell responses (oscillatory potentials) from P30 onward. The cone-mediated b-wave was also decreased from P30. TUNEL analysis showed extensive cell death at P18, with continued labeling detected until P30. Focused gene expression arrays indicated activation of, apoptosis, autophagy and necroptosis in whole retina from P14-18. However, analysis of mitochondrial permeability changes (ΔΨm) using JC-1 dye, combined with immunofluorescence markers for caspase-dependent (cleaved caspase-3) and caspase-independent (AIF) cell death pathways, indicated mitochondrial-mediated cell death was not a major contributor to photoreceptor death. By contrast, reverse-phase protein array data combined with RIPK3 and phospho-MLKL immunofluorescence indicated widespread necroptosis as the predominant mechanism of photoreceptor death. These findings highlight the complexity of mechanisms involved in photoreceptor death in the Pro23His rat model of degeneration and suggest therapies that target necroptosis should be considered for their potential to reduce photoreceptor death.</p>

<p>Advances in video conferencing capabilities combined with dramatic socio-dynamic shifts brought about by COVID-19, have redefined the ways in which humans interact in modern society. From business meetings to medical exams, or from classroom instruction to yoga class, virtual interfacing has permeated nearly every aspect of our daily lives. A seemingly endless stream of technological advances combined with our newfound reliance on virtual interfacing makes it likely that humans will continue to use this modern form of social interaction into the future. However, emergent evidence suggests that virtual interfacing may not be equivalent to face-to-face interactions. Ultimately, too little is currently understood about the mechanisms that underlie human interactions over the virtual divide, including how these mechanisms differ from traditional face-to-face interaction. Here, we propose functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning—simultaneous measurement of two or more brains—as an optimal approach to quantify potential neurocognitive differences between virtual and in-person interactions. We argue that increased focus on this understudied domain will help elucidate the reasons why virtual conferencing doesn't always stack up to in-person meetings and will also serve to spur new technologies designed to improve the virtual interaction experience. On the basis of existing fNIRS hyperscanning literature, we highlight the current gaps in research regarding virtual interactions. Furthermore, we provide insight into current hurdles regarding fNIRS hyperscanning hardware and methodology that should be addressed in order to shed light on this newly critical element of everyday life.</p>

<p>The retrosplenial cortex forms part of the cingulate cortex and is involved in memory and navigation. It is ventral region, the granular retrosplenial cortex, or GRSC is characterized by the presence, of small pyramidal neurons with a distinctive late-spiking (LS) firing pattern in layer 2/3. Using in vitro brain slices of the mouse GRSC we have studied the electrophysiological properties and synaptic responses of these LS neurons, comparing them with neighboring non-LS pyramidal neurons. LS and non-LS neurons showed different responses during cortical propagation of epileptiform discharges. All non-LS neurons generated large supra-threshold excitatory responses that generated bursts of action potentials. Contrastingly, the LS neurons showed small, and invariably subthreshold excitatory synaptic potentials. Although both types of pyramidal neurons were readily intermingled in the GRSC, we observed differences in their innervation by cortico-cortical axons. The application of glutamate to activate cortical neurons evoked synaptic responses in LS neurons only when applied at less than 250 μm, while in non-LS neurons we found synaptic responses when glutamate was applied at larger distances. Analysis of the synaptic responses evoked by long-range cortico-cortical axons (with the origin at 1200 μm from the recorded neurons or in the contralateral hemisphere) confirmed that non-LS neurons were strongly innervated by these axons, while they evoked only small responses or no response at all in the LS neurons (contralateral stimulation, non-LS: 194.0 ± 196.63 pA, n = 22; LS: 51.91 ± 35.26 pA, n = 10; p = 0.004). The excitatory/inhibitory balance was similar in both types of pyramidal neurons, but the latency of the EPSCs evoked by long-range cortico-cortical axons was longer in LS neurons (contralateral stimulation non-LS: 8.13 ± 1.23 ms, n = 17; LS: 10.76 ± 1.58 ms, n = 7; p = 0.004) suggesting a disynaptic mechanism. Our findings highlight the differential cortico-cortical axonal innervation of LS and non-LS pyramidal neurons, and that the two types of neurons are incorporated in different cortico-cortical neuronal circuits. This strongly suggests that the functional organization of the dorsal part of the GRSC is based on independent cortico-cortical circuits (among other elements).</p>

<p>The current study investigates the neurotrophic effects of Clostridium botulinum C3 transferase (C3bot) on highly purified, glia-free, GABAergic, and glutamatergic neurons. Incubation with nanomolar concentrations of C3bot promotes dendrite formation as well as dendritic and axonal outgrowth in rat GABAergic neurons. A comparison of C3bot effects on sorted mouse GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons obtained from newly established NexCre;Ai9xVGAT Venus mice revealed a higher sensitivity of GABAergic cells to axonotrophic and dendritic effects of C3bot in terms of process length and branch formation. Protein biochemical analysis of known C3bot binding partners revealed comparable amounts of β1 integrin in both cell types but a higher expression of vimentin in GABAergic neurons. Accordingly, binding of C3bot to GABAergic neurons was stronger than binding to glutamatergic neurons. A combinatory treatment of glutamatergic neurons with C3bot and vimentin raised the amount of bound C3bot to levels comparable to the ones in GABAergic neurons, thereby confirming the specificity of effects. Overall, different surface vimentin levels between GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons exist that mediate neurotrophic C3bot effects.</p>

<p>Non-evoked miniature release of neurotransmitters is increasingly recognized as playing an important role in neural function and is implicated in synaptic plasticity, metaplasticity, and homeostasis. Spontaneous miniature release events (minis) are usually measured electrophysiologically by recording the miniature postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) that they evoke. However, this indirect technique can be confounded by changes within the postsynaptic neuron. Here, using the fluorescent probe SynaptopHluorin 2×, we have developed an optical method for the measurement of minis that enables direct assessment of release events. We use the technique to reveal that the frequency of minis following incubation of hippocampal neurons with Amyloid β oligomers (Aβo) is increased. Electrophysiological mEPSC recordings obtained under the same conditions report a decrease in frequency, with the discrepancy likely due to Aβo-induced changes in quantal size. Optical quantal analysis of minis may therefore have a role in the study of minis in both normal physiology and disease, as it can circumvent potential confounds caused by postsynaptic changes.</p>

<p>The effective management and therapies for Parkinson’s disease (PD) require appropriate clinical evaluation. The Parkinson’s KinetiGraph (PKG) is a wearable sensor system that can monitor the motion characteristics of PD objectively and continuously. This study was aimed to assess the correlations between PKG data and clinical scores of bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and fluctuation. It also aims to explore the application value of identifying early motor symptoms. An observational study of 100 PD patients wearing the PKG for ≥ 6 days was performed. It provides a series of data, such as the bradykinesia score (BKS), percent time tremor (PTT), dyskinesia score (DKS), and fluctuation and dyskinesia score (FDS). PKG data and UPDRS scores were analyzed, including UPDRS III total scores, UPDRS III-bradykinesia scores (UPDRS III-B: items 23–26, 31), UPDRS III-rigidity scores (UPDRS III-R: item 22), and scores from the Wearing-off Questionnaire (WOQ-9). This study shows that there was significant correlation between BKS and UPDRS III scores, including UPDRS III total scores, UPDRS III-B, and UPDRS III-R scores (r = 0.479–0.588, p ≤ 0.001), especially in the early-stage group (r = 0.682, p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, we found that BKS in patients with left-sided onset (33.57 ± 5.14, n = 37) is more serious than in patients with right-sided onset (29.87 ± 6.86, n = 26). Our findings support the feasibility of using the PKG to detect abnormal movements, especially bradykinesia in PD. It is suitable for the early detection, remote monitoring, and timely treatment of PD symptoms.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common forms of dementia, marked by progressively degrading cognitive function. Although cerebellar changes occur throughout AD progression, its involvement and predictive contribution in its earliest stages, as well as gray or white matter components involved, remains unclear. We used MRI machine learning-based classification to assess the contribution of two tissue components [volume fraction myelin (VFM), and gray matter (GM) volume] within the whole brain, the neocortex, the whole cerebellum as well as its anterior and posterior parts and their predictive contribution to the first two stages of AD and typically aging controls. While classification accuracy increased with AD stages, VFM was the best predictor for all early stages of dementia when compared with typically aging controls. However, we document overall higher cerebellar prediction accuracy when compared to the whole brain with distinct structural signatures of higher anterior cerebellar contribution to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and higher posterior cerebellar contribution to mild/moderate stages of AD for each tissue property. Based on these different cerebellar profiles and their unique contribution to early disease stages, we propose a refined model of cerebellar contribution to early AD development.</p>

<p>by Anahita Bayani, Joanne L. Dunster, Jonathan J. Crofts, Martin R. Nelson</p>

Many common medical conditions (such as cancer, arthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and others) are associated with inflammation, and even more so when combined with the effects of ageing and multimorbidity. While the inflammatory response varies in different tissue types, under disease and in response to therapeutic interventions, it has common interactions that occur between immune cells and inflammatory mediators. Understanding these underlying inflammatory mechanisms is key in progressing treatments and therapies for numerous inflammatory conditions. It is now considered that constituent mechanisms of the inflammatory response can be actively manipulated in order to drive resolution of inflammatory damage; particularly, those mechanisms related to the pro-inflammatory role of neutrophils and the anti-inflammatory role of macrophages. In this article, we describe the assembly of a hybrid mathematical model in which the spatial spread of inflammatory mediators is described through partial differential equations, and immune cells (neutrophils and macrophages) are described individually via an agent-based modelling approach. We pay close attention to how immune cells chemotax toward pro-inflammatory mediators, presenting a model for cell chemotaxis that is calibrated against experimentally observed cell trajectories in healthy and COPD-affected scenarios. We illustrate how variations in key model parameters can drive the switch from resolution of inflammation to chronic outcomes, and show that aberrant neutrophil chemotaxis can move an otherwise healthy outcome to one of chronicity. Finally, we reflect on our results in the context of the on-going hunt for new therapeutic interventions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/53zyQmYx9RA" width="1" />

Cytochrome P450 2D6 (<i>CYP2D6</i>) is a highly polymorphic gene whose protein product metabolizes more than 20% of clinically used drugs. Genetic variations in <i>CYP2D6</i> are responsible for interindividual heterogeneity in drug response that can lead to drug toxicity and ineffective treatment, making <i>CYP2D6</i> one of the most important pharmacogenes. Prediction of CYP2D6 phenotype relies on curation of literature-derived functional studies to assign a functional status to <i>CYP2D6</i> haplotypes. As the number of large-scale sequencing efforts grows, new haplotypes continue to be discovered, and assignment of function is challenging to maintain. To address this challenge, we have trained a convolutional neural network to predict functional status of <i>CYP2D6</i> haplotypes, called Hubble.2D6. Hubble.2D6 predicts haplotype function from sequence data and was trained using two pre-training steps with a combination of real and simulated data. We find that Hubble.2D6 predicts <i>CYP2D6</i> haplotype functional status with 88% accuracy in a held-out test set and explains 47.5% of the variance in <i>in vitro</i> functional data among star alleles with unknown function. Hubble.2D6 may be a useful tool for assigning function to haplotypes with uncurated function, and used for screening individuals who are at risk of being poor metabolizers.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Luls_obX_7o" width="1" />

<p>by Román Zapién-Campos, Michael Sieber, Arne Traulsen</p>

Macroorganisms are inhabited by microbial communities that often change through the lifespan of an individual. One of the factors contributing to this change is colonization from the environment. The colonization of initially microbe-free hosts is particularly interesting, as their microbiome depends entirely on microbes of external origin. We present a mathematical model of this process with a particular emphasis on the effect of ecological drift and a finite host lifespan. Our results indicate the host lifespan becomes especially relevant for short-living organisms (e.g. <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, and <i>Danio rerio</i>). In this case, alternative microbiome states (often called enterotypes), the coexistence of microbe-free and colonized hosts, and a reduced probability of colonization can be observed in our model. These results unify multiple reported observations around colonization and suggest that no selective or deterministic drivers are necessary to explain them.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tutDqAxOPYY" width="1" />

Mathematical modelling has successfully been used to provide quantitative descriptions of many viral infections, but for the Ebola virus, which requires biosafety level 4 facilities for experimentation, modelling can play a crucial role. Ebola modelling efforts have primarily focused on <i>in vivo</i> virus kinetics, e.g., in animal models, to aid the development of antivirals and vaccines. But, thus far, these studies have not yielded a detailed specification of the infection cycle, which could provide a foundational description of the virus kinetics and thus a deeper understanding of their clinical manifestation. Here, we obtain a diverse experimental data set of the Ebola infection <i>in vitro</i>, and then make use of Bayesian inference methods to fully identify parameters in a mathematical model of the infection. Our results provide insights into the distribution of time an infected cell spends in the eclipse phase (the period between infection and the start of virus production), as well as the rate at which infectious virions lose infectivity. We suggest how these results can be used in future models to describe co-infection with defective interfering particles, which are an emerging alternative therapeutic.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/u_zXlulEMdw" width="1" />

<p>by Ling Chen, John A. Capra</p>

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in identifying gene regulatory sequences, but they have provided limited insight into the biology of regulatory elements due to the difficulty of interpreting the complex features they learn. Several models of how combinatorial binding of transcription factors, i.e. the regulatory grammar, drives enhancer activity have been proposed, ranging from the flexible TF billboard model to the stringent enhanceosome model. However, there is limited knowledge of the prevalence of these (or other) sequence architectures across enhancers. Here we perform several hypothesis-driven analyses to explore the ability of DNNs to learn the regulatory grammar of enhancers. We created synthetic datasets based on existing hypotheses about combinatorial transcription factor binding site (TFBS) patterns, including homotypic clusters, heterotypic clusters, and enhanceosomes, from real TF binding motifs from diverse TF families. We then trained deep residual neural networks (ResNets) to model the sequences under a range of scenarios that reflect real-world multi-label regulatory sequence prediction tasks. We developed a gradient-based unsupervised clustering method to extract the patterns learned by the ResNet models. We demonstrated that simulated regulatory grammars are best learned in the penultimate layer of the ResNets, and the proposed method can accurately retrieve the regulatory grammar even when there is heterogeneity in the enhancer categories and a large fraction of TFBS outside of the regulatory grammar. However, we also identify common scenarios where ResNets fail to learn simulated regulatory grammars. Finally, we applied the proposed method to mouse developmental enhancers and were able to identify the components of a known heterotypic TF cluster. Our results provide a framework for interpreting the regulatory rules learned by ResNets, and they demonstrate that the ability and efficiency of ResNets in learning the regulatory grammar depends on the nature of the prediction task.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-1BE1zUKgWQ" width="1" />

To increase statistical power to identify genes associated with complex traits, a number of transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) methods have been proposed using gene expression as a mediating trait linking genetic variations and diseases. These methods first predict expression levels based on inferred expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and then identify expression-mediated genetic effects on diseases by associating phenotypes with predicted expression levels. The success of these methods critically depends on the identification of eQTLs, which may not be functional in the corresponding tissue, due to linkage disequilibrium (LD) and the correlation of gene expression between tissues. Here, we introduce a new method called T-GEN (Transcriptome-mediated identification of disease-associated Genes with Epigenetic aNnotation) to identify disease-associated genes leveraging epigenetic information. Through prioritizing SNPs with tissue-specific epigenetic annotation, T-GEN can better identify SNPs that are both statistically predictive and biologically functional. We found that a significantly higher percentage (an increase of 18.7% to 47.2%) of eQTLs identified by T-GEN are inferred to be functional by ChromHMM and more are deleterious based on their Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) scores. Applying T-GEN to 207 complex traits, we were able to identify more trait-associated genes (ranging from 7.7% to 102%) than those from existing methods. Among the identified genes associated with these traits, T-GEN can better identify genes with high (&gt;0.99) pLI scores compared to other methods. When T-GEN was applied to late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, we identified 96 genes located at 15 loci, including two novel loci not implicated in previous GWAS. We further replicated 50 genes in an independent GWAS, including one of the two novel loci.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AzRN6SQGfzs" width="1" />

In the modern genomic era, scientists without extensive bioinformatic training need to apply high-power computational analyses to critical tasks like phage genome annotation. At the Center for Phage Technology (CPT), we developed a suite of phage-oriented tools housed in open, user-friendly web-based interfaces. A Galaxy platform conducts computationally intensive analyses and Apollo, a collaborative genome annotation editor, visualizes the results of these analyses. The collection includes open source applications such as the BLAST+ suite, InterProScan, and several gene callers, as well as unique tools developed at the CPT that allow maximum user flexibility. We describe in detail programs for finding Shine-Dalgarno sequences, resources used for confident identification of lysis genes such as spanins, and methods used for identifying interrupted genes that contain frameshifts or introns. At the CPT, genome annotation is separated into two robust segments that are facilitated through the automated execution of many tools chained together in an operation called a workflow. First, the structural annotation workflow results in gene and other feature calls. This is followed by a functional annotation workflow that combines sequence comparisons and conserved domain searching, which is contextualized to allow integrated evidence assessment in functional prediction. Finally, we describe a workflow used for comparative genomics. Using this multi-purpose platform enables researchers to easily and accurately annotate an entire phage genome. The portal can be accessed at https://cpt.tamu.edu/galaxy-pub with accompanying user training material.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Mpr76wZdT10" width="1" />

Each year in the United States, influenza causes illness in 9.2 to 35.6 million individuals and is responsible for 12,000 to 56,000 deaths. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tracks influenza activity through a national surveillance network. These data are only available after a delay of 1 to 2 weeks, and thus influenza epidemiologists and transmission modelers have explored the use of other data sources to produce more timely estimates and predictions of influenza activity. We evaluated whether data collected from a national commercial network of influenza diagnostic machines could produce valid estimates of the current burden and help to predict influenza trends in the United States. Quidel Corporation provided us with de-identified influenza test results transmitted in real-time from a national network of influenza test machines called the Influenza Test System (ITS). We used this ITS dataset to estimate and predict influenza-like illness (ILI) activity in the United States over the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 influenza seasons. First, we developed linear logistic models on national and regional geographic scales that accurately estimated two CDC influenza metrics: the proportion of influenza test results that are positive and the proportion of physician visits that are ILI-related. We then used our estimated ILI-related proportion of physician visits in transmission models to produce improved predictions of influenza trends in the United States at both the regional and national scale. These findings suggest that ITS can be leveraged to improve “nowcasts” and short-term forecasts of U.S. influenza activity.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QaDw8lxKTVM" width="1" />

For any given bacteriophage genome or phage-derived sequences in metagenomic data sets, we are unable to assign a function to 50–90% of genes, or more. Structural protein-encoding genes constitute a large fraction of the average phage genome and are among the most divergent and difficult-to-identify genes using homology-based methods. To understand the functions encoded by phages, their contributions to their environments, and to help gauge their utility as potential phage therapy agents, we have developed a new approach to classify phage ORFs into ten major classes of structural proteins or into an “other” category. The resulting tool is named PhANNs (Phage Artificial Neural Networks). We built a database of 538,213 manually curated phage protein sequences that we split into eleven subsets (10 for cross-validation, one for testing) using a novel clustering method that ensures there are no homologous proteins between sets yet maintains the maximum sequence diversity for training. An Artificial Neural Network ensemble trained on features extracted from those sets reached a test F<sub>1</sub>-score of 0.875 and test accuracy of 86.2%. PhANNs can rapidly classify proteins into one of the ten structural classes or, if not predicted to fall in one of the ten classes, as “other,” providing a new approach for functional annotation of phage proteins. PhANNs is open source and can be run from our web server or installed locally.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Yy6oxyk6vd8" width="1" />

Using mRNA sequencing and de novo transcriptome assembly, we identified, cloned, and characterized 9 previously undiscovered fluorescent protein (FP) homologs from <i>Aequorea victoria</i> and a related <i>Aequorea</i> species, with most sequences highly divergent from <i>A</i>. <i>victoria</i> green fluorescent protein (avGFP). Among these FPs are the brightest green fluorescent protein (GFP) homolog yet characterized and a reversibly photochromic FP that responds to UV and blue light. Beyond green emitters, <i>Aequorea</i> species express purple- and blue-pigmented chromoproteins (CPs) with absorbances ranging from green to far-red, including 2 that are photoconvertible. X-ray crystallography revealed that <i>Aequorea</i> CPs contain a chemically novel chromophore with an unexpected crosslink to the main polypeptide chain. Because of the unique attributes of several of these newly discovered FPs, we expect that <i>Aequorea</i> will, once again, give rise to an entirely new generation of useful probes for bioimaging and biosensing.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/8dUh_jGbLL4" width="1" />

U2 Small Nuclear RNA Auxiliary Factor 1 (U2AF1) forms a heterodimeric complex with U2AF2 that is primarily responsible for 3ʹ splice site selection. U2AF1 mutations have been identified in most cancers but are prevalent in Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), and the most common mutation is a missense substitution of serine-34 to phenylalanine (S34F). The U2AF heterodimer also has a noncanonical function as a translational regulator. Here, we report that the U2AF1-S34F mutation results in specific misregulation of the translation initiation and ribosome biogenesis machinery. The net result is an increase in mRNA translation at the single-cell level. Among the translationally up-regulated targets of U2AF1-S34F is Nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1), which is a major driver of myeloid malignancy. Depletion of NPM1 impairs the viability of the U2AF1-S34F mutant cells and causes ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing defects, thus indicating an unanticipated synthetic interaction between U2AF1, NPM1, and ribosome biogenesis. Our results establish a unique molecular phenotype for the U2AF1 mutation that recapitulates translational misregulation in myeloid disease.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/4lfV0dZva7M" width="1" />

The steroid hormone progesterone (P4) mediates many physiological processes through either nuclear receptors that modulate gene expression or membrane P4 receptors (mPRs) that mediate nongenomic signaling. mPR signaling remains poorly understood. Here we show that the topology of mPRβ is similar to adiponectin receptors and opposite to that of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Using <i>Xenopus</i> oocyte meiosis as a well-established physiological readout of nongenomic P4 signaling, we demonstrate that mPRβ signaling requires the adaptor protein APPL1 and the kinase Akt2. We further show that P4 induces clathrin-dependent endocytosis of mPRβ into signaling endosome, where mPR interacts transiently with APPL1 and Akt2 to induce meiosis. Our findings outline the early steps involved in mPR signaling and expand the spectrum of mPR signaling through the multitude of pathways involving APPL1.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/LdVaav2-THo" width="1" />

A crucial aspect when learning a language is discovering the rules that govern how words are combined in order to convey meanings. Because rules are characterized by sequential co-occurrences between elements (e.g., “<i>These</i> cupcake<i>s are un</i>believ<i>able</i>”), tracking the statistical relationships between these elements is fundamental. However, purely bottom-up statistical learning alone cannot fully account for the ability to create abstract rule representations that can be generalized, a paramount requirement of linguistic rules. Here, we provide evidence that, after the statistical relations between words have been extracted, the engagement of goal-directed attention is key to enable rule generalization. Incidental learning performance during a rule-learning task on an artificial language revealed a progressive shift from statistical learning to goal-directed attention. In addition, and consistent with the recruitment of attention, functional MRI (fMRI) analyses of late learning stages showed left parietal activity within a broad bilateral dorsal frontoparietal network. Critically, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on participants’ peak of activation within the left parietal cortex impaired their ability to generalize learned rules to a structurally analogous new language. No stimulation or rTMS on a nonrelevant brain region did not have the same interfering effect on generalization. Performance on an additional attentional task showed that this rTMS on the parietal site hindered participants’ ability to integrate “what” (stimulus identity) and “when” (stimulus timing) information about an expected target. The present findings suggest that learning rules from speech is a two-stage process: following statistical learning, goal-directed attention—involving left parietal regions—integrates “what” and “when” stimulus information to facilitate rapid rule generalization.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/EdTXW6PtEL0" width="1" />

<p>by Caroline M. Weisman, Andrew W. Murray, Sean R. Eddy</p>

Genes for which homologs can be detected only in a limited group of evolutionarily related species, called “lineage-specific genes,” are pervasive: Essentially every lineage has them, and they often comprise a sizable fraction of the group’s total genes. Lineage-specific genes are often interpreted as “novel” genes, representing genetic novelty born anew within that lineage. Here, we develop a simple method to test an alternative null hypothesis: that lineage-specific genes do have homologs outside of the lineage that, even while evolving at a constant rate in a novelty-free manner, have merely become undetectable by search algorithms used to infer homology. We show that this null hypothesis is sufficient to explain the lack of detected homologs of a large number of lineage-specific genes in fungi and insects. However, we also find that a minority of lineage-specific genes in both clades are not well explained by this novelty-free model. The method provides a simple way of identifying which lineage-specific genes call for special explanations beyond homology detection failure, highlighting them as interesting candidates for further study.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/m1Tk0DF4EGI" width="1" />

<p>We characterized the under‐explored retina of the laughing dove, <i>Streptopelia senegalensis</i>. In addition to light and electron microscopy, we sequenced the short wavelength sensitive opsin SWS1. Using phylogeny and multiple sequence alignment, we found that the SWS1 is a violet sensitive opsin. Our results showed the presence of retinal pigmented epithelium that has plentiful melanosomes. There were various oil droplets, cones, horizontal, amacrine, bipolar, and Müller cells. Oligodendrocytes myelinated the nerve fiber layer. Overall, our data suggest a link between the structural variation and the photic adaptation.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuroanatomy of the retina reflects adaptation and acclimation for dark and light conditions. Retinal cells and genes must be functionally adjusted to various environmental luminosities. Opsins are brilliant molecules to assess the adaptations at the genetic and phenotypic levels. Photic adaptations may reveal new mechanisms that enhance vision abilities. Through the investigation of histological, ultrastructural constituents of the whole retinal layers, and the sequencing of shortwave length sensitive opsin 1 (SWS1) of the laughing dove (<i>Streptopelia senegalensis</i>), the current study confirms the plasticity of the retina in response to the natural photic conditions. Retinal pigmented epithelium has plentiful melanosomes, signifying a highly adapted eye for maximum light perception and protection. Variously colored oil droplets signify high color vision ability. Stratified outer nuclear layer with many Müller cells suggests high sensitivity to dim conditions and high retinal regeneration. The penetration of outer limiting membrane by photoreceptor nuclei and Müller cell microvilli could minimize the light reflection. Oligodendrocytes establish thick myelination demanded for a keen visual acuity. A functional violet sensitive SWS1 with crucial Ser90 is presumed. Molecular phylogeny showed a secondary loss as color vision was shifted back from ultraviolet (UV) sensitivity to the ancestral avian violet sensitivity, thus improving visual resolution. However, SWS1 has some UV sensitive residues. These findings implicate not only spectral adaptations with high color vision ability and acuity but also photoinduced structural reorganizations. Further studies are needed to assess the secrets between photons and the structural genes.</p>

<p>Experiments have shown that the same stimulation pattern that causes Long-Term Potentiation in proximal synapses, will induce Long-Term Depression in distal ones. In order to understand these, and other, surprising observations we use a phenomenological model of Hebbian plasticity at the location of the synapse. Our model describes the Hebbian condition of joint activity of pre- and postsynaptic neurons in a compact form as the interaction of the glutamate trace left by a presynaptic spike with the time course of the postsynaptic voltage. Instead of simulating the voltage, we test the model using experimentally recorded dendritic voltage traces in hippocampus and neocortex. We find that the time course of the voltage in the neighborhood of a stimulated synapse is a reliable predictor of whether a stimulated synapse undergoes potentiation, depression, or no change. Our computational model can explain the existence of different -at first glance seemingly paradoxical- outcomes of synaptic potentiation and depression experiments depending on the dendritic location of the synapse and the frequency or timing of the stimulation.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common chronic neurodegenerative disorder, has complex neuropathology. The principal neuropathological hallmarks of the disease are the deposition of extracellular β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) comprised of hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) protein. These changes occur with neuroinflammation, a compromised blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and neuronal synaptic dysfunction, all of which ultimately lead to neuronal cell loss and cognitive deficits in AD. Aβ<sub>1–42</sub> was stereotaxically administered bilaterally into the CA1 region of the hippocampi of 18-month-old male C57BL/6 mice. This study aimed to characterize, utilizing immunohistochemistry and behavioral testing, the spatial and temporal effects of Aβ<sub>1–42</sub> on a broad set of parameters characteristic of AD: p-tau, neuroinflammation, vascular pathology, pyramidal cell survival, and behavior. Three days after Aβ<sub>1–42</sub> injection and before significant neuronal cell loss was detected, acute neuroinflammatory and vascular responses were observed. These responses included the up-regulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1, also known as CD31), fibrinogen labeling, and an increased number of activated astrocytes and microglia in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. From day 7, there was significant pyramidal cell loss in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, and by 30 days, significant localized up-regulation of p-tau, GFAP, Iba-1, CD31, and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) in the Aβ<sub>1–42</sub>-injected mice compared with controls. These molecular changes in Aβ<sub>1–42</sub>-injected mice were accompanied by cognitive deterioration, as demonstrated by long-term spatial memory impairment. This study is reporting a comprehensive examination of a complex set of parameters associated with intrahippocampal administration of Aβ<sub>1–42</sub> in mice, their spatiotemporal interactions and combined contribution to the disease progression. We show that a single Aβ injection can reproduce aspects of the inflammatory, vascular, and p-tau induced pathology occurring in the AD human brain that lead to cognitive deficits.</p>

<p>Understanding how building blocks of life contribute to physiology is greatly aided by protein identification and cellular localization. The two main labeling approaches developed over the past decades are labeling with antibodies such as immunoglobulin G (IgGs) or use of genetically encoded tags such as fluorescent proteins. However, IgGs are large proteins (150 kDa), which limits penetration depth and uncertainty of target position caused by up to ∼25 nm distance of the label created by the chosen targeting approach. Additionally, IgGs cannot be easily recombinantly modulated and engineered as part of fusion proteins because they consist of multiple independent translated chains. In the last decade single domain antigen binding proteins are being explored in bioscience as a tool in revealing molecular identity and localization to overcome limitations by IgGs. These nanobodies have several potential benefits over routine applications. Because of their small size (15 kDa), nanobodies better penetrate during labeling procedures and improve resolution. Moreover, nanobodies cDNA can easily be fused with other cDNA. Multidomain proteins can thus be easily engineered consisting of domains for targeting (nanobodies) and visualization by fluorescence microscopy (fluorescent proteins) or electron microscopy (based on certain enzymes). Additional modules for e.g., purification are also easily added. These nanobody-based probes can be applied in cells for live-cell endogenous protein detection or may be purified prior to use on molecules, cells or tissues. Here, we present the current state of nanobody-based probes and their implementation in microscopy, including pitfalls and potential future opportunities.</p>

<p>Cerebral white matter (WM) lesion load, as measured by white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), has been associated with increasing age and cardiovascular risk factors, like hypertension. Physical sports activity (PSA) may play an important role in maintaining WM in the context of healthy aging. In 196 healthy older adults, we investigated whether participants reporting high levels of PSA (n = 36) had reduced total and regional WMH volumes compared to those reporting low levels of PSA (n = 160). Age group [young-old (YO) = 50–69 years; old-old (OO) = 70–89 years], PSA group, and age by PSA group interaction effects were tested, with sex, hypertension, and body mass index (BMI) as covariates. We found significant main effects for age group and age by PSA group interactions for total, frontal, temporal, and parietal WMH volumes. There were no main effects of PSA group on WMH volumes. The OO group with low PSA had greater total, frontal, temporal, and parietal WMH volumes than the YO with low PSA and OO with high PSA groups. WMH volumes for the YO and OO groups with high PSA were comparable. These findings indicate an age group difference in those with low PSA, with greater WMH volumes in older adults, which was not observed in those with high PSA.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Identification of children at risk of developing epilepsy after a first unprovoked seizure can be challenging. Interictal epileptiform discharges are associated with higher risk but have limited sensitivity and specificity. High frequency oscillations (HFOs) are newer biomarkers for epileptogenesis. We prospectively evaluated the predictive value of HFOs for developing epilepsy in scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) of children after a first unprovoked seizure.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>After their first seizure, 56 children were followed prospectively over 12 months and then grouped in “epilepsy” or “no epilepsy.” Initial EEGs were visually analyzed for spikes, spike ripples, and ripples. Inter‐group comparisons of spike‐rates and HFO‐rates were done by Mann–Whitney <i>U</i> test. Predictive values and optimal thresholds were calculated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the epilepsy group (n = 26, 46%), mean rates of ripples (0.3 vs 0.09 / minute, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) and spike ripples (0.6 vs 0.06 / minute, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) were significantly higher, with no difference in spike rates (1.7 vs 3.0 / minute, <i>p</i> = 0.38). Of those 3 markers, ripples showed the best predictive value (area under the curve [AUC]<sub>ripples</sub> = 0.88). The optimal threshold for ripples was calculated to be ≥ 0.125 / minute with a sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 85%. Ripple rates were negatively correlated to days passing before epilepsy‐diagnosis (R = −0.59, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) and time to a second seizure (R = −0.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] = −0.77 to 0.43, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We could show that in a cohort of children with a first unprovoked seizure, ripples predict the development of epilepsy better than spikes or spike ripples and might be useful biomarkers in the estimation of prognosis and question of treatment. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

Modelling the emergence of foodborne pathogens is a crucial step in the prediction and prevention of disease outbreaks. Unfortunately, the mechanisms that drive the evolution of such continuously adapting pathogens remain poorly understood. Here, we combine molecular genotyping with network science and Bayesian inference to infer directed genotype networks—and trace the emergence and evolutionary paths—of <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium (STM) from nine years of Australian disease surveillance data. We construct networks where nodes represent STM strains and directed edges represent evolutionary steps, presenting evidence that the structural (i.e., network-based) features are relevant to understanding the functional (i.e., fitness-based) progression of co-evolving STM strains. This is argued by showing that outbreak severity, i.e., prevalence, correlates to: (i) the network path length to the most prevalent node (<i>r</i> = −0.613, <i>N</i> = 690); and (ii) the network connected-component size (<i>r</i> = 0.739). Moreover, we uncover distinct exploration-exploitation pathways in the genetic space of STM, including a strong evolutionary drive through a transition region. This is examined via the 6,897 distinct evolutionary paths in the directed network, where we observe a dominant 66% of these paths decrease in network centrality, whilst increasing in prevalence. Furthermore, 72.4% of all paths originate in the transition region, with 64% of those following the dominant direction. Further, we find that the length of an evolutionary path strongly correlates to its increase in prevalence (<i>r</i> = 0.497). Combined, these findings indicate that longer evolutionary paths result in genetically rare and virulent strains, which mostly evolve from a single transition point. Our results not only validate our widely-applicable approach for inferring directed genotype networks from data, but also provide a unique insight into the elusive functional and structural drivers of STM bacteria.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/skSNwJBSdDk" width="1" />

<p>by Kai Ehrenbolger, Nathan Jespersen, Himanshu Sharma, Yuliya Y. Sokolova, Yuri S. Tokarev, Charles R. Vossbrinck, Jonas Barandun</p>

Assembling and powering ribosomes are energy-intensive processes requiring fine-tuned cellular control mechanisms. In organisms operating under strict nutrient limitations, such as pathogenic microsporidia, conservation of energy via ribosomal hibernation and recycling is critical. The mechanisms by which hibernation is achieved in microsporidia, however, remain poorly understood. Here, we present the cryo–electron microscopy structure of the ribosome from <i>Paranosema locustae</i> spores, bound by the conserved eukaryotic hibernation and recycling factor Lso2. The microsporidian Lso2 homolog adopts a V-shaped conformation to bridge the mRNA decoding site and the large subunit tRNA binding sites, providing a reversible ribosome inactivation mechanism. Although microsporidian ribosomes are highly compacted, the <i>P</i>. <i>locustae</i> ribosome retains several rRNA segments absent in other microsporidia, and represents an intermediate state of rRNA reduction. In one case, the near complete reduction of an expansion segment has resulted in a single bound nucleotide, which may act as an architectural co-factor to stabilize a protein–protein interface. The presented structure highlights the reductive evolution in these emerging pathogens and sheds light on a conserved mechanism for eukaryotic ribosome hibernation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0Rmv0IO0vHM" width="1" />

<p>by Jan Grohn, Urs Schüffelgen, Franz-Xaver Neubert, Alessandro Bongioanni, Lennart Verhagen, Jerome Sallet, Nils Kolling, Matthew F. S. Rushworth</p>

Animals learn from the past to make predictions. These predictions are adjusted after prediction errors (PEs), i.e., after surprising events. Generally, most reward PE models learn the average expected amount of reward. However, here we demonstrate the existence of distinct mechanisms for detecting other types of surprising events. Six macaques learned to respond to visual stimuli to receive varying amounts of juice rewards. Most trials ended with the delivery of either 1 or 3 juice drops so that animals learned to expect 2 juice drops on average even though instances of precisely 2 drops were rare. To encourage learning, we also included sessions during which the ratio between 1 and 3 drops changed. Additionally, in all sessions, the stimulus sometimes appeared in an unexpected location. Thus, 3 types of surprising events could occur: reward amount surprise (i.e., a scalar reward prediction error), rare reward surprise, and visuospatial surprise. Importantly, we can dissociate scalar reward prediction errors—rewards that deviated from the average reward amount expected—and rare reward events—rewards that accorded with the average reward expectation but that rarely occurred. We linked each type of surprise to a distinct pattern of neural activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Activity in the vicinity of the dopaminergic midbrain only reflected surprise about the amount of reward. Lateral prefrontal cortex had a more general role in detecting surprising events. Posterior lateral orbitofrontal cortex specifically detected RREs regardless of whether they followed average reward amount expectations, but only in learnable reward environments.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/D-yL7V1x-bs" width="1" />

<p>Resembling letter-by-letter translation, Morse code can be used to investigate various linguistic components by slowing down the cognitive process of language decoding. Using fMRI and Morse code, we investigated patterns of brain activation associated with decoding three-letter words or non-words and making a lexical decision. Our data suggest that early sublexical processing is associated with activation in brain regions that are involved in sound-patterns to phoneme conversion (inferior parietal lobule), phonological output buffer (inferior frontal cortex: pars opercularis) as well as phonological and semantic top-down predictions (inferior frontal cortex: pars triangularis). In addition, later lexico-semantic processing of meaningful stimuli is associated with activation of the phonological lexicon (angular gyrus) and the semantic system (default mode network). Overall, our data indicate that sublexical and lexico-semantic analyses comprise two cognitive processes that rely on neighboring networks in the left frontal cortex and parietal lobule.</p>

<p>Long-term potentiation (LTP) at glutamatergic synapses is an extensively studied form of long-lasting synaptic plasticity widely regarded as the cellular basis for learning and memory. At the CA1 synapse, there are multiple forms of LTP with distinct properties. Although AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPARs) are a key target of LTP expression, whether they are required in all forms of LTP remains unclear. To address this question, we have used our recently developed mouse line, GluA1<sup>C2KI</sup>, where the c-terminal domain (CTD) of the endogenous GluA1 is replaced by that of GluA2. Unlike traditional GluA1 global or conditional KO mice, GluA1<sup>C2KI</sup> mice have no changes in basal AMPAR properties or synaptic transmission allowing a better assessment of GluA1 in synaptic plasticity. We previously showed that these mice are impaired in LTP induced by high-frequency stimulation (HFS-LTP), but whether other forms of LTP are also affected in these mice is unknown. In this study, we compared various forms of LTP at CA1 synapses between GluA1<sup>C2KI</sup> and wild-type littermates by using several induction protocols. We show that HFS-LTP is impaired in both juvenile and adult GluA1<sup>C2KI</sup> mice. The LTP induced by theta-burst stimulation (TBS-LTP) is also abolished in juvenile GluA1<sup>C2KI</sup> mice. Interestingly, TBS-LTP can still be induced in adult GluA1<sup>C2KI</sup> mice, but its mechanisms are altered becoming more sensitive to protein synthesis and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitors compared to wild type (WT) control. The GluA1<sup>C2KI</sup> mice are also differentially altered in several forms of LTP induced under whole-cell recording paradigms. These results indicate that the CTD of GluA1 is differentially involved in different forms of LTP at CA1 synapse highlighting the complexity and adaptative potential of LTP expression mechanisms in the hippocampus.</p>

<p>In recent years, transition metal dichalcogenides have been attracting an increasing interest in the biomedical field, thus implying the need of a deeper understanding of their impact on cell behavior. In this study we investigate tungsten disulfide (WS<sub>2</sub>) grown via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on a transparent substrate (sapphire) as a platform for neural-like cell culture. We culture SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells on WS<sub>2</sub>, using graphene, sapphire and standard culture well as controls. The quality, thickness and homogeneity of the materials is analyzed using atomic force microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The cytocompatibility of CVD WS<sub>2</sub> is investigated for the first time by cell viability and differentiation assessment on SH-SY5Y cells. We find that cells differentiated on WS<sub>2</sub>, displaying a viability and neurite length comparable with the controls. These findings shine light on the possibility of using WS<sub>2</sub> as a cytocompatible material for interfacing neural cells.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.585432">microRNA-Based Biomarkers in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)</a></h4>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a multifactorial, age-related neurological disease characterized by complex pathophysiological dynamics taking place at multiple biological levels, including molecular, genetic, epigenetic, cellular and large-scale brain networks. These alterations account for multiple pathophysiological mechanisms such as brain protein accumulation, neuroinflammatory/neuro-immune processes, synaptic dysfunction, and neurodegeneration that eventually lead to cognitive and behavioral decline. Alterations in microRNA (miRNA) signaling have been implicated in the epigenetics and molecular genetics of all neurobiological processes associated with AD pathophysiology. These changes encompass altered miRNA abundance, speciation and complexity in anatomical regions of the CNS targeted by the disease, including modified miRNA expression patterns in brain tissues, the systemic circulation, the extracellular fluid (ECF) and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). miRNAs have been investigated as candidate biomarkers for AD diagnosis, disease prediction, prognosis and therapeutic purposes because of their involvement in multiple brain signaling pathways in both health and disease. In this review we will: (i) highlight the significantly heterogeneous nature of miRNA expression and complexity in AD tissues and biofluids; (ii) address how information may be extracted from these data to be used as a diagnostic, prognostic and/or screening tools across the entire continuum of AD, from the preclinical stage, through the prodromal, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI) phase all the way to clinically overt dementia; and (iii) consider how specific miRNA expression patterns could be categorized using miRNA reporters that span AD pathophysiological initiation and disease progression.</p>

<p>Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) may cause variable functional impairment. The discrepancy between functional impairment and brain imaging findings in patients with MS (PwMS) might be attributed to differential adaptive and consolidation capacities. Modulating those abilities could contribute to a favorable clinical course of the disease.</p><p>Objectives: We examined the effect of cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (c-tDCS) on locomotor adaptation and consolidation in PwMS using a split-belt treadmill (SBT) paradigm.</p><p>Methods: 40 PwMS and 30 matched healthy controls performed a locomotor adaptation task on a SBT. First, we assessed locomotor adaptation in PwMS. In a second investigation, this training was followed by cerebellar anodal tDCS applied immediately after the task ipsilateral to the fast leg (T0). The SBT paradigm was repeated 24 h (T1) and 78 h (T2) post-stimulation to evaluate consolidation.</p><p>Results: The gait dynamics and adaptation on the SBT were comparable between PwMS and controls. We found no effects of offline cerebellar anodal tDCS on locomotor adaptation and consolidation. Participants who received the active stimulation showed the same retention index than sham-stimulated subjects at T1 (p = 0.33) and T2 (p = 0.46).</p><p>Conclusion: Locomotor adaptation is preserved in people with mild-to-moderate MS. However, cerebellar anodal tDCS applied immediately post-training does not further enhance this ability. Future studies should define the neurobiological substrates of maintained plasticity in PwMS and how these substrates can be manipulated to improve compensation. Systematic assessments of methodological variables for cerebellar tDCS are urgently needed to increase the consistency and replicability of the results across experiments in various settings.</p>

<p>The aim of this work was to re-evaluate electrophysiological data from a previous study on motor imagery (MI) with a special focus on observed inter- and intra-individual differences. More concretely, we investigated event-related desynchronization/synchronization patterns during sports MI (playing tennis) compared with simple MI (squeezing a ball) and discovered high variability across participants. Thirty healthy volunteers were divided in two groups; the experimental group (EG) performed a physical exercise between two imagery sessions, and the control group (CG) watched a landscape movie without physical activity. We computed inter-individual differences by assessing the dissimilarities among subjects for each group, condition, time period, and frequency band. In the alpha band, we observe some clustering in the ranking of the subjects, therefore showing smaller distances than others. Moreover, in our statistical evaluation, we observed a consistency in ranking across time periods both for the EG and for the CG. For the latter, we also observed similar rankings across conditions. On the contrary, in the beta band, the ranking of the subjects was more similar for the EG across conditions and time periods than for the subjects of the CG. With this study, we would like to draw attention to variability measures instead of primarily focusing on the identification of common patterns across participants, which often do not reflect the whole neurophysiological reality.</p>

<p>One factor that is commonly thought to influence MMN amplitude is lexicality; multiple studies have shown that real-word deviants elicit larger MMNs than pseudoword deviants. Here, however, we report data from two experiments challenging this assumption. In the first experiment (N = 48), real-word deviants did not elicit more negative MMNs than pseudoword deviants; the acoustic difference between standard and deviant was identical across these comparisons. In this experiment, the pseudoword deviant [pʰa˨˩] differed from a real-word [pʰa˧˥] in tone only; therefore, to test the possibility that the lexicality effect is real but is restricted to pseudowords that differ from real words by at least one segment, we ran a second experiment which included different items and participants, and also included a control comparison in which the pseudoword ([tsʰei˨˩]) differs from all real words by at least one segment (there is no existing Mandarin morpheme pronounced [tsʰei] in any tone). In the second experiment (N = 36), both types of pseudowords failed to elicit less negative MMNs than real words. These findings, together with other recent studies failing to show lexicality effects in MMN, challenge the assumption that wordhood reliably influences MMN amplitude.</p>

<p>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can be used to enhance the associative memory of healthy subjects and patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the question of where the stimulation should be applied is still unresolved. In a preliminary survey for an effective and feasible solution to this problem, we identified three representative rTMS targets using cortico-hippocampal connectivity, calculated using resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data from 80 young, healthy subjects: (1) the cortical area with the strongest connectivity across the whole cerebral cortical area; (2) the whole lateral parietal cortical area; and (3) the whole medial prefrontal cortical area. We then compared the short-term effects on associative memory, which was tested using face-cued word recall by applying rTMS to three identified targets in a single population of eight healthy adults. Each treatment lasted for 2 days. Associative memory performance was measured at four time points: before and after stimulation on the first day (baseline and post 1) and before and after stimulation on the second day (post 2 and post 3). Compared with baseline levels, 20 min of high-frequency rTMS delivered to target 2 or target 3 produced a significant increase in the mean accuracy of associative memory performance at the post 3 time point alone (target 2, P = 0.0035; target 3, P = 0.0012). Compared with the sham conditions, significant increases in the mean associative memory performance were observed when high-frequency rTMS was delivered to target 2 (P = 0.02) and target 3 (P = 0.012), but not when delivered to target 1 (P = 0.1). Compared with baseline levels, 20 min of high-frequency rTMS delivered to target 3 produced a significant reduction in the mean reaction time of associative memory only at time points post 1 (P = 0.0464) and post 3 (P = 0.0477). Compared with the sham conditions, significant reductions in the mean reaction time of associative memory were observed when high-frequency rTMS was delivered to target 3 (P = 0.006), but not when delivered to target 1 (P = 0.471) or target 2 (P = 0.365). Our findings indicate that stimulation of the locations with the strongest cortico-hippocampal connectivity within the lateral parietal cortical or medial prefrontal cortical areas is effective in enhancing face–word recall-based associative memory in the short term.</p>

<p>While connectivity within sensory cortical circuits has been studied extensively, how these connections contribute to perception and behavior is not well understood. Here we tested the role of a circuit between layers 3 and 5 of auditory cortex in sound detection. We measured sound detection using a common variant of pre-pulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response, in which a silent gap in background noise acts as a cue that attenuates startle. We used the Nr5a-Cre driver line, which we found drove expression in the auditory cortex restricted predominantly to layer 3. Photoactivation of these cells evoked short-latency, highly reliable spiking in downstream layer 5 neurons, and attenuated startle responses similarly to gaps in noise. Photosuppression of these cells did not affect behavioral gap detection. Our data provide the first demonstration that direct activation of auditory cortical neurons is sufficient to attenuate the acoustic startle response, similar to the detection of a sound.</p>

<p>A major challenge in the development of pharmacotherapies for autism is the failure to identify pathophysiological mechanisms that could be targetable. The majority of developing strategies mainly aim at restoring the brain excitatory/inhibitory imbalance described in autism, by targeting glutamate or GABA receptors. Other neurotransmitter systems are critical for the fine-tuning of the brain excitation/inhibition balance. Among these, the dopaminergic, oxytocinergic, serotonergic, and cannabinoid systems have also been implicated in autism and thus represent putative therapeutic targets. One of the latest breakthroughs in pharmacology has been the discovery of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) oligomerization. GPCR heteromers are macromolecular complexes composed of at least two different receptors, with biochemical properties that differ from those of their individual components, leading to the activation of different cellular signaling pathways. Interestingly, heteromers of the above-mentioned neurotransmitter receptors have been described (e.g., mGlu2–5HT2A, mGlu5–D2–A2A, D2–OXT, CB1–D2, D2–5HT2A, D1–D2, D2–D3, and OXT–5HT2A). We hypothesize that differences in the GPCR interactome may underlie the etiology/pathophysiology of autism and could drive different treatment responses, as has already been suggested for other brain disorders such as schizophrenia. Targeting GPCR complexes instead of monomers represents a new order of biased agonism/antagonism that may potentially enhance the efficacy of future pharmacotherapies. Here, we present an overview of the crosstalk of the different GPCRs involved in autism and discuss current advances in pharmacological approaches targeting them.</p>

<p>Objective: Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) activity plays an important role in many neurological disorders in the central nervous system, which may be associated with immunomodulation or anti-inflammatory activity. However, the action of IDO in the ischemic condition is still poorly understood. The purpose of the present study is to explore the expression and action of IDO in stem cell culture under oxygen and glucose deprivation.</p><p>Methods: Neural progenitor cells were obtained from the human embryonic stem cell line BG01. These cells underwent oxygen and glucose deprivation. We examined the IDO expression at 3 and 8 h of oxygen and glucose deprivation and then examined neuronal progenitor cell viability in the normal and oxygen and glucose deprivation condition using the [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay. In addition, we studied the effect of IDO inhibition and the expression of TNF-α, IGF-1, VEGF, IL-6, FGFβ, TGFβ, EGF, and Leptin to explore the mechanism of IDO under the oxygen and glucose deprivation.</p><p>Results: IDO expression in neural progenitor cells increased under oxygen and glucose deprivation, which is closely associated with cell death (p &lt; 0.05). Inhibiting IDO did not affect cell survival in normal neural progenitor cells. However, inhibiting IDO could attenuate cell viability under oxygen and glucose deprivation (p &lt; 0.05). Further study demonstrated that IDO expression was closely associated to the growth factor’s leptin expression.</p><p>Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that an increase of IDO under oxygen and glucose deprivation was associated with cell death, suggesting that inhibiting IDO could be a target for neuroprotection.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the elder population, pathologically characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. While the precise mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of PD remain unknown, various genetic factors have been proved to be associated with PD. To date, at least 23 loci and 19 disease-causing genes for PD have been identified. Although monogenic (often familial) cases account for less than 5% of all PD patients, exploring the phenotypes of monogenic PD can help us understand the disease pathogenesis and progression. Primary motor symptoms are important for PD diagnosis but only detectable at a relatively late stage. Despite typical motor symptoms, various non-motor symptoms (NMS) including sensory complaints, mental disorders, autonomic dysfunction, and sleep disturbances also have negative impacts on the quality of life in PD patients and pose major challenges for disease management. NMS is common in all stages of the PD course. NMS can occur long before the onset of PD motor symptoms or can present in the middle or late stage of the disease accompanied by motor symptoms. Therefore, the profiling and characterization of NMS in monogenic PD may help the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of PD, which thereby can execute early intervention to delay the disease progression. In this review, we summarize the characteristics, clinical phenotypes, especially the NMS of monogenic PD patients carrying mutations of SNCA, LRRK2, VPS35, Parkin, PINK1, DJ-1, and GBA. The clinical implications of this linkage between NMS and PD-related genes are also discussed.</p>

Purpose<p>To investigate differences in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow through the aqueduct and to determine whether there is a relationship between CSF flow and ventricular volume parameters in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) patients, elderly acquired hydrocephalus patients and age-matched healthy volunteers by phase-contrast MR (PC-MR).</p>Methods<p>A total of 40 iNPH patients and 41 elderly acquired hydrocephalus patients and 26 age-matched healthy volunteers in the normal control (NC) group were included between November 2017 and October 2019 in this retrospective study. The following CSF flow parameters were measured with PC-MR: peak velocity, average velocity (AV), aqueductal stroke volume (ASV), net ASV, and net flow. The following ventricular volume parameters were measured: ventricular volume (VV), brain volume, total intracranial volume, and relative VV. Differences between the iNPH and acquired hydrocephalus groups were compared Mann–Whitney U test and correlations between CSF flow and ventricular volume parameters were assessed using the Spearman correlation coefficient.</p>Results<p>Aqueductal stroke volume was significantly higher in the iNPH and acquired hydrocephalus groups than in the NC group, but did not differ significantly between the iNPH group and acquired hydrocephalus group. The AV, net ASV, and net flow in the iNPH and acquired hydrocephalus groups were significantly higher than those in the NC group (P &lt; 0.0001), and those in the acquired hydrocephalus group were significantly higher than those in the iNPH group (P = 0.01, P = 0.007, P = 0.002, respectively). The direction of the AV and net ASV significantly differed among the three groups. There were no associations between the volume parameters and CSF flow according to PC-MR among the three groups.</p>Conclusion<p>Compared with iNPH, elderly acquired hydrocephalus demonstrated higher CSF hyperdynamic flow. Although increased CSF flow may contribute to further changes in ventricular morphology, there is no linear relationship between them. These findings might help increase our understanding of flow dynamics in iNPH and elderly acquired hydrocephalus.</p>

<p>Background: Several studies have linked type 2 diabetes (T2D) to an increased risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This has led to an interest in using antidiabetic treatments for the prevention of AD. However, the underlying mechanisms explaining the relationship between T2D and AD have not been completely elucidated.</p><p>Objective: Our objective was to examine cerebral <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake during normal aging and in AD patients in regions associated with diabetes genetic risk factor expression to highlight which genes may serve as potential targets for pharmaceutical intervention.</p><p>Methods: We calculated regional glucose metabolism differences in units of standardized uptake values (SUVR) for 386 cognitively healthy adults and 335 clinically probable AD patients. We then proceeded to extract gene-expression data from the publicly available Allen Human Brain Atlas (HBA) database. We used the nearest genes to 46 AD- and T2D-associated SNPs previously identified in the literature, and mapped their expression to the same 34 cortical regions in which we calculated SUVRs. SNPs with a donor consistency of 0.40 or greater were selected for further analysis. We evaluated the associations between SUVR and gene-expression across the brain.</p><p>Results: Of the 46 risk-factor genes, 15 were found to be significantly correlated with FDG-PET brain metabolism in healthy adults and probable AD patients after correction for multiple comparisons. Using multiple regression, we found that five genes explained a total of 72.5% of the SUVR variance across the healthy adult group regions, while four genes explained a total of 79.3% of the SUVR variance across the probable AD group regions. There were significant differences in whole-brain SUVR as a function of allele frequencies for two genes.</p><p>Conclusions: These results highlight the association between risk factor genes for T2D and regional glucose metabolism during both normal aging and in probable AD. Highlighted genes were associated with mitochondrial stability, vascular maintenance, and glucose intolerance. Pharmacological intervention of these pathways has the potential to improve glucose metabolism during normal again as well as in AD patients.</p>

Background<p>Minimal data are available on the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in older Chinese adults. Moreover, the current information on MCI shows important geographical variations.</p>Objective<p>We aimed to assess the prevalence and risk factors for MCI by age and sex among older adults in a North Chinese population.</p>Methods<p>In this population-based cross-sectional study, we enrolled a random sample of 4,943 adults aged ≥ 60 years between March 2018 and June 2019 in Tianjin, China. Of these, 312 individuals were excluded due to a lack of data (e.g., fasting blood test). As a result, 4,631 subjects were assessed. Individuals with MCI were identified using neuropsychological assessments, including the Mini-Mental State Examination and Activities of Daily Living scale, based on a modified version of the Petersen’s criteria.</p>Results<p>The mean (SD) age of the 4,631 participants was 67.6 (4.89) years, and 2,579 (55.7%) were female. The overall age- and sex-standardized prevalence of MCI in our study population was 10.7%. There were significant associations of MCI with age [65–69 vs. 60–64 years, OR = 0.74; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.58, 0.96], physical activity (≥23.0 vs. &lt;23.0 MET-hours/week, OR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.96), body mass index (BMI) (OR = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.89, 0.95), grip strength (OR = 0.50; 95% CI: 0.38, 0.67), hypertension (yes vs. no, OR = 1.44; 95% CI: 1.18, 1.77), higher levels of sleepiness (OR = 1.80; 95% CI: 1.36, 2.37), and longer sleep duration (OR = 1.40; 95% CI: 1.14, 1.72). The inverse association between BMI and MCI was stronger in older age groups (P for heterogeneity = 0.003). Moreover, the magnitude of association between triglycerides and MCI was different between the sexes (P for heterogeneity = 0.029).</p>Conclusion<p>The age- and sex-standardized prevalence of MCI was 10.7% in the study sample. Physical activity, BMI, grip strength, sleepiness, sleep duration, and hypertension were associated with the prevalence of MCI. Additionally, triglycerides and BMI might be differently associated with the presence of MCI for different sexes and age stages, respectively.</p>

The ongoing digital revolution in the age of big data is opening new research opportunities. Culturomics and iEcology, two emerging research areas based on the analysis of online data resources, can provide novel scientific insights and inform conservation and management efforts. To date, culturomics and iEcology have been applied primarily in the terrestrial realm. Here, we advocate for expanding such applications to the aquatic realm by providing a brief overview of these new approaches and outlining key areas in which culturomics and iEcology are likely to have the highest impact, including the management of protected areas; fisheries; flagship species identification; detection and distribution of threatened, rare, and alien species; assessment of ecosystem status and anthropogenic impacts; and social impact assessment. When deployed in the right context with awareness of potential biases, culturomics and iEcology are ripe for rapid development as low-cost research approaches based on data available from digital sources, with increasingly diverse applications for aquatic ecosystems.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Mzkqq_k1zYw" width="1" />

<p>The inferior colliculus (IC) is the primary auditory nucleus of the midbrain. We used multichannel fluorescent in situ hybridization to detect expression of α<sub>1A,B,D</sub>, α<sub>2A</sub>, and β<sub>2</sub> encoding mRNA in the mouse IC. We found expression of mRNA encoding these adrenergic receptors in the three subnuclei of the IC in juveniles and adults.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Adrenergic receptors are mediators of adrenergic and noradrenergic modulation throughout the brain. Previous studies have provided evidence for the expression of adrenergic receptors in the midbrain auditory nucleus, the inferior colliculus (IC), but have not examined the cellular patterns of expression in detail. Here, we utilize multichannel fluorescent in situ hybridization to detect the expression of adrenergic receptor‐encoding mRNA in the inferior colliculus of male and female mice. We found expression of α<sub>1</sub>, α<sub>2A</sub>, and β<sub>2</sub> receptor‐encoding mRNA throughout all areas of the IC. While we observed similar levels of expression of α<sub>1</sub> receptor‐encoding mRNA across the subregions of the IC, α<sub>2A</sub> and β<sub>2</sub> receptor‐encoding mRNA was expressed differentially. To account for developmental changes in noradrenergic receptor expression, we measured expression levels in mice aged P15, P20, and P60. We observed little change in levels of expression across these ages. To ascertain the modulatory potential of multiple adrenergic receptor subtypes in a single IC cell, we measured co‐expression of α<sub>1</sub>, α<sub>2A</sub>, and β<sub>2</sub> receptor‐encoding mRNA. We found greater proportions of cells in the IC that expressed no adrenergic receptor‐encoding mRNA, α1 and α2A adrenergic receptor‐encoding mRNA, and α1, α2A, and β2 receptor‐encoding mRNA than would be predicted by independent expression of each receptor subtype. These data suggest a coordinated pattern of adrenergic receptor expression in the IC and provide the first evidence for adrenergic receptor expression and co‐expression in the subregions of the mouse auditory midbrain.</p>

<p>The cytoplasmic fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1)-interacting protein 2 (CYFIP2) gene is associated with epilepsy, intellectual disability (ID), and developmental delay, suggesting its critical role in proper neuronal development and function. CYFIP2 is involved in regulating cellular actin dynamics and also interacts with RNA-binding proteins. However, the adult brain function of CYFIP2 remains unclear because investigations thus far are limited to Cyfip2 heterozygous (Cyfip2<sup>+/−</sup>) mice owing to the perinatal lethality of Cyfip2-null mice. Therefore, we generated Cyfip2 conditional knock-out (cKO) mice with reduced CYFIP2 expression in postnatal forebrain excitatory neurons (CaMKIIα-Cre). We found that in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of adult Cyfip2 cKO mice, CYFIP2 expression was decreased in both layer 2/3 (L2/3) and layer 5 (L5) neurons, unlike the L5-specific CYFIP2 reduction observed in adult Cyfip2<sup>+/−</sup> mice. Nevertheless, filamentous actin (F-actin) levels were increased only in L5 of Cyfip2 cKO mPFC possibly because of a compensatory increase in CYFIP1, the other member of CYFIP family, in L2/3 neurons. Abnormal dendritic spines on basal, but not on apical, dendrites were consistently observed in L5 neurons of Cyfip2 cKO mPFC. Meanwhile, neuronal excitability and activity were enhanced in both L2/3 and L5 neurons of Cyfip2 cKO mPFC, suggesting that CYFIP2 functions of regulating F-actin and excitability/activity may be mediated through independent mechanisms. Unexpectedly, adult Cyfip2 cKO mice did not display locomotor hyperactivity or reduced anxiety observed in Cyfip2<sup>+/−</sup> mice. Instead, both exhibited enhanced social dominance accessed by the tube test. Together, these results provide additional insights into the functions of CYFIP2 in the adult brain.</p>

<p>The manipulation of cholesterol and its metabolites has been hypothesized to be therapeutically beneficial for mood disorders, neurodegenerative disorders, and epilepsies. A major regulator of cholesterol clearance and turnover in the central nervous system is CYP46A1, a brain enriched enzyme responsible for metabolism of cholesterol into 24S-hydroxycholesterol. Inhibition of this enzyme may negatively modulate NMDARs as 24S-hydroxycholesterol was shown to enhance NMDAR function. In addition, alterations of local cholesterol or other changes mediated by CYP46A1 activity could have important influences on central nervous system function. Here we demonstrate that humans and mice display brain region specific and similar CYP46A1 and 24S-hydroxycholesterol distribution. Treatment with distinct classes of CYP46A1 inhibitors led to central 24S-hydroxycholesterol reduction in vivo and ablation of long term depression in hippocampal slices. Our results suggest that rodents show similarity to humans for studying the impact of CYP46A1 inhibitors and that rapid, local modulation of oxysterols can be achieved through CYP46A1 inhibition.</p>

<p>Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), an enzyme required for learning and memory, catalyzes L-arginine decomposition during nitric oxide production in mammalian neurons. Over-activation of nNOS leads to oxidative/nitrosative stress, which is part of the pathophysiological process of various neuropsychiatric disorders. Previous experimental studies suggest that nNOS is a target for small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (SUMO1), and that SUMO1-ylation upregulates nNOS catalytic activity in hippocampal neurons. To date, a comprehensive structural model has not been proposed for nNOS SUMO1-ylation. In this study, our aim was to build in silico models to identify the non-bonded interactions between SUMO1 and the calmodulin binding domain (CaMBD) of nNOS. Using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation, we found that SUMO1 modification stabilizes the conformation of nNOS CaMBD, and helps maintain a conformation beneficial for nNOS catalysis. Analysis of the polar contacts and hydrogen bonds, and the root mean square derivation results showed that R726 and R727 of CaMBD formed polar contacts or high occupancy hydrogen bonds with SUMO1. Correlation factor analysis and free energy calculations showed that the W716, L734, F740, M745, and F781 residues were also involved in the SUMO1/CaMBD interaction in an orientation-dependent manner. The potential inhibitor binding pocket of SUMO1, aimed at disrupting SUMO1/CaMBD binding, was detected from the virtual screening results. Our in silico studies revealed that interfering with the non-bonded interactions of SUMO1/CaMBD would blocked nNOS SUMO-ylation and subsequent hyperactivation. This work provides novel structural insight into the functional regulation of nNOS by post-translational SUMO1 modification, and provides suggestions for the design of drugs targeting nNOS hyperactivation.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.596084">Origin of the Time Lag Phenomenon and the Global Signal in Resting-State fMRI</a></h4>

<p>The global mean signal of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) shows a characteristic spatiotemporal pattern that is closely related to the pattern of vascular perfusion. Although being increasingly adopted in the mapping of the flow of neural activity, the mechanism that gives rise to the BOLD signal time lag remains controversial. In the present study, we compared the time lag of the global mean signal with those of the local network components obtained by applying temporal independent component analysis to the resting-state fMRI data, as well as by using simultaneous wide-field visual stimulation, and demonstrated that the time lag patterns are highly similar across all types of data. These results suggest that the time lag of the rs-fMRI signal reflects the local variance of the hemodynamic responses rather than the arrival or transit time of the stimulus, whether the trigger is neuronal or non-neuronal in origin as long as it is mediated by local hemodynamic responses. Examinations of the internal carotid artery signal further confirmed that the arterial signal is tightly inversely coupled with the global mean signal in accordance with previous studies, presumably reflecting the blood flow or blood pressure changes that are occurring almost simultaneously in the internal carotid artery and the cerebral pial/capillary arteries, within the low-frequency component in human rs-fMRI.</p>

<p>Possible risks stemming from the employment of novel, micrometer-thin printed electrodes for direct current neural stimulation are discussed. To assess those risks, electrochemical methods are used, including cyclic voltammetry, square-wave voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Experiments were conducted in non-deoxidized phosphate-buffered saline to better emulate living organism conditions. Since preliminary results obtained have shown unexpected oxidation peaks in 0–0.4 V potential range, the source of those was further investigated. Hypothesized redox activity of printing paste components was disproven, supporting further development of proposed fabrication technology of stimulating electrodes. Finally, partial permeability and resulting electrochemical activity of underlying silver-based printed layers of the device were pointed as the source of potential tissue irritation or damage. Employing this information, electrodes with corrected design were investigated, yielding no undesired redox processes.</p>

<p>White matter abnormalities in blepharospasm (BSP) have been evaluated using conventional intra-voxel metrics, and changes in patterns of cortical thickness in BSP remain controversial. We aimed to determine whether local diffusion homogeneity, an inter-voxel diffusivity metric, could be valuable in detecting white matter abnormalities for BSP; whether these changes are related to disease features; and whether cortical thickness changes occur in BSP patients. Diffusion tensor and structural magnetic resonance imaging were collected for 29 patients with BSP and 30 healthy controls. Intergroup diffusion differences were compared using tract-based spatial statistics analysis and measures of cortical thickness were obtained. The relationship among cortical thickness, diffusion metric in significantly different regions, and behavioral measures were further assessed. There were no significant differences in cortical thickness and fractional anisotropy between the groups. Local diffusion homogeneity was higher in BSP patients than controls, primarily in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus, corpus callosum, left posterior corona radiata, and left posterior thalamic radiata (P &lt; 0.05, family-wise error corrected). The local diffusion homogeneity values in these regions were positively correlated with the Jankovic rating scale (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.416, P = 0.031) and BSP disability index (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.453, P = 0.018) in BSP patients. These results suggest that intra- and inter-voxel diffusive parameters are differentially sensitive to detecting BSP-related white matter abnormalities and that local diffusion homogeneity might be useful in assessing disability in BSP patients.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00832">Dexmedetomidine – Commonly Used in Functional Imaging Studies – Increases Susceptibility to Seizures in Rats But Not in Wild Type Mice</a></h4>

<p>Functional MRI (fMRI) utilizes changes in metabolic and hemodynamic signals to indirectly infer the underlying local changes in neuronal activity. To investigate the mechanisms of fMRI responses, spontaneous fluctuations, and functional connectivity in the resting-state, it is important to pursue fMRI in animal models. Animal studies commonly use dexmedetomidine sedation. It has been demonstrated that potent sensory stimuli administered under dexmedetomidine are prone to inducing seizures in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Here we combined optical imaging of intrinsic signals and cerebral blood flow with neurophysiological recordings to measure responses in rat area S1FL to electrical forepaw stimulation administered at 8 Hz. We show that the increased susceptibility to seizures starts no later than 1 h and ends no sooner than 3 h after initiating a continuous administration of dexmedetomidine. By administering different combinations of anesthetic and sedative agents, we demonstrate that dexmedetomidine is the sole agent necessary for the increased susceptibility to seizures. The increased susceptibility to seizures prevails under a combination of 0.3–0.5% isoflurane and dexmedetomidine anesthesia. The blood-oxygenation and cerebral blood flow responses to seizures induced by forepaw stimulation have a higher amplitude and a larger spatial extent relative to physiological responses to the same stimuli. The epileptic activity and the associated blood oxygenation and cerebral blood flow responses stretched beyond the stimulation period. We observed seizures in response to forepaw stimulation with 1–2 mA pulses administered at 8 Hz. In contrast, responses to stimuli administered at 4 Hz were seizure-free. We demonstrate that such seizures are generated not only in SD rats but also in Long-Evans rats, but not in C57BL6 mice stimulated with similar potent stimuli under dexmedetomidine sedation. We conclude that high-amplitude hemodynamic functional imaging responses evoked by peripheral stimulation in rats sedated with dexmedetomidine are possibly due to the induction of epileptic activity. Therefore, caution should be practiced in experiments that combine the administration of potent stimuli with dexmedetomidine sedation. We propose stimulation paradigms that elicit seizure-free, well detectable neurophysiological and hemodynamic responses in rats. We further conclude that the increased susceptibility to seizures under dexmedetomidine sedation is species dependent.</p>
