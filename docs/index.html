	<p>The purpose of the present study was to examine whether spatial or temporal prediction of the tactile stimulus contributes to tactile sensitivity. To investigate the effect of spatial prediction on tactile sensitivity, electrical stimuli were provided for the digit nerve in one of five fingers, and advanced notice of the stimulating finger was provided before the stimulus in some trials but not in others. There was no significant effect of spatial prediction on the intensity at the perceptual threshold of the digit nerve stimulus. This indicates that spatial prediction of the tactile stimulus does not influence tactile sensitivity. To examine the effect of temporal prediction, an auditory warning cue was provided 0, 1, or 10 s before the electrical stimulus to the digit nerve. The stimulus intensity at the perceptual threshold in the trials with the 1 s warning cue was lower than those with the 0 s warning cue. This indicates that temporal prediction enhances tactile sensitivity. The stimulus intensity at the perceptual threshold in the trials with the 1 s warning cue was lower than those with the 10 s warning cue. This means that the contribution of temporal prediction to the tactile sensitivity is greater as the warning cue is closer to the time of the stimulus. This finding may be explained by a defense mechanism activated when humans predict that a tactile stimulus is coming soon.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Tinnitus involves the conscious awareness of a tonal or composite noise for which there is no identifiable corresponding external acoustic source. For many people, tinnitus is a disorder associated with symptoms of emotional distress, cognitive dysfunction, autonomic arousal, behavioural changes, and functional disability. Many symptoms can be addressed effectively using education or cognitive behavioural therapy. However, there is no treatment that effectively reduces or alters tinnitus-related neurophysiological activity and thus the tinnitus percept. In this systematic review, we evaluated the effectiveness of neuromodulation therapies for tinnitus that explicitly target pathological synchronous neural activity. (2) Methods: Multiple databases were searched for randomised controlled trials of neuromodulation interventions for tinnitus in adults, with 24 trials included. The risk of bias was assessed, and where appropriate, meta-analyses were performed. (3) Results: Few trials used acoustic, vagal nerve, or transcranial alternating current stimulation, or bimodal stimulation techniques, with limited evidence of neuromodulation or clinical effectiveness. Multiple trials of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) were identified, and a synthesis demonstrated a significant improvement in tinnitus symptom severity in favour of tDCS versus control, although heterogeneity was high. (4) Discussion: Neuromodulation for tinnitus is an emerging but promising field. Electrical stimulation techniques are particularly interesting, given recent advances in current flow modelling that can be applied to future studies.</p>

                <p>The role of gamma rhythm (30&ndash;80&nbsp;Hz) in visual processing is debated; stimuli like gratings and hue patches generate strong gamma, but many natural images do not. Could image gamma responses be predicted by approximating images as gratings or hue patches? Surprisingly, this question remains unanswered, since the joint dependence of gamma on multiple features is poorly understood. We recorded local field potentials and electrocorticogram from two female monkeys while presenting natural images and parametric stimuli varying along several feature dimensions. Gamma responses to different grating/hue features were separable, allowing for a multiplicative model based on individual features. By fitting a hue patch to the image around the receptive field, this simple model could predict gamma responses to chromatic images across scales with reasonably high accuracy. Our results provide a simple "baseline" model to predict gamma from local image properties, against which more complex models of natural vision can be tested.</p>

                <p>Chronic neuropathic pain can result from nervous system injury and can persist in the absence of external stimuli. Although ongoing pain characterizes the disorder, in many individuals, the intensity of this ongoing pain fluctuates dramatically. Previously, it was identified that functional magnetic resonance imaging signal covariations between the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) matter, rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), and spinal trigeminal nucleus are associated with moment-to-moment fluctuations in pain intensity in individuals with painful trigeminal neuropathy (PTN). Since this brainstem circuit is modulated by higher brain input, we sought to determine which cortical sites might be influencing this brainstem network during spontaneous fluctuations in pain intensity. Over 12&nbsp;min, we recorded the ongoing pain intensity in 24 PTN participants and classified them as fluctuating (<I>n</I> = 13) or stable (<I>n</I> = 11). Using a PAG seed, we identified connections between the PAG and emotional-affective sites such as the hippocampal and posterior cingulate cortices, the sensory-discriminative posterior insula, and cognitive-affective sites such as the dorsolateral prefrontal (dlPFC) and subgenual anterior cingulate cortices that were altered dependent on spontaneous high and low pain intensity. Additionally, sliding-window functional connectivity analysis revealed that the dlPFC&ndash;PAG connection anticorrelated with perceived pain intensity over the entire 12&nbsp;min period. These findings reveal cortical systems underlying moment-to-moment changes in perceived pain in PTN, which likely cause dysregulation in the brainstem circuits previously identified, and consequently alter the appraisal of pain across time.</p>

                <p>by Patrick Bryant, Frank Noé</p>

Structure prediction of protein complexes has improved significantly with AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold-multimer (AFM), but only 60% of dimers are accurately predicted. Here, we learn a bias to the MSA representation that improves the predictions by performing gradient descent through the AFM network. We demonstrate the performance on seven difficult targets from CASP15 and increase the average MMscore to 0.76 compared to 0.63 with AFM. We evaluate the procedure on 487 protein complexes where AFM fails and obtain an increased success rate (MMscore>0.75) of 33% on these difficult targets. Our protocol, AFProfile, provides a way to direct predictions towards a defined target function guided by the MSA. We expect gradient descent over the MSA to be useful for different tasks.

                <p>by David Moreau, Kristina Wiebels</p>

Open science principles are revolutionizing the transparency, reproducibility, and accessibility of research. Meta-analysis has become a key technique for synthesizing data across studies in a principled way; however, its impact is contingent on adherence to open science practices. Here, we outline 9 quick tips for open meta-analyses, aimed at guiding researchers to maximize the reach and utility of their findings. We advocate for outlining preregistering clear protocols, opting for open tools and software, and the use of version control systems to ensure transparency and facilitate collaboration. We further emphasize the importance of reproducibility, for example, by sharing search syntax and analysis scripts, and discuss the benefits of planning for dynamic updating to enable living meta-analyses. We also recommend publication in open-access formats, as well as open data, open code, and open access publication. We close by encouraging active promotion of research findings to bridge the gap between complex syntheses and public discourse, and provide a detailed submission checklist to equip researchers, reviewers and journal editors with a structured approach to conducting and reporting open meta-analyses.

<i>Streptomyces</i> are renowned for their prolific production of specialized metabolites with applications in medicine and agriculture. These multicellular bacteria present a sophisticated developmental cycle and play a key role in soil ecology. Little is known about the impact of <i>Streptomyces</i> phage on bacterial physiology. In this study, we investigated the conditions governing the expression and production of “Samy,” a prophage found in <i>Streptomyces ambofaciens</i> ATCC 23877. This siphoprophage is produced simultaneously with the activation of other mobile genetic elements. Remarkably, the presence and production of Samy increases bacterial dispersal under in vitro stress conditions. Altogether, this study unveiled a new property of a bacteriophage infection in the context of multicellular aggregate dynamics.

Alternative transcription start site (TSS) usage regulation has been identified as a major means of gene expression regulation in metazoans. However, in fungi, its impact remains elusive as its study has thus far been restricted to model yeasts. Here, we first re-analyzed TSS-seq data to define genuine TSS clusters in 2 species of pathogenic <i>Cryptococcu</i>s. We identified 2 types of TSS clusters associated with specific DNA sequence motifs. Our analysis also revealed that alternative TSS usage regulation in response to environmental cues is widespread in <i>Cryptococcus</i>, altering gene expression and protein targeting. Importantly, we performed a forward genetic screen to identify a unique transcription factor (TF) named Tur1, which regulates alternative TSS (altTSS) usage genome-wide when cells switch from exponential phase to stationary phase. ChiP-Seq and DamID-Seq analyses suggest that at some loci, the role of Tur1 might be direct. Tur1 has been previously shown to be essential for virulence in <i>C</i>. <i>neoformans</i>. We demonstrated here that a <i>tur1Δ</i> mutant strain is more sensitive to superoxide stress and phagocytosed more efficiently by macrophages than the wild-type (WT) strain.

<p>Despite therapeutic suppression of relapses, multiple sclerosis (MS) patients often experience subtle deterioration, which extends beyond the definition of “progression independent of relapsing activity.” We propose the concept of smouldering-associated-worsening (SAW), encompassing physical and cognitive symptoms, resulting from smouldering pathological processes, which remain unmet therapeutic targets. We provide a consensus-based framework of possible pathological substrates and manifestations of smouldering MS, and we discuss clinical, radiological, and serum/cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for potentially monitoring SAW. Finally, we share considerations for optimizing disease surveillance and implications for clinical trials to promote the integration of smouldering MS into routine practice and future research efforts.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96041">Spatiotemporal changes in Netrin/Dscam1 signaling dictate axonal projection direction in Drosophila small ventral lateral clock neurons</a></h4>

              
                Axon projection is a spatial- and temporal-specific process in which the growth cone receives environmental signals guiding axons to their final destination. However, the mechanisms underlying changes in axonal projection direction without well-defined landmarks remain elusive. Here, we present evidence showcasing the dynamic nature of axonal projections in <i>Drosophila</i>’s small ventral lateral clock neurons (s-LNvs). Our findings reveal that these axons undergo an initial vertical projection in the early larval stage, followed by a subsequent transition to a horizontal projection in the early-to-mid third instar larvae. The vertical projection of s-LNv axons correlates with mushroom body calyx expansion, while the s-LNv-expressed Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam1) interacts with Netrins to regulate the horizontal projection. During a specific temporal window, locally newborn dorsal clock neurons secrete Netrins, facilitating the transition of axonal projection direction in s-LNvs. Our study establishes a compelling in vivo model to probe the mechanisms of axonal projection direction switching in the absence of clear landmarks. These findings underscore the significance of dynamic local microenvironments in the complementary regulation of axonal projection direction transitions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84532">Hippo pathway-mediated YAP1/TAZ inhibition is essential for proper pancreatic endocrine specification and differentiation</a></h4>

              
                The Hippo pathway plays a central role in tissue development and homeostasis. However, the function of Hippo in pancreatic endocrine development remains obscure. Here, we generated novel conditional genetically engineered mouse models to examine the roles of Hippo pathway-mediated YAP1/TAZ inhibition in the development stages of endocrine specification and differentiation. While YAP1 protein was localized to the nuclei in bipotent progenitor cells, Neurogenin 3 expressing endocrine progenitors completely lost YAP1 expression. Using genetically engineered mouse models, we found that inactivation of YAP1 requires both an intact Hippo pathway and Neurogenin 3 protein. Gene deletion of Lats1 and 2 kinases (<i>Lats1&amp;2</i>) in endocrine progenitor cells of developing mouse pancreas using <i>Neurog3<sup>Cre</sup></i> blocked endocrine progenitor cell differentiation and specification, resulting in reduced islets size and a disorganized pancreas at birth. Loss of <i>Lats1&amp;2</i> in Neurogenin 3 expressing cells activated YAP1/TAZ transcriptional activity and recruited macrophages to the developing pancreas. These defects were rescued by deletion of <i>Yap1/Wwtr1</i> genes, suggesting that tight regulation of YAP1/TAZ by Hippo signaling is crucial for pancreatic endocrine specification. In contrast, deletion of <i>Lats1&amp;2</i> using β-cell-specific Ins1<i><sup>CreER</sup></i> resulted in a phenotypically normal pancreas, indicating that <i>Lats1&amp;2</i> are indispensable for differentiation of endocrine progenitors but not for that of β-cells. Our results demonstrate that loss of YAP1/TAZ expression in the pancreatic endocrine compartment is not a passive consequence of endocrine specification. Rather, Hippo pathway-mediated inhibition of YAP1/TAZ in endocrine progenitors is a prerequisite for endocrine specification and differentiation.

                High-throughput vertebrate animal model systems for the study of patient-specific biology and new therapeutic approaches for aggressive brain tumors are currently lacking, and new approaches are urgently needed. Therefore, to build a patient-relevant in vivo model of human glioblastoma, we expressed common oncogenic variants including activated human EGFR<sup>vIII</sup> and PI3KCA<sup>H1047R</sup> under the control of the radial glial-specific promoter <i>her4.1</i> in syngeneic <i>tp53</i> loss-of-function mutant zebrafish. Robust tumor formation was observed prior to 45 days of life, and tumors had a gene expression signature similar to human glioblastoma of the mesenchymal subtype, with a strong inflammatory component. Within early stage tumor lesions, and in an in vivo and endogenous tumor microenvironment, we visualized infiltration of phagocytic cells, as well as internalization of tumor cells by <i>mpeg1.1</i>:EGFP+ microglia/macrophages, suggesting negative regulatory pressure by pro-inflammatory cell types on tumor growth at early stages of glioblastoma initiation. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene targeting of master inflammatory transcription factors <i>irf7</i> or <i>irf8</i> led to increased tumor formation in the primary context, while suppression of phagocyte activity led to enhanced tumor cell engraftment following transplantation into otherwise immune-competent zebrafish hosts. Altogether, we developed a genetically relevant model of aggressive human glioblastoma and harnessed the unique advantages of zebrafish including live imaging, high-throughput genetic and chemical manipulations to highlight important tumor-suppressive roles for the innate immune system on glioblastoma initiation, with important future opportunities for therapeutic discovery and optimizations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89367">Temporally resolved early bone morphogenetic protein-driven transcriptional cascade during human amnion specification</a></h4>

              
                Amniogenesis, a process critical for continuation of healthy pregnancy, is triggered in a collection of pluripotent epiblast cells as the human embryo implants. Previous studies have established that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling is a major driver of this lineage specifying process, but the downstream BMP-dependent transcriptional networks that lead to successful amniogenesis remain to be identified. This is, in part, due to the current lack of a robust and reproducible model system that enables mechanistic investigations exclusively into amniogenesis. Here, we developed an improved model of early amnion specification, using a human pluripotent stem cell-based platform in which the activation of BMP signaling is controlled and synchronous. Uniform amniogenesis is seen within 48 hr after BMP activation, and the resulting cells share transcriptomic characteristics with amnion cells of a gastrulating human embryo. Using detailed time-course transcriptomic analyses, we established a previously uncharacterized BMP-dependent amniotic transcriptional cascade, and identified markers that represent five distinct stages of amnion fate specification; the expression of selected markers was validated in early post-implantation macaque embryos. Moreover, a cohort of factors that could potentially control specific stages of amniogenesis was identified, including the transcription factor TFAP2A. Functionally, we determined that, once amniogenesis is triggered by the BMP pathway, TFAP2A controls the progression of amniogenesis. This work presents a temporally resolved transcriptomic resource for several previously uncharacterized amniogenesis states and demonstrates a critical intermediate role for TFAP2A during amnion fate specification.

">Parvalbumin interneuron ErbB4 controls ongoing network oscillations and olfactory behaviors in mice</a></h4>

              
                Parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons modulate the processing of odor information. However, less is known about how PV interneurons dynamically remodel neural circuit responses in the olfactory bulb (OB) and its physiological significance. This study showed that a reinforced odor discrimination task up-regulated the activity of ErbB4 kinase in mouse OB. ErbB4 knock-out in the OB impaired dishabituation of odor responses and discrimination of complex odors, whereas odor memory or adaptation had no alteration in mice. RNAscope analysis demonstrated that ErbB4-positive neurons are localized throughout the OB, whereas within the internal and external plexiform layers, ErbB4 mRNA are largely expressed in PV-positive interneurons. ErbB4 knock-out in PV interneurons disrupted odor-evoked responses of mitral/tufted cells, and led to increased power in the ongoing local field potential in awake mice. We also found a decrease in the frequency of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents and deficits in stimulus-evoked recurrent and lateral inhibition onto mitral cells, suggesting broad impairments in inhibitory circuit following PV-ErbB4 loss. Similarly, ErbB4 ablation in OB PV interneurons disrupted olfactory discrimination and dishabituation in mice. These findings provide novel insights into the role of PV-ErbB4 signaling in inhibitory circuit plasticity, ongoing oscillations, and OB output, which underlies normal olfactory behaviors.

                Cortical layer 6 (L6) neurons uniquely respond to orexin, a neuropeptide influencing arousal and emotion. We show that Drd1a-Cre+ neurons in the prefrontal cortex are selectively sensitive to orexin and regulate prefrontal network activation in vitro and in vivo. Chronically silencing these neurons impairs orexin-induced prefrontal activation and reduces anxiety-like behaviour, indicating that orexin-responsive L6 neurons modulate emotional states and may be a substrate for anxiety regulation.

">Rescuing behavioral flexibility in a mouse model for OCD by enhancing reward-cue salience</a></h4>

              
                Deficits in cognitive flexibility are a frequent symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and have been hypothesized to drive compulsive behavior. Sign- and goal-tracking behaviors are thought to be related to cognitive flexibility, yet have not been studied in this context. To investigate the relationship between sign- and goal-tracking behavior and cognitive flexibility, we tested SAPAP3 knockout mice (SAPAP3-/-) and wild-type littermate controls in a Pavlovian reversal-learning task with two conditioned stimuli, one predicting reward delivery and the other reward omission. SAPAP3-/- displayed a heterogenous reversal-learning performance: Half of the population failed to acquire the reversed cue-reward contingencies, whereas the other half reversed their approach behavior similar to control mice. Surprisingly, such behavioral inflexibility and compulsive-like grooming were unrelated, suggesting a non-causal relationship between these traits. Importantly, compromised reversal learning in impaired mice was associated with diminished sign-tracking behavior (and therefore presumably with an overreliance on goal-tracking behavior). Administration of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine, the first-line pharmacological OCD treatment, ameliorated both anxiety-like behavior and compulsive-like grooming, but did not improve behavioral flexibility in SAPAP3-/. In contrast, enhancing reward-cue salience by altering conditioned stimuli brightness improved behavioral flexibility through augmenting sign-tracking behavior. These findings suggest that deficits in behavioral flexibility are associated with imbalanced sign- and goal-tracking behaviors in SAPAP3-/-, and enhancing reward-cue salience can rescue behavioral flexibility by restoring the balance. Thus, sign- and goal-tracking behavior might be an underexplored cognitive mechanism that could potentially be exploited to improve cognitive flexibility in OCD patients.

">No evidence of musical training influencing the cortical contribution to the speech-FFR and its modulation through selective attention</a></h4>

              
                Musicians can have better abilities to understand speech in adverse conditions such as background noise than non-musicians. However, the neural mechanisms behind such enhanced behavioral performances remain largely unclear. Studies have found that the subcortical frequency-following response to the fundamental frequency of speech and its higher harmonics (speech-FFR) may be involved since it is larger in people with musical training than in those without. Recent research has shown that the speech-FFR consists of a cortical contribution in addition to the subcortical sources. Both the subcortical and the cortical contribution are modulated by selective attention to one of two competing speakers. However, it is unknown whether the strength of the cortical contribution to the speech-FFR, or its attention modulation, is influenced by musical training. Here we investigate these issues through magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings of 52 subjects (18 musicians, 25 non-musicians, and 9 neutral participants) listening to two competing male speakers while selectively attending one of them. The speech-in-noise comprehension abilities of the participants were not assessed. We find that musicians and non-musicians display comparable cortical speech-FFRs and additionally exhibit similar subject-to-subject variability in the response. Furthermore, we also do not observe a difference in the modulation of the neural response through selective attention between musicians and non-musicians. Moreover, when assessing whether the cortical speech-FFRs are influenced by particular aspects of musical training, no significant effects emerged. Taken together, we did not find any effect of musical training on the cortical speech-FFR.

">Control of tongue movements by the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum</a></h4>

              
                To quantify the cerebellum's contributions to control of the tongue, we trained head-fixed marmosets to make dexterous movements, harvesting food from small tubes that were placed orthogonal to the mouth. We identified the lingual regions in lobule VI of the vermis and recorded from hundreds of Purkinje cells (P-cells), each in sessions where the subject produced thousands of licks. Most movements aimed for one of the small tubes, while other movements groomed the mouth area. To quantify contributions of a P-cell to control of the tongue, we relied on the fact that in a small fraction of the licks, the input from the inferior olive produced a complex spike (CS), which then briefly but completely silenced the P-cell. When the movements were targeting a tube, the CS rates increased during protraction for both ipsilateral and contralateral targets, thus identifying the preferred axis of motion in the olivary input, termed CS-on. However, for grooming movements this modulation was absent. We compared the tongue's trajectory in the targeted movement that had experienced the CS with temporally adjacent targeted licks that had not. When the SS suppression occurred during protraction, the tongue exhibited hypermetria, and when the suppression took place during retraction, the tongue exhibited slowing. These effects amplified when two P-cells were simultaneously suppressed. Therefore, CS-induced suppression of P-cells in the lingual vermis disrupted the forces that would normally decelerate the tongue as it approached the target, demonstrating a specialization in stopping the movement. Because the CS-on direction tended to align with the direction of downstream forces produced during P-cell suppression, this suggests that for targeted licks, the olivary input defined an axis of control for the P-cells.

                Precisely neuromodulating deep brain regions in humans could bring transformative advancements in both cognitive neuroscience and brain disorder treatment. In a within subject experiment, twenty-six healthy adults underwent a series of transcranial ultrasound stimulation procedures, including stimulation of the nucleus accumbens, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, or no sonication. Results revealed that ultrasound stimulation of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) induced changes in reward-related behaviours, including in the tendency to stick with winning choices, the rate of learning specifically from positive feedback, and the rate of repeating rewarded choices. Functional brain scans showed corresponding neural changes in response to reward expectations in targeted and interconnected brain areas. These findings demonstrate the causal role of the human NAcc in learning from positive feedback, as well as the feasibility of using non-invasive neuromodulation deep in the human brain to modulate learning and decision making both as a research tool and as a potential component of future treatments for disorders involving reward sensitivity.

                Many bipolar disorder (BD) patients are non-responsive to lithium. The mechanisms underlying lithium (non-)responsiveness are largely unknown. By using gene-set enrichment analysis methods, we found that core clock gene-sets are significantly associated with lithium response. Among the top hits was BHLHE41, a modulator of the molecular clock and homeostatic sleep. Since BHLHE41 and its paralog BHLHE40 are functionally redundant, we assessed chronic lithium response in double-knockout mutant mice (DKO). We demonstrated that DKOs are non-responsive to lithium's effect in various behavioral tasks. Cellular assays and patch clamp recordings revealed lowered excitability and reduced lithium-response in prefrontal cortical layer 2/3 DKO neurons and on hippocampal long-term potentiation. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified that lithium deregulated mitochondrial respiration, cation channel and postsynapse associated gene-sets specifically in upper layer excitatory neurons. Our findings show that lithium acts in a highly cell-specific way on neuronal metabolism and excitability and modulates synaptic plasticity depending on BHLHE40/41.

">How to reward animals based on their subjective percepts: A Bayesian approach to online estimation of perceptual biases.</a></h4>

              
                Elucidating the neural basis of perceptual biases, such as those produced by visual illusions, can provide powerful insights into the neural mechanisms of perceptual inference. However, studying the subjective percepts of animals poses a fundamental challenge: unlike human participants, animals cannot be verbally instructed to report what they see, hear, or feel. Instead, they must be trained to perform a task for reward, and researchers must infer from their responses what the animal perceived. However, animals' responses are shaped by reward feedback, thus raising the major concern that the reward regimen may alter the animal's decision strategy or even intrinsic perceptual biases. We developed a method that estimates perceptual bias during task performance and then computes the reward for each trial based on the evolving estimate of the animal's perceptual bias. Our approach makes use of multiple stimulus contexts to dissociate perceptual biases from decision-related biases. Starting with an informative prior, our Bayesian method updates a posterior over the perceptual bias after each trial. The prior can be specified based on data from past sessions, thus reducing the variability of the online estimates and allowing it to converge to a stable estimate over a small number of trials. After validating our method on synthetic data, we apply it to estimate perceptual biases of monkeys in a motion direction discrimination task in which varying background optic flow induces robust perceptual biases. This method overcomes an important challenge to understanding the neural basis of subjective percepts.

">Expectation modulates learning emotional words: Evidence from a hierarchical Bayesian model</a></h4>

              
                In language acquisition, individuals learn the emotional value of words through external feedback. Previous studies have used emotional words as experimental materials to explore the cognitive mechanism underlying emotional language processing, but have failed to recognize that languages are acquired in a changing environment. To this end, this study aims to combine reinforcement learning with emotional word learning, using a probabilistic reversal learning task to explore how individuals acquire the valence of emotional words in a dynamically changing environment. Our computational modeling on both behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) data revealed that individuals' expectations can modulate the learning speed and temporal processing of emotional words, demonstrating a clear negative bias. Specifically, as the expected value increases, individuals respond faster and exhibit higher amplitudes for negative emotional words. These findings shed light on the neural mechanisms of emotional word learning in a volatile environment, highlighting the crucial role of expectations in this process and the preference for processing negative information.

">Enhancing Statistical Power While Maintaining Small Sample Sizes in Behavioral Neuroscience Experiments Evaluating Success Rates</a></h4>

              
                Studies with low statistical power reduce the probability of detecting true effects and often lead to overestimated effect sizes, undermining the reproducibility of scientific results. While several free statistical software tools are available for calculating statistical power, they often do not account for the specialized aspects of experimental designs in behavioral studies that evaluate success rates. To address this gap, we developed "SuccessRatePower" a free and user-friendly power calculator based on Monte Carlo simulations that takes into account the particular parameters of these experimental designs. Using "SuccessRatePower", we demonstrated that statistical power can be increased by modifying the experimental protocol in three ways: 1) reducing the probability of succeeding by chance (chance level), 2) increasing the number of trials used to calculate subject success rates, and 3) employing statistical analyses suited for discrete values. These adjustments enable even studies with small sample sizes to achieve high statistical power. Finally, we performed an associative behavioral task in mice, confirming the simulated statistical advantages of reducing chance levels and increasing the number of trials in such studies

">Differential Reactivation of Task-Demand-Associated Firing Patterns in Subicular and CA1 Place Cells during a Hippocampal Memory Task</a></h4>

              
                Reactivation of place cells during sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) in the hippocampus is pivotal for memory consolidation, yet the SWR dynamics between the hippocampus and its neighboring subiculum remain underexplored. This study examined the differential SWR-associated reactivations of task-demand-associated representations in the subiculum and CA1 during a visual scene memory task in rats. In the task, the spiking activities of place-cell ensembles were reactivated during a SWR event according to task demands. These reactivations were more frequent and associated with more heterogeneous task-demand types in the subiculum compared to CA1. These subicular characteristics were driven by multiple subfields within the subicular place field, parcellated by the theta phase precession cycle. In contrast, CA1 exhibited a higher incidence of spatial replay than the subiculum. These findings indicate that the subiculum plays a key role in transmitting task-specific variables from the hippocampus to other brain regions.

">Ultrastructural diversity of alpha-Synuclein pathology in the post-mortem brain of Parkinson patients: implications for Lewy Body formation</a></h4>

              
                Lewy bodies, the major pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease, are intraneuronal inclusions rich in aggregated alpha-synuclein (aSyn). To understand the cellular mechanisms behind the formation of Lewy bodies and the aggregation of aSyn, we used correlative light and electron microscopy and detailed ultrastructural analysis of postmortem brain tissue samples of Parkinson patients. We found that somal aSyn inclusions in dopaminergic neurons were exclusively fibrillar, while membranous-type inclusions were located outside the cell soma and likely compact neuritic aggregates. These neuritic inclusions displayed phenotypic heterogeneity, ranging from predominantly membranous to mixed membranous/fibrillar ultrastructures. Our data suggest that membranous and fibrillar aSyn inclusions form via distinct mechanisms, with membranous neuritic inclusions providing the environment for the initial nucleation of aSyn fibrils, which could then spread via a prion-like mechanism to form somal fibrillar Lewy bodies. This study provides important insight into Lewy body formation and highlights the importance of aSyn and membrane interactions for future therapeutic intervention.

">Melanocortin system activates carotid body arterial chemoreceptors in hypertension</a></h4>

              
                Background: The body's internal milieu is controlled by a system of interoceptors coupled to motor outflows that drive compensatory adaptive responses. These include the arterial chemoreceptors, best known for sensing arterial oxygen. In cardiometabolic diseases, such as essential hypertension, the carotid bodies (CB) exhibit heightened reflex sensitivity and tonic activity without an apparent stimulus. The mechanisms behind CB sensitization in these conditions are not well understood. Methods: Guided by functional genomics, a range of functional assays are used to interrogate downstream intracellular and interorgan signalling pathways involved in arterial chemosensory function. Results: Here, we report the presence of the Melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) in the mammalian CB and show its elevated expression in experimental hypertension. We demonstrate that melanocortin agonists activate arterial chemosensory cells, modulating CB chemosensory afferent drive to influence both resting and chemoreflex-evoked sympathetic and ventilatory activity. Transcriptional analysis of hypertensive CB implicates the activation of the Mash1 (Ascl1) regulatory network in driving elevated Mc4r expression. Conclusions: Collectively, our data indicate a primarily pathophysiological role of melanocortin signalling in arterial chemosensation, contributing to excess sympathetic activity in cardiometabolic disease.

">Cerebellar systems consolidation driven by the temporal dynamics of Purkinje cell excitability</a></h4>

              
                Systems consolidation, essential for long-term memory formation, orchestrates the reorganization of newly encoded memories into subsequent neural circuitry. While the role of synaptic mechanism in consolidation is well understood, the contribution of neuronal intrinsic excitability (IE) remains relatively unexplored. Herein, we adopted a cerebellum-dependent learning model, and manipulated IE of the sole output of the cerebellar cortex, Purkinje cells (PCs), to corroborate the direct causality between neuronal IE and memory consolidation and assessed its impact on intrinsic plasticity of the downstream neural circuits. Optogenetic excitation disrupted consolidation but was effective only within the 90 min post-learning time window. Notably, PC-IE temporarily weakened, but the effect faded beyond 90 minutes. Furthermore, abnormally increased PC-IE abolished intrinsic plasticity in flocculus-targeting neurons, a post-circuitry of cortical PCs, within the medial vestibular nucleus. These findings thus emphasize the precise temporal dynamics of IE, highlighting it as a crucial mechanism for systems consolidation.

">Cortico-subcortical dynamics in primate working memory</a></h4>

              
                Working memory is essential for cognition, facilitating the temporary maintenance and manipulation of information to produce goal-directed behavior. While both cortical and subcortical structures are involved, their precise roles and interactions are not fully understood. To investigate this, we simultaneously recorded neural activity from the frontal and parietal cortex, higher-order thalamic nuclei, and core basal ganglia structures during color and spatial working memory tasks in non-human primates. We found widespread yet differential encoding of color and spatial information, marked by area-specific temporal dynamics and modulation according to task demands. Both cortical and subcortical information increased towards working memory-dependent actions, suggesting a task-specific reloading of information. Directed interactions between cortical and subcortical regions were extensive and reciprocal, with dominant directions of information flow, especially from frontoparietal areas. These interactions were dynamically modulated and partially task specific. Our findings provide comprehensive insights into the large-scale circuit dynamics underlying primate working memory and suggest that flexible goal-directed behavior relies on the selective processing of task-relevant memory information within information-specific cortico-subcortical networks.

">Modeling Nitric Oxide Diffusion and Plasticity Modulation in Cerebellar Learning</a></h4>

              
                Nitric Oxide (NO) is a versatile signalling molecule with significant roles in various physiological processes, including synaptic plasticity and memory formation. In the cerebellum, NO is produced by neural NO Synthase and diffuses to influence synaptic changes, particularly at parallel fiber - Purkinje cell synapses. This study aims to investigate NO's role in cerebellar learning mechanisms using a biologically realistic simulation-based approach. We developed the NO Diffusion Simulator (NODS), a Python module designed to model NO production and diffusion within a cerebellar spiking neural network framework. Our simulations focus on the Eye-Blink Classical Conditioning protocol to assess the impact of NO modulation on long-term potentiation and depression at parallel fiber - Purkinje cell synapses. The results demonstrate that NO diffusion significantly affects synaptic plasticity, dynamically adjusting learning rates based on synaptic activity patterns. This metaplasticity mechanism enhances the cerebellum's capacity to prioritize relevant inputs and mitigate learning interference selectively modulating synaptic efficacy. Our findings align with theoretical models suggesting that NO serves as a contextual indicator, optimizing learning rates for effective motor control and adaptation to new tasks. The NODS implementation provides an efficient tool for large-scale simulations, facilitating future studies on NO dynamics in various brain regions and neurovascular coupling scenarios. By bridging the gap between molecular processes and network-level learning, this work underscores the critical role of NO in cerebellar function and offers a robust framework for exploring NO-dependent plasticity in computational neuroscience.

	<p>Background: Psoriasis and atopic dermatitis are chronic skin diseases found all over the world that cause a lot of suffering to patients. Objectives: The aim of this study was to answer the following questions: whether people suffering from psoriasis and AD have greater problems with recognizing emotions, the effectiveness of attention and memory processes, and whether they use different strategies of coping with stress than healthy people. Methods: This study involved 90 patients, including 30 patients with psoriasis, 30 patients with AD and 30 healthy patients, aged 21 to 63 years, including 54 women and 36 men. This study used a battery of the CANTAB Cognitive Tests, Mini-COPE Questionnaire Inventory, Toronto Alexithymia Scale TAS Questionnaire, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, and Eczema Area and Severity Index. Results: People with psoriasis and AD had higher total scores on the alexithymia scale and had greater difficulty in identifying and verbalizing emotions. People with psoriasis and AD are less likely to choose the correct stimulus and achieve a shorter length of the sequence that should be remembered. Psoriasis patients with more severe symptoms are less likely to use the strategy of a sense of humor in stressful situations. AD patients with more severe symptoms are less likely to use strategies of operative thinking, denial and self-blame, and the strategy of seeking instrumental support is used more often. Conclusion: Patients with psoriasis and AD require a holistic approach; in addition to dermatological treatment, psychological support, psychotherapeutic support and possible psychiatric treatment are recommended.</p>

	<p>To investigate the reliability of L2 listening tests and explore potential factors affecting the reliability, a reliability generalization (RG) meta-analysis was conducted in the present study. A total number of 122 alpha coefficients of L2 listening tests from 92 published articles were collected and submitted to a linear mixed effects RG analysis. The papers were coded based on a coding scheme consisting of 16 variables classified into three categories: study features, test features, and statistical results. The results showed an average reliability of 0.818 (95% CI: 0.803 to 0.833), with 40% of reliability estimates falling below the lower bound of CI. The presence of publication bias and heterogeneity was found in the reliability of L2 listening tests, indicating that low reliability coefficients were likely omitted from some published studies. In addition, two factors predicting the reliability of L2 listening tests were the number of items and test type (standardized and researcher- or teacher-designed tests). The study also found that reliability is not a moderator of the relationship between L2 listening scores and theoretically relevant constructs. Reliability induction was identified in reporting the reliability of L2 listening tests, too. Implications for researchers and teachers are discussed.</p>

	<p>Objective: to identify advanced or &amp;amp;ldquo;so-called inoperable&amp;amp;rdquo; cases of tympanojugular paragangliomas (PGLs) and analyze how each case is surgically managed and followed afterward. Study Design: a retrospective case series study. Methods: Out of 262 type C and D TJPs and more than 10 cases of advanced or so-called inoperable cases, files of 6 patients with a diagnosis of advanced tympanojugular PGLs who were referred to an otology and skull-base center between 1996 and 2021 were reviewed to analyze management and surgical outcomes. The criteria for choosing these cases involve having one or more of the following features: (1) a large-sized tumor; (2) a single ipsilateral internal carotid artery (ICA); (3) involvement of the vertebral artery; (4) a considerable involvement of the ICA; (5) an extension to the clivus, foramen magnum, and cavernous sinus; (6) large intradural involvement (IDE); and (7) bilateral or multiple PGLs. Results: The age range at presentation was 25&amp;amp;ndash;43 years old, with a mean of 40.5 years: two females and four males. The presenting symptoms were glossal atrophy, hearing loss, pulsatile tinnitus, dysphonia, shoulder weakness, and diplopia. The modified Infratemporal Fossa Approach (ITFA) with a transcondylar&amp;amp;ndash;transtubercular extension is the principal approach in most cases, with additional approaches being used accordingly. Conclusions: The contemporary introduction of carotid artery stenting with the direct and indirect embolization of PGLs has made it possible to operate on many cases, which was otherwise considered impossible to treat surgically. Generally, the key is to stage the removal of the tumor in multiple stages during the management of complex PGLs to decrease surgical morbidities. A crucial aspect is to centralize the treatment of PGLs in referral centers with experienced surgeons who are trained to plan the stages and manage possible surgical complications.</p>

	<p>Long COVID-19 is characterized by ongoing symptoms or prolonged or long-term complications of SARS-CoV-2 contraction which persist beyond 4 weeks from the initial onset of symptoms. Gender and duration of hospitalization (DH) are key risk factors for developing long COVID-19 syndrome, but their impact and interplay need further study. This research involved 996 long COVID-19 patients, and we compared the levels of general psychopathology, depression, agitated depression, anxiety, and medication use between hospitalized and non-hospitalized males and females. In the hospitalized patients, multivariate regressions assessed the impact of gender, DH, and the interaction of these variables. The females had higher levels of long COVID-19 symptoms, psychotropic drug use, depression, anxiety, and general psychopathology than the males. The non-hospitalized females exhibited more severe agitated depression than the non-hospitalized males. In females, DH was more strongly correlated with the number of psychotropic medications used during long COVID-19. A negative correlation was found between DH and severity of agitated depression in the female patients only. These results highlight that the gender-specific relationship between DH and agitated depression severity should be explored further.</p>

	<p>A new dyslexia screening test for Italian, Tiltan-IT, is presented. The test was developed based on an integrated dual-route model of reading, which describes in detail specific mechanisms underpinning early visual processes as well as the lexical and the sublexical routes. The principle according to which the test was developed is that each dyslexia type is manifested in different kinds of errors and in different kinds of stimuli, and we therefore included stimuli sensitive to each dyslexia type in the test. Tiltan-IT is a reading aloud test that includes word, nonword, and word pair lists. The test was administered to 618 Italian-speaking children (2nd&amp;amp;ndash;8th grade). Each error produced by the children was classified through the coding scheme developed to detect the different types of dyslexias described by the reading model. The Tiltan-IT was able to identify 110 children with dyslexia. The identified dyslexia types included letter position dyslexia, attentional dyslexia, letter identity dyslexia, surface dyslexia, vowel dyslexia, consonant conversion dyslexia, multi-letter phonological dyslexia, voicing dyslexia. The results confirm that the selection of items in the Tiltan-IT enabled the detection of the wide variety of dyslexias in Italian, some of them for the first time, adding evidence for the cross-linguistic validity of multiple types of developmental dyslexias and for the dual-route model of reading.</p>

	<p>The insula is often considered the fifth lobe of the brain and is increasingly recognized as one of the most connected regions in the brain, with widespread connections to cortical and subcortical structures. As a follow-up to our previous tractography work, we investigated the resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) profiles of insular subregions and assessed their concordance with structural connectivity. We used the CONN toolbox to analyze the rsFC of the same 19 insular regions of interest (ROIs) we used in our prior tractography work and regrouped them into six subregions based on their connectivity pattern similarity. Our analysis of 50 healthy participants confirms the known broad connectivity of the insula and shows novel and specific whole-brain and intra-connectivity patterns of insular subregions. By examining such subregions, our findings provide a more detailed pattern of connectivity than prior studies that may prove useful for comparison between patients.</p>

	<p>Pain is a complex response to noxious stimuli. Upon detection of the nociceptive stimulus by first-order neurons or nociceptors, an action potential ascends to the spinal dorsal horn, a crucial site for synapsing with second-order neurons. These second-order neurons carry the nociceptive stimulus to supraspinal regions, notably the thalamus. Although extensive research has focused on spinal-level nociceptive mechanisms (e.g., neurotransmitters, receptors, and glial cells), the thalamus is still poorly elucidated. The role of the thalamus in relaying sensory and motor responses to the cortex is well known. However, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms in the synapse between the second-order and third-order neurons that transmit this impulse to the somatosensory cortex, where the response is processed and interpreted as pain, is still lacking. Thus, this review investigated the thalamus&amp;amp;rsquo;s role in transmitting nociceptive impulses. Current evidence indicates the involvement of the neurotransmitters glutamate and serotonin, along with NMDA, P2X4, TLR4, FGR, and NLRP3 receptors, as well as signaling pathways including ERK, P38, NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B, cytokines, and glial cells at nociceptive synapses within the thalamus.</p>

                <p>Many neurons including vasopressin (VP) magnocellular neurosecretory cells (MNCs) of the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus (SON) generate afterhyperpolarizations (AHPs) during spiking to slow firing, a phenomenon known as spike frequency adaptation. The AHP is underlain by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> currents, and while slow component (sAHP) features are well described, its mechanism remains poorly understood. Previous work demonstrated that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through N-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels is a primary source of sAHP activation in SON oxytocin neurons, but no obvious channel coupling was described for VP neurons. Given this, we tested the possibility of an intracellular source of sAHP activation, namely, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-handling organelles endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria in male and female Wistar rats. We demonstrate that ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion greatly inhibits sAHPs without a corresponding decrease in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal. Caffeine sensitized AHP activation by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In contrast to ER, disabling mitochondria with CCCP or blocking mitochondria Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporters (MCUs) enhanced sAHP amplitude and duration, implicating mitochondria as a vital buffer for sAHP-activating Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Block of mitochondria Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> release via triphenylphosphonium (TPP<sup>+</sup>) failed to affect sAHPs, indicating that mitochondria Ca<sup>2+</sup> does not contribute to sAHP activation. Together, our results suggests that ER Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release activates sAHPs and mitochondria shape the spatiotemporal trajectory of the sAHP via Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering in VP neurons. Overall, this implicates organelle Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and specifically ER&ndash;mitochondria-associated membrane contacts, as an important site of Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomain activity that regulates sAHP signaling pathways. Thus, this site plays a major role in influencing VP firing activity and systemic hormonal release.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/30/e0195242024?rss=1">Neural Representation of Valenced and Generic Probability and Uncertainty</a></h4>

              
                <p>Representing the probability and uncertainty of outcomes facilitates adaptive behavior by allowing organisms to prepare in advance and devote attention to relevant events. Probability and uncertainty are often studied only for valenced (appetitive or aversive) outcomes, raising the question of whether the identified neural machinery also processes the probability and uncertainty of motivationally neutral outcomes. Here, we aimed to dissociate valenced from valence-independent (i.e., generic) probability (<I>p</I>; maximum at <I>p</I>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1) and uncertainty (maximum at <I>p</I> = 0.5) signals using human neuroimaging. In a Pavlovian task (<I>n</I> = 41; 19 females), different cues predicted appetitive, aversive, or neutral liquids with different probabilities (<I>p</I> = 0, <I>p</I> = 0.5, <I>p</I> = 1). Cue-elicited motor responses accelerated, and pupil sizes increased primarily for cues that predicted valenced liquids with higher probability. For neutral liquids, uncertainty rather than probability tended to accelerate cue-induced responding and decrease pupil size. At the neural level, generic uncertainty signals were limited to the occipital cortex, while generic probability also activated the anterior ventromedial prefrontal cortex. These generic probability and uncertainty signals contrasted with cue-induced responses that only encoded the probability and uncertainty of valenced liquids in medial prefrontal, insular, and occipital cortices. Our findings show a behavioral and neural dissociation of generic and valenced signals. Thus, some parts of the brain keep track of motivational charge while others do not, highlighting the need and usefulness of characterizing the exact nature of learned representations.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/30/e0261242024?rss=1">{beta}-arrestins Are Scaffolding Proteins Required for Shh-Mediated Axon Guidance</a></h4>

              
                <p>During nervous system development, Sonic hedgehog (Shh) guides developing commissural axons toward the floor plate of the spinal cord. To guide axons, Shh binds to its receptor Boc and activates downstream effectors such as Smoothened (Smo) and Src family kinases (SFKs). SFK activation requires Smo activity and is also required for Shh-mediated axon guidance. Here we report that &beta;-arrestin1 and &beta;-arrestin2 (&beta;-arrestins) serve as scaffolding proteins that link Smo and SFKs in Shh-mediated axon guidance. We found that &beta;-arrestins are expressed in rat commissural neurons. We also found that Smo, &beta;-arrestins, and SFKs form a tripartite complex, with the complex formation dependent on &beta;-arrestins. &beta;-arrestin knockdown blocked the Shh-mediated increase in Src phosphorylation, demonstrating that &beta;-arrestins are required to activate Src kinase downstream of Shh. &beta;-arrestin knockdown also led to the loss of Shh-mediated attraction of rat commissural axons in axon turning assays. Expression of two different dominant-negative &beta;-arrestins, &beta;-arrestin1 V53D which blocks the internalization of Smo and &beta;-arrestin1 P91G-P121E which blocks its interaction with SFKs, also led to the loss of Shh-mediated attraction of commissural axons. In vivo, the expression of these dominant-negative &beta;-arrestins caused defects in commissural axon guidance in the spinal cord of chick embryos of mixed sexes. Thus we show that &beta;-arrestins are essential scaffolding proteins that connect Smo to SFKs and are required for Shh-mediated axon guidance.</p>

                <p>Music, like spoken language, is often characterized by hierarchically organized structure. Previous experiments have shown neural tracking of notes and beats, but little work touches on the more abstract question: how does the brain establish high-level musical structures in real time? We presented Bach chorales to participants (20 females and 9 males) undergoing electroencephalogram (EEG) recording to investigate how the brain tracks musical phrases. We removed the main temporal cues to phrasal structures, so that listeners could only rely on harmonic information to parse a continuous musical stream. Phrasal structures were disrupted by locally or globally reversing the harmonic progression, so that our observations on the original music could be controlled and compared. We first replicated the findings on neural tracking of musical notes and beats, substantiating the positive correlation between musical training and neural tracking. Critically, we discovered a neural signature in the frequency range ~0.1&nbsp;Hz (modulations of EEG power) that reliably tracks musical phrasal structure. Next, we developed an approach to quantify the phrasal phase precession of the EEG power, revealing that phrase tracking is indeed an operation of active segmentation involving predictive processes. We demonstrate that the brain establishes complex musical structures online over long timescales (&gt;5&nbsp;s) and actively segments continuous music streams in a manner comparable to language processing. These two neural signatures, phrase tracking and phrasal phase precession, provide new conceptual and technical tools to study the processes underpinning high-level structure building using noninvasive recording techniques.</p>

                <p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a genetic cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. The mesocorticolimbic system, which includes the prefrontal cortex (PFC), basolateral amygdala (BLA), and nucleus accumbens core (NAcC), is essential for regulating socioemotional behaviors. We employed optogenetics to compare the functional properties of the BLA-&gt;NAcC, PFC-&gt;NAcC, and reciprocal PFCBLA pathways in <I>Fmr1&ndash;/y::Drd1a-tdTomato</I> male mice. In FXS mice, the PFCBLA reciprocal pathway was unaffected, while significant synaptic modifications occurred in the BLA/PFC-&gt;NAcC pathways. We observed distinct changes in D1 striatal projection neurons (SPNs) and separate modifications in D2 SPNs. In FXS mice, the BLA/PFC-&gt;NAcC-D2 SPN pathways demonstrated heightened synaptic strength. Focusing on the BLA-&gt;NAcC pathway, linked to autistic symptoms, we found increased AMPAR and NMDAR currents and elevated spine density in D2 SPNs. Conversely, the amplified firing probability of BLA-&gt;NAcC-D1 SPNs was not accompanied by increased synaptic strength, AMPAR and NMDAR currents, or spine density. These pathway-specific alterations resulted in an overall enhancement of excitatory-to-spike coupling, a physiologically relevant index of how efficiently excitatory inputs drive neuronal firing, in both BLA-&gt;NAcC-D1 and BLA-&gt;NAcC-D2 pathways. Finally, the absence of fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMRP) led to impaired long-term depression specifically in BLA-&gt;D1 SPNs. These distinct alterations in synaptic transmission and plasticity within circuits targeting the NAcC highlight the potential role of postsynaptic mechanisms in selected SPNs in the observed circuit-level changes. This research underscores the heightened vulnerability of the NAcC in the context of FMRP deficiency, emphasizing its pivotal role in the pathophysiology of FXS.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/30/e1717232024?rss=1">Electrophysiological Mechanisms and Validation of Ferritin-Based Magnetogenetics for Remote Control of Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Magnetogenetics was developed to remotely control genetically targeted neurons. A variant of magnetogenetics uses magnetic fields to activate transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) channels when coupled with ferritin. Stimulation with static or RF magnetic fields of neurons expressing these channels induces Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and modulates behavior. However, the validity of ferritin-based magnetogenetics has been questioned due to controversies surrounding the underlying mechanisms and deficits in reproducibility. Here, we validated the magnetogenetic approach Ferritin-iron Redistribution to Ion Channels (FeRIC) using electrophysiological (Ephys) and imaging techniques. Previously, interference from RF stimulation rendered patch-clamp recordings inaccessible for magnetogenetics. We solved this limitation for FeRIC, and we studied the bioelectrical properties of neurons expressing TRPV4 (nonselective cation channel) and transmembrane member 16A (TMEM16A; chloride-permeable channel) coupled to ferritin (FeRIC channels) under RF stimulation. We used cultured neurons obtained from the rat hippocampus of either sex. We show that RF decreases the membrane resistance (Rm) and depolarizes the membrane potential in neurons expressing TRPV4<sup>FeRIC</sup>. RF does not directly trigger action potential firing but increases the neuronal basal spiking frequency. In neurons expressing TMEM16A<sup>FeRIC</sup>, RF decreases the Rm, hyperpolarizes the membrane potential, and decreases the spiking frequency. Additionally, we corroborated the previously described biochemical mechanism responsible for RF-induced activation of ferritin-coupled ion channels. We solved an enduring problem for ferritin-based magnetogenetics, obtaining direct Ephys evidence of RF-induced activation of ferritin-coupled ion channels. We found that RF does not yield instantaneous changes in neuronal membrane potentials. Instead, RF produces responses that are long-lasting and moderate, but effective in controlling the bioelectrical properties of neurons.</p>

                <p>Linking sensory input and its consequences is a fundamental brain operation. During behavior, the neural activity of neocortical and limbic systems often reflects dynamic combinations of sensory and task-dependent variables, and these "mixed representations" are suggested to be important for perception, learning, and plasticity. However, the extent to which such integrative computations might occur outside of the forebrain is less clear. Here, we conduct cellular-resolution two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in the superficial "shell" layers of the inferior colliculus (IC), as head-fixed mice of either sex perform a reward-based psychometric auditory task. We find that the activity of individual shell IC neurons jointly reflects auditory cues, mice's actions, and behavioral trial outcomes, such that trajectories of neural population activity diverge depending on mice's behavioral choice. Consequently, simple classifier models trained on shell IC neuron activity can predict trial-by-trial outcomes, even when training data are restricted to neural activity occurring prior to mice's instrumental actions. Thus, in behaving mice, auditory midbrain neurons transmit a population code that reflects a joint representation of sound, actions, and task-dependent variables.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/30/e2134232024?rss=1">Decoding Remapped Spatial Information in the Peri-Saccadic Period</a></h4>

              
                <p>It has been suggested that, prior to a saccade, visual neurons predictively respond to stimuli that will fall in their receptive fields after completion of the saccade. This saccadic remapping process is thought to compensate for the shift of the visual world across the retina caused by eye movements. To map the timing of this predictive process in the brain, we recorded neural activity using electroencephalography during a saccade task. Human participants (male and female) made saccades between two fixation points while covertly attending to oriented gratings briefly presented at various locations on the screen. Data recorded during trials in which participants maintained fixation were used to train classifiers on stimuli in different positions. Subsequently, data collected during saccade trials were used to test for the presence of remapped stimulus information at the post-saccadic retinotopic location in the peri-saccadic period, providing unique insight into when remapped information becomes available. We found that the stimulus could be decoded at the remapped location ~180&nbsp;ms post-stimulus onset, but only when the stimulus was presented 100&ndash;200&nbsp;ms before saccade onset. Within this range, we found that the timing of remapping was dictated by stimulus onset rather than saccade onset. We conclude that presenting the stimulus immediately before the saccade allows for optimal integration of the corollary discharge signal with the incoming peripheral visual information, resulting in a remapping of activation to the relevant post-saccadic retinotopic neurons.</p>

                <p>Light plays an essential role in a variety of physiological processes, including vision, mood, and glucose homeostasis. However, the intricate relationship between light and an animal's feeding behavior has remained elusive. Here, we found that light exposure suppresses food intake, whereas darkness amplifies it in male mice. Interestingly, this phenomenon extends its reach to diurnal male Nile grass rats and healthy humans. We further show that lateral habenula (LHb) neurons in mice respond to light exposure, which in turn activates 5-HT neurons in the dorsal Raphe nucleus (DRN). Activation of the LHb-&gt;5-HT<sup>DRN</sup> circuit in mice blunts darkness-induced hyperphagia, while inhibition of the circuit prevents light-induced anorexia. Together, we discovered a light-responsive neural circuit that relays the environmental light signals to regulate feeding behavior in mice.</p>

                <p>Completely ignoring a salient distractor presented concurrently with a target is difficult, and sometimes attention is involuntarily attracted to the distractor's location (attentional capture). Employing the N2ac component as a marker of attention allocation toward sounds, in this study we investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of auditory attention across two experiments. Human participants (male and female) performed an auditory search task, where the target was accompanied by a distractor in two-third of the trials. For a distractor more salient than the target (Experiment 1), we observe not only a distractor N2ac (indicating attentional capture) but the full chain of attentional dynamics implied by the notion of attentional capture, namely, (1) the distractor captures attention before the target is attended, (2) allocation of attention to the target is delayed by distractor presence, and (3) the target is attended after the distractor. Conversely, for a distractor less salient than the target (Experiment 2), although responses were delayed, no attentional capture was observed. Together, these findings reveal two types of spatial attentional dynamics in the auditory modality (distraction with and without attentional capture).</p>

                <p>Mature vertebrates maintain posture using vestibulospinal neurons that transform sensed instability into reflexive commands to spinal motor circuits. Postural stability improves across development. However, due to the complexity of terrestrial locomotion, vestibulospinal contributions to postural refinement in early life remain unexplored. Here we leveraged the relative simplicity of underwater locomotion to quantify the postural consequences of losing vestibulospinal neurons during development in larval zebrafish of undifferentiated sex. By comparing posture at two timepoints, we discovered that later lesions of vestibulospinal neurons led to greater instability. Analysis of thousands of individual swim bouts revealed that lesions disrupted movement timing and corrective reflexes without impacting swim kinematics, and that this effect was particularly strong in older larvae. Using a generative model of swimming, we showed how these disruptions could account for the increased postural variability at both timepoints. Finally, late lesions disrupted the fin/trunk coordination observed in older larvae, linking vestibulospinal neurons to postural control schemes used to navigate in depth. Since later lesions were considerably more disruptive to postural stability, we conclude that vestibulospinal contributions to balance increase as larvae mature. Vestibulospinal neurons are highly conserved across vertebrates; we therefore propose that they are a substrate for developmental improvements to postural control.</p>

Protein kinase function and interactions with drugs are controlled in part by the movement of the DFG and ɑC-Helix motifs that are related to the catalytic activity of the kinase. Small molecule ligands elicit therapeutic effects with distinct selectivity profiles and residence times that often depend on the active or inactive kinase conformation(s) they bind. Modern AI-based structural modeling methods have the potential to expand upon the limited availability of experimentally determined kinase structures in inactive states. Here, we first explored the conformational space of kinases in the PDB and models generated by AlphaFold2 (AF2) and ESMFold, two prominent AI-based protein structure prediction methods. Our investigation of AF2’s ability to explore the conformational diversity of the kinome at various multiple sequence alignment (MSA) depths showed a bias within the predicted structures of kinases in DFG-in conformations, particularly those controlled by the DFG motif, based on their overabundance in the PDB. We demonstrate that predicting kinase structures using AF2 at lower MSA depths explored these alternative conformations more extensively, including identifying previously unobserved conformations for 398 kinases. Ligand enrichment analyses for 23 kinases showed that, on average, docked models distinguished between active molecules and decoys better than random (average AUC (avgAUC) of 64.58), but select models perform well (e.g., avgAUCs for PTK2 and JAK2 were 79.28 and 80.16, respectively). Further analysis explained the ligand enrichment discrepancy between low- and high-performing kinase models as binding site occlusions that would preclude docking. The overall results of our analyses suggested that, although AF2 explored previously uncharted regions of the kinase conformational space and select models exhibited enrichment scores suitable for rational drug discovery, rigorous refinement of AF2 models is likely still necessary for drug discovery campaigns.

                <p>by Virgile Andreani, Eric J. South, Mary J. Dunlop</p>

Dense arrangements of binding sites within nucleotide sequences can collectively influence downstream transcription rates or initiate biomolecular interactions. For example, natural promoter regions can harbor many overlapping transcription factor binding sites that influence the rate of transcription initiation. Despite the prevalence of overlapping binding sites in nature, rapid design of nucleotide sequences with many overlapping sites remains a challenge. Here, we show that this is an NP-hard problem, coined here as the nucleotide String Packing Problem (SPP). We then introduce a computational technique that efficiently assembles sets of DNA-protein binding sites into dense, contiguous stretches of double-stranded DNA. For the efficient design of nucleotide sequences spanning hundreds of base pairs, we reduce the SPP to an Orienteering Problem with integer distances, and then leverage modern integer linear programming solvers. Our method optimally packs sets of 20–100 binding sites into dense nucleotide arrays of 50–300 base pairs in 0.05–10 seconds. Unlike approximation algorithms or meta-heuristics, our approach finds provably optimal solutions. We demonstrate how our method can generate large sets of diverse sequences suitable for library generation, where the frequency of binding site usage across the returned sequences can be controlled by modulating the objective function. As an example, we then show how adding additional constraints, like the inclusion of sequence elements with fixed positions, allows for the design of bacterial promoters. The nucleotide string packing approach we present can accelerate the design of sequences with complex DNA-protein interactions. When used in combination with synthesis and high-throughput screening, this design strategy could help interrogate how complex binding site arrangements impact either gene expression or biomolecular mechanisms in varied cellular contexts.

                <p>by Pierre Le Denmat, Tom Verguts, Kobe Desender</p>

Human decision making is accompanied by a sense of confidence. According to Bayesian decision theory, confidence reflects the learned probability of making a correct response, given available data (e.g., accumulated stimulus evidence and response time). Although optimal, independently learning these probabilities for all possible data combinations is computationally intractable. Here, we describe a novel model of confidence implementing a low-dimensional approximation of this optimal yet intractable solution. This model allows efficient estimation of confidence, while at the same time accounting for idiosyncrasies, different kinds of biases and deviation from the optimal probability correct. Our model dissociates confidence biases resulting from the estimate of the reliability of evidence by individuals (captured by parameter α), from confidence biases resulting from general stimulus independent under and overconfidence (captured by parameter β). We provide empirical evidence that this model accurately fits both choice data (accuracy, response time) and trial-by-trial confidence ratings simultaneously. Finally, we test and empirically validate two novel predictions of the model, namely that 1) changes in confidence can be independent of performance and 2) selectively manipulating each parameter of our model leads to distinct patterns of confidence judgments. As a tractable and flexible account of the computation of confidence, our model offers a clear framework to interpret and further resolve different forms of confidence biases.

Evidently, establishing practical means for collaboration and data sharing among institutions is a fundamental methodological barrier for performing high-powered studies. As the sample sizes become more heterogeneous, complex statistical approaches, such as generalized linear mixed effects models, must be used to correct for the confounders that may bias results. On another front, due to the privacy concerns around Protected Health Information (PHI), genetic information is restrictively protected by sharing according to regulations such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This limits data sharing among institutions and hampers efforts around executing high-powered collaborative studies. Federated approaches are promising to alleviate the issues around privacy and performance, since sensitive data never leaves the local sites. Motivated by these, we developed FedGMMAT, a federated genetic association testing tool that utilizes a federated statistical testing approach for efficient association tests that can correct for confounding fixed and additive polygenic random effects among different collaborating sites. Genetic data is never shared among collaborating sites, and the intermediate statistics are protected by encryption. Using simulated and real datasets, we demonstrate FedGMMAT can achieve the virtually same results as pooled analysis under a privacy-preserving framework with practical resource requirements.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002547">Wnt signaling modulates the response to DNA damage in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc by regulating the EGFR pathway</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ben Ewen-Campen, Norbert Perrimon</p>

Despite the deep conservation of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, cells in different contexts vary widely in their susceptibility to DNA damage and their propensity to undergo apoptosis as a result of genomic lesions. One of the cell signaling pathways implicated in modulating the DDR is the highly conserved Wnt pathway, which is known to promote resistance to DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation in a variety of human cancers. However, the mechanisms linking Wnt signal transduction to the DDR remain unclear. Here, we use a genetically encoded system in <i>Drosophila</i> to reliably induce consistent levels of DNA damage in vivo, and demonstrate that canonical Wnt signaling in the wing imaginal disc buffers cells against apoptosis in the face of DNA double-strand breaks. We show that Wg, the primary Wnt ligand in <i>Drosophila</i>, activates epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling via the ligand-processing protease Rhomboid, which, in turn, modulates the DDR in a <i>Chk2</i>-, <i>p53</i>-, and <i>E2F1-</i>dependent manner. These studies provide mechanistic insight into the modulation of the DDR by the Wnt and EGFR pathways in vivo in a highly proliferative tissue. Furthermore, they reveal how the growth and patterning functions of Wnt signaling are coupled with prosurvival, antiapoptotic activities, thereby facilitating developmental robustness in the face of genomic damage.

                Exposure to outdoor air pollution has been linked to adverse health effects, including potential widespread impacts on the CNS. Ongoing brain development may render children and adolescents especially vulnerable to neurotoxic effects of air pollution. While mechanisms remain unclear, promising advances in human neuroimaging can help elucidate both sensitive periods and neurobiological consequences of exposure to air pollution. Herein we review the potential influences of air pollution exposure on neurodevelopment, drawing from animal toxicology and human neuroimaging studies. Due to ongoing cellular and system-level changes during childhood and adolescence, the developing brain may be more sensitive to pollutants’ neurotoxic effects, as a function of both timing and duration, with relevance to cognition and mental health. Building on these foundations, the emerging field of environmental neuroscience is poised to further decipher which air toxicants are most harmful and to whom.

                Intellectual disability is defined as limitations in cognitive and adaptive behavior that often arise during development. Disordered sleep is common in intellectual disability and, given the importance of sleep for cognitive function, it may contribute to other behavioral phenotypes. Animal models of intellectual disability, in particular of monogenic intellectual disability syndromes (MIDS), recapitulate many disease phenotypes and have been invaluable for linking some of these phenotypes to specific molecular pathways. An emerging feature of MIDS, in both animal models and humans, is the prevalence of metabolic abnormalities, which could be relevant for behavior. Focusing on specific MIDS that have been molecularly characterized, we review sleep, circadian, and metabolic phenotypes in animal models and humans and propose that altered metabolic state contributes to the abnormal sleep/circadian phenotypes in MIDS.

Mechanistically, IBSP induces a forward shift of macrophage-to-osteoclast differentiation, leading to early osteolysis. Inhibition of RAC1 reduces the incidence of bone metastasis and ameliorates bone destruction.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93509">Sex differences in discrimination behavior and orbitofrontal engagement during context-gated reward prediction</a></h4>

              
                Animals, including humans, rely on contextual information to interpret ambiguous stimuli. Impaired context processing is a hallmark of several neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and addiction. While sex differences in the prevalence and manifestations of these disorders are well established, potential sex differences in context processing remain uncertain. Here, we examined sex differences in the contextual control over cue-evoked reward seeking and its neural correlates, in rats. Male and female rats were trained in a bidirectional occasion-setting preparation in which the validity of two auditory reward-predictive cues was informed by the presence, or absence, of a visual contextual feature (LIGHT: X+/DARK: X−/LIGHT: Y−/DARK: Y+). Females were significantly slower to acquire contextual control over cue-evoked reward seeking. However, once established, the contextual control over behavior was more robust in female rats; it showed less within-session variability (less influence of prior reward) and greater resistance to acute stress. This superior contextual control achieved by females was accompanied by an increased activation of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) compared to males. Critically, these behavioral and neural sex differences were specific to the contextual modulation process and not observed in simple, context-independent, reward prediction tasks. These results indicate a sex-biased trade-off between the speed of acquisition and the robustness of performance in the contextual modulation of cued reward seeking. The different distribution of sexes along the fast learning ↔ steady performance continuum might reflect different levels of engagement of the OFC, and might have implications for our understanding of sex differences in psychiatric disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88929">Glycan-shielded homodimer structure and dynamical features of the canine distemper virus hemagglutinin relevant for viral entry and efficient vaccination</a></h4>

              
                Canine distemper virus (CDV) belongs to morbillivirus, including measles virus (MeV) and rinderpest virus, which causes serious immunological and neurological disorders in carnivores, including dogs and rhesus monkeys, as recently reported, but their vaccines are highly effective. The attachment glycoprotein hemagglutinin (CDV-H) at the CDV surface utilizes signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) and Nectin-4 (also called poliovirus-receptor-like-4; PVRL4) as entry receptors. Although fusion models have been proposed, the molecular mechanism of morbillivirus fusion entry is poorly understood. Here, we determined the crystal structure of the globular head domain of CDV-H vaccine strain at 3.2 Å resolution, revealing that CDV-H exhibits a highly tilted homodimeric form with a six-bladed β-propeller fold. While the predicted Nectin-4-binding site is well conserved with that of MeV-H, that of SLAM is similar but partially different, which is expected to contribute to host specificity. Five <i>N</i>-linked sugars covered a broad area of the CDV-H surface to expose receptor-binding sites only, supporting the effective production of neutralizing antibodies. These features are common to MeV-H, although the glycosylation sites are completely different. Furthermore, real-time observation using high-speed atomic force microscopy revealed highly mobile features of the CDV-H dimeric head via the connector region. These results suggest that sugar-shielded tilted homodimeric structure and dynamic conformational changes are common characteristics of morbilliviruses and ensure effective fusion entry and vaccination.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93158">Shared structure facilitates working memory of multiple sequences</a></h4>

              
                Daily experiences often involve the processing of multiple sequences, yet storing them challenges the limited capacity of working memory (WM). To achieve efficient memory storage, relational structures shared by sequences would be leveraged to reorganize and compress information. Here, participants memorized a sequence of items with different colors and spatial locations and later reproduced the full color and location sequences one after another. Crucially, we manipulated the consistency between location and color sequence trajectories. First, sequences with consistent trajectories demonstrate improved memory performance and a trajectory correlation between reproduced color and location sequences. Second, sequences with consistent trajectories show neural reactivation of common trajectories, and display spontaneous replay of color sequences when recalling locations. Finally, neural reactivation correlates with WM behavior. Our findings suggest that a shared common structure is leveraged for the storage of multiple sequences through compressed encoding and neural replay, together facilitating efficient information organization in WM.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91072">Single-molecule analysis reveals the phosphorylation of FLS2 governs its spatiotemporal dynamics and immunity</a></h4>

              
                The <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> FLAGELLIN-SENSITIVE2 (FLS2), a typical receptor kinase, recognizes the conserved 22 amino acid sequence in the N-terminal region of flagellin (flg22) to initiate plant defense pathways, which was intensively studied in the past decades. However, the dynamic regulation of FLS2 phosphorylation at the plasma membrane after flg22 recognition needs further elucidation. Through single-particle tracking, we demonstrated that upon flg22 treatment the phosphorylation of Ser-938 in FLS2 impacts its spatiotemporal dynamics and lifetime. Following Förster resonance energy transfer-fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy and protein proximity indexes assays revealed that flg22 treatment increased the co-localization of GFP-tagged FLS2/FLS2<sup>S938D</sup> but not FLS2<sup>S938A</sup> with AtRem1.3-mCherry, a sterol-rich lipid marker, indicating that the phosphorylation of FLS2<sup>S938</sup> affects FLS2 sorting efficiency to <i>At</i>Rem1.3-associated nanodomains. Importantly, we found that the phosphorylation of Ser-938 enhanced flg22-induced FLS2 internalization and immune responses, demonstrating that the phosphorylation may activate flg22-triggered immunity through partitioning FLS2 into functional <i>At</i>Rem1.3-associated nanodomains, which fills the gap between the FLS2<sup>S938</sup> phosphorylation and FLS2-mediated immunity.

                Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant threat to human health. Although vaccines have been developed to combat AMR, it has proven challenging to associate specific vaccine antigens with AMR. Bacterial plasmids play a crucial role in the transmission of AMR. Our recent research has identified a group of bacterial plasmids (specifically, IncHI plasmids) that encode large molecular mass proteins containing bacterial immunoglobulin-like domains. These proteins are found on the external surface of the bacterial cells, such as in the flagella or conjugative pili. In this study, we show that these proteins are antigenic and can protect mice from infection caused by an AMR <i>Salmonella</i> strain harboring one of these plasmids. Furthermore, we successfully generated nanobodies targeting these proteins, that were shown to interfere with the conjugative transfer of IncHI plasmids. Considering that these proteins are also encoded in other groups of plasmids, such as IncA/C and IncP2, targeting them could be a valuable strategy in combating AMR infections caused by bacteria harboring different groups of AMR plasmids. Since the selected antigens are directly linked to AMR itself, the protective effect extends beyond specific microorganisms to include all those carrying the corresponding resistance plasmids.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88573">YAP/TAZ enhances P-body formation to promote tumorigenesis</a></h4>

              
                The role of processing bodies (P-bodies) in tumorigenesis and tumor progression is not well understood. Here, we showed that the oncogenes YAP/TAZ promote P-body formation in a series of cancer cell lines. Mechanistically, both transcriptional activation of the P-body-related genes <i>SAMD4A, AJUBA</i>, and <i>WTIP</i> and transcriptional suppression of the tumor suppressor gene <i>PNRC1</i> are involved in enhancing the effects of YAP/TAZ on P-body formation in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. By reexpression of PNRC1 or knockdown of P-body core genes (<i>DDX6, DCP1A,</i> and <i>LSM14A</i>), we determined that disruption of P-bodies attenuates cell proliferation, cell migration, and tumor growth induced by overexpression of YAP<sup>5SA</sup> in CRC. Analysis of a pancancer CRISPR screen database (DepMap) revealed co-dependencies between YAP/TEAD and the P-body core genes and correlations between the mRNA levels of <i>SAMD4A, AJUBA, WTIP, PNRC1,</i> and YAP target genes. Our study suggests that the P-body is a new downstream effector of YAP/TAZ, which implies that reexpression of PNRC1 or disruption of P-bodies is a potential therapeutic strategy for tumors with active YAP.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97289">Presynaptic Rac1 in the hippocampus selectively regulates working memory</a></h4>

              
                One of the most extensively studied members of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases, Rac1 is an intracellular signal transducer that remodels actin and phosphorylation signaling networks. Previous studies have shown that Rac1-mediated signaling is associated with hippocampal-dependent working memory and longer-term forms of learning and memory and that Rac1 can modulate forms of both pre- and postsynaptic plasticity. How these different cognitive functions and forms of plasticity mediated by Rac1 are linked, however, is unclear. Here, we show that spatial working memory in mice is selectively impaired following the expression of a genetically encoded Rac1 inhibitor at presynaptic terminals, while longer-term cognitive processes are affected by Rac1 inhibition at postsynaptic sites. To investigate the regulatory mechanisms of this presynaptic process, we leveraged new advances in mass spectrometry to identify the proteomic and post-translational landscape of presynaptic Rac1 signaling. We identified serine/threonine kinases and phosphorylated cytoskeletal signaling and synaptic vesicle proteins enriched with active Rac1. The phosphorylated sites in these proteins are at positions likely to have regulatory effects on synaptic vesicles. Consistent with this, we also report changes in the distribution and morphology of synaptic vesicles and in postsynaptic ultrastructure following presynaptic Rac1 inhibition. Overall, this study reveals a previously unrecognized presynaptic role of Rac1 signaling in cognitive processes and provides insights into its potential regulatory mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87775">Landing force reveals new form of motion-induced sound camouflage in a wild predator</a></h4>

              
                Predator-prey arms races have led to the evolution of finely tuned disguise strategies. While the theoretical benefits of predator camouflage are well established, no study has yet been able to quantify its consequences for hunting success in natural conditions. We used high-resolution movement data to quantify how barn owls (<i>Tyto alba</i>) conceal their approach when using a sit-and-wait strategy. We hypothesized that hunting barn owls would modulate their landing force, potentially reducing noise levels in the vicinity of prey. Analysing 87,957 landings by 163 individuals equipped with GPS tags and accelerometers, we show that barn owls reduce their landing force as they approach their prey, and that landing force predicts the success of the following hunting attempt. Landing force also varied with the substrate, being lowest on man-made poles in field boundaries. The physical environment, therefore, affects the capacity for sound camouflage, providing an unexpected link between predator-prey interactions and land use. Finally, hunting strike forces in barn owls were the highest recorded in any bird, relative to body mass, highlighting the range of selective pressures that act on landings and the capacity of these predators to modulate their landing force. Overall, our results provide the first measurements of landing force in a wild setting, revealing a new form of motion-induced sound camouflage and its link to hunting success.

">Motor Cortical Neuronal Hyperexcitability Associated with α-Synuclein Aggregation</a></h4>

              
                Dysfunction of the cerebral cortex is thought to underlie motor and cognitive impairments in Parkinsons disease (PD). While cortical function is known to be suppressed by abnormal basal ganglia output following dopaminergic degeneration, it remains to be determined how the deposition of Lewy pathology disrupts cortical circuit integrity and function. Moreover, it is also unknown whether cortical Lewy pathology and midbrain dopaminergic degeneration interact to disrupt cortical function in late-stage. To begin to address these questions, we injected -synuclein (Syn) preformed fibrils (PFFs) into the dorsolateral striatum of mice to seed Syn pathology in the cortical cortex and induce degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Using this model system, we reported that Syn aggregates accumulate in the motor cortex in a layer- and cell-subtype-specific pattern. Particularly, intratelencephalic neurons (ITNs) showed earlier accumulation and greater extent of Syn aggregates relative to corticospinal neurons (CSNs). Moreover, we demonstrated that the intrinsic excitability and inputs resistance of Syn aggregates-bearing ITNs in the secondary motor cortex (M2) are increased, along with a noticeable shrinkage of cell bodies and loss of dendritic spines. Last, neither the intrinsic excitability of CSNs nor their thalamocortical input was altered by a partial striatal dopamine depletion associated with Syn pathology. Our results documented motor cortical neuronal hyperexcitability associated with Syn aggregation and provided a novel mechanistic understanding of cortical circuit dysfunction in PD.

">Satellite glial contact enhances differentiation and maturation of human induced sensory neurons</a></h4>

              
                Induced sensory neurons (iSNs) generated from pluripotent stem cells are used to model human peripheral neuropathies, however current differentiation protocols produce sensory neurons with an embryonic phenotype. Peripheral glial cells contact sensory neurons early in development and contribute to formation of the canonical pseudounipolar morphology, but these signals are not encompassed in current iSN differentiation protocols. Here, we show that terminal differentiation of iSNs in co-culture with rodent Dorsal Root Ganglion satellite glia (rSG) advances their differentiation and maturation. Co-cultured iSNs develop a pseudounipolar morphology through contact with rSGs. This transition depends on semaphorin-plexin guidance cues and on glial gap junction signaling. In addition to morphological changes, iSNs terminally differentiated in co-culture exhibit enhanced spontaneous action potential firing, more mature gene expression, and increased susceptibility to paclitaxel induced axonal degeneration. Thus, iSNs differentiated in coculture with rSGs provide a better model for investigating human peripheral neuropathies.

">Aberration correction in long GRIN lens-based microendoscopes for extended field-of-view two-photon imaging in deep brain regions</a></h4>

              
                Two-photon (2P) fluorescence imaging through gradient index (GRIN) lens-based endoscopes is fundamental to investigate the functional properties of neural populations in deep brain circuits. However, GRIN lenses have intrinsic optical aberrations, which severely degrade their imaging performance. GRIN aberrations decrease the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spatial resolution of fluorescence signals, especially in lateral portions of the field-of-view (FOV), leading to restricted FOV and smaller number of recorded neurons. This is especially relevant for GRIN lenses of several millimeters in length, which are needed to reach the deeper regions of the rodent brain. We have previously demonstrated a novel method to enlarge the FOV and improve the spatial resolution of two-photon microendoscopes based on GRIN lenses of length < 4.1 mm (Antonini et al. eLife 2020). However, previously developed microendoscopes were too short to reach the most ventral regions of the mouse brain. In this study, we combined optical simulations with fabrication of aspherical polymer microlenses through three-dimensional (3D) microprinting to correct for optical aberrations in long (length > 6 mm) GRIN lens-based microendoscopes (diameter, 500 {micro}m). Long corrected microendoscopes had improved spatial resolution, enabling imaging in significantly enlarged FOVs. Moreover, using synthetic calcium data we showed that aberration correction enabled detection of cells with higher SNR of fluorescent signals and decreased cross-contamination between neurons. Finally, we applied long corrected microendoscopes to perform large-scale and high precision recordings of calcium signals in populations of neurons in the olfactory cortex, a brain region laying approximately 5 mm from the brain surface, of awake head-tethered mice. Long corrected microendoscopes are powerful new tools enabling population imaging with unprecedented large FOV and high spatial resolution in the most ventral regions of the mouse brain.

                Early stages of Huntington's disease (HD) before the onset of motor and cognitive symptoms are characterized by imbalanced excitatory and inhibitory output from the cortex to striatal and subcortical structures. The window before the onset of symptoms presents an opportunity to adjust the firing rate within microcircuits with the goal of restoring the impaired E/I balance, thereby preventing or slowing down disease progression. Here, we investigated the effect of presymptomatic cell-type specific manipulation of activity of pyramidal neurons and parvalbumin interneurons in the M1 motor cortex on disease progression in the R6/2 HD mouse model. Our results show that dampening excitation of Emx1 pyramidal neurons or increasing activity of parvalbumin interneurons once daily for 3 weeks during the pre-symptomatic phase alleviated HD-related motor coordination dysfunction. Cell-type-specific modulation to normalize the net output of the cortex is a potential therapeutic avenue for HD and other neurodegenerative disorders.

">CD2AP is Co-Expressed with Tropomyosin-Related Kinase A and Ras-Related Protein Rab-5A in Cholinergic Neurons of the Murine Basal Forebrain</a></h4>

              
                Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons project to the hippocampus and cortex, are critical for learning and memory, and are central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). GWAS have consistently shown that genomic variants at the CD2AP gene locus are associated with significant increased risk of AD. GWAS studies have also shown that genetic variants in endocytosis genes, including RAB5A, significantly increase susceptibility to AD. Previous work in our lab has shown that CD2AP functions as a docking-scaffold/adaptor protein as a coordinator of nerve growth factor (NGF) and trophic signaling in neurons. We have also demonstrated that CD2AP positively regulates Rab5-mediated mechanisms of endocytosis in primary sensory neurons. The purpose of this study was to perform an in vivo characterization of CD2AP expression in cholinergic neurons of the brain regions most relevant to AD pathogenesis and to investigate the colocalization of CD2AP and Rab5 in cholinergic neurons of the murine basal forebrain. Brain tissue was perfused, harvested from ChATBAC-eGFP transgenic mice (N=4 male, N=4 female; aged 10 mo), where cholinergic neurons (co-) express green fluorescence protein (GFP) in central and peripheral neurons that express choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). Frozen tissue sections were used to assess the specificity of the reporter in mouse brain along with localization of both CD2AP and Rab5 (co-) expression using immunofluorescence (IF) analysis of ChAT-GFP+ neurons and primary antibodies against ChAT, CD2AP and Rab5. Image J software was used to develop and optimize a colocalization assay for CD2AP and Rab5 puncta. Experiments were repeated in a follow-up cohort of aged-adult mice (N=2 male, N=2 female; aged 18 mo). IF expression of CD2AP was quantified in the basal forebrain, diagonal band of Broca (vDB), and striatal regions and compared to results from the cortical regions of the adult mouse brain. Colocalization of CD2AP was observed in the cell bodies of ChAT-GFP+ neurons of the striatum, vDB and basal forebrain regions, where CD2AP expression intensity as well as the number of cell bodies with positive signal increased incrementally. Colocalization analyses revealed near-complete overlap of CD2AP and Rab5 expression in ChAT-GFP+ cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain region. We conclude that cholinergic neurons express CD2AP in healthy adult and aged-adult mouse brains. These data provide the first evidence of quantifiable CD2AP protein expression of cholinergic neurons specific to the diagonal band of Broca (vDB) and basal forebrain. Together with previous research from our lab, these data support a role for CD2AP in the pathogenesis of AD through orchestration of endocytosis and retrograde signaling. Ongoing studies are underway to verify these findings in a novel AD mouse model that incorporates the humanized variant of CD2AP, created by MODEL-AD, where we aim to further investigate how CD2AP variants may affect mechanistic components of Rab5 endocytosis as well as subsequent survival of cholinergic neurons in the context of known amyloid beta and Tau pathologies.

">Overlapping Cortical Substrate of Biomechanical Control and Subjective Agency</a></h4>

              
                Every movement requires the nervous system to solve a complex biomechanical control problem, but this process is mostly veiled from one's conscious awareness. Simultaneously, we also have conscious experience of controlling our movements - our sense of agency (SoA). Whether SoA corresponds to those neural representations that implement actual neuromuscular control is an open question with ethical, medical, and legal implications. If SoA is the conscious experience of control, this predicts that SoA can be decoded from the same brain structures that implement the so-called "inverse kinematic" computations for planning movement. We correlated human fMRI measurements during hand movements with the internal representations of a deep neural network (DNN) performing the same hand control task in a biomechanical simulation - revealing detailed cortical encodings of sensorimotor states, idiosyncratic to each subject. We then manipulated SoA by usurping control of participants' muscles via electrical stimulation, and found that the same voxels which were best explained by modeled inverse kinematic representations - which, strikingly, were located in canonically visual areas - also predicted SoA. Importantly, model-brain correspondences and robust SoA decoding could both be achieved within single subjects, enabling relationships between motor representations and awareness to be studied at the level of the individual.

">Different Roles of D1/D2 Medium Spiny Neurons in the Nucleus Accumbens in Pair Bond Formation of Male Mandarin Voles</a></h4>

              
                The mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system has been implicated in pair bond formation. However, involvements of DA release, real time activities, and electrophysiological activities of D1/D2 medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell in pair bonding remain unclear. This work verified that male mandarin voles after pair bonding released higher levels of DA in the NAc shell and displayed higher levels of D1 MSNs activity and lower levels of D2 MSNs activity upon sniffing their partners compared to upon sniffing an unknown female. Moreover, pair bonding induced differential alterations in both synaptic plasticity and neuronal intrinsic excitability in both D1 MSNs and D2 MSNs. In addition, chemogenetic inhibition (activation) of ventral pallidum-projecting D2 MSNs in the NAc shell enhanced (inhibited) pair bond formation, respectively. These findings suggest that different neuronal activity of NAc shell D1 MSNs / D2 MSNs regulated by increasing DA release after pair bonding may be a neurobiological mechanism underlying pair bond formation.

">Neural correlates of phonetic categorization under auditory (phoneme) and visual (grapheme) modalities</a></h4>

              
                We tested whether the neural mechanisms of phonetic categorization are specific to speech sounds or generalize to graphemes (i.e., visual letters) of the same phonetic label. Given that linguistic experience shapes categorical processing, and letter-speech sound matching plays a crucial role during early reading acquisition, we hypothesized sound phoneme and visual grapheme tokens representing the same linguistic identity might recruit common neural substrates, despite originating from different sensory modalities. Behavioral and neuroelectric brain responses (ERPs) were acquired as participants categorized stimuli from sound (phoneme) and homologous letter (grapheme) continua each spanning a /da/ - /ga/ gradient. Behaviorally, listeners were faster and showed stronger categorization of phoneme compared to graphemes. At the neural level, multidimensional scaling of the EEG revealed responses self-organized in a categorial fashion such that tokens clustered within their respective modality beginning ~150-250 ms after stimulus onset. Source-resolved ERPs further revealed modality-specific and overlapping brain regions supporting phonetic categorization. Left inferior frontal gyrus and auditory cortex showed stronger responses for sound category members compared to phonetically ambiguous tokens, whereas early visual cortices paralleled this categorical organization for graphemes. Auditory and visual categorization also recruited common visual association areas in extrastriate cortex but in opposite hemispheres (auditory = left; visual=right). Our findings reveal both auditory and visual sensory cortex supports categorical organization for phonetic labels within their respective modalities. However, a partial overlap in phoneme and grapheme processing among occipital brain areas implies the presence of an isomorphic, domain-general mapping for phonetic categories in dorsal visual system.

">Longevity or Well-being? A Dual-Dimension Structure of Neuroticism</a></h4>

              
                The development of personality traits is often viewed as evolutionarily adaptive. Current neuroticism research, however, predominantly highlights its negative health impacts, neglecting its potential evolutionary advantages. We propose that neuroticism's inter-individual variability can be structured into two distinct geometric dimensions. One, named the Emotional Reactivity-Instability/Distress Spectrum (ERIS), correlates strongly with longevity and is associated with chronic diseases and risk-averse lifestyle. This dimension is underpinned by evolutionarily conserved subcortical brain regions and genes. The other, resembling the overall neuroticism score, is primarily linked to mental and stress-related disorders, as well as life satisfaction. It involves higher-order emotional brain regions and is genetically enriched in human-accelerated regions. Collectively, these dimensions represent a dual-strategy personality framework that optimizes survival and well-being, with the former being evolutionarily conservative and the latter potentially an unique human adaptation.

">A Mathematical Sequence Representing Tonic Action Potential Spike Trains</a></h4>

              
                This is a study on the regularity of action potential spikes. Through a stochastic study, we found a series of strong correlations between the intervals of tonically firing spikes with the existence of spike frequency adaptation generated by injecting constant currents of varying intensities into layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the ferret medial prefrontal cortex. Based on this, we derived a relationship formula for the interspike intervals (ISIs). According to this formula, an ISI can be expressed as a product of the first ISI and a mathematical sequence that factorials the history of all previous ISIs. When this formula was applied to individual neurons, the sequence part exhibited minimal variation in value against the intensity of stimulation and was similar across injected current intensities, serving as a precursor to timing which is related to spike number rather than time after stimulation. In contrast, the first ISI decreased negative logarithmically with the intensity of injected current, acting as a scale factor. Finally, we successfully predicted the timing of spike occurrences based on the characteristics of this sequence formula and replicated spike train generated by strong stimulation using partial information from spike trains generated by weak stimuli.

">Neuron-specific partial reprogramming in the dentate gyrus impacts mouse behavior and ameliorates age-related decline in memory and learning.</a></h4>

              
                Age-associated neurodegenerative disorders represent significant challenges due to progressive neuronal decline and limited treatments. In aged mice, partial reprogramming, characterized by pulsed expression of reprogramming factors, has shown promise in improving function in various tissues, but its impact on the aging brain remains poorly understood. Here we investigated the impact of in vivo partial reprogramming on mature neurons in the dentate gyrus of young and aged mice. Using two different approaches: a neuron-specific transgenic reprogrammable mouse model and neuron-specific targeted lentiviral delivery of OSKM reprogramming factors, we demonstrated that in vivo partial reprogramming of mature neurons in the dentate gyrus, a neurogenic niche in the adult mouse brain, can influence animal behavior, and ameliorate age-related decline in memory and learning. These findings underscore the potential of in vivo partial reprogramming as an important therapeutic intervention to rejuvenate the neurogenic niche and ameliorate cognitive decline associated with aging or neurodegeneration.

">Effects of working memory training on cognitive flexibility, dendritic spine density and long-term potentiation in female mice</a></h4>

              
                Working memory (WM) is a cognitive function that refers to the ability of short-term storage and manipulation of information necessary for the accomplishment of a task. Two brain regions involved in WM are the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus (HPC). Several studies have suggested that training in WM (WMT) can improve performance in other cognitive tasks. However, our understanding of the neurobiological changes induced by WMT is very limited. Previous work from our lab has shown that WMT enhances synaptic and structural plasticity in the PFC and HPC in male mice. In this study, we investigate the effect of WMT on cognitive flexibility and synaptic properties in PFC and HPC in adult female mice. To this end, female adult mice were split into 3 groups: a) naive which remained in their home cage, b) non-adaptive which learned to alternate the arms in the T-maze but without any delays and c) adaptive which were trained in the delayed alternation task for 9 days. The delayed alternation task was used for WMT. In one cohort, following the delayed alternation task, all mice were tested in the attention set-shifting (AST) task in order to measure cognitive flexibility, and then, the brains were harvested for Golgi-Cox staining to study dendritic spine density. Our results showed that in female mice, there were no differences in performance in the AST among the three groups tested, however, the latency to make a choice was reduced. With regards to dendritic spine density, no significant differences were identified in PFC while increased dendritic spine density was found in the hippocampus of the adaptive group, compared to the naive group. In a second cohort, acute brain slices were prepared following the delayed alternation task to investigate the synaptic properties in the PFC and the HPC. Evoked field excitatory post-synaptic potential (fEPSP) recordings were performed in either PFC or HPC brain slices. Our results show that tetanic-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) in the PFC was not different among the three training groups. In the HPC, theta-burst induced LTP was significantly increased in the adaptive group also compared to the other two groups. These results reveal both similarities and differences of WMT on cognitive flexibility, dendritic spine density and LTP in females, compared to males.

">Differentiation of Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis from Multiple Sclerosis Using a Novel Brain Lesion Segmentation and Classification Pipeline</a></h4>

              
                Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease affecting the central nervous system, while Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is a sudden, often monophasic inflammatory condition of the brain and spinal cord. Only 17% of ADEM cases are correctly diagnosed on the first visit due to overlapping clinical and radiological presentations with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) [1]. Both ADEM and MS are demyelinating diseases, meaning they cause brain lesions by damaging the myelin sheath, leading to scar tissue that disrupts nerve signals [2]. Previous machine learning pipelines have differentiated Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) (a different demyelinating disease) from MS and ADEM from NMOSD based on MRI imagery with varying accuracies [3, 4]. Our novel Classifier for Demyelinating Disease (CDD) pipeline is the first to differentiate ADEM from MS using MRI imagery. It does this in two stages: a segmentation stage which creates segmentation masks of the lesions and a classification stage to classify them as either ADEM or MS. Additionally, we introduce a novel ADEM dataset from open-access medical case reports. The CDD pipeline achieves an accuracy of 90.0% on our validation dataset, making it a potentially viable diagnostic tool in the future. All data and code is available here. 2

">A comprehensive chemotyping and gonadal regulation of seven kisspeptinergic neuronal populations in the mouse brain</a></h4>

              
                Herein, we present a systematic analysis, using dual and multiplex RNAscope methods, of seven kisspeptinergic neuronal populations, based on their chemotyping and distribution throughout the mouse brain. The co-expression of mRNAs coding for neuropeptides, for excitatory and inhibitory transmitter biosynthetic enzymes, and for sex steroid receptors are described in four hypothalamic and three extra-hypothalamic nuclei. These include a newly characterized kisspeptin-expressing ventral premammillary nucleus cell group co-expressing vesicular glutamate transporter 2, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide and neurotensin mRNAs. Kisspeptin mRNA (Kiss1) was observed within both somatic and dendritic compartments at a single-cell level in two hypothalamic sites, a prominent and previously undescribed feature of kisspeptin neurons in these two cell groups. Patterns of altered Kiss1 expression following gonadectomy among these seven KP populations suggest that androgen receptor signaling may also play a previously unremarked role in gonadal feedback regulation of kisspeptinergic neuronal function. Data from this study provide a chemoanatomical basis for hypothesis generation regarding the functional diversity of kisspeptinergic signaling in hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic brain.

	<p>Background: Lumbar foraminal stenosis (LFS) involves the narrowing of neural foramina, leading to nerve compression, significant lower back pain and radiculopathy, particularly in the aging population. Management includes physical therapy, medications and potentially invasive surgeries such as foraminotomy. Advances in diagnostic and treatment strategies are essential due to LFS&amp;amp;rsquo;s complexity and prevalence, which underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in optimizing patient outcomes. Method: This literature review on LFS employed a systematic methodology to gather and synthesize recent scientific data. A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane Library databases using specific keywords related to LFS. The search, restricted to English language articles from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2023, focused on peer-reviewed articles, clinical trials and reviews. Due to the heterogeneity among the studies, data were qualitatively synthesized into themes related to diagnosis, treatment and pathophysiology. Results: This literature review on LFS analyzed 972 articles initially identified, from which 540 remained after removing duplicates. Following a rigorous screening process, 20 peer-reviewed articles met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. These studies primarily focused on evaluating the diagnostic accuracy, treatment efficacy and pathophysiological insights into LFS. Conclusion: The comprehensive review underscores the necessity for precise diagnostic and management strategies for LFS, highlighting the role of a multidisciplinary approach and the utility of a unified classification system in enhancing patient outcomes in the face of this condition&amp;amp;rsquo;s increasing prevalence.</p>

	<p>Studies of social cognition have shown gender differences regarding human face processing. One interesting finding is the enhanced processing of opposite-gender faces at different time stages, as revealed by event-related brain potentials. Crucially, from an evolutionary perspective, such a bias might interact with the emotional expression of the face. To investigate this, 100 participants (50 female, 50 male) completed an expression-detection task while their EEG was recorded. In three blocks, fearful, happy and neutral faces (female and male) were randomly presented, with participants instructed to respond to only one predefined target expression level in each block. Using linear mixed models, we observed both faster reaction times as well as larger P1 and late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes for women compared to men, supporting a generally greater female interest in faces. Highly interestingly, the analysis revealed an opposite-gender bias at P1 for happy target faces. This suggests that participants&amp;amp;rsquo; attentional templates may include more opposite-gender facial features when selectively attending to happy faces. While N170 was influenced by neither the face nor the participant gender, LPP was modulated by the face gender and specific combinations of the target status, face gender and expression, which is interpreted in the context of gender-emotion stereotypes. Future research should further investigate this expression and attention dependency of early opposite-gender biases.</p>

	<p>Heterogeneity has been one of the main barriers to understanding and treatment of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Previous studies have identified several subtypes of ASD through unsupervised clustering analysis. However, most of them primarily depicted the pairwise similarity between individuals through second-order relationships, relying solely on patient data for their calculation. This leads to an underestimation of the complexity inherent in inter-individual relationships and the diagnostic information provided by typical development (TD). To address this, we utilized an elastic net model to construct an individual deviation-based hypergraph (ID-Hypergraph) based on functional MRI data. We then conducted a novel community detection clustering algorithm to the ID-Hypergraph, with the aim of identifying subtypes of ASD. By applying this framework to the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange repository data (discovery: 147/125, ASD/TD; replication: 134/132, ASD/TD), we identified four reproducible ASD subtypes with roughly similar patterns of ALFF between the discovery and replication datasets. Moreover, these subtypes significantly varied in communication domains. In addition, we achieved over 80% accuracy for the classification between these subtypes. Taken together, our study demonstrated the effectiveness of identifying subtypes of ASD through the ID-hypergraph, highlighting its potential in elucidating the heterogeneity of ASD and diagnosing ASD subtypes.</p>

                <p>Psychotic symptoms and delusional beliefs have been linked to dopamine transmission in both healthy and clinical samples and are assumed to result at least in part from perceiving illusory patterns in noise. However, the existing literature on the role of dopamine in detecting patterns in noise is inconclusive. To address this issue, we assessed the effect of manipulating dopaminergic neurotransmission on illusory pattern perception in healthy individuals (<I>n </I>= 48, <I>n </I>= 19 female) in a double-blind placebo-controlled within-subjects design (see preregistration at <A HREF="https://osf.io/a4k9j/">https://osf.io/a4k9j/</A>). We predicted individuals on versus off &#x029F;-DOPA to be more likely to perceive illusory patterns, specifically objects in images containing only noise. Using a signal detection model, however, we found no credible evidence that &#x029F;-DOPA compared with placebo increased false alarm rates. Further, &#x029F;-DOPA did not reliably modulate measures of accuracy, discrimination sensitivity, and response bias. In all cases, Bayesian statistics revealed strong evidence in favor of the null hypothesis. The task design followed previous work on illusory pattern perception and comprised a limited number of items per condition. The results therefore need to be interpreted with caution, as power was limited. Future studies should address illusory pattern perception using more items and take into account potential dose-dependent effects and differential effects in healthy versus clinical samples.</p>

                <p>Typical statistical practices in the biological sciences have been increasingly called into question due to difficulties in the replication of an increasing number of studies, many of which are confounded by the relative difficulty of null significance hypothesis testing designs and interpretation of <I>p</I>-values. Bayesian inference, representing a fundamentally different approach to hypothesis testing, is receiving renewed interest as a potential alternative or complement to traditional null significance hypothesis testing due to its ease of interpretation and explicit declarations of prior assumptions. Bayesian models are more mathematically complex than equivalent frequentist approaches, which have historically limited applications to simplified analysis cases. However, the advent of probability distribution sampling tools with exponential increases in computational power now allows for quick and robust inference under any distribution of data. Here we present a practical tutorial on the use of Bayesian inference in the context of neuroscientific studies in both rat electrophysiological and computational modeling data. We first start with an intuitive discussion of Bayes' rule and inference followed by the formulation of Bayesian-based regression and ANOVA models using data from a variety of neuroscientific studies. We show how Bayesian inference leads to easily interpretable analysis of data while providing an open-source toolbox to facilitate the use of Bayesian tools.</p>

                <p>by Thomas Williams, James M. McCaw, James M. Osborne</p>

The role of direct cell–to–cell spread in viral infections—where virions spread between host and susceptible cells without needing to be secreted into the extracellular environment—has come to be understood as essential to the dynamics of medically significant viruses like hepatitis C and influenza. Recent work in both the experimental and mathematical modelling literature has attempted to quantify the prevalence of cell–to–cell infection compared to the conventional free virus route using a variety of methods and experimental data. However, estimates are subject to significant uncertainty and moreover rely on data collected by inhibiting one mode of infection by either chemical or physical factors, which may influence the other mode of infection to an extent which is difficult to quantify. In this work, we conduct a simulation–estimation study to probe the practical identifiability of the proportion of cell–to–cell infection, using two standard mathematical models and synthetic data that would likely be realistic to obtain in the laboratory. We show that this quantity cannot be estimated using non–spatial data alone, and that the collection of a data which describes the spatial structure of the infection is necessary to infer the proportion of cell–to–cell infection. Our results provide guidance for the design of relevant experiments and mathematical tools for accurately inferring the prevalence of cell–to–cell infection in <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> contexts.

Reduction of amyloid beta (Aβ) has been shown to be effective in treating Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but the underlying assumption that neurons are the main source of pathogenic Aβ is untested. Here, we challenge this prevailing belief by demonstrating that oligodendrocytes are an important source of Aβ in the human brain and play a key role in promoting abnormal neuronal hyperactivity in an AD knock-in mouse model. We show that selectively suppressing oligodendrocyte Aβ production improves AD brain pathology and restores neuronal function in the mouse model in vivo. Our findings suggest that targeting oligodendrocyte Aβ production could be a promising therapeutic strategy for treating AD.

Awards can propel academic careers. They also reflect the culture and values of the scientific community. But do awards incentivize greater transparency, inclusivity, and openness in science? Our cross-disciplinary survey of 222 awards for the “best” journal articles across all 27 SCImago subject areas revealed that journals and learned societies administering such awards generally publish little detail on their procedures and criteria. Award descriptions were brief, rarely including contact details or information on the nominations pool. Nominations of underrepresented groups were not explicitly encouraged, and concepts that align with Open Science were almost absent from the assessment criteria. At the same time, 10% of awards, especially the recently established ones, tended to use article-level impact metrics. USA-affiliated researchers dominated the winner’s pool (48%), while researchers from the Global South were uncommon (11%). Sixty-one percent of individual winners were men. Overall, Best Paper awards miss the global calls for greater transparency and equitable access to academic recognition. We provide concrete and implementable recommendations for scientific awards to improve the scientific recognition system and incentives for better scientific practice.

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>Multiple cortical motor areas are critically involved in the voluntary control of discrete movement (e.g., reaching) and gait. Here, we outline experimental findings in nonhuman primates with clinical reports and research in humans that explain characteristic movement control mechanisms in the primary, supplementary, and presupplementary motor areas, as well as in the dorsal premotor area. We then focus on single-neuron activity recorded while monkeys performed motor sequences consisting of multiple discrete movements, and we consider how area-specific control mechanisms may contribute to the performance of complex movements. Following this, we explore the motor areas in cats that we have considered as analogs of those in primates based on similarities in their cortical surface topology, anatomic connections, microstimulation effects, and activity patterns. Emphasizing that discrete movement and gait modification entail similar control mechanisms, we argue that single-neuron activity in each area of the cat during gait modification is compatible with the function ascribed to the activity in the corresponding area in primates, recorded during the performance of discrete movements. The findings that demonstrate the premotor areas’ contribution to locomotion, currently unique to the cat model, should offer highly valuable insights into the control mechanisms of locomotion in primates, including humans.

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>The vagus nerve, as an important component of the gut-brain axis, plays a crucial role in the communication between the gut and brain. It influences food intake, fat metabolism, and emotion by regulating the gut-brain axis, which is closely associated with the development of gastrointestinal, psychiatric, and metabolism-related disorders. In recent years, significant progress has been made in understanding the vagus-mediated regulatory pathway, highlighting its profound implications in the development of many diseases. Here, we summarize the latest advancements in vagus-mediated gut-brain pathways and the novel interventions targeting the vagus nerve. This will provide valuable insights for future research on treatment of obesity and gastrointestinal and depressive disorders based on vagus nerve stimulation.

<p>One-year-old mice with deletions of <i>malin</i> display robust Lafora body accumulation, astrogliosis, microgliosis, and evidence of cortical circuit dysfunction. Despite these pathologies, malin KO mice exhibited no abnormalities in a wide range of home-cage neurobehavioral endpoints, pointing to a broad window for intervention in this otherwise fatal form of epilepsy.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Lafora disease (LD) is a syndrome of progressive myoclonic epilepsy and cumulative neurocognitive deterioration caused by recessively inherited genetic lesions of EPM2A (laforin) or NHLRC1 (malin). Neuropsychiatric symptomatology in LD is thought to be directly downstream of neuronal and astrocytic polyglucosan aggregates, termed Lafora bodies (LBs), which faithfully accumulate in an age-dependent manner in all mouse models of LD. In this study, we applied home-cage monitoring to examine the extent of neurobehavioral deterioration in a model of malin-deficient LD as a means to identify robust preclinical endpoints that may guide the selection of novel genetic treatments. At 6 weeks, ∼6–7 months, and ∼12 months of age, malin-deficient mice (“KO”) and wild-type (WT) littermates underwent a standardized home-cage behavioral assessment designed to non-obtrusively appraise features of rest/arousal, consumptive behaviors, risk aversion, and voluntary wheel-running. At all timepoints, and over a range of metrics that we report transparently, WT and KO mice were essentially indistinguishable. In contrast, within WT mice compared across the same timepoints, we identified age-related nocturnal hypoactivity, diminished sucrose preference, and reduced wheel-running. Neuropathological examinations in subsets of the same mice revealed expected age-dependent LB accumulation, gliosis, and microglial activation in cortical and subcortical brain regions. At 12 months of age, despite the burden of neocortical LBs, we did not identify spontaneous seizures during an electroencephalographic (EEG) survey, and KO and WT mice exhibited similar spectral EEG features. However, in an in vitro assay of neocortical function, paroxysmal bursts of network activity (UP states) in KO slices were more prolonged at 3 and 6 months of age, but similar to WT at 12 months. KO mice displayed a distinct response to pentylenetetrazole, with a greater incidence of clonic seizures and a more pronounced postictal suppression of movement, feeding, and drinking behavior. Together, these results highlight the clinicopathologic dissociation in a mouse model of LD, where the accrual of LBs may latently modify cortical circuit function and seizure threshold without clinically meaningful changes in home-cage behavior. Our findings allude to a delay between LB accumulation and neurobehavioral decline in LD: one that may provide a window for treatment, and whose precise duration may be difficult to ascertain within the typical lifespan of a laboratory mouse.</p>

                <p>Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) safety and efficacy in patients with large core infarcts receiving oral anticoagulants (OAC) are unknown. In the SELECT2 trial (NCT03876457), 29 of 180 (16%; vitamin K antagonists 15, direct OACs 14) EVT, and 18 of 172 (10%; vitamin K antagonists 3, direct OACs 15) medical management (MM) patients reported OAC use at baseline. EVT was not associated with better clinical outcomes in the OAC group (EVT 6 [4–6] vs MM 5 [4–6], adjusted generalized odds ratio 0.89 [0.53–1.50]), but demonstrated significantly better outcomes in patients without OAC (EVT 4 [3–6] vs MM 5 [4–6], adjusted generalized odds ratio 1.87 [1.45–2.40], <i>p</i> = 0.02). The OAC group had higher comorbidities, including atrial fibrillation (70% vs 17%), congestive heart failure (28% vs 10%), and hypertension (87% vs 72%), suggesting increased frailty. However, the results were consistent after adjustment for these comorbidities, and was similar regardless of the type of OACs used. Whereas any hemorrhage rates were higher in the OAC group receiving EVT (86% in OAC vs 70% in no OAC), no parenchymal hemorrhage or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage were observed with OAC use in both the EVT and MM arms. Although we did not find evidence that the effect was due to excess hemorrhage or confounded by underlying cardiac disease or older age, OAC use alone should not exclude patients from receiving EVT. Baseline comorbidities and ischemic injury extent should be considered while making individualized treatment decisions. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96507">The mechanism of mammalian proton-coupled peptide transporters</a></h4>

              
                Proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters (POTs) are of great pharmaceutical interest owing to their promiscuous substrate binding site that has been linked to improved oral bioavailability of several classes of drugs. Members of the POT family are conserved across all phylogenetic kingdoms and function by coupling peptide uptake to the proton electrochemical gradient. Cryo-EM structures and alphafold models have recently provided new insights into different conformational states of two mammalian POTs, SLC15A1, and SLC15A2. Nevertheless, these studies leave open important questions regarding the mechanism of proton and substrate coupling, while simultaneously providing a unique opportunity to investigate these processes using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Here, we employ extensive unbiased and enhanced-sampling MD to map out the full SLC15A2 conformational cycle and its thermodynamic driving forces. By computing conformational free energy landscapes in different protonation states and in the absence or presence of peptide substrate, we identify a likely sequence of intermediate protonation steps that drive inward-directed alternating access. These simulations identify key differences in the extracellular gate between mammalian and bacterial POTs, which we validate experimentally in cell-based transport assays. Our results from constant-PH MD and absolute binding free energy (ABFE) calculations also establish a mechanistic link between proton binding and peptide recognition, revealing key details underpining secondary active transport in POTs. This study provides a vital step forward in understanding proton-coupled peptide and drug transport in mammals and pave the way to integrate knowledge of solute carrier structural biology with enhanced drug design to target tissue and organ bioavailability.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93804">Aberrant hippocampal Ca2+ microwaves following synapsin-dependent adeno-associated viral expression of Ca2+ indicators</a></h4>

              
                Genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) such as GCaMP are invaluable tools in neuroscience to monitor neuronal activity using optical imaging. The viral transduction of GECIs is commonly used to target expression to specific brain regions, can be conveniently used with any mouse strain of interest without the need for prior crossing with a GECI mouse line, and avoids potential hazards due to the chronic expression of GECIs during development. A key requirement for monitoring neuronal activity with an indicator is that the indicator itself minimally affects activity. Here, using common adeno-associated viral (AAV) transduction procedures, we describe spatially confined aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> microwaves slowly travelling through the hippocampus following expression of GCaMP6, GCaMP7, or R-CaMP1.07 driven by the synapsin promoter with AAV-dependent gene transfer in a titre-dependent fashion. Ca<sup>2+</sup> microwaves developed in hippocampal CA1 and CA3, but not dentate gyrus nor neocortex, were typically first observed at 4 wk after viral transduction, and persisted up to at least 8 wk. The phenomenon was robust and observed across laboratories with various experimenters and setups. Our results indicate that aberrant hippocampal Ca<sup>2+</sup> microwaves depend on the promoter and viral titre of the GECI, density of expression, as well as the targeted brain region. We used an alternative viral transduction method of GCaMP which avoids this artefact. The results show that commonly used Ca<sup>2+</sup>-indicator AAV transduction procedures can produce artefactual Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses. Our aim is to raise awareness in the field of these artefactual transduction-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> microwaves, and we provide a potential solution.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91783">circHIPK3 nucleates IGF2BP2 and functions as a competing endogenous RNA</a></h4>

              
                Circular RNAs represent a class of endogenous RNAs that regulate gene expression and influence cell biological decisions with implications for the pathogenesis of several diseases. Here, we disclose a novel gene-regulatory role of circHIPK3 by combining analyses of large genomics datasets and mechanistic cell biological follow-up experiments. Using time-course depletion of circHIPK3 and specific candidate RNA-binding proteins, we identify several perturbed genes by RNA sequencing analyses. Expression-coupled motif analyses identify an 11-mer motif within circHIPK3, which also becomes enriched in genes that are downregulated upon circHIPK3 depletion. By mining eCLIP datasets and combined with RNA immunoprecipitation assays, we demonstrate that the 11-mer motif constitutes a strong binding site for IGF2BP2 in bladder cancer cell lines. Our results suggest that circHIPK3 can sequester IGF2BP2 as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA), leading to target mRNA stabilization. As an example of a circHIPK3-regulated gene, we focus on the <i>STAT3</i> mRNA as a specific substrate of IGF2BP2 and validate that manipulation of circHIPK3 regulates IGF2BP2-<i>STAT3</i> mRNA binding and, thereby, <i>STAT3</i> mRNA levels. Surprisingly, absolute copy number quantifications demonstrate that IGF2BP2 outnumbers circHIPK3 by orders of magnitude, which is inconsistent with a simple 1:1 ceRNA hypothesis. Instead, we show that circHIPK3 can nucleate multiple copies of IGF2BP2, potentially via phase separation, to produce IGF2BP2 condensates. Our results support a model where a few cellular circHIPK3 molecules can induce IGF2BP2 condensation, thereby regulating key factors for cell proliferation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87746">Optical mapping of ground reaction force dynamics in freely behaving Drosophila melanogaster larvae</a></h4>

              
                During locomotion, soft-bodied terrestrial animals solve complex control problems at substrate interfaces, but our understanding of how they achieve this without rigid components remains incomplete. Here, we develop new all-optical methods based on optical interference in a deformable substrate to measure ground reaction forces (GRFs) with micrometre and nanonewton precision in behaving <i>Drosophila</i> larvae. Combining this with a kinematic analysis of substrate-interfacing features, we shed new light onto the biomechanical control of larval locomotion. Crawling in larvae measuring ~1 mm in length involves an intricate pattern of cuticle sequestration and planting, producing GRFs of 1–7 µN. We show that larvae insert and expand denticulated, feet-like structures into substrates as they move, a process not previously observed in soft-bodied animals. These ‘protopodia’ form dynamic anchors to compensate counteracting forces. Our work provides a framework for future biomechanics research in soft-bodied animals and promises to inspire improved soft-robot design.

	<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disabilities with persistent impairments in cognition, communication, and social behavior. Although environmental factors play a role in ASD etiopathogenesis, a growing body of evidence indicates that ASD is highly inherited. In the last two decades, the dramatic rise in the prevalence of ASD has interested researchers to explore the etiologic role of epigenetic marking and incredibly abnormal DNA methylation. This review aimed to explain the current understanding of the association between changes in DNA methylation signatures and ASD in patients or animal models. We reviewed studies reporting alterations in DNA methylation at specific genes as well as epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs). Finally, we hypothesized that specific changes in DNA methylation patterns could be considered a potential biomarker for ASD diagnosis and prognosis and even a target for pharmacological intervention.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/7/ENEURO.0038-24.2024?rss=1">Electrophysiological Activity of Multifunctional and Behaviorally Specialized Spinal Neurons Involved in Swimming, Scratching, and Flexion Reflex in Turtles</a></h4>

              
                <p>The adult turtle spinal cord can generate multiple kinds of limb movements, including swimming, three forms of scratching, and limb withdrawal (flexion reflex), even without brain input and sensory feedback. There are many multifunctional spinal neurons, activated during multiple motor patterns, and some behaviorally specialized neurons, activated during only one. How do multifunctional and behaviorally specialized neurons each contribute to motor output? We analyzed in vivo intracellular recordings of multifunctional and specialized neurons. Neurons tended to spike in the same phase of the hip-flexor (HF) activity cycle during swimming and scratching, though one preferred opposite phases. During both swimming and scratching, a larger fraction of multifunctional neurons than specialized neurons were highly rhythmic. One group of multifunctional neurons was active during the HF-on phase and another during the HF-off phase. Thus, HF&ndash;extensor alternation may be generated by a subset of multifunctional spinal neurons during both swimming and scratching. Scratch-specialized neurons and flexion reflex-selective neurons may instead trigger their respective motor patterns, by biasing activity of multifunctional neurons. In phase-averaged membrane potentials of multifunctional neurons, trough phases were more highly correlated between swimming and scratching than peak phases, suggesting that rhythmic inhibition plays a greater role than rhythmic excitation. We also provide the first intracellular recording of a turtle swim-specialized neuron: tonically excited during swimming but inactive during scratching and flexion reflex. It displayed an excitatory postsynaptic potential following each swim-evoking electrical stimulus and thus may be an intermediary between reticulospinal axons and the swimming CPG they activate.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/7/ENEURO.0065-24.2024?rss=1">Gaze and Arrows: Does the Gaze-Following Patch in the Posterior Temporal Cortex Differentiate Social and Symbolic Spatial Cues?</a></h4>

              
                <p>The gaze-following patch (GFP) is located in the posterior temporal cortex and has been described as a cortical module dedicated to processing other people's gaze-direction in a domain-specific manner. Thus, it appears to be the neural correlate of Baron-Cohen's eye direction detector (EDD) which is one of the core modules in his mindreading system&mdash;a neurocognitive model for the theory of mind concept. Inspired by Jerry Fodor's ideas on the modularity of the mind, Baron-Cohen proposed that, among other things, the individual modules are domain specific. In the case of the EDD, this means that it exclusively processes eye-like stimuli to extract gaze-direction and that other stimuli, which may carry directional information as well, are processed elsewhere. If the GFP is indeed EDD's neural correlate, it must meet this expectation. To test this, we compared the GFP's BOLD activity during gaze-direction following with the activity during arrow-direction following in the present human fMRI study. Contrary to the expectation based on the assumption of domain specificity, we did not find a differentiation between gaze- and arrow-direction following. In fact, we were not able to reproduce the GFP as presented in the previous studies. A possible explanation is that in the present study&mdash;unlike the previous work&mdash;the gaze stimuli did not contain an obvious change of direction that represented a visual motion. Hence, the critical stimulus component responsible for the identification of the GFP in the previous experiments might have been visual motion.</p>

                <p>by Hsun Chiang, Chih-Ang Chung</p>

Capillary plexus cultivation is crucial in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Theoretical simulations have been conducted to supplement the expensive experimental works. However, the mechanisms connecting mechanical and chemical stimuli remained undefined, and the functions of the different VEGF forms in the culture environment were still unclear. In this paper, we developed a hybrid model for simulating short-term <i>in vitro</i> capillary incubations. We used the Cellular Potts model to predict individual cell migration, morphology change, and continuum mechanics to quantify biogel deformation and VEGF transport dynamics. By bridging the mechanical regulation and chemical stimulation in the model, the results showed good agreement between the predicted network topology and experiments, in which elongated cells connected, forming the network cords and round cells gathered, creating cobblestone-like aggregates. The results revealed that the capillary-like networks could develop in high integrity only when the mechanical and chemical couplings worked adequately, with the cell morphology and haptotaxis driven by the soluble and bound forms of VEGF, respectively, functioning simultaneously.
