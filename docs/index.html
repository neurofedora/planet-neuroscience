	<p>Recent neuroimaging research has suggested that interpreters and non-interpreters elicit different brain activation patterns during simultaneous language translation. However, whether these two groups have different functional connectivity during such a task, and how the neural coupling is among brain subregions, are still not well understood. In this study, we recruited Mandarin (L1)/English (L2) interpreters and non-interpreter bilinguals, whom we asked to perform simultaneous language translation and reading tasks. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to collect cortical brain data for participants during each task, using 68 channels that covered the prefrontal cortex and the bilateral perisylvian regions. Our findings revealed both interpreter and non-interpreter groups recruited the right dorsolateral prefrontal hub when completing the simultaneous language translation tasks. We also found different functional connectivity between the groups. The interpreter group was characterized by information exchange between the frontal cortex and Wernicke&amp;amp;rsquo;s area. In comparison, the non-interpreter group revealed neural coupling between the frontal cortex and Broca&amp;amp;rsquo;s area. These findings indicate expertise modulates functional connectivity, possibly because of more developed cognitive skills associated with executive functions in interpreters.</p>

	<p>Physiological studies have shown that self-body images receive unique recognition processing in a wide range of brain areas, from the frontal lobe to the parietal-occipital cortex. Event-related potential (ERP) studies have shown that the self-referential effect on the image of a hand increases P300 components, but such studies do not evaluate brain oscillatory activity. In this study, we aimed to discover the self-specific brain electrophysiological activity in relation to hand images. ERPs on the fronto-parietal midline were elicited by a three-stimulus visual oddball task using hand images: the self-hand, another hand (most similar to the self-hand), and another hand (similar to the self-hand). We analyzed ERP waveform and brain oscillatory activity by simple averaging and time-frequency analysis. The simple averaging analysis found no significant differences between the responses for the three stimulus tasks in all time windows. However, time-frequency analysis showed that self-hand stimuli elicited high gamma ERS in 650&amp;amp;ndash;900 ms at the Cz electrode compared to other hand stimuli. Our results show that brain activity specific to the self-referential process to the self-hand image was reflected in the long latency gamma band activity in the mid-central region. This high gamma-band activity at the Cz electrode may be similar to the activity of the mirror neuron system, which is involved in hand motion.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Volume and Connectivity Differences in Brain Networks Associated with Cognitive Constructs of Binge Eating</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorder (BED) are characterized by episodes of eating large amounts of food while experiencing a loss of control. Recent studies suggest that the underlying causes of BN/BED consist of a complex system of environmental cues, atypical processing of food stimuli, altered behavioral responding, and structural/functional brain differences compared with healthy controls (HC). In this narrative review, we provide an integrative account of the brain networks associated with the three cognitive constructs most integral to BN and BED, namely increased reward sensitivity, decreased cognitive control, and altered negative affect and stress responding. We show altered activity in BED/BN within several brain networks, specifically in the striatum, insula, prefrontal cortex (PFC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and cingulate gyrus. Numerous key nodes in these networks also differ in volume and connectivity compared with HC. We provide suggestions for how this integration may guide future research into these brain networks and cognitive constructs.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) coupled to G<SUB>i</SUB> signaling, in particular downstream of monoaminergic neurotransmission, are posited to play a key role during developmental epochs (postnatal and juvenile) in shaping the emergence of adult anxiodepressive behaviors and sensorimotor gating. To address the role of G<SUB>i</SUB> signaling in these developmental windows, we used a CaMKII&alpha;-tTA::TRE hM4Di bigenic mouse line to express the hM4Di-DREADD (designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs) in forebrain excitatory neurons and enhanced G<SUB>i</SUB> signaling via chronic administration of the DREADD agonist, clozapine-<I>N</I>-oxide (CNO) in the postnatal window (postnatal days 2&ndash;14) or the juvenile window (postnatal days 28&ndash;40). We confirmed that the expression of the HA-tagged hM4Di-DREADD was restricted to CaMKII&alpha;-positive neurons in the forebrain, and that the administration of CNO in postnatal or juvenile windows evoked inhibition in forebrain circuits of the hippocampus and cortex, as indicated by a decline in expression of the neuronal activity marker c-Fos. hM4Di-DREADD-mediated inhibition of CaMKII&alpha;-positive forebrain excitatory neurons in postnatal or juvenile life did not impact the weight profile of mouse pups, and also did not influence the normal ontogeny of sensory reflexes. Further, postnatal or juvenile hM4Di-DREADD-mediated inhibition of CaMKII&alpha;-positive forebrain excitatory neurons did not alter anxiety- or despair-like behaviors in adulthood and did not impact sensorimotor gating. Collectively, these results indicate that chemogenetic induction of G<SUB>i</SUB> signaling in CaMKII&alpha;-positive forebrain excitatory neurons in postnatal and juvenile temporal windows does not appear to impinge on the programming of anxiodepressive behaviors in adulthood.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">MRI Stereoscope: A Miniature Stereoscope for Human Neuroimaging</a></h4>

              
                <p>Stereoscopic vision enables the perception of depth. To study the brain mechanisms behind stereoscopic vision using noninvasive brain imaging (magnetic resonance brain imaging; MRI), scientists need to reproduce the independent views of the left and right eyes in the brain scanner using "dichoptic" displays. However, high-quality dichoptic displays are technically challenging and costly to implement in the MRI scanner. The novel miniature stereoscope system ("MRI stereoscope") is an affordable and open-source tool that displays high-quality dichoptic images inside the MRI scanner. The MRI stereoscope takes advantage of commonly used display equipment, the MRI head coil, and a display screen. To validate the MRI stereoscope, binocular disparity stimuli were presented in a 3T MRI scanner while neural activation was recorded using functional MRI in six human participants. The comparison of large binocular disparities compared with disparities close to zero evoked strong responses across dorsal and ventral extra-striate visual cortex. In contrast, binocularly anti-correlated stimuli, which are not perceived in depth, did not evoke comparable activation. These results are the proof-of-concept that the MRI stereoscope can deliver dichoptic images that produce the perception of stereoscopic depth during acquisition of MR responses. Application of the MRI stereoscope to neuroscience can help to address important questions in perception and consciousness.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Targeting Neurons with Functional Oxytocin Receptors: A Novel Set of Simple Knock-In Mouse Lines for Oxytocin Receptor Visualization and Manipulation</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The neuropeptide oxytocin (Oxt) plays important roles in modulating social behaviors. Oxt receptor (Oxtr) is abundantly expressed in the brain and its relationship to socio-behavioral controls has been extensively studied using mouse brains. Several genetic tools to visualize and/or manipulate Oxtr-expressing cells, such as fluorescent reporters and Cre recombinase drivers, have been generated by ES-cell based gene targeting or bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenesis. However, these mouse lines displayed some differences in their Oxtr expression profiles probably because of the complex context and integrity of their genomic configurations in each line. Here, we apply our sophisticated genome-editing techniques to the <I>Oxtr</I> locus, systematically generating a series of knock-in mouse lines, in which its endogenous transcriptional regulations are intactly preserved and evaluate their expression profiles to ensure the reliability of our new tools. We employ the epitope tagging strategy, with which C-terminally fused tags can be detected by highly specific antibodies, to successfully visualize the Oxtr protein distribution on the neural membrane with super-resolution imaging for the first time. By using T2A self-cleaving peptide sequences, we also induce proper expressions of tdTomato reporter, codon-improved Cre recombinase (iCre), and spatiotemporally inducible Cre-ERT2 in Oxtr-expressing neurons. Electrophysiological recordings from tdTomato-positive cells in the reporter mice support the validity of our tool design. Retro-orbital injections of AAV-PHP.eB vector into the Cre line further enabled visualization of recombinase activities in the appropriate brain regions. Moreover, the first-time Cre-ERT2 line drives Cre-mediated recombination in a spatiotemporally controlled manner on tamoxifen (TMX) administration. These tools thus provide an excellent resource for future functional studies in Oxt-responsive neurons and should prove of broad interest in the field.</p>

                Background: Phytomedicines are gaining a spotlight in wound management, where much research has suggested the wound healing potential of Barringtonia racemosa. The objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of B. racemosa kernel extract in accelerating wound healing process in animal models. Methods: B. racemosa kernel was extracted using ethanol:water (7:3) solvent and was then used as a bioactive ingredient in a Carbopol 940-based gel formulation in four different concentrations (1, 3, 5 and 7 ppm). A 3 cm diameter wound was made in the dorsal area of Rattus norvegicus rat and wound healing process was assessed up to 12 days using DESIGN (Depth, Exudate, Size of Inflammation/Infection, Granulation tissue, and Necrotic tissue) scoring system. Results: Our data suggested that the DESIGN scores were significantly different among concentration groups after the 3rd day onward suggesting B. racemosa extract accelerated the wound healing process. Rats treated with gel formulation containing 7 ppm of B. racemosa kernel extract had faster wound healing than that treated with topical Metcovazin. Conclusion: B. racemosa kernel extract was effective in accelerating wound healing on rats. Further study is warranted to purify the bioactive component and the action mechanism in wound healing process.

                In order to reduce the impact of technical variation inherent in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies on biological interpretation of experiments, rigorous preprocessing and quality control is required to transform raw sequencing reads into high-quality, gene and transcript counts. While hundreds of tools have been developed for this purpose, the vast majority of the most widely used tools are built for the R software environment. With an increasing number of new tools now being developed using Python, it is necessary to develop integrative workflows that leverage tools from both platforms. We have therefore developed, SASCRiP (Sequencing Analysis of Single-Cell RNA in Python), a modular single-cell preprocessing workflow that integrates functionality from existing, widely used R and Python packages, and additional custom features and visualizations, to enable preprocessing of scRNA-seq data derived from technologies that use unique molecular identifier (UMI) sequences in a single Python analysis workflow. We describe the utility of SASCRiP using datasets derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells sequenced using droplet-based, 3′-end sequencing technology. We highlight SASCRiP’s diagnostic visualizations and fully customizable functions, and demonstrate how SASCRiP provides a highly flexible, integrative Python workflow for preparing unprocessed UMI count-based scRNA-seq data for subsequent downstream analyses. SASCRiP is freely available through PyPi or from the GitHub page.

                Background – Peer review or evaluation has been seen as a promising approach in helping students to learn from one another instead of relying solely on their overwhelmed teachers for feedback on their written work. However, there have been mixed reviews on the effectiveness of this method. This study aims to examine the effects of peer review on blogging buddies’ writing performance as well as to suggest the groundwork needed for an effective way to pair the blogging buddies to ensure that the peers can bilaterally benefit each other.     Methods – A qualitative case study was conducted on eight students from a private university in Malaysia. The writing scores for three different essays (pre and post peer review) were tracked to observe its effects on the respective blogging buddies’ writing performance.      Results – The findings have shown that the students’ proficiency levels played an important part in pairing the students as it impacted their writing performance and the effectiveness of the peer review activity. Poor proficiency students who were paired with average proficiency students seemed to make the greatest progress and were the most prominent beneficiaries. Even though these average students benefited from being a reviewer; this pairing was a disadvantage when they reposted their essays after peer review. For high proficiency students who were paired together, they recorded either an increased score or a same score in their post-peer writing.     Conclusions – This study has shown that for peer review via weblogs to be effectively implemented in writing classes, proper groundwork needs to be laid for instructors to ensure that adequate training is provided, the peers are properly paired, and sufficient support is provided to these blogging buddies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Cortical signatures of auditory object binding in children with autism spectrum disorder are anomalous in concordance with behavior and diagnosis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hari Bharadwaj, Fahimeh Mamashli, Sheraz Khan, Ravinderjit Singh, Robert M. Joseph, Ainsley Losh, Stephanie Pawlyszyn, Nicole M. McGuiggan, Steven Graham, Matti S. Hämäläinen, Tal Kenet</p>

Organizing sensory information into coherent perceptual objects is fundamental to everyday perception and communication. In the visual domain, indirect evidence from cortical responses suggests that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have anomalous figure–ground segregation. While auditory processing abnormalities are common in ASD, especially in environments with multiple sound sources, to date, the question of scene segregation in ASD has not been directly investigated in audition. Using magnetoencephalography, we measured cortical responses to unattended (passively experienced) auditory stimuli while parametrically manipulating the degree of temporal coherence that facilitates auditory figure–ground segregation. Results from 21 children with ASD (aged 7–17 years) and 26 age- and IQ-matched typically developing children provide evidence that children with ASD show anomalous growth of cortical neural responses with increasing temporal coherence of the auditory figure. The documented neurophysiological abnormalities did not depend on age, and were reflected both in the response evoked by changes in temporal coherence of the auditory scene and in the associated induced gamma rhythms. Furthermore, the individual neural measures were predictive of diagnosis (83% accuracy) and also correlated with behavioral measures of ASD severity and auditory processing abnormalities. These findings offer new insight into the neural mechanisms underlying auditory perceptual deficits and sensory overload in ASD, and suggest that temporal-coherence-based auditory scene analysis and suprathreshold processing of coherent auditory objects may be atypical in ASD.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Public human microbiome data are dominated by highly developed countries</a></h4>

The importance of sampling from globally representative populations has been well established in human genomics. In human microbiome research, however, we lack a full understanding of the global distribution of sampling in research studies. This information is crucial to better understand global patterns of microbiome-associated diseases and to extend the health benefits of this research to all populations. Here, we analyze the country of origin of all 444,829 human microbiome samples that are available from the world’s 3 largest genomic data repositories, including the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). The samples are from 2,592 studies of 19 body sites, including 220,017 samples of the gut microbiome. We show that more than 71% of samples with a known origin come from Europe, the United States, and Canada, including 46.8% from the US alone, despite the country representing only 4.3% of the global population. We also find that central and southern Asia is the most underrepresented region: Countries such as India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh account for more than a quarter of the world population but make up only 1.8% of human microbiome samples. These results demonstrate a critical need to ensure more global representation of participants in microbiome studies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">In silico screening of chloroquine analogues for compounds with more affinity for the Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine transporter as potential antimalarial drugs [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Malaria is an acute febrile illness affecting over 229 million people worldwide. Children aged five years and below are affected the most, with the highest prevalence in Sub-Saharan Africa. Chloroquine was previously used as the first-line treatment for malaria due to its affordability and high efficacy, but resistance has developed. Resistance to chloroquine is due to a mutation in the protein Plasmodium falciparum Chloroquine Transporter (pfCRT) which effluxes the drug from the parasitic digestive vacuole, decreasing the drug concentration. Resistance has however been shown to be reversible by compounds that can bind to the protein. Methods: In silico screening for chloroquine analogues was done using SwissSimilarity, SWISSADME, SwissTargetPrediction, Pubchem sketcher, Chimera and Avogadro tools to predict pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic profiles of the selected analogues. Results: About 20 compounds with a similarity index of > 95% were obtained from the ZINC database. In total, 12 of the 20 compounds showed a higher binding affinity to the mutant pfCRT protein. Overall, four of the 12 had a binding affinity less than -8.0 compared to -7.0 for chloroquine. Compound ZINC01596768 had the greatest binding strength at -8.3. The other analogues were ZINC38050614, ZINC38050617, and ZINC38050615 with binding interaction strengths of -8.0, -8.2 and -8.2 respectively. Pharmacokinetic profile prediction showed all 12 compounds inhibited the enzymes CYP1A2 and CYP2D6, followed the Lipinski rules, had a high GI absorption, were permeant to the blood brain barrier, had no alerts on the PAINS criteria and had violated the rule of XLOGP3 > 3.5 in lead likeness. Compounds ZINC38050614, ZINC38050617, and ZINC38050615 were predicted to be substrates of P-glycoprotein. The synthetic accessibility score for the twelve compounds were below 3.07. Conclusions: Results demonstrated that the compounds ZINC01596768, ZINC38050614, ZINC38050617, and ZINC38050615 were potential candidates that could be tested and developed as co-formulations of chloroquine.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Rice husk and melaleuca biochar additions reduce soil CH4 and N2O emissions and increase soil physicochemical properties [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Biochar is a promising material in mitigating greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions from paddy fields due to its remarkable structural properties. Rice husk biochar (RhB) and melaleuca biochar (MB) are amendment materials that could be used to potentially reduce emissions in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD). However, their effects on CH4 and N2O emissions and soil under local water management and conventional rice cultivation have not been thoroughly investigated. Methods: We conducted a field experiment using biochar additions to the topsoil layer (0-20 cm). Five treatments comprising 0 t ha-1 (CT0); 5 t ha-1 (RhB5) and 10 t ha-1 (RhB10), and 5 t ha-1 (MB5) and 10 t ha-1 (MB10) were designed plot-by-plot (20 m2) in triplicates. Results: The results showed that biochar application from 5 to 10 t ha-1 significantly decreased cumulative CH4 (24.2-28.0%, RhB; 22.0-14.1%, MB) and N2O (25.6-41.0%, RhB; 38.4–56.4%, MB) fluxes without a reduction in grain yield. Increasing the biochar application rate further did not decrease significantly total CH4 and N2O fluxes but was seen to significantly reduce the global warming potential (GWP) and yield-scale GWP in the RhB treatments. Biochar application improved soil Eh but had no effects on soil pH. Whereas CH4 flux correlated negatively with soil Eh (P < 0.001; r2 = 0.552, RhB; P < 0.001; r2 = 0.502, MB). Ameliorating soil aeration and functions by adding RhB and MB resulted in improving soil physicochemical properties, especially significant SOM and AN boosting, which indicate better soil health, structure, and fertility. Conclusions: Biochar supplementation significantly reduced CH4 and N2O fluxes and improved soil mineralization and physicochemical properties toward beneficial for rice plants. The results suggest that the optimal combination of biochar-application rates and effective water-irrigation techniques for soil types in the MD should be further studied in future works.

                <img src="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c65a665d-9e16-4c35-a107-f77c742a5627/cne25304-gra-0001-m.png"
     alt="Cross-hierarchical plasticity of corticofugal projections to dLGN after neonatal monocular enucleation"/>
<p>In this study, the effect of monocular enucleation (MoE) in the development of the first-order visual thalamic nucleus, dLGN, was examined. We reported by microarray analysis a transcriptionally immature dLGN after early MoE. Additionally, focusing on layer 5 axonal projections, we demonstrated by viral tracing that layer 5 fibers in the enucleated dLGN originate from the primary visual cortex and not from the primary somatosensory cortex. Finally, we showed that layer 5 axons reorganize while innervating the enucleated dLGN and form aberrant synapses that persist until adulthood, indicating the presence of a permanent cross-hierarchical cortico-thalamic plasticity.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Perception is the result of interactions between the sensory periphery, thalamus, and cerebral cortex. Inputs from the retina project to the first-order dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), which projects to the primary visual cortex (V1). In return, the cortex innervates the thalamus. While layer 6 projections innervate all thalamic nuclei, cortical layer 5 neurons selectively project to the higher order lateral posterior nucleus (LP) and not to dLGN. It has been demonstrated that a subpopulation of layer 5 (Rbp4-Cre+) projections rewires to dLGN after monocular or binocular enucleation in young postnatal mice. However, the exact cortical regional origin of these projections was not fully determined, and it remained unclear whether these changes persisted into adulthood. In this study, we report gene expression changes observed in the dLGN after monocular enucleation at birth using microarray, qPCR at P6, and in situ hybridization at P8. We report that genes that are normally enriched in dLGN, but not LP during development are preferentially downregulated in dLGN following monocular enucleation. Comparisons with developmental gene expression patters in dLGN suggest more immature and delayed gene expression in enucleated dLGN. Combined tracing and immuno-histochemical analysis revealed that the induced layer 5 fibers that innervate enucleated dLGN originate from putative primary visual cortex and they retain increased VGluT1+ synapse formation into adulthood. Our results indicate a new form of plasticity when layer 5 driver input takes over the innervation of an originally first-order thalamic nucleus after early sensory deficit.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Correlation between serum methotrexate-polyglutamate 3 (MTX-PG3) level and disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis patients: A prospective cohort study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the most common autoimmune diseases, characterized by systemic inflammation, joint destruction and disability. Methotrexate (MTX) is used as the primary treatment for RA patients. However, the response to MTX therapy is highly varied and difficult to predict. This study sought to determine the role of MTX by measuring the MTX polyglutamate 3 (MTX-PG3) levels and the disease activity score 28 based on C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) of RA patients. Method: A prospective cohort study was conducted at the Rheumatology Polyclinic of Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital. Thirty-four patients with RA were included and followed up to 12 weeks. The RA patients were treated with MTX 10 mg per week and an increased dose of 5 mg per week every month. DAS28-CRP and MTX-PG3 level were assessed at week 8 and 12. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the correlation between MTX-PG3 and DAS28-CRP. Result: A total of 34 RA patients were followed and the MTX was well tolerated in which no increase of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were observed. The mean scores of DAS28-CRP decreased following the MTX-treatment: 3.93, 3.22 and 2.82 at week 0, 8 and 12, respectively. In contrast, the median concentration of MTX-PG3 increased from week 8 to week 12 followed by increasing the dose of MTX. Our analysis suggested there was a moderate positive correlation between MTX-PG3 levels and DAS28-CRP score at week 8 and week 12 post-MTX treatment. Conclusion: The level of MTX-PG3 is correlated with DAS28-CRP score suggesting that MTX-PG3 could be used as an indicator to assess the disease activity in RA patients. Nevertheless, a prospective study with a higher number of patients is needed to confirm this finding.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Personalizing deep brain stimulation using advanced imaging sequences</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>With a growing appreciation for interindividual anatomical variability and patient-specific brain connectivity, advanced imaging sequences offer the opportunity to directly visualize anatomical targets for deep brain stimulation (DBS). The lack of quantitative evidence demonstrating their clinical utility, however, has hindered their broad implementation in clinical practice.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using fast gray matter acquisition T1 inversion recovery (FGATIR) sequences, the present study identified a thalamic hypointensity that holds promise as a visual marker in DBS.</p>
<p>To validate the clinical utility of the identified hypointensity we retrospectively analyzed 65 patients (26 female, mean age: 69.1 ± 12.7 years) who underwent DBS in the treatment of essential tremor. We characterized its neuroanatomical substrates and evaluated the hypointensity's ability to predict clinical outcome using stimulation volume modeling and voxel-wise mapping. Finally, we determined whether the hypointensity marker could predict symptom improvement on a patient-specific level.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Anatomical characterization suggested that the identified hypointensity constituted the terminal part of the dentato-rubro-thalamic tract. Overlap between DBS stimulation volumes and the hypointensity in standard space significantly correlated with tremor improvement (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.16, p = 0.017) and distance to hotspots previously reported in the literature (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.49, p = 7.9e-4). In contrast, the amount of variance explained by other anatomical atlas structures was reduced. When accounting for interindividual neuroanatomical variability, the predictive power of the hypointensity increased further (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.37, p = 0.002).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings introduce and validate a novel imaging-based marker attainable from FGATIR sequences that has the potential to personalize and inform targeting and programming in DBS for essential tremor.</p>

                Hu et al. find that burrowing behavior alters allele-specific gene expression in F1 hybrids of two deer mouse species that dig long versus short burrows. Genes for which burrowing upregulates the allele from longer-burrowing parents often affect locomotor coordination and are linked to genomic regions associated with burrow-length variation.

                Inflammation contributes to neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. Sterling et al. describe the activation of nutritional immunity by pathological α-synuclein. Through this pathway, termed the cellular iron sequestration response (CISR), pro-inflammatory microglia drive neuronal iron accumulation and cell death.

Accordingly, impaired production of Tregs and organ-specific autoimmunity in Aire-deficient mice are rescued by depleting the CTLA-4 from mTECs.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Renal Klotho and inorganic phosphate are extrinsic factors that antagonistically regulate hematopoietic stem cell maintenance</a></h4>

              
                Du et al. identify renal Klotho and Pi as extrinsic factors that antagonistically regulate hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) maintenance in the bone marrow. Kidney-secreted soluble Klotho restrains SLC20A1-mediated Pi absorption of bone marrow HSCs, whereas disruption of the Klotho-Pi axis induces expansion and megakaryocyte/myeloid-biased differentiation of bone marrow HSCs.

                Perez-Frances et al. describe the natural history of islet endocrine cells in adult and aged (10-month-old) mice, tracing them back to an embryonic origin exclusively. All islet cells emerge from hormone-expressing cells arising already in early pancreatic primordia, with precise patterns of hormone gene activation, co-expression, and switching during development.

                Ma et al. show that Lgl1 is essential for mammary gland branching morphogenesis but not epithelial polarity. Lgl1 is required for directional migration by regulating Integrin β1 signaling levels and focal adhesion strengths. Finally, branching mechanisms are distinct between mammary gland and Drosophila systems where directional migration is indispensable.

                Sivakumar et al. show that the tumor suppressor TP53 promotes human embryonic stem cell (hESC) differentiation into mature teratomas. They further identify a developmentally regulated transcriptional program of TP53 that promotes ciliogenesis, restrains Shh signaling, and commits hESCs to neural lineages. Their findings implicate the differentiation-promoting function of TP53 in tumor suppression.

                DOT1L is a histone lysine methyltransferase that is stimulated by H2BK120 ubiquitylation and is central to the pathogenesis of leukemia. Here, Spangler et al. show how ubiquitin and cofactor binding by DOT1L accelerate conformational changes to promote H3K79 methylation. Disruption of the DOT1L-ubiquitin interaction blocks cell proliferation in MLL-rearranged leukemia.

                The dynamics of host-parasite interactions are highly temperature-dependent and may be modified by increasing frequency and intensity of climate-driven heat events. Here, we show that altered patterns of temperature variance lead to an almost order-of-magnitude shift in thermal performance of host and pathogen life-history traits over and above the effects of mean temperature and, moreover, that different temperature regimes affect these traits differently. We found that diurnal fluctuations of ±3°C lowered infection rates and reduced spore burden compared to constant temperatures in our focal host <i>Daphnia magna</i> exposed to the microsporidium parasite <i>Ordospora colligata</i>. In contrast, a 3-day heatwave (+6°C) did not affect infection rates, but increased spore burden (relative to constant temperatures with the same mean) at 16°C, while reducing burden at higher temperatures. We conclude that changing patterns of climate variation, superimposed on shifts in mean temperatures due to global warming, may have profound and unanticipated effects on disease dynamics.

                Prostate cancer is the second most occurring cancer in men worldwide. To better understand the mechanisms of tumorigenesis and possible treatment responses, we developed a mathematical model of prostate cancer which considers the major signalling pathways known to be deregulated. We personalised this Boolean model to molecular data to reflect the heterogeneity and specific response to perturbations of cancer patients. 488 prostate samples were used to build patient-specific models and compared to available clinical data. Additionally, eight prostate cell-line-specific models were built to validate our approach with dose-response data of several drugs. The effects of single and combined drugs were tested in these models under different growth conditions. We identified 15 actionable points of interventions in one cell-line-specific model whose inactivation hinders tumorigenesis. To validate these results, we tested nine small molecule inhibitors of five of those putative targets and found a dose-dependent effect on four of them, notably those targeting HSP90 and PI3K. These results highlight the predictive power of our personalised Boolean models and illustrate how they can be used for precision oncology.

                Three-photon excitation has recently been demonstrated as an effective method to perform intravital microscopy in deep, previously inaccessible regions of the mouse brain. The applicability of 3-photon excitation for deep imaging of other, more heterogeneous tissue types has been much less explored. In this work, we analyze the benefit of high-pulse-energy 1 MHz pulse-repetition-rate infrared excitation near 1300 and 1700 nm for in-depth imaging of tumorous and bone tissue. We show that this excitation regime provides a more than 2-fold increased imaging depth in tumor and bone tissue compared to the illumination conditions commonly used in 2-photon excitation, due to improved excitation confinement and reduced scattering. We also show that simultaneous 3- and 4-photon processes can be effectively induced with a single laser line, enabling the combined detection of blue to far-red fluorescence together with second and third harmonic generation without chromatic aberration, at excitation intensities compatible with live tissue imaging. Finally, we analyze photoperturbation thresholds in this excitation regime and derive setpoints for safe cell imaging. Together, these results indicate that infrared high-pulse-energy low-repetition-rate excitation opens novel perspectives for intravital deep-tissue microscopy of multiple parameters in strongly scattering tissues and organs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">PBN-PVT projections modulate negative affective states in mice</a></h4>

              
                Long-lasting negative affections dampen enthusiasm for life, and dealing with negative affective states is essential for individual survival. The parabrachial nucleus (PBN) and thalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVT) are critical for modulating affective states in mice. However, the functional roles of PBN-PVT projections in modulating affective states remain elusive. Here, we show that PBN neurons send dense projection fibers to the PVT and form direct excitatory synapses with PVT neurons. Activation of the PBN-PVT pathway induces robust behaviors associated with negative affective states without affecting nociceptive behaviors. Inhibition of the PBN-PVT pathway reduces aversion-like and fear-like behaviors. Furthermore, the PVT neurons innervated by the PBN are activated by aversive stimulation, and activation of PBN-PVT projections enhances the neuronal activity of PVT neurons in response to the aversive stimulus. Consistently, activation of PVT neurons that received PBN-PVT projections induces anxiety-like behaviors. Thus, our study indicates that PBN-PVT projections modulate negative affective states in mice.

                Body mass index (BMI), hyperlipidemia, and truncal adipose distribution concordantly elevate cardiovascular disease risks, but have unknown genetic effects on blood trait variation. Using Mendelian randomization, we define unexpectedly opposing roles for increased BMI and truncal adipose distribution on blood traits. Elevated genetically determined BMI and lipid levels decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, consistent with clinical observations associating obesity and anemia. We found that lipid-related effects were confined to erythroid traits. In contrast, BMI affected multiple blood lineages, indicating broad effects on hematopoiesis. Increased truncal adipose distribution opposed BMI effects, increasing hemoglobin and blood cell counts across lineages. Conditional analyses indicated genes, pathways, and cell types responsible for these effects, including <i>Leptin Receptor</i> and other blood cell-extrinsic factors in adipocytes and endothelium that regulate hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell biology. Our findings identify novel roles for obesity on hematopoiesis, including a previously underappreciated role for genetically determined adipose distribution in determining blood cell formation and function.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells improve survival from sepsis by boosting immunomodulatory cells</a></h4>

              
                New therapeutic strategies to reduce sepsis-related mortality are urgently needed, as sepsis accounts for one in five deaths worldwide. Since hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are responsible for producing blood and immune cells, including in response to immunological stress, we explored their potential for treating sepsis. In a mouse model of Group A <i>Streptococcus</i> (GAS)-induced sepsis, severe immunological stress was associated with significant depletion of bone marrow HSPCs and mortality within approximately 5–7 days. We hypothesized that the inflammatory environment of GAS infection drives rapid HSPC differentiation and depletion that can be rescued by infusion of donor HSPCs. Indeed, infusion of 10,000 naïve HSPCs into GAS-infected mice resulted in rapid myelopoiesis and a 50–60% increase in overall survival. Surprisingly, mice receiving donor HSPCs displayed a similar pathogen load compared to untreated mice. Flow cytometric analysis revealed a significantly increased number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells in HSPC-infused mice, which correlated with reduced inflammatory cytokine levels and restored HSPC levels. These findings suggest that HSPCs play an essential immunomodulatory role that may translate into new therapeutic strategies for sepsis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Comprehensive and unbiased multiparameter high-throughput screening by compaRe finds effective and subtle drug responses in AML models</a></h4>

              
                Large-scale multiparameter screening has become increasingly feasible and straightforward to perform thanks to developments in technologies such as high-content microscopy and high-throughput flow cytometry. The automated toolkits for analyzing similarities and differences between large numbers of tested conditions have not kept pace with these technological developments. Thus, effective analysis of multiparameter screening datasets becomes a bottleneck and a limiting factor in unbiased interpretation of results. Here we introduce compaRe, a toolkit for large-scale multiparameter data analysis, which integrates quality control, data bias correction, and data visualization methods with a mass-aware gridding algorithm-based similarity analysis providing a much faster and more robust analyses than existing methods. Using mass and flow cytometry data from acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome patients, we show that compaRe can reveal interpatient heterogeneity and recognizable phenotypic profiles. By applying compaRe to high-throughput flow cytometry drug response data in AML models, we robustly identified multiple types of both deep and subtle phenotypic response patterns, highlighting how this analysis could be used for therapeutic discoveries. In conclusion, compaRe is a toolkit that uniquely allows for automated, rapid, and precise comparisons of large-scale multiparameter datasets, including high-throughput screens.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Erythropoietin directly remodels the clonal composition of murine hematopoietic multipotent progenitor cells</a></h4>

              
                The cytokine erythropoietin (EPO) is a potent inducer of erythrocyte development and one of the most prescribed biopharmaceuticals. The action of EPO on erythroid progenitor cells is well established, but its direct action on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) is still debated. Here, using cellular barcoding, we traced the differentiation of hundreds of single murine HSPCs, after <i>ex vivo</i> EPO-exposure and transplantation, in five different hematopoietic cell lineages, and observed the transient occurrence of high-output Myeloid-Erythroid-megaKaryocyte (MEK)-biased and Myeloid-B-cell-Dendritic cell (MBDC)-biased clones. Single-cell RNA sequencing (ScRNAseq) analysis of <i>ex vivo</i> EPO-exposed HSPCs revealed that EPO induced the upregulation of erythroid associated genes in a subset of HSPCs, overlapping with multipotent progenitor (MPP) 1 and MPP2. Transplantation of Barcoded EPO-exposed-MPP2 confirmed their enrichment in Myeloid-Erythroid-biased clones. Collectively, our data show that EPO does act directly on MPP independent of the niche, and modulates fate by remodeling the clonal composition of the MPP pool.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Assessing the effects of stress on feeding behaviors in laboratory mice</a></h4>

              
                Stress often affects eating behaviors, increasing caloric intake in some individuals and decreasing it in others. The determinants of feeding responses to stress are unknown, in part because this issue is rarely studied in rodents. We focused our efforts on the novelty-suppressed feeding (NSF) assay, which uses latency to eat as readout of anxiety-like behavior, but rarely assesses feeding per se. We explored how key variables in experimental paradigms – estrous and diurnal cyclicity, age and duration of social isolation, prandial state, diet palatability, and elevated body weight – influence stress-induced anxiety-like behavior and food intake in male and female C57BL/6J mice. Latency to eat in the novel environment is increased in both sexes across most of the conditions tested, while effects on caloric intake are variable. In the common NSF assay (i.e., lean mice in the light cycle), sex-specific effects of the length of social isolation, and not estrous cyclicity, are the main source of variability. Under conditions that are more physiologically relevant for humans (i.e., overweight mice in the active phase), the novel stress now elicits robust hyperphagia in both sexes . This novel model of stress eating can be used to identify underlying neuroendocrine and neuronal substrates. Moreover, these studies can serve as a framework to integrate cross-disciplinary studies of anxiety and feeding related behaviors in rodents.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Increased low-frequency brain responses to music after psilocybin therapy for depression</a></h4>

              
                Psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy with psilocybin is an emerging therapy with great promise for depression, and modern psychedelic therapy (PT) methods incorporate music as a key element. Music is an effective emotional/hedonic stimulus that could also be useful in assessing changes in emotional responsiveness following psychedelic therapy. Brain responses to music were assessed before and after PT using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and ALFF (Amplitude of Low Frequency Fluctuations) analysis methods. Nineteen patients with treatment-resistant depression underwent two treatment sessions involving administration of psilocybin, with MRI data acquired one week prior and the day after completion of the second of two psilocybin dosing sessions. Comparison of music-listening and resting-state scans revealed significantly greater ALFF in bilateral superior temporal cortex for the post-treatment music scan, and in the right ventral occipital lobe for the post-treatment resting-state scan. ROI analyses of these clusters revealed a significant effect of treatment in the superior temporal lobe for the music scan only. Somewhat consistently, voxelwise comparison of treatment effects showed relative increases for the music scan in the bilateral superior temporal lobes and supramarginal gyrus, and relative decreases in the medial frontal lobes for the resting-state scan. ALFF in these music-related clusters was significantly correlated with intensity of subjective effects felt during the dosing sessions. These data suggest a specific effect of PT on the brain's response to a hedonic stimulus (music), implying an elevated responsiveness to music after psilocybin therapy that was related to subjective drug effects felt during dosing.

                Information flow in the sensory cortex has been described as a predominantly feedforward sequence with deep layers as the output structure. Although recurrent excitatory projections from layer 5 (L5) to superficial L2/3 have been identified by anatomical and physiological studies, their functional impact on sensory processing remains unclear. Here, we use layer-selective optogenetic manipulations in the primary auditory cortex to demonstrate that feedback inputs from L5 suppress the activity of superficial layers, contrary to the prediction from their excitatory connectivity. This suppressive effect is predominantly mediated by translaminar circuitry through intratelencephalic (IT) neurons, with an additional contribution of subcortical projections by pyramidal tract (PT) neurons. Furthermore, L5 activation sharpened tone-evoked responses of superficial layers in both frequency and time domains, indicating its impact on cortical spectro-temporal integration. Together, our findings challenge the classical view of feedforward cortical circuitry and reveal a major contribution of inhibitory recurrence in shaping sensory representations.

                The fluorescent glutamate indicator iGluSnFR enables imaging of neurotransmission with genetic and molecular specificity. However, existing iGluSnFR variants exhibit saturating activation kinetics and are excluded from post-synaptic densities, limiting their ability to distinguish synaptic from extrasynaptic glutamate. Using a multi-assay screen in bacteria, soluble protein, and cultured neurons, we generated novel variants with improved kinetics and signal-to-noise ratios. We also developed surface display constructs that improve iGluSnFR's nanoscopic localization to post-synapses. The resulting indicator, iGluSnFR3, exhibits rapid non-saturating activation kinetics and reports synaptic glutamate release with improved linearity and increased specificity versus extrasynaptic signals in cultured neurons. In mouse visual cortex, imaging of iGluSnFR3 at individual boutons reported single electrophysiologically-observed action potentials with high specificity versus non-synaptic transients. In vibrissal sensory cortex Layer 4, we used iGluSnFR3 to characterize distinct patterns of touch-evoked feedforward input from thalamocortical boutons and both feedforward and recurrent input onto L4 cortical neuron dendritic spines.

                Accelerometers are low-cost measurement devices that can readily be used outside the lab. However, determining isolated gait events from accelerometer signals, especially foot-off events during running, is an open problem. We outline a two-step approach where machine learning serves to predict vertical ground reaction forces from accelerometer signals, followed by force-based event detection. We collected shank accelerometer signals and ground reaction forces from five adults during comfortable walking and running on an instrumented treadmill. We trained one common reservoir computer using segmented data using both walking and running data. Despite being trained on just a small number of strides, this reservoir computer predicted vertical ground reaction forces in continuous gait with excellent quality. The subsequent foot contact and foot off event detection proved highly accurate when compared to the golden standard based on co-registered ground reaction forces. Our proof-of-concept illustrates the capacity of combining accelerometery with machine learning for detecting isolated gait events irrespective of mode of locomotion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Exploring volume mediated bystander-inhibition in a neuron model of the Locus coeruleus</a></h4>

              
                The Locus coeruleus (LC) modulates various neuronal circuits throughout the brain. Its unique architectural organization encompasses a net of axonal innervation that spans the entire brain; while its somatic core is highly compact. Recent research revealed an unexpected cellular input specificity within the nucleus that can give rise to various network states that either broadcast NE signals throughout the brain or pointedly modulate specific brain areas. Such adaptive input-output functions likely surpass our existing network models that build upon a given synaptic wiring configuration between neurons. As the distances between noradrenergic neurons in the core of the LC are unusually small, neighboring neurons could theoretically impact each other via volume transmission of NE. We therefore set out to investigate such bystander-inhibition via noradrenergic alpha2-receptors through a computational LC neuron model. We validate our model of LC neurons through comparison with experimental patch-clamp data and identify key variables that impact bystander-inhibition of neighboring LC neurons. Our simulation confirms a reliable autoinhibition of LC neurons after episodes of high neuronal activity that continue even after neuronal activity subsided. Also, dendro-somatic synapses inhibit spontaneous spiking in the somatic compartment of connected neurons in our model. We determined the exact position of hundreds of LC neurons in the mouse brain stem via a tissue clearing approach and based on this, further determined that 25 percent of noradrenergic neurons have a neighboring LC neuron within less than a 25-micrometers radius. By modeling NE diffusion, we estimate that more than 15 percent of alpha2-adrenergic receptors fraction can bind NE within such diffusion radius. Our spike model of LC neurons predicts that repeated or long-lasting episodes of high neuronal activity induce a bystander-inhibition that reduces the spike rate in neighboring neurons at distances smaller than 25 micrometers. As these volume-mediate neighboring effects are challenging to test with the current methodology, our findings can guide future experimental approaches to test this phenomenon and its physiological consequences.

                Reproductive endocrine disorders are common comorbidities of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Our previous studies using the intrahippocampal kainic acid (IHKA) mouse model of TLE demonstrated that many females show prolonged estrous cycles and hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons exhibit elevated firing during diestrus. However, it is unknown whether the degree of change in GnRH neuron activity is dependent on epilepsy severity. Here, we used 24/7 in vivo EEG and in vitro electrophysiological recordings in acute brain slices to assess GnRH neuron firing in relation to chronic seizure burden in diestrous female mice at two months after IHKA injection. We found that percentage of time in seizure activity in the 24 hours prior to slice preparation is an accurate proxy of overall seizure burden. Firing rates of GnRH neurons from EEG-recorded IHKA mice were increased in comparison to controls, but no relationships were found between GnRH neuron firing and seizure burden measured in vivo. The independence of GnRH neuron firing rate in relation to seizure burden was unaffected by GnRH neuron soma location or estrous cycle length. Furthermore, GnRH neuron firing rates were not yet different from control values when measured 1 month after injection when epileptogenesis is already complete in IHKA mice. This result suggests a potential window for intervention to prevent epilepsy-associated GnRH neuron dysfunction. These findings indicate that the severity of epilepsy and the degree of downstream disruption to GnRH neuron activity are independent, suggesting that susceptibility to reproductive endocrine comorbidities is driven by other risk factors.

                The biological mechanisms supporting age-dependent changes in learning and memory remain elusive. While a growing body of human literature implicates KIBRA in memory and neurodevelopmental disorders, KIBRA's molecular function and contribution to maturation of synaptic function and cognition remain poorly understood. Despite being expressed throughout early postnatal development, germline deletion of KIBRA impairs synaptic plasticity selectively in adult rodents. However, it is unclear whether KIBRA facilitates proper brain maturation necessary for adult plasticity or whether it plays a distinct role in plasticity in the adult brain. Here, using an inducible KIBRA knockout mouse, we demonstrate that acutely deleting KIBRA in adult forebrain neurons impairs both spatial memory and long-term potentiation (LTP). The deficits in LTP correlate with an adult-selective decrease in extrasynaptic AMPA receptors under basal conditions. We also identify a novel role for KIBRA in LTP-induced AMPAR upregulation. In contrast, acute deletion of KIBRA in juvenile forebrain neurons did not affect LTP and had minimal effects on basal AMPAR expression. These data suggest that KIBRA serves a unique role in adult hippocampal function through regulation of basal and activity-dependent AMPAR proteostasis that supports synaptic plasticity.

                Understanding how neurons interact across the brain to control animal behaviors is one of the central goals in neuroscience. Recent developments in fluorescent microscopy and genetically-encoded calcium indicators led to the establishment of whole-brain imaging methods in zebrafish, which records neural activity across a brain-wide volume with single-cell resolution. Pioneering studies of whole-brain imaging used custom light-sheet microscopes, and their operation relied on commercially developed and maintained software that is not available globally. Hence it has been challenging to disseminate and develop the technology in the research community. Here, we present PyZebrascope, an open-source Python platform designed for neural activity imaging in zebrafish using light-sheet microscopy. PyZebrascope has intuitive user interfaces and implements essential features for whole-brain imaging, such as two orthogonal excitation beams and eye damage prevention. Its modular architecture allows the inclusion of advanced algorithms for microscope control and image processing. As a proof of concept, we implemented an automatic algorithm for maximizing the image resolution in the brain by precisely aligning the excitation beams to the image focal plane. PyZebrascope enables whole-brain neural activity imaging in fish behaving in a virtual reality environment with a stable high data throughput and low CPU and memory consumption. Thus, PyZebrascope will help disseminate and develop light-sheet microscopy techniques in the neuroscience community and advance our understanding of whole-brain neural dynamics during animal behaviors.

                Information flow through neural circuits is continuously modified by context-dependent learning. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, pairing specific odors with food deprivation results in aversion to the odor. Here we identify cell-specific mechanisms of insulin/IGF receptor signaling that integrate sensory information with food context during aversive olfactory learning. Using FLP::FRT recombination of an endogenously targeted locus, we show that aversive learning to butanone, an odor sensed only by the AWCON olfactory neuron, requires the insulin/IGF receptor DAF-2 in AWCON. Learning requires an axonally-localized DAF-2c isoform and the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) protein IST-1, and is partly independent of the FoxO transcription factor DAF-16. Food deprivation, the unconditioned stimulus for learning, increases DAF-2 expression post-transcriptionally through an insulin- and ist-1-dependent process. Aversive learning suppresses odor-regulated glutamate release from the AWCON axon in wild-type animals but not in ist-1 mutants, suggesting that insulin signaling drives presynaptic depression to generate an aversive memory.

                Loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in CASK cause severe developmental phenotypes, including microcephaly with pontine and cerebellar hypoplasia, X-linked intellectual disability, and autism. Unraveling the pathogenesis of CASK-related disorders has been challenging due to limited human cellular models to study the dynamic roles of this molecule during neuronal and synapse development. Here, we generated CASK knockout (KO) isogenic cell lines from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) using CRISPR/Cas9 and examined gene expression, morphometrics and synaptic function of induced neuronal cells during development. While young (immature) CASK KO neurons show robust neuronal outgrowth, mature CASK KO neurons displayed severe defects in synaptic transmission and synchronized burst activity without compromising neuronal morphology and synapse numbers. In developing human cortical neurons, CASK functions to promote both structural integrity and establishment of cortical excitatory neuronal networks. These results lay the foundation for future studies identifying suppressors of such phenotypes relevant to human patients.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural correlates of multisensory enhancement in audiovisual narrative speech perception: a fMRI investigation</a></h4>

              
                This fMRI study investigated the effect of seeing articulatory movements of a speaker while listening to a naturalistic narrative stimulus. It had the goal to identify regions of the language network showing multisensory enhancement under synchronous audiovisual conditions. We expected this enhancement to emerge in regions known to underlie the integration of auditory and visual information such as the posterior superior temporal gyrus as well as parts of the broader language network, including the semantic system. To this end we presented 53 participants with a continuous narration of a story in auditory alone, visual alone, and both synchronous and asynchronous audiovisual speech conditions while recording brain activity using BOLD fMRI. We found multisensory enhancement in an extensive network of regions underlying multisensory integration and parts of the semantic network as well as extralinguistic regions not usually associated with multisensory integration, namely the primary visual cortex and the bilateral amygdala. Analysis also revealed involvement of thalamic brain regions along the visual and auditory pathways more commonly associated with early sensory processing. We conclude that under natural listening conditions, multisensory enhancement not only involves sites of multisensory integration but many regions of the wider semantic network and includes regions associated with extralinguistic sensory, perceptual and cognitive processing.

	<p>We compared neuropsychological functioning and prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in two birth cohorts born 20 years apart when participants had reached the same age, i.e., the mid-60s. The study followed up 500 volunteers born 1930&amp;amp;ndash;1932 (C30) and 502 born 1950&amp;amp;ndash;1952 (C50). Participants underwent medical, neuropsychological, and psychiatric examinations in 1993&amp;amp;ndash;1996 (T1), 1997&amp;amp;ndash;2000 (T2), 2005&amp;amp;ndash;2008 (T3), and 2014&amp;amp;ndash;2016 (T4), including assessment of abstract thinking, memory performance, verbal fluency, visuo-spatial thinking, psychomotor speed, and attention. Healthy participants from C30 at T2 (n = 298) and from C50 at T4 (n = 205) were compared using multivariate ANCOVAs. Groups slightly differed with respect to age (C50: 63.86 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.14 vs. C30: 66.80 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.91; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) and years of education (13.28 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.89 vs. 14.56 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.45). After correcting for age, C50 significantly outperformed C30 in all domains except concentration and verbal fluency. After additionally adjusting for education, C50 significantly outperformed C30 in declarative memory performances and abstract thinking only. Prevalence rates of MCI were 25.2% in C30 and 9.6% in C50 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Our findings confirm the association between better educational attainment and enhanced cognitive performance in &amp;amp;ldquo;younger&amp;amp;rdquo; old individuals. While this association corresponds to the Flynn effect, various life course influences may have also contributed to better performance, including improvements in healthcare provision, medication, and lifestyle factors. Their overall effects may foster cognitive reserve and thus translate into the decline in MCI prevalence reported here.</p>

	<p>The presence of external observers has been shown to affect performance on cognitive tasks, but the parameters of this impact for different types of tasks and the underlying neural dynamics are less understood. The current study examined the behavioral and brain activity effects of perceived observation on participants&amp;amp;rsquo; visual working memory (VWM) in a virtual reality (VR) classroom setting, using the task format as a moderating variable. Participants (n = 21) were equipped with a 57-channel EEG cap, and neural data were collected as they completed two VWM tasks under two observation conditions (observed and not observed) in a within-subjects experimental design. The &amp;amp;ldquo;observation&amp;amp;rdquo; condition was operationalized through the addition of a static human avatar in the VR classroom. The avatar&amp;amp;rsquo;s presence was associated with a significant effect on extending the task response time, but no effect was found on task accuracy. This outcome may have been due to a ceiling effect, as the mean participant task scores were quite high. EEG data analysis supported the behavioral findings by showing consistent differences between the no-observation and observation conditions for one of the VWM tasks only. These neural differences were identified in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and the occipital cortex (OC) regions, with higher theta-band activity occurring in the dlPFC during stimulus encoding and in the OC during response selection when the &amp;amp;ldquo;observing&amp;amp;rdquo; avatar was present. These findings provide evidence that perceived observation can inhibit performance during visual tasks by altering attentional focus, even in virtual contexts.</p>

	<p>Dementia is a neurodegenerative disease that leads to the development of cognitive deficits, such as aphasia, apraxia, and agnosia. It is currently considered one of the most significant major medical problems worldwide, primarily affecting the elderly. This condition gradually impairs the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s cognition, eventually leading to the inability to perform everyday tasks without assistance. Since dementia is an incurable disease, early detection plays an important role in delaying its progression. Because of this, tools and methods have been developed to help accurately diagnose patients in their early stages. State-of-the-art methods have shown that the use of syntactic-type linguistic features provides a sensitive and noninvasive tool for detecting dementia in its early stages. However, these methods lack relevant semantic information. In this work, we propose a novel methodology, based on the semantic features approach, by using sentence embeddings computed by Siamese BERT networks (SBERT), along with support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest, and an artificial neural network (ANN) as classifiers. Our methodology extracted 17 features that provide demographic, lexical, syntactic, and semantic information from 550 oral production samples of elderly controls and people with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, provided by the DementiaBank Pitt Corpus database. To quantify the relevance of the extracted features for the dementia classification task, we calculated the mutual information score, which demonstrates a dependence between our features and the MMSE score. The experimental classification performance metrics, such as the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score (77, 80, 80, and 80%, respectively), validate that our methodology performs better than syntax-based methods and the BERT approach when only the linguistic features are used.</p>

                Background - Data analytics can support the external auditors’ judgements. However, little is known about the external auditors’ data analytics competency. Likewise, role of religiosity in enhancing the external auditors’ performance is also inadequately investigated. This study examined: 1) the effects of data analytics competency on the external auditors’ performance, and 2) the moderating effects of religiosity on data analytics competency and external auditors’ performance relationship. Methods – Survey was conducted on 201 external auditors. Data analytics competency dimensions, namely, personal capabilities, professional expertise, technical skills, technologies and tools expertise were examined. Religiosity was measured by level and dimension (faith, virtue and optional). Results – Data analytics competency (personal capabilities) has a significant positive effect on the Muslim external auditors’ performance, whereas data analytics competency (technologies and tools expertise) has a significant positive affect on the non-Muslim external auditors’ performance. Level of religiosity has significant moderating effect on the relationship between data analytics competency (technologies and tools expertise) and Muslim external auditors’ performance. Nonetheless, level of religiosity does not moderate the relationship between data analytics competency and the performance of non-Muslim external auditors. Religiosity (virtue) has significant moderating effect on the relationship between data analytics competency (personal capabilities) and Muslim external auditors’ performance. Meanwhile, religiosity (faith) has a significant moderating effect on the relationship between data analytics competency (technologies and tools expertise) and non-Muslim external auditors’ performance. Conclusion – This study demonstrates that data analytics competency and religiosity can influence the external auditors’ performance.

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Amacrine cells (ACs) are the most diverse neuronal cell type in the vertebrate retina. Yet little is known about the contribution of ACs to visual processing and retinal disease. A major challenge in evaluating AC function is genetic accessibility. A classic tool of mouse genetics, Cre-mediated recombination, can provide such access. We have screened existing genetically-modified mouse strains and identified multiple candidates that express Cre-recombinase in subsets of retinal ACs. The Cre-expressing mice were crossed to fluorescent-reporter mice to assay Cre expression. In addition, a Cre-dependent fluorescent reporter plasmid was electroporated into the subretinal space of Cre strains. Herein, we report three mouse lines (<I>Tac1::IRES-cre</I>, <I>Camk2a-cre</I>, and <I>Scx-cre</I>) that express Cre recombinase in sub-populations of ACs. In two of these lines, recombination occurred in multiple AC types and a small number of other retinal cell types, while recombination in the <I>Camk2a-cre</I> line appears specific to a morphologically distinct AC. We anticipate that these characterized mouse lines will be valuable tools to the community of researchers who study retinal biology and disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Auditory Nerve Fiber Discrimination and Representation of Naturally-Spoken Vowels in Noise</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>To understand how vowels are encoded by auditory nerve (AN) fibers, a number of representation schemes have been suggested that extract the vowel&rsquo;s formant frequencies from AN-fiber spiking patterns. The current study aims to apply and compare these schemes for AN-fiber responses to naturally-spoken vowels in a speech-shaped background noise. Responses to three vowels were evaluated; based on behavioral experiments in the same species, two of these were perceptually difficult to discriminate from each other (/e/ vs /i/), and one was perceptually easy to discriminate from the other two (/a:/). Single-unit AN fibers were recorded from ketamine/xylazine-anesthetized Mongolian gerbils of either sex (<I>n</I> = 8). First, single-unit discrimination between the three vowels was studied. Compared with the perceptually easy discriminations, the average spike timing-based discrimination values were significantly lower for the perceptually difficult vowel discrimination. This was not true for an average rate-based discrimination metric, the rate d-prime (d&rsquo;). Consistently, spike timing-based representation schemes, plotting the temporal responses of all recorded units as a function of their best frequency (BF), i.e., dominant component schemes, average localized interval rate, and fluctuation profiles, revealed representation of the vowel&rsquo;s formant frequencies, whereas no such representation was apparent in the rate-based excitation pattern. Making use of perceptual discrimination data, this study reveals that discrimination difficulties of naturally-spoken vowels in speech-shaped noise originate peripherally and can be studied in the spike timing patterns of single AN fibers.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Modelling sociodemographic factors that affect malaria prevalence in Sussundenga, Mozambique: a cross-sectional study. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Malaria is still one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in Mozambique with little progress in malaria control over the past 20 years. Sussundenga is one of most affected areas. Malaria transmission has a strong association with environmental and sociodemographic factors. The knowledge of sociodemographic factors that affects malaria, may be used to improve the strategic planning for its control. Currently such studies have not been performed in Sussundenga. Thus, the objective of this study is to model the relationship between malaria and sociodemographic factors in Sussundenga, Mozambique. Methods: Houses in the study area were digitalized and enumerated using Google Earth Pro version 7.3. In this study 100 houses were randomly selected to conduct a community survey of Plasmodium falciparum parasite prevalence using rapid diagnostic test (RDT). During the survey, a questionnaire was conducted to assess the sociodemographic factors of the participants. Descriptive statistics were analyzed and backward stepwise logistic regression was performed establishing a relationship between positive cases and the factors. The analysis was carried out using SPSS version 20 package. Results: The overall P. falciparum prevalence was 31.6%. Half of the malaria positive cases occurred in age group 5 to 14 years. Previous malaria treatment, population density and age group were significant predictors for the model. The model explained 13.5% of the variance in malaria positive cases and sensitivity of the final model was 73.3%. Conclusion: In this area the highest burden of P. falciparum infection was among those aged 5–14 years old. Malaria infection was related to sociodemographic factors. Targeting malaria control at community level can combat the disease more effectively than waiting for cases at health centers. These finding can be used to guide more effective interventions in this region.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Runcer-Necromancer: a method to rescue data from an interrupted run on MGISEQ-2000 [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                During the sequencing process, problems can occur with any device, including the MGISEQ-2000 (DNBSEQ-G400) platform. We encountered a power outage that resulted in a temporary shutdown of a sequencer in the middle of the run. Since barcode reading in MGISEQ-2000 takes place at the end of the run, it was impossible to use non-demultiplexed raw data. We decided to completely use up the same cartridge with reagents and flow cell loaded with DNB and started a new run in a shortened custom mode. We figured out how the MGISEQ-2000 converts preliminary data in .cal format into .fastq files and wrote a script named “Runcer-Necromacer” for merging .fastq files based on the analysis of their headers (available online: https://github.com/genomecenter/runcer-necromancer). Read merging proved to be possible because the MGISEQ-2000 flow cell has a patterned structure and each DNB has invariable coordinates on it, regardless of its position on the flow cell stage. We demonstrated the correctness of data merging by comparing sample analysis results with previously obtained .fastq files for them. Thus, we confirmed that it is possible to restart the device and save both parts of the interrupted run.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Impact on carbon emissions of online study for a cohort of overseas students: A retrospective cohort study [version 5; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: One of the benefits of online education is the potential reduction in carbon emissions through the decrease in travel to attend a university in person. We estimated the savings in CO2 emissions of an international cohort of master’s students who studied fully online from their home countries, rather than travelling to the UK and living there while attending university. Methods: The city and country of residence of a cohort of students who first enrolled in the fully online Peoples-uni/Manchester Metropolitan University Master of Public Health programme between the second semester of 2011 and the first semester 2013 were recorded. Total difference in emissions was calculated by adding the estimated aviation emissions between Manchester, UK and the cities where students resided, to the difference in per capita emissions between the country of origin and the UK for the time that the student would have spent in Manchester, based on the semester in which they first enrolled. Results: 128 students enrolled from 70 cities in 30 countries. 93 students were from a range of African countries and 18 from the Indian sub-continent. Flights to and from Manchester were estimated to have accounted for 114,553kg of CO2 and living in Manchester for the duration of their course compared with staying in the home country would have been equivalent to 854,904kg of CO2. The combined net savings was 969,457kg of CO2. Conclusions: A small cohort of overseas students, largely from Africa and India, studied online rather than attending university in the UK. The likely saving by this small cohort of nearly a million kg of CO 2 emissions offers an indication of the potential environmental benefits of offering university education online to overseas students.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effect of whitening toothpaste on surface roughness and microhardness of human teeth: a systematic review and meta-analysis [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Whitening toothpastes exert a whitening effect on teeth through higher surface cleaning effectiveness resulting from the abrasive properties of the paste or specific chemical components. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conceptualized to examine the relationship between whitening toothpastes and surface roughness as well as microhardness of human teeth and to clarify the evidence base available around this relationship by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies in this topic area, looking at in vitro randomized control trials. Methods: Criteria for including studies in the review were done based on population, intervention, comparison, outcomes and study and studies were identified from electronic databases. Covidence® was used for data screening and data extraction. The CONSORT tool was used for checking relevant content and methodology used in each of the papers reviewed. Systematic review was done followed by meta-analysis, using Review Manager. Results: A total of 125 articles were obtained on key word search. After duplicate removal and title screening, 17 articles were eligible for full text review. Finally, 7 studies were included for systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted on 4 studies. The forest plot for surface roughness showed that that the meta-analytic effect was statistically significant with surface roughness value being higher in the intervention group. The forest plot for microhardness showed that the meta-analytic effect was statistically significant with the microhardness value being lesser in the intervention group. Conclusions: Although whitening toothpastes typically can lighten tooth color by about one or two shades, there is some evidence to show that these toothpastes also affect the mineral content of teeth by increasing surface roughness and reducing microhardness. More evidence and further research are needed to identify the type of whitening agent which will whiten the tooth effectively while maintaining the integrity of the tooth structure.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The benefit of tissue sealant on urethroplasty in hypospadias patients – A systematic review and meta-analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Hypospadias was ranked second after undescended testis as the most prevalent congenital abnormality in newborn males. Hypospadias can be successfully repaired through multiple surgeries in the majority of children. Postoperative complications were not rarely seen after surgeries, such as urethrocutaneous fistula (UCF), meatal stenosis, and glans breakdown. Tissue sealant application in hypospadias repair serves as additional suture line coverage and reduces the post surgery complications5.However, the effects of sealants usage during urethroplasty are still uncertain. This review aimed to know the effects of tissue sealant usage on patients with hypospadias who undergo urethroplasty.  Methods: The study was reported based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Literature was searched on PubMed, Embase, and Scopus following PRISMA guidelines. The search was conducted on October 12th, 2021, using the search term ("glue" OR "sealants" OR "tissue glue" OR "tissue sealant" OR "tissue adhesive") AND ("hypospadias" OR "urethrocutaneous fistula" OR "urethral repair" OR "urethroplasty" OR "hypospadiology").  Result: Systematic searching from all databases resulted in 160 potential articles. After a full-text review, eight articles were included in this study. UCF complication was reported in all studies. The occurrence of complication reported by all studies was urethrocutaneous fistula. Several studies also reported tissue edema and flap-related complications. Tissue sealant had no significant effect in reducing meatal stenosis.   Conclusions: This systematic review revealed additional benefits from several types of tissue sealant in hypospadias repair surgery. Fibrin sealant application over the urethroplasty suture line in hypospadias repair offers a water-proof coverage and may enhance the outcome from the surgery.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Performance and preference of problem-based learning (PBL) and lecture-based classes among medical students of Nepal [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: PBL (problem based learning) is new active learning educational strategy that has been extensively tested and used in recent years. This study aims to compare students' understanding and knowledge retention when taught through PBL and lecture-based classes and compare PAHS students' perceptions of PBL and lectures in medical education. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of medical students of a PBL based medical school in Nepal, a non-Western low-income country. Ethical approval was given by the institutional research committee of the Patan Academy of Health Sciences. Understanding and knowledge retention was assessed with 50 vignette-based multiple-choice questions, half of which were taught through PBL sessions, and the remaining half were taught in didactic lectures during basic science years of medical school. A separate pre-validated perception questionnaire was used to assess students' preferences regarding PBL and lectures. Results: Out of 107 students, 99 participated in the understanding and knowledge retention questionnaires and 107 completed perception questionnaires. Understanding and knowledge retention of students was found to be the same for topics taught by PBL and lectures, with median scores of 17 and s16, respectively. PBL were mostly preferred for the physiology (59.81%), pathology (51.40%) and pharmacology (53.27%) concepts, and lectures were mostly preferred for the anatomy (78.50%), biochemistry (45.79%), and microbiology (42.99%) topics. Students wanted the same concepts to be taught through both PBL and lectures, especially for anatomy. Conclusions: Understanding and knowledge retention is the same for topics taught by either PBL or lectures during the basic science years of undergraduate medical education. Students prefer PBL for physiology, pathology, and pharmacology-related concepts, conventional didactic lecture for physiology and microbiology, and a combination of lecture and PBL sessions for anatomy.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Colorectal cancer on a dish: exploring the 3D-sphere culture of primary colorectal cancer cells from an Indonesian perspective [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background : Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is one of the deadliest types of cancer and has emerged as one of Indonesia's most devastating diseases. The growing number of colorectal cancer cases is frequently undiagnosed until the disease has progressed to a metastatic stage. This issue has lasted for years, limiting therapy options and resulting in a bad prognosis for the majority of patients. Thus, the purpose of this work is to develop a CRC detection method for Indonesia and other low-middle income nations that integrates in vitro 3D culture, molecular analysis, and in silico analysis. Methods : Colorectal cancer biopsies were transported to the lab and underwent mechanical disaggregation and centrifuged at 300 x g for five minutes. Approximately 10,000 cells were seeded in each Nunc-Sphera 96-well plate (u-bottom) for the following 7 days in standard culture medium. The 3D-sphere was harvested and RNA was extracted afterwards. Molecular analysis was performed using qPCR and the Human Cancer Pathway Profiler. Protein interaction and pathway analysis were conducted using STRING and Reactome online tools. Results :  Following initial seeding, primary CRC 3D-spheres were grown for 14–16 days. Gene profiling and in silico analyses suggest that CDC20, AURKA, and ACLY are expressed at lower levels than the positive control in the 3D-sphere. These markers have been implicated in metastasis, CRC proliferation, and as a drug target ligand. Conclusion : A combination of 3D culture, gene profiling, and in silico analysis is feasible to detect CRC for Indonesia and other low- and middle-income countries. A future possibility is to use minicolorectal cancer in a dish for ex vivo cancer modeling and pharmacological testing.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Vessel masking and Hough transform for optic disc localisation from retinal images [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Retinal images can be considered as one of the reliable indicators for symptoms of many ocular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration and glaucoma. By analysing and tracking changes of important structures on a retinal image, symptoms of ocular diseases can be detected in a timely manner which helps physicians plan early treatment for better disease control. One of the important landmarks on a retinal image is the optic disc (OD), which must be localised to estimate retinal vessel parameters such as vessel width and tortuosity. This paper proposes a method for automatic OD localisation from a retinal image. Methods: A retinal image is first pre-processed and thresholded to produce a binary image that highlights most retinal vessels on the image. Next, a discrete cosine transform-based smoothing method is employed to replace the detected vessel pixel values on the pre-processed image with values closer to the surrounding neighbour pixel values, effectively masking most vessels on the image. Hough transform is then applied to the vessel-masked image to detect the circle representing the OD on the image, producing the estimated location of the OD center and its estimated diameter. Results: Applying the proposed method to three different public databases, namely Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction (DRIVE), High-Resolution Fundus (HRF) and Methods to Evaluate Segmentation and Indexing Techniques in the field of Retinal Ophthalmology (MESSIDOR) resulted in an overall detection rate of 99.53%. Conclusions: The achieved performance by the proposed method is superior to many published methods of OD localization, with a processing time of less than one second for each image. While this has only been validated on one type of retinal images, future investigations may include validation on other types such as angiograms or scanning laser ophthalmoscopy.

                Background: As Malaysia struggles with the battle to retain talented workers, the retention of persons with disabilities (PWDs) remains a major challenge in innovation management. Malaysia currently has the lowest retention of PWDs in innovation management in The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The purpose of this study is to develop a unique framework to enhance the inclusion of PWDs in Malaysia.  Methods: A questionnaire was distributed to 200 PWDs in the central region of Malaysia.   Results: Based on the results of this research, four crucial variables (salary, compensation, career advancement and reward management) contributed to the lack of involvement in innovation management among PWDs in Malaysia.  Conclusions: This study only focuses on 200 PWDs in Malaysia. Despite the fact that PWDs’ involvement in innovation management is the lowest, there is a lack of research initiative and practitioner commitment to address this issue. Serving as preliminary research in Malaysia, this study develops a unique framework to fill the gap.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Shape analysis of gamma rhythm supports a superlinear inhibitory regime in an inhibition-stabilized network</a></h4>

              
                <p>by R Krishnakumaran, Mohammed Raees, Supratim Ray</p>

Visual inspection of stimulus-induced gamma oscillations (30–70 Hz) often reveals a non-sinusoidal shape. Such distortions are a hallmark of non-linear systems and are also observed in mean-field models of gamma oscillations. A thorough characterization of the shape of the gamma cycle can therefore provide additional constraints on the operating regime of such models. However, the gamma waveform has not been quantitatively characterized, partially because the first harmonic of gamma, which arises because of the non-sinusoidal nature of the signal, is typically weak and gets masked due to a broadband increase in power related to spiking. To address this, we recorded local field potential (LFP) from the primary visual cortex (V1) of two awake female macaques while presenting full-field gratings or iso-luminant chromatic hues that produced huge gamma oscillations with prominent peaks at harmonic frequencies in the power spectra. We found that gamma and its first harmonic always maintained a specific phase relationship, resulting in a distinctive shape with a sharp trough and a shallow peak. Interestingly, a Wilson-Cowan (WC) model operating in an inhibition stabilized mode could replicate this shape, but only when the inhibitory population operated in the super-linear regime, as predicted recently. However, another recently developed model of gamma that operates in a linear regime driven by stochastic noise failed to produce salient harmonics or the observed shape. Our results impose additional constraints on models that generate gamma oscillations and their operating regimes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Patient contrastive learning: A performant, expressive, and practical approach to electrocardiogram modeling</a></h4>

Supervised machine learning applications in health care are often limited due to a scarcity of labeled training data. To mitigate the effect of small sample size, we introduce a pre-training approach, Patient Contrastive Learning of Representations (PCLR), which creates latent representations of electrocardiograms (ECGs) from a large number of unlabeled examples using contrastive learning. The resulting representations are expressive, performant, and practical across a wide spectrum of clinical tasks. We develop PCLR using a large health care system with over 3.2 million 12-lead ECGs and demonstrate that training linear models on PCLR representations achieves a 51% performance increase, on average, over six training set sizes and four tasks (sex classification, age regression, and the detection of left ventricular hypertrophy and atrial fibrillation), relative to training neural network models from scratch. We also compared PCLR to three other ECG pre-training approaches (supervised pre-training, unsupervised pre-training with an autoencoder, and pre-training using a contrastive multi ECG-segment approach), and show significant performance benefits in three out of four tasks. We found an average performance benefit of 47% over the other models and an average of a 9% performance benefit compared to best model for each task. We release PCLR to enable others to extract ECG representations at https://github.com/broadinstitute/ml4h/tree/master/model_zoo/PCLR.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">gmxapi: A GROMACS-native Python interface for molecular dynamics with ensemble and plugin support</a></h4>

              
                <p>by M. Eric Irrgang, Caroline Davis, Peter M. Kasson</p>

Gmxapi provides an integrated, native Python API for both standard and advanced molecular dynamics simulations in GROMACS. The Python interface permits multiple levels of integration with the core GROMACS libraries, and legacy support is provided via an interface that mimics the command-line syntax, so that all GROMACS commands are fully available. Gmxapi has been officially supported since the GROMACS 2019 release and is enabled by default in current versions of the software. Here we describe gmxapi 0.3 and later. Beyond simply wrapping GROMACS library operations, the API permits several advanced operations that are not feasible using the prior command-line interface. First, the API allows custom user plugin code within the molecular dynamics force calculations, so users can execute custom algorithms without modifying the GROMACS source. Second, the Python interface allows tasks to be dynamically defined, so high-level algorithms for molecular dynamics simulation and analysis can be coordinated with loop and conditional operations. Gmxapi makes GROMACS more accessible to custom Python scripting while also providing support for high-level data-flow simulation algorithms that were previously feasible only in external packages.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Evidence for the emergence of β-trefoils by ‘Peptide Budding’ from an IgG-like β-sandwich</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Liam M. Longo, Rachel Kolodny, Shawn E. McGlynn</p>

As sequence and structure comparison algorithms gain sensitivity, the intrinsic interconnectedness of the protein universe has become increasingly apparent. Despite this general trend, β-trefoils have emerged as an uncommon counterexample: They are an isolated protein lineage for which few, if any, sequence or structure associations to other lineages have been identified. If β-trefoils are, in fact, remote islands in sequence-structure space, it implies that the oligomerizing peptide that founded the β-trefoil lineage itself arose <i>de novo</i>. To better understand β-trefoil evolution, and to probe the limits of fragment sharing across the protein universe, we identified both ‘β-trefoil bridging themes’ (evolutionarily-related sequence segments) and ‘β-trefoil-like motifs’ (structure motifs with a hallmark feature of the β-trefoil architecture) in multiple, ostensibly unrelated, protein lineages. The success of the present approach stems, in part, from considering β-trefoil sequence segments or structure motifs rather than the β-trefoil architecture as a whole, as has been done previously. The newly uncovered inter-lineage connections presented here suggest a novel hypothesis about the origins of the β-trefoil fold itself–namely, that it is a derived fold formed by ‘budding’ from an Immunoglobulin-like β-sandwich protein. These results demonstrate how the evolution of a folded domain from a peptide need not be a signature of antiquity and underpin an emerging truth: few protein lineages escape nature’s sewing table.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Elucidating multi-input processing 3-node gene regulatory network topologies capable of generating striped gene expression patterns</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Juan Camilo Arboleda-Rivera, Gloria Machado-Rodríguez, Boris A. Rodríguez, Jayson Gutiérrez</p>

A central problem in developmental and synthetic biology is understanding the mechanisms by which cells in a tissue or a Petri dish process external cues and transform such information into a coherent response, e.g., a terminal differentiation state. It was long believed that this type of positional information could be entirely attributed to a gradient of concentration of a specific signaling molecule (i.e., a morphogen). However, advances in experimental methodologies and computer modeling have demonstrated the crucial role of the dynamics of a cell’s gene regulatory network (GRN) in decoding the information carried by the morphogen, which is eventually translated into a spatial pattern. This morphogen interpretation mechanism has gained much attention in systems biology as a tractable system to investigate the emergent properties of complex genotype-phenotype maps. In this study, we apply a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-like algorithm to probe the design space of three-node GRNs with the ability to generate a band-like expression pattern (target phenotype) in the middle of an arrangement of 30 cells, which resemble a simple (1-D) morphogenetic field in a developing embryo. Unlike most modeling studies published so far, here we explore the space of GRN topologies with nodes having the potential to perceive the same input signal differently. This allows for a lot more flexibility during the search space process, and thus enables us to identify a larger set of potentially interesting and realizable morphogen interpretation mechanisms. Out of 2061 GRNs selected using the search space algorithm, we found 714 classes of network topologies that could correctly interpret the morphogen. Notably, the main network motif that generated the target phenotype in response to the input signal was the type 3 Incoherent Feed-Forward Loop (I3-FFL), which agrees with previous theoretical expectations and experimental observations. Particularly, compared to a previously reported pattern forming GRN topologies, we have uncovered a great variety of novel network designs, some of which might be worth inquiring through synthetic biology methodologies to test for the ability of network design with minimal regulatory complexity to interpret a developmental cue robustly.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Computational modelling of cell motility modes emerging from cell-matrix adhesion dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Leonie van Steijn, Inge M. N. Wortel, Clément Sire, Loïc Dupré, Guy Theraulaz, Roeland M. H. Merks</p>

Lymphocytes have been described to perform different motility patterns such as Brownian random walks, persistent random walks, and Lévy walks. Depending on the conditions, such as confinement or the distribution of target cells, either Brownian or Lévy walks lead to more efficient interaction with the targets. The diversity of these motility patterns may be explained by an adaptive response to the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). Indeed, depending on the ECM composition, lymphocytes either display a floating motility without attaching to the ECM, or sliding and stepping motility with respectively continuous or discontinuous attachment to the ECM, or pivoting behaviour with sustained attachment to the ECM. Moreover, on the long term, lymphocytes either perform a persistent random walk or a Brownian-like movement depending on the ECM composition. How the ECM affects cell motility is still incompletely understood. Here, we integrate essential mechanistic details of the lymphocyte-matrix adhesions and lymphocyte intrinsic cytoskeletal induced cell propulsion into a Cellular Potts model (CPM). We show that the combination of <i>de novo</i> cell-matrix adhesion formation, adhesion growth and shrinkage, adhesion rupture, and feedback of adhesions onto cell propulsion recapitulates multiple lymphocyte behaviours, for different lymphocyte subsets and various substrates. With an increasing attachment area and increased adhesion strength, the cells’ speed and persistence decreases. Additionally, the model predicts random walks with short-term persistent but long-term subdiffusive properties resulting in a pivoting type of motility. For small adhesion areas, the spatial distribution of adhesions emerges as a key factor influencing cell motility. Small adhesions at the front allow for more persistent motility than larger clusters at the back, despite a similar total adhesion area. In conclusion, we present an integrated framework to simulate the effects of ECM proteins on cell-matrix adhesion dynamics. The model reveals a sufficient set of principles explaining the plasticity of lymphocyte motility.

Is there any research that should not be done? Could you think of an experiment and then decide not to do it? These questions get to the heart of the power of modern genetics to mix up and alter genes.

Is there any research you think should not be done? Can you imagine deciding not to do an experiment? This Perspective article explores controversial experiments in the past and today, and what should be done.

                Background : The bauxite mining area on Bintan Island continues to expand into the mangrove forest area. Mangrove forests have ecological, economic, and social importance, which must be managed accordingly to maintain their sustainability. This research was conducted to examine the sustainability of mangrove forest management in the former bauxite mining area on Bintan Island.                                                         Methods: The approach used is Multi Dimensional Scaling- Rapid Appraisal for Sustainability through the modified Rapfish ordinance software technique for the Mangrove Ecosystem. The type of data used is quantitative, covering five dimensions of sustainability, namely ecological, economic, social, legal and institutional as well as technology.                                                                                                        Results: The results showed that the sustainability index status of the ecological, social, legal and institutional dimensions was quite sustainable, while the sustainability index of the economic dimension was unsustainable, and the technological dimension was less sustainable. Attributes of levers that are sensitive to the sustainability of mangrove forest management are: 1) Mangrove density, 2) Substrate fraction, 3) sedimentation, 4) Mangrove importance index, 5) Bio-concentration factor, 6) Benefit value direct, 7) Indirect benefit value, 8) Dependence on mangrove forest as a source of livelihood, 9) Corporate Social Responsibility funding support, 10) Community income, 11) Community health level, 12) Community perception, 13) Legality of mangrove area and mining, 14) Pollution monitoring technology in ex-mining areas and 15) Mangrove rehabilitation technology.                                                                                          Conclusions:The status of the mangrove forest sustainability index on Bintan Island is quite good. the economic and technological dimensions can be upgraded to sustainable status by carrying out management that is more focused on the lever attributes of the ecological, social, legal and institutional dimensions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Association of women’s literacy and children’s mortality rate among countries in southeast Asia 2015-2019: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Women’s literacy is often associated with the health status of family members, especially children. Unfortunately, in some regions of Southeast Asia, the rates of women’s literacy are still very low, and in these areas, children’s mortality rates are also very high. This study aims to identify the association of women's literacy and children’s mortality rates among countries in the Southeast Asian region from 2015 to 2019. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, children’s mortality rates were defined as mortality rates in newborns and under-fives. Besides women’s literacy (WL), we also assessed the Human Development Index (HDI), Freedom Status (FS), Government Effectiveness (GE), and the proportion of births assisted by skilled health staff (BASHS) as the independent variables in this study. First, we describe the profiles of WL as well as newborn and under-five mortality rates among 11 countries in Southeast Asia from 2015 to 2019, and then we assess the correlations. Results: Between 2015 to 2019, Myanmar, Lao, and Timor-Leste had the highest child mortality rates. In addition, these four countries were the countries with the lowest WL rates compared to other countries. Children’s mortality rates were significantly associated with WL, GE, HDI, and BASHS. Meanwhile, this study found that the FS of a country was not significantly associated with the children’s mortality rate of countries in the Southeast Asia region. Conclusion: This study found that there’s an indication that the better the WL rate, as well as the governance, the HDI, and maternity services in a country, the lower its children’s mortality rates. Therefore, improvement in multiple sectors such as governance, economy, health system, education, and gender equality is required to help countries in this region achieve the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals target by 2030.

                Since thousands of years ago, oral sex has become part of sexual behavior among humans. Oral sex is considered taboo. Its taboo does not lie in the behavior, but its expression is deemed inappropriate. As technology becomes more sophisticated, human rights also stand out, leading to the disclosure of the practice in the 21st century. The oral sex that is discussed on a large scale in media encourages people to express it as feedback whether within right or not. It all depends on the value of each people. We found that this sexual behavior is found everywhere regardless of religion, culture, and race. Pop culture influences this behavior so much, it can be seen from music, movies, and television programs that provoke oral sex. Many motivations underlying this behavior include getting sexual pleasure for the sake of living well-being. But it is undeniable that this behavior is still controversial. It could be at risk of causing disease and, on the other hand, is reported to provide many benefits.  According to our theory, oral sex is not a new behavior crossing boundaries. It is just an old behavior that surfaces because of the factors that support it. This behavior, which is still considered taboo, has its disadvantages such as sexually transmitted disease but has also benefits such as preventing preeclampsia.

                Ovaries can be an elective metastatic site for many cancers mostly in gastrointestinal tract, breast and endometrial cancers. Gallbladder and bile ducts cancers are rare, accounting for few ovarian metastatic tumors. We report a case of bilateral metastatic ovarian of gallbladder carcinoma in a 44 years old woman. Patient had pelvic pain, anorexia, weight loss and decreased visual acuity. Imagery showed bilateral ovarian tumor and polyp in the gallbladder.  Furthermore, there were metastasis to the liver, lungs and choroid plexus. Liver biopsy confirmed the metastatic origin from gallbladder cancer. Patient underwent surgery. She had total hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy, omentectomy and cholecystectomy.  She passed away six months later, after refusing additional adjuvant therapy.

A consecutive sample of 54 malnourished cases aged 5-10 years and presented to the Outpatient Clinic of Pediatric Dentistry Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University across 6 months period were examined for HSPM, MIH – using the  European Academy of Pediatric Dentistry criteria - and dental Caries using def/ DMF indices. Outcomes were the presence or absence of MIH and HSPM and their levels measured as percentage as well as Caries Indices. Exposures were types of malnutrition and the socioeconomic status.  Results:  The mean age of study participants was 7.10 ± 1.34 years. HSPM and MIH were found in 47.2% and 45.2% of the study participants respectively, while dental caries was observed in 83% and 64.3% for primary and permanent teeth respectively. There was co-occurrence between HSPM and MIH in 39% of the cases. HSPM level was significantly different in various types of malnutrition. It showed significant difference between the stunted group (median HSPM of 14.2%) and the overweight or obese group (median HSPM of 0.0%) (P value 0.01). MIH level showed significant differences between the stunted group (median MIH of 19.4%) and overweight or obese group (median MIH of 0.0%) (p value 0.001), as well as between the stunted group (median MIH of 19.4%) and wasted group (median MIH of 0.0%) (p value 0.025). Conclusions: Malnourished children have high prevalence of dental abnormalities. HSPM could expect the presence of MIH.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Students’ perception of online learning amidst the Covid-19 pandemic: A study of junior, senior high school and college students in a remote area [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about many changes in all sectors of life, especially in the field of education. These changes aim to make the learning process more effective in the pandemic environment. However, it can be challenging, as some students do not give positive responses to these changes, especially those in remote areas. This article aims to identify and report students' perceptions about the effectiveness of online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic in the remote North Tapanuli region of Indonesia. Methods: In this study, data were obtained using an online survey involving 30 students from three levels of education, namely junior high school, senior high school, and college. They are students who the teacher appoints as class administrators; through them, the teacher communicates about everything—learning activities. So compared to his other friends, they know more about the implementation of online learning during the covid 19 pandemic. In addition, schools in remote areas have fewer students than schools in big cities. So we conclude that this research is considered representative with thirty students as the sample. The data gathered from the survey were analyzed using quantitative descriptive methods. Results: Results show that online learning is considered less effective by students in remote areas; this happens because communication networks and infrastructure do not adequately support them to follow online learning. Conclusion: Teachers need to evaluate how to teach as well as re-design models and approaches to be applied in learning. This can be achieved by adjusting to the student’s current situation to generate interest and willingness to learn online.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Polygenic Risk Score in African populations: progress and challenges [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) analysis is a method that predicts the genetic risk of an individual towards targeted traits. Even when there are no significant markers, it gives evidence of a genetic effect beyond the results of Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). Moreover, it selects  single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that  contribute to the disease with low effect size  making it more precise at individual level risk prediction. PRS  analysis addresses the shortfall of GWAS by taking into account the SNPs/alleles with  low effect size but play an indispensable role to the observed phenotypic/trait variance.  PRS analysis has  applications that investigate the genetic basis of several traits, which includes rare diseases. However, the accuracy of PRS analysis depends on the genomic data of the underlying population. For instance, several studies  show   that obtaining higher prediction power of PRS analysis is challenging for non-Europeans. In this manuscript, we review the conventional PRS methods and their application to sub-Saharan African communities. We conclude that  lack of sufficient GWAS data and tools is  the limiting factor of applying PRS analysis to sub-Saharan populations.   We recommend developing Africa-specific PRS methods and tools for estimating and analyzing  African population data   for clinical  evaluation of PRSs of interest and predicting  rare diseases.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Decision making resides at the interface between sensory perception and movement production. Female songbirds in the context of mate choice are an excellent system to define neural circuits through which sensory perception influences production of courtship behaviors. Previous experiments by our group and others have implicated secondary auditory brain sites, including the caudal nidopallium (NC), in mediating behavioral indicators of mate choice. Here, we used anterograde tracer molecules to define projections that emerge from NC in female songbirds, identifying pathways through which NC influences downstream sites implicated in signal processing and decision making. Our results reveal that NC sends projections into the arcopallium, including the ventral intermediate arcopallium (AIV). Previous work revealed that AIV also receives input from another auditory area implicated in song preference and mate choice (caudal mesopallium, CM), suggesting that convergent input from multiple auditory areas may play important roles in initiating mate choice behaviors. In the present results, NC projects to an area implicated in postural and locomotory control (dorsal arcopallium, Ad), suggesting that NC may play a role in directing those forms of copulatory behavior. NC projections also systematically avoid a vocal motor region of the arcopallium that is innervated by CM (robust nucleus of the arcopallium). These results suggest a model in which both NC and CM project to arcopallial pathways implicated in behavioral motivation. These brain regions may exert different influences on pathways through which auditory information can direct different facets of behavioral responses to information detected in those auditory signals.</p>

                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 14 February 2022; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28439-w">doi:10.1038/s41467-022-28439-w</a></p>Construction of chiral organosilicon compounds could have implications in photophysical, biological, and chemical fields, as silicon is isoelectronic with carbon, and can mimic carbon atoms while providing slightly different properties. Here the authors present an intermolecular, enantioselective C–H silylation of heterocycles via rhodium catalysis.

They find that the highly conserved free fatty acid binding pocket (FABP) can function as an allosteric regulator, enabling adaptation of immunogenicity via binding of proinflammatory free fatty acids and mediating the spike open to-closed equilibrium.
