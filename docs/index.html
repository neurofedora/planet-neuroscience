              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Asynchronous excitatory neuron development in an isogenic cortical spheroid model of Down syndrome</a></h4>

              
                The intellectual disability (ID) in Down syndrome (DS) is thought to result from a variety of developmental deficits such as alterations in neural progenitor division, neurogenesis, gliogenesis, cortical architecture, and reduced cortical volume. However, the molecular processes underlying these neurodevelopmental changes are still elusive, preventing an understanding of the mechanistic basis of ID in DS. In this study, we used a pair of isogenic (trisomic and euploid) induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines to generate cortical spheroids (CS) that model the impact of trisomy 21 on brain development. CS contain neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes and they are widely used to approximate early neurodevelopment. Using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we uncovered cell type-specific transcriptomic changes in the trisomic CS. In particular, we found that excitatory neuron populations were most affected and that a specific population of cells with a transcriptomic profile resembling layer IV cortical neurons displayed the most profound divergence in developmental trajectory between trisomic and euploid genotypes. We also identified candidate genes potentially driving the developmental asynchrony between trisomic and euploid excitatory neurons. Direct comparison between the current isogenic CS scRNA-seq data and previously published datasets revealed several recurring differentially expressed genes between DS and control samples. Altogether, our study highlights the power and importance of cell type-specific analyses within a defined genetic background, coupled with broader examination of mixed samples, to comprehensively evaluate cellular phenotypes in the context of DS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Coordinated control of neuronal differentiation and wiring by a sustained code of transcription factors</a></h4>

              
                The enormous diversity of cell types in nervous systems presents a challenge in identifying the genetic mechanisms that encode it. Here, we report that nearly 200 distinct neurons in the Drosophila visual system can each be defined by unique combinations of ~10 transcription factors that are continuously expressed by them. We show that targeted modifications of this "selector" code induce predictable conversions of cell fates between neurons in vivo. These conversions appear morphologically and transcriptionally complete, arguing for a conserved gene regulatory program that jointly instructs both the type-specific development and the terminal features of neurons. Cis-regulatory sequence analysis of open chromatin links one of these selectors to an upstream patterning gene in stem cells that specifies neuronal fates. Experimentally validated network models show that selectors interact with ecdysone signaling to regulate downstream effectors controlling brain wiring. Our results provide a generalizable framework of how specific fates are initiated and maintained in postmitotic neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A role for the anterior hippocampus in autobiographical memory construction regardless of temporal distance</a></h4>

              
                Mounting evidence suggests distinct functional contributions of the anterior and posterior hippocampus to autobiographical memory retrieval, but how these subregions function under different retrieval demands as memories age is not yet understood. Specifically, autobiographical memory retrieval is not a homogenous process, rather, it is thought to consist of multiple stages: an early stage of memory construction and a later stage of detailed elaboration, which may differently engage the hippocampus over time. In the present study, we analyzed data from 40 participants who constructed and overtly elaborated upon recent and remote memories in response to picture cues in the fMRI scanner. We previously reported a temporal gradient in the posterior hippocampus during the elaboration period of autobiographical retrieval, with posterior hippocampal activation observed for recent but not remote timepoints. Here, we consider the previously unanalyzed construction stage of retrieval, where participants searched for and selected a memory. We found no evidence of a temporal gradient during memory construction, instead observing strong anterior hippocampus activity regardless of memory remoteness. Our findings suggest a unique contribution of the anterior hippocampus to the construction process of autobiographical retrieval over time. These findings highlight that retrieval processes, which have yet to be considered in current models of systems consolidation, offer novel insights to hippocampal subregion function over time.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Goal-driven optimization of single-neuron properties in artificial networks reveals regularization role of neural diversity and adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Individual neurons, and the circuits they collectively form in the brain, have been subject to joint evolutionary pressure to produce system-level functions. Considerable effort has been invested in understanding the impact of single-neuron input-output mechanisms, such as diversity in f-I curves and spike frequency adaptation, on network computations. Yet, how goal-driven requirements at the network level influence single-neuron coding properties remains largely unexplored. Toward addressing this, we systematically investigate single-neuron input-output adaptive mechanisms, optimized in an end-to-end fashion in artificial recurrent neural networks. This is achieved by interconnected Adaptive Recurrent Units (ARU), which perform online control of a novel two-parameter family of activation functions mimicking the diversity of f-I curves found in common neural types in the brain. Our network of ARUs shows much-improved robustness to noise and changes in input statistics. Importantly, we find that ARUs recover precise biological coding strategies such as gain scaling and fractional order differentiation. Using tools from dynamical systems theory, we elucidate the role of these emergent single neuron properties and argue that neural diversity and adaption likely play an active regularization role that enables neural circuits to optimally propagate information across time. In doing so, we discuss how goal-driven optimization approaches, while not biologically plausible themselves, reveal neural mechanisms that are consistent with evolutionary pressures on the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamic tripartite construct of interregional engram circuits underlies forgetting of extinction memory</a></h4>

              
                Fear extinction allows for adaptive control of learned fear responses but often fails, resulting in a renewal or spontaneous recovery of the extinguished fear, i.e., forgetting of the extinction memory readily occurs. Using an activity-dependent neuronal labeling strategy, we demonstrate that engram neurons for fear extinction memory are dynamically positioned in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), basolateral amygdala (BLA), and ventral hippocampus (vHPC), which constitute an engram construct in the term of directional engram synaptic connectivity from the BLA or vHPC to mPFC, but not that in the opposite direction, for retrieval of extinction memory. Fear renewal or spontaneous recovery switches the extinction engram construct from an accessible to inaccessible state, whereas additional extinction learning or optogenetic induction of long-term potentiation restores the directional engram connectivity and prevents the return of fear. Thus, the plasticity of engram construct underlies forgetting of extinction memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modelling mouse auditory response dynamics along a continuum of consciousness using a deep recurrent neural network</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Understanding neurophysiological changes that accompany transitions between anaesthetized and conscious states is a key objective of anesthesiology and consciousness science. This study aimed to characterize the dynamics of auditory-evoked potential morphology in mice along a continuum of consciousness. Approach: Epidural field potentials were recorded from above the primary auditory cortices of two groups of laboratory mice: urethane-anaesthetized (A, n = 14) and conscious (C, n = 17). Both groups received auditory stimulation in the form of a repeated pure-tone stimulus, before and after receiving 10 mg/kg i.p. ketamine (AK and CK). Evoked responses were then ordered by ascending sample entropy into AK, A, CK, and C, considered to reflect physiological correlates of awareness. These data were used to train a recurrent neural network (RNN) with an input parameter encoding state. Model outputs were compared with grand-average event-related potential (ERP) waveforms. Subsequently, the state parameter was varied to simulate changes in the ERP that occur during transitions between states, and relationships with dominant peak amplitudes were quantified. Main results: The RNN synthesized output waveforms that were in close agreement with grand-average ERPs for each group (r2 > 0.9, p < 0.0001). Varying the input state parameter generated model outputs reflecting changes in ERP morphology predicted to occur between states. Positive peak amplitudes within 25 to 50 ms, and negative peak amplitudes within 50 to 75 ms post-stimulus-onset, were found to display a sigmoidal characteristic during the transition from anaesthetized to conscious states. In contrast, negative peak amplitudes within 0 to 25 ms displayed greater linearity. Significance: This study demonstrates a method for modelling changes in ERP morphology that accompany transitions between states of consciousness using a RNN. In future studies, this approach may be applied to human data to support the clinical use of ERPs to predict transition to consciousness.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Recurrent neural network model of human event-related potentials in response to intensity oddball stimulation</a></h4>

              
                The mismatch negativity (MMN) component of the human event-related potential (ERP) is frequently interpreted as a sensory prediction-error signal. However, there is ambiguity concerning the neurophysiology underlying hypothetical prediction and prediction-error signalling components, and whether these can be dissociated from overlapping obligatory components of the ERP that are sensitive to physical properties of sounds. In the present study, a hierarchical recurrent neural network (RNN) was fitted to ERP data from 38 subjects. After training the model to reproduce ERP waveforms evoked by 80 dB standard and 70 dB deviant stimuli, it was used to simulate a response to 90 dB deviant stimuli. Internal states of the RNN effectively combine to generate synthetic ERPs, where individual hidden units are loosely analogous to population-level sources. Model behaviour was characterised using principal component analysis of stimulus condition, layer, and individual unit responses. Hidden units were categorised according to their temporal response fields, and statistically significant differences among stimulus conditions were observed for amplitudes of units peaking in the 0 to 75 ms (P50), 75 to 125 ms (N1), and 250 to 400 ms (N3) latency ranges, surprisingly not including the measurement window of MMN. The model demonstrated opposite polarity changes in MMN amplitude produced by falling (70 dB) and rising (90 dB) intensity deviant stimuli, consistent with loudness dependence of sensory ERP components. Although perhaps less parsimoniously, these observations could be interpreted within the context of predictive coding theory, as examples of negative and positive prediction errors, respectively.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">NMDA-receptor-Fc-fusion constructs neutralize anti- NMDA receptor antibodies</a></h4>

              
                N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is the most common subtype of autoimmune encephalitis characterized by a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome ranging from memory impairment and psychosis to coma. Patients develop an intrathecal immune response against NMDARs with antibodies that presumably bind to the amino-terminal domain (ATD) of the GluN1 subunit. The therapeutic response to immunotherapy is often delayed and does not directly interfere with intrathecal synthesis of pathogenic antibodies. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches for fast neutralization of NMDAR antibodies are needed. Here, we developed fusion constructs consisting of the Fc part of immunoglobulin G and the ATDs of either GluN1 or GluN2B or both, GluN1 and GluN2B, subunits. Surprisingly, both subunits were required to generate high-affinity epitopes. The construct with both subunits efficiently prevented NMDAR binding of patient-derived monoclonal antibodies and of patient cerebrospinal fluid containing high-titer NMDAR antibodies. Furthermore, it inhibited the internalization of NMDARs in rodent dissociated neurons and human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived neurons. Finally, the construct stabilized NMDAR currents recorded in rodent neurons. Our results demonstrate that both GluN1 and GluN2B subunits contribute to the main immunogenic region of the NMDAR and provide a promising strategy for fast and specific treatment of NMDAR encephalitis, which can complement immunotherapy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Learning to suppress likely distractor locations in visual search is driven by the local distractor frequency</a></h4>

              
                Salient but task-irrelevant distractors interfere less with visual search when they appear in a display region where distractors have appeared more frequently in the past ('distractor-location probability cueing'). This effect could reflect the (re-)distribution of a global, limited attentional 'inhibition resource'. Accordingly, changing the frequency of distractor appearance in one display region should also affect the magnitude of interference generated by distractors in a different region. Alternatively, distractor-location learning may reflect a local response (e.g., 'habituation') to distractors occurring at a particular location. In this case, the local distractor frequency in one display region should not affect distractor interference in a different region. To decide between these alternatives, we conducted three experiments in which participants searched for an orientation-defined target while ignoring a more salient orientation distractor that occurred more often in one vs. another display region. Experiment 1 varied the ratio of distractors appearing in the frequent vs. rare regions (60/40-90/10), with a fixed global distractor frequency. The results revealed the cueing effect to increase with increasing probability ratio. In Experiments 2 and 3, one ('test') region was assigned the same local distractor frequency as in one of the conditions of Experiment 1, but a different frequency in the other region - dissociating local from global distractor frequency. Together, the three experiments showed that distractor interference in the test region was not significantly influenced by the frequency in the other region, consistent with purely local learning. We discuss the implications for theories of statistical distractor-location learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hippocampal cAMP-dependent synaptic potentiation, ERK-dependent immediate-early gene activation, and context-dependent fear conditioning in mice are linked through dependence on the guanine nucleotide exchange factor RapGEF2</a></h4>

              
                The MAP kinase ERK is important for neuronal plasticity underlying associative learning, yet specific molecular pathways for ERK activation in hippocampus are still largely undetermined. RapGEF2 has emerged as a neuron-specific cAMP sensor that mediates ERK activation. We investigated whether RapGEF2 might also be required for cAMP-dependent ERK activation leading to synaptic potentiation, and how this involvement might be penetrant to hippocampus-dependent learned behavior. We demonstrate that conditional knockout of Rapgef2 in forebrain neurons, specifically in dentate gyrus and CA1 of the hippocampus, leads to an attenuation of context-dependent fear conditioning, but not of cue-dependent fear conditioning, in mice. RapGEF2 knockout is associated with a reduction in cAMP-dependent synaptic potentiation at two central hippocampal synapses-the entorhinal cortex- granule cell synapse and the CA3- CA1 synapse. Furthermore, cAMP-induced postsynaptic potentiation requires both RapGEF2 and activation of ERK. Induction of Egr-1/Zif268 (and pERK), but not of c-Fos, immediately following fear conditioning, was abolished in CA1 and detate gyrus, in the absence of RapGEF2 expression in these hippocampal regions, thus revealing a link between learning (conditioning) and molecular pathways activated during conditioned fear memory formation. Hence, we suggest that contextual fear conditioning is mediated via RapGEF2-dependent ERK activation and downstream induction of Egr-1, via an underlying mechanism of cAMP-dependent long-term potentiation at hippocampal synapses. Cyclic AMP-dependent GEFs have been genetically associated as risk factors for schizophrenia, a disorder associated with cognitive deficits. This study provides a functional link between one of these cAMP-dependent GEFs, RapGEF2, and cognitive processes involved in associative learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Explaining and Predicting the Effects of Neurostimulation via Neuronal Excitation/Inhibition</a></h4>

              
                Previous research has highlighted the role of the excitation/inhibition ratio (E/I) for typical and atypical development, mental health, cognition, and learning. Parallel research has highlighted the benefits of high-frequency random noise stimulation (tRNS), an excitatory form of neurostimulation, on learning. We examined the E/I as a potential mechanism and whether tRNS effect on learning depends on E/I as measured by the aperiodic exponent. In addition to manipulating E/I using tRNS, we also manipulated the level of learning (learning/overlearning) that has been shown to influence E/I. One hundred and two participants received either sham stimulation or 20 min DLPFC tRNS during a mathematical learning task. We showed a lower aperiodic exponent, which reflects higher E/I, after tRNS, and that higher baseline aperiodic exponent, which reflects lower E/I, predicted greater benefit from tRNS specifically for the learning task. In contrast to previous MRS-based E/I studies, we found no effect of the learning manipulation on E/I. Our results highlight the role of E/I as a marker for neurostimulation efficacy and learning. This mechanistic understanding could provide stronger potential to augment learning. At the same time, we offer new insights on the quantification of E/I using EEG vs MRS to foster better theoretical understanding and its utilisation in future research.

                Healthy ageing is commonly accompanied by cognitive decline affecting several domains such as executive control, whereas certain verbal skills remain relatively preserved. Interestingly, recent scientific research has shown that some intellectual activities may be linked to beneficial effects, delaying or even alleviating cognitive decline in the elderly. Thirty young (age: M = 23) and thirty old (age: M = 66) adults were assessed in executive control (switching) and literacy experience (print exposure). First, we tried to confirm whether healthy ageing was generally associated with deficits in switching by looking at mixing cost effects, to then investigate if individual differences in print exposure explained variation in that age-related mixing costs. Both accuracy and reaction times mixing cost indexes demonstrated larger cost in old (but not in young) adults when switching from local to global information. More importantly, this cost effect disappeared in old adults with higher print exposure (reaction times). Our findings suggest literacy experience accumulated across the life-span may act as a cognitive reserve proxy to prevent executive control decline.

                The axon initial segment (AIS) is a critical locus of control of action potential (AP) generation and neuronal information synthesis. Concussive traumatic brain injury gives rise to diffuse axotomy, and the majority of neocortical axonal injury arises at the AIS. Consequently, concussive traumatic brain injury might profoundly disrupt the functional specialization of this region. To investigate this hypothesis, one and two days after mild central fluid percussion injury in Thy1-YFP-H mice, we recorded high-resolution APs from axotomized and adjacent intact layer 5 pyramidal neurons and applied a second derivative (2o) analysis to measure the AIS- and soma-regional contributions to the AP upstroke. All layer 5 pyramidal neurons recorded from sham animals manifested two stark 2o peaks separated by a negative intervening slope. In contrast, within injured mice, we discovered a subset of axotomized layer 5 pyramidal neurons in which the AIS-regional 2o peak was abolished, a functional perturbation associated with diminished excitability, axonal sprouting and distention of the AIS as assessed by staining for ankyrin-G. Our analysis revealed an additional subpopulation of both axotomized and intact layer 5 pyramidal neurons that manifested a melding together of the AIS- and soma-regional 2o peaks, suggesting a more subtle aberration of sodium channel function and/or translocation of the AIS initiation zone closer to the soma. When these experiments were repeated in animals in which cyclophilin-D was knocked out, these effects were ameliorated, suggesting that trauma-induced AIS functional perturbation is associated with mitochondrial calcium dysregulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The contribution of Neanderthal introgression and natural selection to neurodegenerative diseases</a></h4>

              
                Background: Humans are thought to be more susceptible to neurodegeneration than equivalently-aged primates. It is not known whether this vulnerability is specific to anatomically-modern humans or shared with other hominids. The contribution of introgressed Neanderthal DNA to neurodegenerative disorders remains uncertain. It is also unclear how common variants associated with neurodegenerative disease risk are maintained by natural selection in the population despite their deleterious effects. In this study, we aimed to quantify the genome-wide contribution of Neanderthal introgression and positive selection to the heritability of complex neurodegenerative disorders to address these questions. Methods: We used stratified-linkage disequilibrium score regression to investigate the relationship between five SNP-based signatures of natural selection, reflecting different timepoints of evolution, and genome-wide associated variants of the three most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders: Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Results: We found a significant depletion of positively-selected SNPs in the heritability of Parkinson's disease, raising the possibility that these variants may modulate disease risk, in addition to conferring an evolutionary advantage. For Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, common deleterious disease variants are unlikely to be maintained by positive selection. There was no enrichment of Neanderthal introgression in the SNP-heritability of these disorders, suggesting that Neanderthal admixture is unlikely to have contributed to disease risk. Conclusions: These findings provide insight into the origins of neurodegenerative disorders within the evolution of Homo sapiens and addresses a long-standing debate, showing that Neanderthal admixture is unlikely to have contributed to common genetic risk of neurodegeneration in anatomically-modern humans.

                Neuronal activity and neurotransmitter release cause use-dependent decline in protein function. However, it is unclear how this is coupled to local protein turnover and quality control mechanisms. Here we show that the endocytic protein Endophilin-A (EndoA/ENDOA1) couples activity-induced calcium influx to synaptic autophagy and neuronal survival. We identify single mutations in the EndoA flexible region that either increases EndoA diffusion and promotes autophagosome formation in the absence of calcium, or immobilizes EndoA and blocks autophagy, even in the presence of calcium. Hence, the EndoA flexible region is a switch that responds to calcium, regulating EndoA nanoscale synaptic organization and association with autophagosomes driving their formation. Interestingly, a pathogenic variant in the human ENDOA1 variable region that confers risk to Parkinson s disease (PD), also confines ENDOA1 to the synaptic plasma membrane and equally blocks autophagy in flies in vivo and in induced human neurons. Thus, our work reveals a mechanism neurons use to connect neuronal activity to local protein turnover by autophagy, which is critical for neuronal survival.

                Different sleep states have been shown to be vital for a variety of brain function, including learning, memory, and skill consolidation. However, our understanding of neural dynamics during sleep and the role of prominent LFP frequency bands remain incomplete. To discern changes between different behavioral states we collected multichannel LFP and spike data in primary motor cortex of unconstrained macaques for up to 24 hours using the Neurochip3. Each 8 second bin of time was classified into awake and moving (Move), awake and at rest (Rest), REM sleep (REM), or non-REM sleep (NREM) by using dimensionality reduction and clustering on the average spectral density and the acceleration of the head. LFP power showed high delta during NREM, high theta during REM, and high beta when the animal was awake. Cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling typically showed higher coupling for deeper sleep between all pairs of frequency bands except for high delta-high gamma and theta-high gamma coupling during Move, and high theta-beta coupling during REM. Sorted single units showed decreased firing rate with deeper sleep, though with higher, bursty patterns during NREM compared to other states. Spike-LFP synchrony showed high delta synchrony during Move, and higher coupling with all other frequency bands during NREM. These results altogether are consistent with previous findings showing reactivation of cortical circuitry activated during the day, which may be driven by the delta band LFP.

                Myelination depends on maintenance of oligodendrocytes that arise from oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). We show that the dynamic nature of oligodendroglia and myelination are regulated by the circadian transcription factor BMAL1. Bmal1 knockdown in OPCs during development, but not adulthood, decreases OPC proliferation, whereas BMAL1 regulates OPC morphology throughout life. OPC-specific Bmal1 deficiency impairs remyelination in an age-dependent manner, suggesting that age-associated decrements in circadian regulation of oligodendroglia may contribute to the deficient remyelination potential in demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS). This oligodendroglial dysregulation and dysmyelination increase sleep fragmentation in OPC-specific Bmal1 knockout mice, and sleep fragmentation is causally associated with MS. These findings have broad mechanistic and therapeutic implications for numerous brain disorders that include both myelin and sleep phenotypes.

                Fragile X patients and mice lacking the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) suffer from multiple behavioral alterations, including deficits in motor learning. We found that enhanced synaptic vesicle (SV) docking in cerebellar parallel fiber to Purkinje cell Fmr1KO synapses was associated with enhanced asynchronous release, which not only occludes further potentiation, but it also compromises presynaptic parallel fiber long-term potentiation (PF-LTP). A reduction in extracellular Ca2+ restored the readily releasable pool (RRP) size, rescuing {beta} adrenergic receptor-mediated potentiation and parallel fiber LTP. Interestingly, VU 0155041, a selective positive allosteric modulator of mGluR4, also restored both the RRP size and parallel fiber LTP. Moreover, when injected into Fmr1KO mice, VU 0155041 improved motor learning in skilled reaching, classical eyeblink conditioning and vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) tests, as well as improving the social behavior of these mice. Thus, pharmacological activation of mGluRs may offer therapeutic relief for motor learning and social deficits in Fragile X Syndrome.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Features Underlying the Memorability of Objects</a></h4>

              
                Despite decades of study of memory, it remains unclear what makes an image memorable. There is considerable debate surrounding the underlying determinants of memory, including the roles of semantic (e.g., animacy, utility) and visual features (e.g., brightness) as well as whether the most prototypical or most atypical items are best remembered. Prior studies have relied on constrained stimulus sets, limiting any generalized view of the features that may contribute to memory. Here, we collected over one million memory ratings (N=13,946) for THINGS (Hebart et al., 2019), a naturalistic dataset of 26,107 object images designed to comprehensively sample concrete objects. First, we establish a model of object features that is predictive of image memorability, capturing over half of the explainable variance. For this model, we find that semantic features have a stronger influence than visual features on what people will remember. Second, we examined whether memorability could be accounted for by the typicality of the objects, by comparing human behavioral data, object feature dimensions, and deep neural network features. While prototypical objects tend to be the most memorable, the relationship between memorability and typicality is more complex than a simple positive or negative association and typicality alone cannot account for memorability.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">DeepSlice: rapid fully automatic registration of mouse brain imaging to a volumetric atlas</a></h4>

              
                Registration of data to a common frame of reference is an essential step in the analysis and integration of diverse neuroscientific data modalities. To this end, volumetric brain atlases enable histological datasets to be spatially registered and analysed, yet accurate registration remains expertise-dependent and slow. We have trained a neural network, DeepSlice, to register mouse brain histology to the Allen Brain Atlas, retaining accuracy while improving speed by >1000 fold.

	<p>Anxiety disorder impacts the quality of life of the patients. The 95% ethanol extract of rhizomes and roots of Valeriana jatamansi Jones (Zhi zhu xiang, ZZX) has previously been shown to be effective for the treatment of anxiety disorder. In this study, the dose ratio of each component of the anxiolytic compounds group (ACG) in a 95% ethanol extract of ZZX was optimized by a uniform design experiment and mathematical modeling. The anxiolytic effect of ACG was verified by behavioral experiments and biochemical index measurement. Network pharmacology was used to determine potential action targets, as well as predict biological processes and signaling pathways, which were then verified by molecular docking analysis. Metabolomics was then used to screen and analyze metabolites in the rat hippocampus before and after the administration of ZZX-ACG. Finally, the results of metabolomics and network pharmacology were integrated to clarify the anti-anxiety mechanism of the ACG. The optimal dose ratio of ACG in 95% ethanol extract of ZZX was obtained, and our results suggest that ACG may regulate ALB, AKT1, PTGS2, CYP3A4, ESR1, CASP3, CYP2B6, EGFR, SRC, MMP9, IGF1, and MAPK8, as well as the prolactin signaling pathway, estrogen signaling pathway, and arachidonic acid metabolism pathway, thus affecting the brain neurotransmitters and HPA axis hormone levels to play an anxiolytic role, directly or indirectly.</p>

	<p>Preclinical evidence suggests a main role of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) signaling in drug addiction. Recently, we reported alterations in the plasma concentrations of LPA species in patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD). As there are sex differences in drug addiction, the main aim of the present study was to investigate whether relevant LPA species (16:0-LPA, 18:0-LPA, 18:1-LPA, 18:2-LPA and 20:4-LPA) were associated with sex and/or substance use disorder (SUD). This exploratory study was conducted in 214 abstinent patients with lifetime SUD, and 91 healthy control subjects. The SUD group was divided according to the diagnosis of AUD and/or cocaine use disorder (CUD). Participants were clinically assessed, and plasma samples were collected to determine LPA species and total LPA. We found that LPA concentrations were significantly affected by sex, and women showed higher concentrations than men. In addition, there were significantly lower 16:0-LPA, 18:2-LPA and total LPA concentrations in patients with SUD than in controls. Namely, patients with CUD and AUD + CUD showed lower LPA concentrations than controls or patients with AUD. In conclusion, our data suggest that LPA species could be potential biomarkers for SUD in women and men, which could contribute to a better stratification of these patients in treatment programs.</p>

	<p>Many people are affected by tinnitus, a sensation of ringing in the ear despite the absence of external sound. Goshajinkigan (GJG) is one of the formulations of Japanese traditional herbal medicine and is prescribed for the palliative treatment of patients with tinnitus. Although GJG is clinically effective in these patients, its behavioral effects and the underlying neuroanatomical substrate have not been modeled in animals. We modeled tinnitus using salicylate-treated rats, demonstrated the effectiveness of GJG on tinnitus, and examined the underlying neuronal substrate with c-Fos expression. Intraperitoneal injection of sodium salicylate (400 mg/kg) into rats for three consecutive days significantly increased false positive scores, which were used to assess tinnitus behavior. When GJG was orally administered one hour after each salicylate injection, the increase in tinnitus behavior was suppressed. The analysis of c-Fos expression in auditory-related brain areas revealed that GJG significantly reduced the salicylate-induced increase in the number of c-Fos-expressing cells in the auditory cortices, inferior colliculus, and dorsal cochlear nucleus. These results suggest a suppressive effect of GJG on salicylate-induced tinnitus in animal models.</p>

	<p>A growing body of research documents the persistence of physical and neuropsychiatric symptoms following the resolution of acute COVID-19 infection. To the best of our knowledge, no published study has examined the interaction between insomnia and mental health. Accordingly, we proposed to examine new diagnoses of insomnia, and referrals to pulmonary and sleep medicine clinics for treatment of sleep disorders, in patients presenting to one post-acute COVID-19 recovery clinic. Additionally, we aimed to examine the relationship between poor sleep quality, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress. Patients presented to the clinic on average 2 months following COVID-19 infection; 51.9% (n = 41) were hospitalized, 11.4% (n = 9) were in the intensive care unit, 2.5% (n = 2) were on a mechanical ventilator, and 38.0% (n = 30) were discharged on oxygen. The most commonly reported symptom was fatigue (88%, n = 70), with worse sleep following a COVID-19 infection reported in 50.6% (n = 40). The mean PSQI score was 9.7 (82.3%, n = 65 with poor sleep quality). The mean GAD-7 score was 8.3 (22.8%, n = 14 with severe depression). The mean PHQ-9 was 10.1 (17.8%, n = 18 with severe anxiety). The mean IES-6 was 2.1 (54.4%, n = 43 with post-traumatic stress). Poor sleep quality was significantly associated with increased severity of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress. Future work should follow patients longitudinally to examine if sleep, fatigue, and mental health symptoms improve over time.</p>

Sequence simulators are fundamental tools in bioinformatics, as they allow us to test data processing and inference tools, and are an essential component of some inference methods. The ongoing surge in available sequence data is however testing the limits of our bioinformatics software. One example is the large number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes available, which are beyond the processing power of many methods, and simulating such large datasets is also proving difficult. Here, we present a new algorithm and software for efficiently simulating sequence evolution along extremely large trees (e.g. > 100, 000 tips) when the branches of the tree are short, as is typical in genomic epidemiology. Our algorithm is based on the Gillespie approach, and it implements an efficient multi-layered search tree structure that provides high computational efficiency by taking advantage of the fact that only a small proportion of the genome is likely to mutate at each branch of the considered phylogeny. Our open source software allows easy integration with other Python packages as well as a variety of evolutionary models, including indel models and new hypermutability models that we developed to more realistically represent SARS-CoV-2 genome evolution.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Population heterogeneity in clinical cohorts affects the predictive accuracy of brain imaging</a></h4>

Brain imaging research enjoys increasing adoption of supervised machine learning for single-participant disease classification. Yet, the success of these algorithms likely depends on population diversity, including demographic differences and other factors that may be outside of primary scientific interest. Here, we capitalize on propensity scores as a composite confound index to quantify diversity due to major sources of population variation. We delineate the impact of population heterogeneity on the predictive accuracy and pattern stability in 2 separate clinical cohorts: the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE, <i>n</i> = 297) and the Healthy Brain Network (HBN, <i>n</i> = 551). Across various analysis scenarios, our results uncover the extent to which cross-validated prediction performances are interlocked with diversity. The instability of extracted brain patterns attributable to diversity is located preferentially in regions part of the default mode network. Collectively, our findings highlight the limitations of prevailing deconfounding practices in mitigating the full consequences of population diversity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Context coding in the mouse nucleus accumbens modulates motivationally relevant information</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jimmie M. Gmaz, Matthijs A. A. van der Meer</p>

Neural activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is thought to track fundamentally value-centric quantities linked to reward and effort. However, the NAc also contributes to flexible behavior in ways that are difficult to explain based on value signals alone, raising the question of if and how nonvalue signals are encoded in NAc. We recorded NAc neural ensembles while head-fixed mice performed an odor-based biconditional discrimination task where an initial discrete cue modulated the behavioral significance of a subsequently presented reward-predictive cue. We extracted single-unit and population-level correlates related to the cues and found value-independent coding for the initial, context-setting cue. This context signal occupied a population-level coding space orthogonal to outcome-related representations and was predictive of subsequent behaviorally relevant responses to the reward-predictive cues. Together, these findings support a gating model for how the NAc contributes to behavioral flexibility and provide a novel population-level perspective from which to view NAc computations.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Inequities in Therapy for Infantile Spasms: A Call to Action</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The aim of this study was to determine whether selection of treatment for children with infantile spasms (IS) varies by race/ethnicity.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The prospective US National Infantile Spasms Consortium database includes children with IS treated from 2012 to 2018. We examined the relationship between race/ethnicity and receipt of standard IS therapy (prednisolone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, vigabatrin), adjusting for demographic and clinical variables using logistic regression. Our primary outcome was <i>treatment course</i>, which considered therapy prescribed for the first and, when needed, the second IS treatment together.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 555 children, 324 (58%) were non-Hispanic white, 55 (10%) non-Hispanic Black, 24 (4%) non-Hispanic Asian, 80 (14%) Hispanic, and 72 (13%) other/unknown. Most (398, 72%) received a standard treatment course. Insurance type, geographic location, history of prematurity, prior seizures, developmental delay or regression, abnormal head circumference, hypsarrhythmia, and IS etiologies were associated with standard therapy. In adjusted models, non-Hispanic Black children had lower odds of receiving a standard treatment course compared with non-Hispanic white children (odds ratio [OR], 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.20–0.89; <i>p</i> = 0.02). Adjusted models also showed that children with public (vs. private) insurance had lower odds of receiving standard therapy for treatment 1 (OR, 0.42; CI, 0.21–0.84; <i>p</i> = 0.01).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Non-Hispanic Black children were more often treated with non-standard IS therapies than non-Hispanic white children. Likewise, children with public (vs. private) insurance were less likely to receive standard therapies. Investigating drivers of inequities, and understanding the impact of racism on treatment decisions, are critical next steps to improve care for patients with IS. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                Detecting the direction of motion underlies many visually guided behaviors, from reflexive eye movements to identifying and catching moving objects. A subset of motion sensitive cells are direction selective – responding strongly to motion in one direction and weakly to motion in other directions. In mammals, direction-selective cells are found throughout the visual system, including the retina, superior colliculus, and primary visual cortex. Direction selectivity maps are well characterized in the mouse retina, where the preferred directions of retinal direction-selective cells follow the projections of optic flow, generated by the movements animals make as they navigate their environment.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Ripple-selective GABAergic projection cells in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Szabo et al. identify a subset of hippocampal GABAergic cells with long-range projections and unique activity dynamics. Theta-OFF/ripple-ON (TORO) cells are virtually silent during locomotion and REM sleep theta but fire vigorously during sharp-wave ripples. TORO cells receive CA3 glutamatergic, septal GABAergic, and inhibitory cholinergic inputs and target interneurons.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Doublecortin engages the microtubule lattice through a cooperative binding mode involving its C-terminal domain</a></h4>

              
                Doublecortin (DCX) is a microtubule (MT) associated protein that regulates MT structure and function during neuronal development and mutations in DCX lead to a spectrum of neurological disorders. The structural properties of MT-bound DCX that explain these disorders are incompletely determined. Here, we describe the molecular architecture of the DCX-MT complex through an integrative modeling approach that combines data from X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM and a high-fidelity chemical crosslinking method. We demonstrate that DCX interacts with MTs through its N-terminal domain and induces a lattice-dependent self-association involving the C-terminal structured domain and its disordered tail, in a conformation that favors an open, domain-swapped state. The networked state can accommodate multiple different attachment points on the MT lattice, all of which orient the C-terminal tails away from the lattice. As numerous disease mutations cluster in the C-terminus, and regulatory phosphorylations cluster in its-tail, our study shows that lattice-driven self-assembly is an important property of DCX.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">VE-cadherin enables trophoblast endovascular invasion and spiral artery remodeling during placental development</a></h4>

              
                During formation of the mammalian placenta trophoblasts invade the maternal decidua and remodel spiral arteries to bring maternal blood into the placenta. This process, known as endovascular invasion, is thought to involve the adoption of functional characteristics of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) by trophoblasts. The genetic and molecular basis of endovascular invasion remains poorly defined, however, and whether trophoblasts utilize specialized endothelial proteins in an analogous manner to create vascular channels remains untested. Vascular endothelial (VE-)cadherin is a homotypic adhesion protein that is expressed selectively by ECs in which it enables formation of tight vessels and regulation of EC junctions. VE-cadherin is also expressed in invasive trophoblasts and is a prime candidate for a molecular mechanism of endovascular invasion by those cells. Here, we show that the VE-cadherin is required for trophoblast migration and endovascular invasion into the maternal decidua in the mouse. VE-cadherin deficiency results in loss of spiral artery remodeling that leads to decreased flow of maternal blood into the placenta, fetal growth restriction, and death. These studies identify a non-endothelial role for VE-cadherin in trophoblasts during placental development and suggest that endothelial proteins may play functionally unique roles in trophoblasts that do not simply mimic those in ECs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Imaging of the pial arterial vasculature of the human brain in vivo using high-resolution 7T time-of-flight angiography</a></h4>

              
                The pial arterial vasculature of the human brain is the only blood supply to the neocortex, but quantitative data on the morphology and topology of these mesoscopic arteries (diameter 50-300µm) remains scarce. Because it is commonly assumed that blood flow velocities in these vessels are prohibitively slow, non-invasive time-of-flight MRI angiography (TOF-MRA)-which is well-suited to high 3D imaging resolutions-has not been applied to imaging the pial arteries. Here, we provide a theoretical framework that outlines how TOF-MRA can visualize small pial arteries <i>in vivo</i>, by employing extremely small voxels at the size of individual vessels. We then provide evidence for this theory by imaging the pial arteries at 140-µm isotropic resolution using a 7T MRI scanner and prospective motion correction, and show that pial arteries one voxel-width in diameter can be detected. We conclude that imaging pial arteries is not limited by slow blood flow, but instead by achievable image resolution. This study represents the first targeted, comprehensive account of imaging pial arteries <i>in vivo</i> in the human brain. This ultra-high-resolution angiography will enable the characterization of pial vascular anatomy across the brain to investigate patterns of blood supply and relationships between vascular and functional architecture.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Epistatic selection on a selfish Segregation Distorter supergene: drive, recombination, and genetic load</a></h4>

              
                Meiotic drive supergenes are complexes of alleles at linked loci that together subvert Mendelian segregation resulting in preferential transmission. In males, the most common mechanism of drive involves the disruption of sperm bearing one of a pair of alternative alleles. While at least two loci are important for male drive- the driver and the target- linked modifiers can enhance drive, creating selection pressure to suppress recombination. In this work, we investigate the evolution and genomic consequences of an autosomal, multilocus, male meiotic drive system, <i>Segregation Distorter</i> (<i>SD</i>) in the fruit fly, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. In African populations, the predominant <i>SD</i> chromosome variant, <i>SD-Mal</i>, is characterized by two overlapping, paracentric inversions on chromosome arm <i>2R</i> and nearly perfect (~100%) transmission. We study the <i>SD-Mal</i> system in detail, exploring its components, chromosomal structure, and evolutionary history. Our findings reveal a recent chromosome-scale selective sweep mediated by strong epistatic selection for haplotypes carrying <i>Sd</i>, the main driving allele, and one or more factors within the double inversion. While most <i>SD-Mal</i> chromosomes are homozygous lethal, <i>SD-Mal</i> haplotypes can recombine with other, complementing haplotypes via crossing over, and with wildtype chromosomes via gene conversion. <i>SD-Mal</i> chromosomes have nevertheless accumulated lethal mutations, excess non-synonymous mutations, and excess transposable element insertions. Therefore, <i>SD-Mal</i> haplotypes evolve as a small, semi-isolated subpopulation with a history of strong selection. These results may explain the evolutionary turnover of <i>SD</i> haplotypes in different populations around the world, and have implications for supergene evolution broadly.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Rate-limiting transport of positively charged arginine residues through the Sec-machinery is integral to the mechanism of protein secretion</a></h4>

              
                Transport of proteins across and into membranes is a fundamental biological process with the vast majority being conducted by the ubiquitous Sec machinery. In bacteria, this is usually achieved when the SecY-complex engages the cytosolic ATPase SecA (secretion) or translating ribosomes (insertion). Great strides have been made towards understanding the mechanism of protein translocation. Yet, important questions remain - notably, the nature of the individual steps that constitute transport, and how the proton-motive force (PMF) across the plasma membrane contributes. Here, we apply a recently developed high-resolution protein transport assay to explore these questions. We find that pre-protein transport is limited primarily by the diffusion of arginine residues across the membrane, particularly in the context of bulky hydrophobic sequences. This specific effect of arginine, caused by its positive charge, is mitigated for lysine which can be deprotonated and transported across the membrane in its neutral form. These observations have interesting implications for the mechanism of protein secretion, suggesting a simple mechanism through which the PMF can aid transport by enabling a 'proton ratchet', wherein re-protonation of exiting lysine residues prevents channel re-entry, biasing transport in the outward direction.

                Children have more difficulty perceiving speech in noise than adults. Whether these difficulties relate to immature processing of prosodic or linguistic elements of the attended speech is still unclear. To address the impact of noise on linguistic processing per se, we assessed how acoustic noise impacts the cortical tracking of intelligible speech devoid of prosody in school-aged children and adults. Twenty adults and twenty children (7-9 years) listened to synthesized French monosyllabic words presented at 2.5 Hz, either randomly or in 4-word hierarchical structures wherein 2 words formed a phrase, and 2 phrases formed a sentence, with or without babble noise. Neuromagnetic responses to words, phrases and sentences were identified and source-localized. Children and adults displayed significant cortical tracking of words in all conditions, and of phrases and sentences only when words formed meaningful sentences. In children compared with adults, cortical tracking of linguistic units was lower for all units in conditions without noise, and similarly impacted by the addition of babble noise for phrase and sentence units. Critically, when there was noise, adults increased the cortical tracking of monosyllabic words in the inferior frontal gyri but children did not. This study demonstrates that the difficulties of school-aged children in understanding speech in a multi-talker background might be partly due to an immature identification of lexical but not supra-lexical linguistic units.

                Some species successfully repair retinal injuries in contrast to non-regenerative mammalian retina. We show here that the Mexican axolotl salamander regrows its excised retina even in adulthood. During early regeneration, cell proliferation occurred in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). All dividing cells expressed Vimentin, and some also expressed Muller glia and neural progenitor cell marker Glast (Slc1a3), suggesting that regeneration is driven by RPE-derived retinal progenitor cells. Bulk RNA sequencing showed that genes associated with the extracellular matrix and angiogenesis were upregulated in early-to-mid retinal regeneration. The fully regenerated retina re-established nerve projections to the brain and contained all the original retinal cell types, including Muller glia. Regeneration of cellular diversity may be modulated by Notch signaling, as inhibiting Notch signaling in early regeneration promoted production of rod photoreceptors. Our study highlights the axolotl salamander as an advantageous model of adult tetrapod retinal regeneration and provides insights into its mechanisms.

                CLN3 disease is a lysosomal storage disorder associated with fatal neurodegeneration that is caused by mutations in CLN3. Most individuals with CLN3 disease carry at least one allele with a 966 bp deletion in CLN3 which results in the deletion of exons 7 and 8. There is a need for more physiologically relevant human cell-based CLN3 disease models to better understand the cellular changes during the disease process. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we corrected the 966 bp deletion mutation in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of a compound heterozygous patient (CLN3 {Delta} 966 bp and E295K). The isogenic deletion-corrected and unedited CLN3 patient iPSCs were used for disease modeling. iPSC-derived neurons carrying this particular CLN3 mutation (CLN3 neurons) had lower functional activity as recorded using microelectrode arrays for most of the culture period. Proteomics analysis showed downregulation of proteins related to axon guidance and endocytosis at day in vitro (DIV) 14 and 42 in CLN3 neurons. This was accompanied by an increase in lysosomal-related proteins in CLN3 neurons. Western blot analysis revealed hyperglycosylation of the lysosomal marker, Lysosome Associated Membrane Protein 1 (LAMP1) in CLN3 neurons at DIV 14, 28 and 42, which was not apparent in control neurons. Ultrastructural analysis of CLN3 neurons showed numerous membrane-bound vacuoles containing diverse types of storage material, ranging from curvilinear deposits, multilamellar structures to osmiophilic deposits. Our findings suggest alterations in lysosomal function and neurodevelopment involving axon guidance and synaptic transmission in CLN3-deficient neuronal derivatives, which could be potential targets for therapy.

                Background. Electrically evoked compound action potentials (ECAPs) generated in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) contain features that may be useful for titrating deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy for Parkinson's disease. While previous studies have leveraged macroscale DBS electrodes, directional DBS leads with split-band contacts are thought to enable sampling ECAPs at a higher spatial resolution both within and adjacent to the STN. Objective. In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal features of ECAPs in and around the STN across parameter sweeps of stimulation current amplitude, pulse width, and electrode configuration. Methods. Four non-human primates were implanted unilaterally with either a directional (n=3) or non-directional (n=1) DBS lead targeting the sensorimotor STN. Resting-state ECAPs were recorded before and after rendering the subjects parkinsonian with MPTP treatments. Results. ECAP responses were characterized by primary features (within 1.6ms after a stimulus pulse) and secondary features (between 1.6-7.4ms after a stimulus pulse). Using these ECAP features, a linear classifier was able to differentiate electrodes within and dorsal to the STN in all four subjects. Conclusion. ECAP responses varied systematically with recording and stimulating electrode location, which may provide utility in efficiently defining DBS electrode configurations to target pathways in and around the STN for treating symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

However, how SG assembly is regulated and related to pathomechanism is incompletely understood. Here, we show that ER stress activates JNK via IRE1 in fly and cellular models of C9orf72-mediated ALS/FTD (c9ALS/FTD), the most common genetic form of ALS/FTD. Furthermore, activated JNK promotes SG assembly induced by poly(GR) and poly(PR), two toxic proteins implicated in c9ALS/FTD, by promoting the transcription of G3BP1, a key SG protein. Consistent with these findings, JNK or IRE1 inhibition reduced SG formation, G3BP1 mRNA and protein levels, and neurotoxicity in cells overexpressing poly(GR) and poly(PR) or neurons derived from c9ALS/FTD patient induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Our findings connect ER stress, JNK, and SG assembly in a unified pathway contributing to c9ALS/FTD neurodegeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex Differences in Central Amygdala Reactivity following Psychedelic Drug Exposure</a></h4>

              
                Psilocybin, and its active metabolite psilocin, have been shown to elicit rapid and long-lasting symptom improvements in a variety of affective psychiatric illnesses. However, the specific mechanisms behind these therapeutic effects remain relatively unknown. The central amygdala (CeA) is a primary output region within the extended amygdala that is heavily dysregulated in affective psychiatric disorders. Here, we utilized fiber photometry to measure changes in CeA reactivity to an aversive air puff stimulus after psilocin administration, both acutely and at varying prolonged time points. We found that administration of psilocin increased reactivity acutely in females, but not males. Additionally, we show that one dose of psilocin produced decreases in reactivity in males, but not females, 28-days post administration, with decreases seen as early as 2-days post administration. We further report stimulus-specific changes in CeA reactivity after psilocin with differential responsivity to an aversive air puff stimulus and an auditory stimulus. We also measured changes in behavioral response to the air puff stimulus and report sex differences in exploratory behavior but not threat responding or general locomotion. This study provides evidence that a single dose of psilocin can elicit sex-specific, dynamic, and enduring changes in CeA reactivity to an aversive stimulus. These data are an important step towards dissecting circuit-based mechanisms underlying the effects of psychedelics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Microglial ferroptotic stress causes non-cell autonomous neuronal death</a></h4>

              
                Background. Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death characterised by lipid peroxidation as the terminal endpoint and a requirement for iron. Although it protects against cancer and infection, ferroptosis is also implicated in causing neuronal death in degenerative diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). The precise role for ferroptosis in causing neuronal death is yet to be fully resolved. Methods. To elucidate the role of ferroptosis in neuronal death we utilised co-culture and conditioned medium transfer experiments involving microglia, astrocytes and neurones. We ratified clinical significance of our cell culture findings via assessment of human CNS tissue from cases of the fatal, paralysing neurodegenerative condition of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Finally, we utilised the SOD1G37R mouse model of ALS and a novel CNS-permeant ferroptosis inhibitor to verify pharmacological significance in vivo. Results. We found that sublethal ferroptotic stress selectively affecting microglia triggers an inflammatory cascade that results in non-cell autonomous neuronal death. Central to this cascade is the conversion of astrocytes to a neurotoxic state. We show that spinal cord tissue from cases of ALS exhibits a signature of ferroptosis that encompasses atomic, molecular and biochemical features. Moreover, a molecular correlation between ferroptosis and neurotoxic astrocytes evident in ALS-affected spinal cord is recapitulated in the SOD1G37R mouse model where treatment with the novel, CNS-permeant ferroptosis inhibitor, CuII(atsm), ameliorated these markers and was neuroprotective. Conclusions. By showing that microglia responding to sublethal ferroptotic stress culminates in non-cell autonomous neuronal death, our results implicate microglial ferroptotic stress as a rectifiable cause of neuronal death in neurodegenerative disease. As ferroptosis is currently primarily regarded as an intrinsic cell death phenomenon, these results introduce an entirely new pathophysiological role for ferroptosis in disease.

                Neural network models have been instrumental in revealing the foundational principles of whole-brain dynamics. Here we describe a new whole-cortex model of mouse resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) activity. Our model implements neural input-output nonlinearities and excitatory-inhibitory interactions within areas, as well as a directed connectome obtained with viral tracing to model interareal connections. Our model makes novel predictions about the dynamic organization of rsfMRI activity on a fast scale of seconds, and explains its relationship with the underlying axonal connectivity. Specifically, the simulated rsfMRI activity exhibits rich attractor dynamics, with multiple stationary and oscillatory attractors. Guided by these theoretical predictions, we find that empirical mouse rsfMRI time series exhibit analogous signatures of attractor dynamics, and that model attractors recapitulate the topographical organization and temporal structure of empirical rsfMRI co-activation patterns (CAPs). The richness and complexity of attractor dynamics, as well as its ability to explain CAPs, are lost when the directionality of underlying axonal connectivity is neglected. Finally, complexity of fast dynamics on the scale of seconds was maximal for the values of inter-hemispheric axonal connectivity strength and of inter-areal connectivity sparsity measured in real anatomical mouse data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age-related changes in neural synchronization and the sustained response to amplitude and frequency modulation of sound</a></h4>

              
                Perception of speech requires sensitivity to features, such as amplitude and frequency modulations, which are often temporally regular. Previous work suggests age-related changes in neural responses to temporally regular features, but little work has focused on age differences for different types of modulations. We recorded magnetoencephalography in younger (21-33 years) and older adults (53-73 years) to investigate age differences in neural responses to slow (2-6 Hz sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal) modulations in amplitude, frequency, or combined amplitude and frequency. Neural responses to sound onset (independent of temporal modulations) were enhanced in older compared to younger adults, suggesting hyperresponsivity and a loss of inhibition in the aged auditory system. Analyses of neural activity to modulations revealed enhanced neural synchronization with amplitude, frequency, and combined amplitude-frequency modulations for older compared to younger adults. This enhancement generalized across different degrees of temporal regularity (sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal), although neural synchronization was generally lower for non-sinusoidal modulation. Despite enhanced synchronization, sustained neural activity was reduced in older compared to younger adults for sounds modulated both sinusoidally and non-sinusoidally in frequency. Our results suggest substantial age differences in the sensitivity of the auditory system to features present in speech and other natural sounds.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Deficiency in pericyte remodeling as a basis for impaired capillary flow and structure during brain aging</a></h4>

              
                Deterioration of brain capillary flow and architecture is a hallmark of aging and dementia. It remains unclear how loss of brain pericytes in these conditions contributes to capillary dysfunction. We conducted cause-and-effect studies by optically ablating pericytes in adult and aged mice in vivo. Focal pericyte loss induced capillary dilation without blood-brain barrier disruption. These abnormal dilations were exacerbated in the aged brain and resulted in increased flow heterogeneity in capillary networks. A subset of affected capillaries reduced in perfusion due to flow steal. Some capillaries stalled in flow and regressed, leading to loss of capillary connectivity. Remodeling of neighboring pericytes restored endothelial coverage and vascular tone within days. Pericyte remodeling was slower in the aged brain, resulting in regions of persistent capillary dilation. These findings link pericyte loss to disruption of capillary flow and structure. They also identify pericyte remodeling as a therapeutic target to preserve capillary flow dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Face Familiarity Revealed by Fixational Eye Movements and Fixation-Related Potentials in Free Viewing</a></h4>

              
                Event-related potentials (ERPs) and the oculomotor inhibition (OMI) in response to transient visual stimuli are known to be sensitive to different stimulus properties, including attention and expectation. In natural vision, transient stimulation of the visual cortex is generated primarily by saccades. Recent studies suggest that the core EEG components in free viewing, induced by saccades (fixation-related potentials, FRPs), are similar to the ERP components with flashed stimuli. We have recently found that the OMI in response to flashed stimuli is sensitive to face familiarity. Here, we investigated whether fixation-related-potentials (FRPs) and microsaccade inhibition (OMI) in free viewing are sensitive to face familiarity. Observers (N=15) freely watched a slideshow of seven unfamiliar and one familiar world leader's facial images presented randomly for 4-seconds periods, with multiple images per identity. We measured the occipital fixation-related N1 relative to the P1 magnitude as well as the associated fixation-triggered OMI. We found that the average N1 was significantly smaller and the OMI was shorter for the familiar face, compared with any of the 7 unfamiliar faces. Moreover, the P1 was suppressed across saccades for the familiar but not for the unfamiliar faces. Overall, the results indicate that the occipital FRP and the OMI in free viewing are sensitive to face familiarity; this could perhaps be used as a novel physiological measure for studying hidden suppressed memories.

                The characterization of cortical myelination is essential for the study of structure-function relationships in the human brain. However, knowledge about cortical myelination is largely based on post mortem histology, which shows conflicting results depending on the staining method used, and generally renders direct comparison to function impossible. The repeating pattern of pale-thin-pale-thick stripes of cytochrome oxidase (CO) activity in the primate secondary visual cortex (V2) is a prominent columnar system, where heavier myelination in both thin/thick and pale stripes were found, respectively. We used quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) in conjunction with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at ultra-high field strength (7 T) to localize and study myelination of stripes in several humans at sub-millimeter resolution in vivo. Thin and thick stripes were functionally localized by exploiting their sensitivity to color and binocular disparity, respectively. Resulting functional activation maps showed robust stripe patterns in V2 which enabled further comparison of quantitative relaxation parameters between stripe types. Thereby, we found lower longitudinal relaxation rates (R1) of thin and thick stripes compared to surrounding gray matter in the order of 1-2%, indicating heavier myelination of pale stripes. No differences for effective transverse relaxation rates (R2*) were found. The study demonstrates the feasibility to investigate structure-function relationships in living humans within one cortical area at the level of columnar systems using qMRI.

                Memory traces develop gradually and link to neural plasticity. Memory reactivation during sleep is crucial for consolidation, but its precise impact on plasticity and contribution to long-term memory storage remains unclear. We used multimodal diffusion-weighted imaging to track the location and timescale of microstructural changes following Targeted Memory Reactivation (TMR) of a motor task. This showed continuous microstructure plasticity in precuneus across 10 days post-TMR, paralleling the gradual development of behavioural benefit. Both early (0 - 24 h post-TMR) and late (24 h - 10 days post-TMR) microstructural changes in striatum and sensorimotor cortex were associated with the emergence of behavioural effects of TMR at day 20. Furthermore, the baseline microstructural architecture of sensorimotor cortex predicted TMR susceptibility. These findings demonstrate that repeated reactivation of memory traces during sleep engenders microstructural plasticity which continues days after the stimulation night and is associated with the emergence of memory benefits at the behavioural level.

                The oral microbiome is second only to its intestinal counterpart in diversity and abundance, but its effects on taste cells remains largely unexplored. Using single cell RNASeq, we found that mouse taste receptor cells (STRCs) have a gene expression signature reminiscent of Microfold (M) cells, a central player in immune surveillance in the mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) such as those in the Peyers patch and tonsils. Administration of Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 11 (TNFSF11, also known as RANKL), a growth factor required for differentiation of M cells dramatically increased M cell proliferation and marker gene expression in the taste papillae and in cultured taste organoids from wild type (WT) mice. Taste papillae and organoids from knockout mice lacking Spib (Spib KO), a RANKL-regulated transcription factor required for M cell development and regeneration on the other hand, failed to respond to RANKL. Taste papillae from Spib KO mice also showed reduced expression of NF-{kappa}B signaling pathway components and proinflammatory cytokines and attracted fewer immune cells. However, lipopolysaccharide- induced expression of cytokines was strongly upregulated in Spib KO mice compared to their WT counterparts. Like M cells, STRCs from WT but not Spib KO mice readily took up fluorescently labeled microbeads, a proxy for microbial transcytosis. The proportion of STRCs and other taste cell subtypes are unaltered in Spib KO mice; however, they displayed increased attraction to sweet and umami taste stimuli. We propose that STRCs are involved in immune surveillance at the taste papillae and tune their taste responses to microbial signaling and infection.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Normative Decision Rules in Changing Environments</a></h4>

              
                Models based on normative principles have played a major role in our understanding of how the brain forms decisions. However, these models have typically been derived for simple, stable environments, and their relevance to decisions under more naturalistic, dynamic conditions is unclear. We previously derived a normative decision model in which evidence accumulation is adapted to environmental dynamics (Glaze et al., 2015), but the evolution of commitment rules (e.g., thresholds on the accumulated evidence) under such dynamic conditions is not fully understood. Here we derive a normative model for decisions based on changing evidence or reward. In these cases, performance (reward rate) is maximized using adaptive decision thresholds that best account for diverse environmental changes, in contrast to predictions of many previous decision models. These adaptive thresholds exhibit several distinct temporal motifs that depend on the specific, predicted and experienced changes in task conditions. These adaptive decision strategies perform robustly even when implemented imperfectly (noisily) and can account for observed response times on a task with time-varying evidence better than commonly used constant-threshold or urgency-gating models. These results further link normative and neural decision-making while expanding our view of both as dynamic, adaptive processes that update and use expectations to govern both deliberation and commitment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Global brain health modulates the impact of lesion damage on post-stroke sensorimotor outcomes</a></h4>

              
                Sensorimotor performance after stroke is strongly related to focal injury measures such as corticospinal tract lesion load. However, the role of global brain health is less clear. Here, we examined the impact of brain age, a measure of neurobiological aging derived from whole brain structural neuroimaging, on sensorimotor outcomes. We hypothesized that stroke lesion damage would result in older brain age, which would in turn be associated with poorer sensorimotor outcomes. We also expected that brain age would mediate the impact of lesion damage on sensorimotor outcomes and that these relationships would be driven by post-stroke secondary atrophy (e.g., strongest in the ipsilesional hemisphere in chronic stroke). We further hypothesized that structural brain resilience, which we define in the context of stroke as the ability of the brain to maintain its global integrity despite focal lesion damage, would differentiate people with better versus worse outcomes. We analyzed cross-sectional high-resolution brain MRI and outcomes data from 963 people with stroke from 38 cohorts worldwide using robust linear mixed-effects regressions to examine the relationship between sensorimotor behavior, lesion damage, and brain age. We used a mediation analysis to examine whether brain age mediates the impact of lesion damage on stroke outcomes and if associations are driven by ipsilesional measures in chronic ([&ge;]180 days) stroke. We assessed the impact of brain resilience on sensorimotor outcome using logistic regression with propensity score matching on lesion damage. Stroke lesion damage was associated with older brain age, which in turn was associated with poorer sensorimotor outcomes. Brain age mediated the impact of corticospinal tract lesion load on sensorimotor outcomes most strongly in the ipsilesional hemisphere in chronic stroke. Greater brain resilience, as indexed by younger brain age, explained why people have better versus worse sensorimotor outcomes when lesion damage was fixed. We present novel evidence that global brain health is associated with superior post-stroke sensorimotor outcomes and modifies the impact of focal damage. This relationship appears to be due to post-stroke secondary degeneration. Brain resilience provides insight into why some people have better outcomes after stroke, despite similar amounts of focal injury. Inclusion of imaging-based assessments of global brain health may improve prediction of post-stroke sensorimotor outcomes compared to focal injury measures alone. This investigation is important because it introduces the potential to apply novel therapeutic interventions to prevent or slow brain aging from other fields (e.g., Alzheimers disease) to stroke.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A translational MRI approach to validate acute axonal damage detection in multiple sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                Axonal degeneration is a central pathological feature of multiple sclerosis and is closely associated with irreversible clinical disability. Current noninvasive methods to detect axonal damage in vivo are limited in their specificity, clinical applicability and lack of proper validation. We aimed to validate an MRI framework based on multicompartment modeling of the diffusion signal (AxCaliber) in rats in the presence of axonal pathology, achieved through injection of a neurotoxin damaging the neuronal terminal of axons. We then applied the same MRI protocol to map axonal integrity in the whole brain of multiple sclerosis relapsing-remitting patients and age-matched healthy controls. AxCaliber is sensitive to microstructural axonal damage in rats, as demonstrated by a significant increase in the mean axonal caliber along the target tract, which correlated with the neurotoxin neurofilament staining. In humans, we uncovered a diffuse increase in mean axonal caliber in demyelinating lesions and, importantly, in most areas of the normal-appearing white matter. Our results demonstrate that axonal diameter mapping is a sensitive and specific imaging biomarker able to link noninvasive imaging contrasts with the underlying biological substrate, supporting the key role of generalized axonal damage in multiple sclerosis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The lateral habenula mediates the association of a conditioned stimulus with the absence of an appetitive unconditioned stimulus</a></h4>

              
                The lateral habenula (LHb) has been implicated in conditioned inhibition. Here, the modulating effects of LHb activity on the association of a conditioned stimulus (CS) with the nonoccurrence of an unconditioned stimulus (US) were assessed in vivo using chemogenetic methods. Animals initially received explicitly unpaired CS light and US food presentations. Animals subjected to a retardation-of-acquisition task subsequently underwent light and food pairings, whereas those subjected to a summation task underwent compound light-tone and food pairings. The inhibitory light strength was assessed based on retardation of the acquisition of food-cup conditioned responses (CRs) in light-food pairings and comparisons of food-cup CRs to each stimulus in a CS-alone test following compound training. Neurotoxic LHb lesions and chemogenetic LHb inhibition throughout unpaired training attenuated the inhibitory light strength. Furthermore, chemogenetic LHb activation accelerated the decline in CR induced by repeated light-alone presentations following light-food pairings. Therefore, the LHb critically contributes to conditioned inhibition.

                Sleep spindles are associated with the beginning of deep sleep and memory consolidation and are disrupted in schizophrenia and autism. In primates, distinct core and matrix thalamocortical (TC) circuits regulate sleep-spindle activity, through communications that are filtered by the inhibitory thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) however, little is known about typical TC network interactions and the mechanisms that are disrupted in brain disorders. We developed a primate-specific, circuit-based TC computational model with distinct core and matrix loops that can simulate sleep spindles. We implemented novel multilevel cortical and thalamic mixing, and included local thalamic inhibitory interneurons, and direct layer 5 projections of variable density to TRN and thalamus to investigate the functional consequences of different ratios of core and matrix node connectivity contribution to spindle dynamics. Our simulations showed that spindle power in primates can be modulated based on the level of cortical feedback, thalamic inhibition, and engagement of model core vs. matrix, with the latter having a greater role in spindle dynamics. The study of the distinct spatial and temporal dynamics of core-, matrix-, and mix-generated sleep spindles establishes a framework to study disruption of TC circuit balance underlying deficits in sleep and attentional gating seen in autism and schizophrenia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Volitional generation of reproducible energy-efficient temporal patterns</a></h4>

              
                One of the extraordinary characteristics of the biological brain is its low energy expense to implement a variety of biological functions and intelligence compared to the modern artificial intelligence (AI). Spike-based energy-efficient temporal codes have long been suggested as the contributor for the brain to run with a low energy expense. Despite this code having been largely reported in the sensory cortex, whether this code can be implemented in other brain areas to serve broader functions and how the brain learns to generate it have remained unaddressed. In this study, we designed a novel brain-machine interface (BMI) paradigm, by learning which two macaques could volitionally generate reproducible energy-efficient temporal patterns in the primary motor cortex (M1). Moreover, most neurons that were not directly assigned for controlling the BMI did not boost their excitability, demonstrating an overall energy-efficiency manner in performing the task. Over the course of learning, we found that the firing rates and temporal precision of selected neurons co-evolved to generate the energy-efficient temporal patterns, suggesting a cohesive rather than dissociable processing underlie the refinement of energy-efficient temporal patterns.

                Cav3.2 T-type calcium channel is a major molecular actor of neuropathic pain in peripheral sensory neurons, but its involvement at the supra-spinal level is almost unknown. In the Anterior Pretectum (APT), a hub of connectivity of the somatosensory system involved in pain perception, we show that Cav3.2 channels are expressed in a sub-population of GABAergic neurons co-expressing parvalbumin (PV). In these PV-expressing neurons, Cav3.2 channels contribute to a high frequency bursting activity, which is increased in the spared nerve injury model of neuropathy. Specific deletion of Cav3.2 channels in APT neurons reduced both the initiation and maintenance of mechanical and cold allodynia. These data are a direct demonstration that centrally expressed Cav3.2 channels also play a fundamental role in pain pathophysiology.

                Munc13 proteins are priming factors for SNARE-dependent exocytosis, which are activated by diacylglycerol (DAG)-binding to their C1-domain. Several Munc13 paralogs exist, but their differential roles are not well understood. We studied the interdependence of phorbolesters (DAG mimics) with Munc13-1 and ubMunc13-2 in mouse adrenal chromaffin cells. Although expression of either Munc13-1 or ubMunc13-2 stimulated secretion, phorbolester was only stimulatory for secretion when ubMunc13-2 expression dominated, but inhibitory when Munc13-1 dominated. Accordingly, phorbolester stimulated secretion in wildtype cells, or cells overexpressing ubMunc13-2, but inhibited secretion in Munc13-2/Unc13b knockout (KO) cells or in cells overexpressing Munc13-1. Phorbolester was more stimulatory in the Munc13-1/Unc13a KO than in WT littermates, showing that endogenous Munc13-1 limits the effects of phorbolester. Imaging showed that ubMunc13-2, but not Munc13-1, traffics to the plasma membrane with a time-course matching Ca2+-dependent secretion, and trafficking is independent of synaptotagmin-7 (syt7). However, in the absence of syt7, phorbolester became inhibitory for both Munc13-1 and ubMunc13-2 driven secretion, indicating that stimulatory phorbolester x Munc13-2 interaction depends obligatorily on functional pairing with syt7. Overall, DAG/phorbolester, ubMunc13-2 and syt7 form a stimulatory triad for dense-core vesicle priming.

                Immunohistochemistry on archival human brains is often limited because several conditions arise that complicate the use for high-resolution fluorescence microscopy. In this study, we developed a novel clearing approach for immunofluorescence-based analysis of perfusion- and immersion-fixed post mortem human brain tissue, termed hCLARITY. hCLARITY is optimized for specificity by reducing off-target labeling and yields very sensitive stainings in human brain sections allowing for super-resolution microscopy with unprecedented imaging of pre- and postsynaptic compartments. Moreover, hallmarks of the Alzheimer's disease were preserved with hCLARITY, and importantly classical DAB or Nissl stainings are compatible with this protocol. hCLARITY is extremely versatile as demonstrated by the use of more than 30 well performing antibodies and allows for de- and subsequent re-staining of the same tissue section, which is important for multi-labelling approaches, e.g., in super-resolution microscopy. Taken together, hCLARITY enables research of the human brain with highest sensitivity and down to sub-diffraction resolution and therefore has enormous potential for the investigation of local morphological changes, e.g., in neurodegenerative diseases.

                The dorsal subiculum (dSub) is one of the key structures responsible for the formation of hippocampal memory traces but the contribution of individual ionic currents to its cognitive function is not well studied. Although low-voltage-activated T-type calcium channels (T-channels) are crucial for the burst firing pattern regulation in the dSub pyramidal neurons, their potential role in learning and memory remains unclear. Here we used in vivo local field potential recordings and miniscope calcium imaging in freely behaving mice coupled with pharmacological and genetic tools to address this gap in knowledge. We show that the CaV3.1 isoform of T-channels is critically involved in controlling neuronal activity in the dSub in vivo. Altering burst firing pattern by inhibiting T-channel activity markedly affects calcium dynamics, synaptic plasticity, neuronal oscillations and phase-amplitude coupling in the dSub, thereby disrupting spatial learning. These results provide a crucial causative link between the CaV3.1 channels, burst firing activity of dSub neurons and memory processing, thus further supporting the notion that changes in neuronal excitability regulate memory trace formation. We posit that subicular CaV3.1 T-channels could be a promising novel drug target for cognitive disorders.

                Reward and punishment powerfully inform ongoing behaviors and drive learning throughout the brain, including neocortex. Yet it remains elusive how these global signals are represented and impact local cortical computations. Previously we found that in auditory cortex, VIP-expressing interneurons are recruited by reinforcement feedback. Here, we used 3D random-access two-photon microscopy and fiber photometry to monitor VIP neural activity in dozens of cortical areas while mice learned an auditory decision task. We show that reward and punishment evoke a rapid, cortex-wide activation of most VIP interneurons. This global recruitment mode of VIP interneurons showed variations in temporal dynamics in individual neurons and across areas. Neither their weak sensory tuning in visual cortex, nor their arousal state modulation was predictive of reinforcer responses of VIP interneurons. We suggest that VIP-expressing cortical inhibitory neurons transduce global reinforcement signals to provide disinhibitory control over local circuit computations and their plasticity.

	<p>Duplication of the pituitary gland (DPG) is an extremely rare malformation. DPG is associated with a wide variety of midline and central nervous system malformations (DPG-plus syndrome). We present the computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) findings of a rare case of DPG with associated tuberomammillary fusion resulting in a hypothalamic mass-like configuration, oropharyngeal teratoma, cleft palate, hypertelorism, duplicated/broad sella, duplication/low bifurcation of the basilar artery, and craniovertebral midline anomalies. Qualitative interpretation of DTI yielded normal white matter organization of the brain. The duplication of the prechordal plate and the rostral end of the notochordal plate/notochord is thought to be the main factor leading to a duplication of the pituitary primordium and resulting in the formation of two morphologically normal glands. The time of induction of the teratogenic influence, the extent of the prechordal plate and notochordal plate/notochord abnormalities, and the faulty interactions are believed to be the reason for the wide spectrum of associated midline abnormalities.</p>

	<p>Up to 80% of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) patients in nursing homes experiences chronic pain and 97% develops fluctuant neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS). Agitation, associated with unrelieved pain, is managed through antipsychotics and may increase the risk of death. Evidence is accumulating in favor of analgesia for a safer, effective therapy of agitation. The Italian version of Mobilization&amp;amp;ndash;Observation&amp;amp;ndash;Behavior&amp;amp;ndash;Intensity&amp;amp;ndash;Dementia, I-MOBID2, recently validated in the Italian setting, shows: good scale content validity index (0.89), high construct validity (Spearman rank-order correlation Rho = 0.748), reliable internal consistency (Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s &amp;amp;alpha; coefficient = 0.751), good-excellent inter-rater (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC = 0.778) and test-retest (ICC = 0.902) reliability, and good inter-rater and test-retest agreement (Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s K = 0.744) with 5.8 min completion time. This study intends to identify the responsiveness of the I-MOBID2 based on COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) recommendations, assessing the a priori hypotheses of (1) the efficacy of painkillers administered to severe AD patients after proper pain assessment and (2) the effect of reduction of the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) score and of agitation rescue medications. This protocol is approved by Calabria Region Ethics Committee protocol No. 31/2017 and follows the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines.</p>

	<p>High-altitude exposure can negatively impact one&amp;amp;rsquo;s ability to accurately perceive time. This study focuses on Chinese migrants who have traveled to the Tibetan plateau and explores the effects of high-altitude exposure on their time interval judgment abilities based on three separate studies. In Study 1, it was found that exposure to high altitudes negatively impacted the time interval judgment functions of the migrants compared with a low-altitude control group; they exhibited a prolonged response time (540 ms: p = 0.006, 95% CI (&amp;amp;minus;1.70 &amp;amp;minus;0.32)) and reduced accuracy (1080 ms: p = 0.032, 95% CI (0.06 1.26)) in certain behavioral tasks. In Study 2, the results showed that high-altitude exposure and sleepiness had an interactive effect on time interval judgment (1080 ms) (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05, 95% CI (&amp;amp;minus;0.83 &amp;amp;minus;0.40)). To further verify our interaction hypothesis, in Study 3, we investigated the time interval judgment of interactions between acute high-altitude exposure and sleepiness level. The results revealed that the adaptation effect disappeared and sleepiness significantly exacerbated the negative effects of high-altitude exposure on time interval judgment (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, 95% CI (&amp;amp;minus;0.85 &amp;amp;minus;0.34)). This study is the first to examine the effects of high-altitude exposure on time interval judgment processing functions and the effects of sleep-related factors on individual time interval judgment.</p>

	<p>Growing evidence suggests that humans and other animals assign value to a stimulus based not only on its inherent rewarding properties, but also on the costs of the action required to obtain it, such as the cost of time. Here, we examined whether such cost also occurs for mentally simulated actions. Healthy volunteers indicated their subjective value for snack foods while the time to imagine performing the action to obtain the different stimuli was manipulated. In each trial, the picture of one food item and a home position connected through a path were displayed on a computer screen. The path could be either large or thin. Participants first rated the stimulus, and then imagined moving the mouse cursor along the path from the starting position to the food location. They reported the onset and offset of the imagined movements with a button press. Two main results emerged. First, imagery times were significantly longer for the thin than the large path. Second, participants liked significantly less the snack foods associated with the thin path (i.e., with longer imagery time), possibly because the passage of time strictly associated with action imagery discounts the value of the reward. Importantly, such effects were absent in a control group of participants who performed an identical valuation task, except that no action imagery was required. Our findings hint at the idea that imagined actions, like real actions, carry a cost that affects deeply how people assign value to the stimuli in their environment.</p>

	<p>Introduction: Due to the changes in the indication range for cochlear implants and the demographic development towards an aging society, more and more people are in receipt of cochlear implants. An implantation requires a close-meshed audiological and logopedic aftercare. Hearing therapy rehabilitation currently requires great personnel effort and is time consuming. Hearing and speech therapy rehabilitation can be supported by digital hearing training programs. However, the apps currently on the market are to a limited degree personalized and structured. Increasing digitalization makes it possible, especially in times of pandemics, to decouple hearing therapy treatment from everyday clinical practice. Material and Methods: For this purpose, an app is in development that provides hearing therapy tailored to the patient. The individual factors that influence hearing outcome are considered. Using intelligent algorithms, the app determines the selection of exercises, the level of difficulty and the speed at which the difficulty is increased. Results: The app works autonomously without being connected to local speech therapists. In addition, the app is able to analyze patient difficulties within the exercises and provides conclusions about the need for technical adjustments. Conclusions: The presented newly developed app represents a possibility to support, replace, expand and improve the classic outpatient hearing and speech therapy after CI implantation. The way the application works allows it to reach more people and provide a time- and cost-saving alternative to traditional therapy.</p>

	<p>Neurological autoimmune diseases have various origins and pathogeneses. Specific antibodies are associated with paraneoplastic syndromes, other infectious agents, or inherited disorders. We aim to evaluate the relation between the autoantibodies, the chosen symptoms, demographic characteristics, and infection history. We retrospectively analysed 508 children during neurological diagnostics. We investigated serum antineuronal, IgG, IgM anti-ganglioside, and anti-aquaporin-4 in both the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) anti-cell surface and anti-synaptic protein antibodies in 463, 99, 44, 343, and 119 patients, respectively. The CSF polymerase chain reaction detection of Herpesviridae, enterovirus, B19 parvovirus, adenovirus, and parechovirus involved 261 patients. We included available clinical information and electroencephalographic, radiologic, and microbiological results. The IgM anti-ganglioside antibodies increased the risk of tics and positive symptoms (p = 0.0345, p = 0.0263, respectively), the anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase particle of paresis (p = 0.0074), and anti-neuroendothelium of mutism (p = 0.0361). Anti-neuroendothelium, IgM anti-ganglioside, and CSF anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate antibodies were more often associated with consciousness loss (p = 0.0496, p = 0.0044, p = 0.0463, respectively). Anti-myelin antibodies co-occured with Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 IgG (p = 0.0415), anti-CV2 with HSV-1 IgM (p = 0.0394), whereas anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein was linked with past Epstein-Barr virus infection. The anti-ganglioside IgM and anti-myelin particles were bilaterally correlated (p = 0.0472). The clinical pictures may overlap, requiring specialistic diagnostics. We noticed the links between the infection aetiology and the specific autoantibody&amp;amp;rsquo;s positivity.</p>

	<p>There is a lack of knowledge about the factors associated with the recurrence of hemifacial spam (HFS) following an initially successful microvascular decompression (MVD) surgery. The aim of the present study was to systematically review the pertinent literature and carry out a meta-analysis of factors linked to HFS recurrence in patients undergoing initially successful MVD treatment. An online literature search was launched on the PubMed/Medline and Scopus databases. The following data were collected: sex, age at surgery, affected side, reported improvement after surgery, presence of post-operatory facial weakness, symptom duration, offender vessels, and data obtained from intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring. Upon full-text review, eight articles were included, studying 1105 patients, of which 64 (5.7%) reported recurrence after MVD surgery for hemifacial spasm. There was a statistically significant increased incidence of HFS recurrence in patients with the persistence of lateral spread response (LSR after surgery (OR 9.44 (95% CI 1.69&amp;amp;ndash;52.58) p 0.01), while those patients experiencing a shorter disease duration before going to surgery were significantly less prone to experiencing disease recurrence (OR 0.11 (95% CI 0.03&amp;amp;ndash;0.46) p 0.002). The remaining examined factors did not result as significantly associated with the risk of recurrence. The funnel plots were largely symmetrical for each variable studied. Taken together, the results of our meta-analysis seem to suggest that short-term symptom duration is a protective factor against HFS recurrence after MVD surgery, while LSR persistence is a negative prognostic factor. Well-designed randomized controlled clinical trials with a long follow-up are expected to further explore therapeutic alternatives for HFS recurrence.</p>

	<p>Emotional contexts affect memory processes. However, the impact of contextual priming as a function of the emotional valence on the recall of neutral information is not fully understood. The aim of the present study was to evaluate how a conditioning of emotional context during encoding may influence the subsequent memory of otherwise neutral materials in a well-established phenomenon as the serial position effect. Participants performed a free recall task for neutral words in three conditions: (i) word list alone; (ii) word list coupled with positive or neutral images; and (iii) word list coupled with negative or neutral images. Images were presented before each word stimulus. In three different experiments, the emotional context during the word list presentation was manipulated separately for primacy and recency clusters, and for the middle words (&amp;amp;lsquo;middlecy&amp;amp;rsquo;). Emotional context affects free recall of neutral stimuli, changing the serial position curve effect across conditions. Namely, emotional images presented in the primacy and recency clusters worsen accuracy, whereas their occurrence in the &amp;amp;lsquo;middlecy&amp;amp;rsquo; cluster reduces the oblivion. The present findings show that the typical pattern related to the serial position curve for neutral information can be shaped by the conditioning of emotional context. Findings have implications in medical-legal contexts in the case of the recollection of events with high emotional content.</p>

	<p>Normal aging is associated with changes in volumetric indices of brain atrophy. A quantitative understanding of age-related brain changes can shed light on successful aging. To investigate the effect of age on global and regional brain volumes and cortical thickness, 3514 magnetic resonance imaging scans were analyzed using automated brain segmentation and parcellation methods in elderly healthy individuals (69&amp;amp;ndash;88 years of age). The machine learning algorithm extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) achieved a mean absolute error of 2 years in predicting the age of new subjects. Feature importance analysis showed that the brain-to-intracranial-volume ratio is the most important feature in predicting age, followed by the hippocampi volumes. The cortical thickness in temporal and parietal lobes showed a superior predictive value than frontal and occipital lobes. Insights from this approach that integrate model prediction and interpretation may help to shorten the current explanatory gap between chronological age and biological brain age.</p>

	<p>Perinatal brain injury occurs in 5.14/1000 live births in England. A significant proportion of these injuries result from hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) in term infants and intracranial haemorrhage (IVH) or periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) in preterm infants. Standardised care necessitates minimal handling from parents and professionals to reduce the progression of injury. This can potentially increase parental stress through the physical inability to bond with their baby. Recent research highlights the ability of music therapy (MT) to empower parental bonding without handling, through sharing culturally informed personal music with their infant. This review therefore aimed to systematically evaluate the use of MT with infants diagnosed with perinatal brain injury in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Search terms were combined into three categories (audio stimulation (MT), population (neonates) and condition (brain injury), and eight electronic databases were used to identify relevant studies following PRISMA guidelines. Eleven studies using music or vocal stimulation with infants diagnosed with perinatal brain injury were identified and quality assessed using Cochrane ROB2, the ROBINSI Tool and the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Studies used either voice as live (n = 6) or pre-recorded (n = 3) interventions or pre-recorded instrumental music (n = 2). Studies had two primary areas of focus: developmental outcomes and physiological effects. Results suggested the use of music interventions led to a reduction of infants&amp;amp;rsquo; pain scores during procedures and cardiorespiratory events, improved feeding ability (increase oral feeding rate, volume intake and feeds per day) and resulted in larger amygdala volumes than control groups. Additionally, MT intervention on the unit supported long-term hospitalised infants in the acquisition of developmental milestones. Vocal soothing was perceived to be an accessible intervention for parents. However, infants with PVL showed signs of stress in complex interventions, which also potentially resulted in an increase in maternal anxiety in one study. MT with infants diagnosed with perinatal brain injury can have positive effects on infants&amp;amp;rsquo; behavioural and neurological parameters and support parental involvement in their infants&amp;amp;rsquo; developmental care. Further feasibility studies are required using MT to determine appropriate outcome measures for infants and the support required for parents to allow future comparison in large-scale randomised control trials.</p>

	<p>L-glutamate (L-Glu) is a nonessential amino acid, but an extensively utilised excitatory neurotransmitter with critical roles in normal brain function. Aberrant accumulation of L-Glu has been linked to neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration. To investigate this further, we systematically reviewed the literature to evaluate the effects of L-Glu on neuronal viability linked to the pathogenesis and/or progression of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). A search in PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Web of Science Core Collection was conducted to retrieve studies that investigated an association between L-Glu and pathology for five NDDs: Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (HD). Together, 4060 studies were identified, of which 71 met eligibility criteria. Despite several inadequacies, including small sample size, employment of supraphysiological concentrations, and a range of administration routes, it was concluded that exposure to L-Glu in vitro or in vivo has multiple pathogenic mechanisms that influence neuronal viability. These mechanisms include oxidative stress, reduced antioxidant defence, neuroinflammation, altered neurotransmitter levels, protein accumulations, excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, intracellular calcium level changes, and effects on neuronal histology, cognitive function, and animal behaviour. This implies that clinical and epidemiological studies are required to assess the potential neuronal harm arising from excessive intake of exogenous L-Glu.</p>

	<p>Hand grip strength has been considered as a possible marker for metabolic and psychiatric disease. To date, however, no research has focused on the association between alexithymia and hand grip strength. The objective of the present study was to investigate the correct association between hand grip strength and alexithymia. A cross-sectional study was carried out in Comalcalco, Tabasco, M&amp;amp;eacute;xico. A total of 246 individuals were included. Hand grip strength was evaluated in the dominant hand using a Takei&amp;amp;reg; portable digital dynamometer. Alexithymia was measured using the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20). Two linear regression models adjusted by confounders were used to determine the association between alexithymia and hand grip strength. The rate for positive alexithymia was 39.0% (n = 94). Individuals with alexithymia showed a weaker hand grip strength than the comparison group (t = 2.4, 244 df, p = 0.01). Individuals with alexithymia had significantly reduced levels of hand grip strength (&amp;amp;beta; = &amp;amp;minus;0.39 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.14; p = 0.006); after additional adjustment for clinical variables, decreased hand grip strength remained (&amp;amp;beta; = 8.00 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.86; p &amp;amp;le; 0.001). Our results suggest that a decrease in hand grip strength could be associated with alexithymia. This measurement could be useful as a predictive marker for the identification of alexithymia in Mexican individuals who attend outpatient clinics.</p>

	<p>Expressive language sampling (ELS) is a frequently used tool for language analysis, as it can be used across widely ranging cognitive and language abilities. ELS can also evaluate pragmatic language, including excessive self-repetition, which is challenging to assess with traditional standardized assessments. This study explored how a well-established ELS protocol can assess three types of linguistic self-repetition in three neurodevelopmental disabilities: fragile X syndrome (FXS), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and Down syndrome (DS). We examined its ability to differentiate between these disorders, the relationships between repetitive language and other participant characteristics, and initial construct validity. We found that the groups with FXS and ASD differed significantly on each of the three repetitive language measure, and that the group with DS differed from either ASD or FXS on two. Cognitive ability was significantly related to phrase repetition in the group with ASD. When the groups were combined, there was evidence of convergent and divergent validity. This study extends previous research on ELS and supports its use as a means to characterize pragmatic language. It also provides information about the relationships between repetitive language and other phenotypic characteristics.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Inferring ongoing cancer evolution from single tumour biopsies using synthetic supervised learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tom W. Ouellette, Philip Awadalla</p>

Variant allele frequencies (VAF) encode ongoing evolution and subclonal selection in growing tumours. However, existing methods that utilize VAF information for cancer evolutionary inference are compressive, slow, or incorrectly specify the underlying cancer evolutionary dynamics. Here, we provide a proof-of-principle synthetic supervised learning method, TumE, that integrates simulated models of cancer evolution with Bayesian neural networks, to infer ongoing selection in bulk-sequenced single tumour biopsies. Analyses in synthetic and patient tumours show that TumE significantly improves both accuracy and inference time per sample when detecting positive selection, deconvoluting selected subclonal populations, and estimating subclone frequency. Importantly, we show how transfer learning can leverage stored knowledge within TumE models for related evolutionary inference tasks—substantially reducing data and computational time for further model development and providing a library of recyclable deep learning models for the cancer evolution community. This extensible framework provides a foundation and future directions for harnessing progressive computational methods for the benefit of cancer genomics and, in turn, the cancer patient.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Optimizing interneuron circuits for compartment-specific feedback inhibition</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Joram Keijser, Henning Sprekeler</p>

Cortical circuits process information by rich recurrent interactions between excitatory neurons and inhibitory interneurons. One of the prime functions of interneurons is to stabilize the circuit by feedback inhibition, but the level of specificity on which inhibitory feedback operates is not fully resolved. We hypothesized that inhibitory circuits could enable separate feedback control loops for different synaptic input streams, by means of specific feedback inhibition to different neuronal compartments. To investigate this hypothesis, we adopted an optimization approach. Leveraging recent advances in training spiking network models, we optimized the connectivity and short-term plasticity of interneuron circuits for compartment-specific feedback inhibition onto pyramidal neurons. Over the course of the optimization, the interneurons diversified into two classes that resembled parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SST) expressing interneurons. Using simulations and mathematical analyses, we show that the resulting circuit can be understood as a neural decoder that inverts the nonlinear biophysical computations performed within the pyramidal cells. Our model provides a proof of concept for studying structure-function relations in cortical circuits by a combination of gradient-based optimization and biologically plausible phenomenological models.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Frequency–dependency of the involvement of dopamine D1/D5 and beta‐adrenergic receptors in hippocampal LTD triggered by locus coeruleus stimulation</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Patterned stimulation of the locus coeruleus (LC, 100 Hz), in conjunction with test-pulse stimulation of hippocampal afferents, results in input-specific long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Effects are long-lasting and have been described in Schaffer-collateral–CA1 and perforant path-dentate gyrus synapses in behaving rats. To what extent LC-mediated hippocampal LTD (LC-LTD) is frequency-dependent is unclear. Here, we report that LC-LTD can be triggered by LC stimulation with 2 and 5 Hz akin to tonic activity, 10 Hz equivalent to phasic activity, and 100 Hz akin to high-phasic activity in the dentate gyrus (DG) of freely behaving rats. LC-LTD at both 2 and 100 Hz can be significantly prevented by an NMDA receptor antagonist. The LC releases both noradrenaline (NA) and dopamine (DA) from its hippocampal terminals and may also trigger hippocampal DA release by activating the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Unclear is whether both neurotransmitters contribute equally to hippocampal LTD triggered by LC stimulation (LC-LTD). Both DA D1/D5 receptors (D1/D5R) and beta-adrenergic receptors (β-AR) are critically required for hippocampal LTD that is induced by patterned stimulation of hippocampal afferents, or is facilitated by spatial learning. We, therefore, explored to what extent these receptor subtypes mediate frequency-dependent hippocampal LC-LTD. LC-LTD elicited by 2, 5, and 10 Hz stimulation was unaffected by antagonism of β-AR with propranolol, whereas LC-LTD induced by these frequencies was prevented by D1/D5R-antagonism using SCH23390. By contrast, LC-LTD evoked at 100 Hz was prevented by β-AR-antagonism and only mildly affected by D1/D5R-antagonism. Taken together, these findings support that LC-LTD can be triggered by LC activity at a wide range of frequencies. Furthermore, the contribution of D1/D5R and β-AR to hippocampal LTD that is triggered by LC activity is frequency-dependent and suggests that D1/D5R may be involved in LC-mediated hippocampal tonus.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">The Optimal Target and Connectivity for Deep Brain Stimulation in Lennox–Gastaut Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) can reduce seizures in Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (LGS). However, little is known about the optimal target and whether efficacy depends on connectivity of the stimulation site. Using outcome data from the ESTEL trial, we aimed to determine the optimal target and connectivity for DBS in LGS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 20 patients underwent bilateral DBS of the thalamic centromedian nucleus (CM). Outcome was percentage seizure reduction from baseline after 3 months of DBS, defined using three measures (monthly seizure diaries, 24-hour scalp electroencephalography [EEG], and a novel diary-EEG composite). Probabilistic stimulation mapping identified thalamic locations associated with higher/lower efficacy. Two substitute diffusion MRI datasets (a normative dataset from healthy subjects and a “disease-matched” dataset from a separate group of LGS patients) were used to calculate structural connectivity between DBS sites and a map of areas known to express epileptic activity in LGS, derived from our previous EEG-fMRI research.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Results were similar across the three outcome measures. Stimulation was most efficacious in the anterior and inferolateral “parvocellular” CM border, extending into the ventral lateral nucleus (posterior subdivision). There was a positive association between diary-EEG composite seizure reduction and connectivity to areas of <i>a priori</i> EEG-fMRI activation, including premotor and prefrontal cortex, putamen, and pontine brainstem.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Nonapoptotic caspases in neural development and in anesthesia-induced neurotoxicity</a></h4>

              
                Apoptosis, classically initiated by caspase pathway activation, plays a prominent role during normal brain development as well as in neurodegeneration. The noncanonical, nonlethal arm of the caspase pathway is evolutionarily conserved and has also been implicated in both processes, yet is relatively understudied. Dysregulated pathway activation during critical periods of neurodevelopment due to environmental neurotoxins or exposure to compounds such as anesthetics can have detrimental consequences for brain maturation and long-term effects on behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/inpress.rss">Delta spike P681R mutation enhances SARS-CoV-2 fitness over Alpha variant</a></h4>

              
                It is important to identify mutations that account for the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Liu et al. show that Delta spike mutation P681R enhances the cleavage of full-length spike to S1 and S2, which improves cell surface-mediated virus entry and leads to the Alpha-to-Delta variant replacement.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neuronal apoptosis drives remodeling states of microglia and shifts in survival pathway dependence</a></h4>

              
                Microglia serve critical remodeling roles that shape the developing nervous system, responding to the changing neural environment with phagocytosis or soluble factor secretion. Recent single-cell sequencing (scRNAseq) studies have revealed the context-dependent diversity in microglial properties and gene expression, but the cues promoting this diversity are not well defined. Here, we ask how interactions with apoptotic neurons shape microglial state, including lysosomal and lipid metabolism gene expression and dependence on Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) for survival. Using early postnatal mouse retina, a CNS region undergoing significant developmental remodeling, we performed scRNAseq on microglia from mice that are wild-type, lack neuronal apoptosis (Bax KO), or are treated with CSF1R inhibitor (PLX3397). We find that interactions with apoptotic neurons drives multiple microglial remodeling states, subsets of which are resistant to CSF1R inhibition. We find that TAM receptor Mer and complement receptor 3 are required for clearance of apoptotic neurons, but that Mer does not drive expression of remodeling genes. We show TAM receptor Axl is negligible for phagocytosis or remodeling gene expression but is consequential for microglial survival in the absence of CSF1R signaling. Thus, interactions with apoptotic neurons shift microglia towards distinct remodeling states and through Axl, alter microglial dependence on survival pathway, CSF1R.

                When people perform the same task repeatedly, their behavior becomes habitual, or inflexible to changes in the goals or structure of a task. While habits have been hypothesized to be a key aspect of motor skill acquisition, there has been little empirical work investigating the relationship between skills and habits. To better understand this relationship, we examined whether and when people's behavior would become habitual as they learned a challenging new motor skill. After up to ten days of practice, we altered the structure of the task to assess whether participants would flexibly adjust their behavior or habitually persist in performing the task the way they originally learned. We found that participants' behavior became habitual early in practice--after only two days--at which point they were still relatively unskilled. These data demonstrate that motor skills become habitual after relatively little training, but can nevertheless further improve with practice.

                Inhibitory control improves into young adulthood after specialization of relevant brain systems during adolescence. However, the biological mechanisms supporting this unique transition are not well understood. Given that adolescence is defined by pubertal maturation, we examined relative contributions of chronological age and pubertal maturation to inhibitory control development. 105 8-19-year-olds completed 1-5 longitudinal visits (227 visits total) in which pubertal development was assessed via self-reported Tanner stage and inhibitory control was assessed with an in-scanner antisaccade task. As expected, percent and latency of correct antisaccade responses improved with age and pubertal stage. When controlling for pubertal stage, chronological age was distinctly associated with correct response rate. In contrast, pubertal stage was uniquely associated with antisaccade latency even when controlling for age. Chronological age was associated with fMRI task activation in several regions including the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, while puberty was associated with right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) activation. Furthermore, task-related connectivity between VLPFC and cingulate was associated with both pubertal stage and response latency. These results suggest that while age-related developmental processes may support maturation of brain systems underlying the ability to inhibit a response, puberty may play a larger role in the effectiveness of generating cognitive control responses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sensory regulation of absence seizures in a mouse model of Gnb1 encephalopathy</a></h4>

              
                Absence seizures, a type of non-convulsive epilepsy manifested by spike-wave discharges (SWD) in the electroencephalogram (EEG), display synchronous reciprocal excitation between the neocortex and thalamus. Recent studies have revealed that inhibitory neurons in the reticular thalamic (RT) nucleus and excitatory thalamocortical (TC) neurons are two key subcortical players in generating SWD. However, the signals that drive SWD-related thalamic activity remain elusive. Here, we show that SWD predominately occurs during wakefulness in several mouse models of absence epilepsy. In more focused studies of Gnb1 mutant mice, we found that sensory input regulates SWD. Using in vivo recording, we demonstrate that TC cells are activated prior to the onset of SWD and then inhibited during SWD. On the contrary, RT cells are slightly inhibited prior to SWD, but are strongly activated during SWD. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation of TC cells leads to the enhancement of SWD in Gnb1 mice. Together, our results indicate that sensory input in the periphery can regulate SWD by activating the thalamocortical pathway.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Neuropeptidergic Signaling Pathway for Olfactory Gain Modulation</a></h4>

              
                Sensory systems are dynamically adjusted according to the animal's ongoing needs by neuromodulators, such as neuropeptides. Despite their prevalence across all nervous systems, how peptidergic neurons and the neuropeptide they release act to adjust sensory processing remains poorly understood. Here, we reveal that a heterogeneous ensemble of local interneurons (LNs) release the neuropeptide myoinhibitory peptide (MIP) within the Drosophila primary olfactory center (the antennal lobe, AL). We find MIPergic LNs form reciprocal connections with many AL principal neurons, but only a subset express the inhibitory MIP receptor (sex peptide receptor, SPR). We find both the MIPergic LNs and several of the SPR-expressing neurons are activated by the food-related odor apple cider vinegar (ACV), therefore suggesting MIP plays a role in adjusting ACV responses within the AL. We demonstrate that MIP can simultaneously decrease olfactory input to some glomeruli, while indirectly increasing olfactory input to others. As those glomeruli boosted by MIP -- as well as MIP itself -- are necessary and sufficient to initiate an attractive behavioral response to ACV, the neural substrates identified here may represent a key circuit element for the animal's switch in behavioral responses.

                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by synaptic loss and neuronal network dysfunction. These network deficits are mediated by early alterations in neuronal firing rates that coincide with amyloid plaque accumulation. Mounting evidence supports that inhibitory networks are impaired in AD, but the mechanisms driving these inhibitory deficits are poorly understood. Here we use in vivo multiphoton calcium imaging to determine the relationship between amyloid accumulation and the spontaneous activity of excitatory neurons and inhibitory interneurons in an APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. We show that somatostatin-expressing (SOM) interneurons are hyperactive, while parvalbumin-expressing interneurons are hypoactive in APP/PS1 mice. Only SOM interneuron hyperactivity correlated with proximity to amyloid plaque. These inhibitory deficits were accompanied by decreased excitatory neurons activity and decreased pairwise activity correlations in APP/PS1 mice. Our study identifies cell-specific interneuronal firing deficits driven by amyloid pathology in APP/PS1 mice and provides new insights for targeting inhibitory circuits in Alzheimer's disease.

                Rod photoreceptor degeneration causes deterioration in the morphology and physiology of cone photoreceptors along with changes in retinal circuits. These changes could diminish visual signaling at cone-mediated light levels, thereby limiting the efficacy of treatments such as gene therapy for rescuing normal, cone-mediated vision. However, the impact of progressive rod death on cone-mediated signaling remains unclear. A mouse model of rod degeneration was used to investigate the fidelity of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) signaling throughout disease progression. Despite clear deterioration of cone morphology with rod death, cone-mediated signaling among RGCs remained surprisingly robust: spatiotemporal receptive fields changed little and the mutual information between stimuli and spiking responses was relatively constant. This relative stability held until nearly all rods had died and cones had completely lost well-formed outer segments. Interestingly, RGC information rates were higher and more stable for natural movies than checkerboard noise as degeneration progressed. The main change in RGC responses with photoreceptor degeneration was a decrease in response gain. These results suggest that gene therapies for rod degenerative diseases are likely to successfully prolong cone-mediated vision even if there are changes to cone morphology and density.

                Cognitive decline with age is associated with brain atrophy and reduced brain activations, but the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms are unclear, especially in deeper brain structures primarily affected by healthy aging or neurodegenerative processes. Here, we characterize time-resolved, resting-state magnetoencephalography activity of the hippocampus and subcortical brain regions in a large cohort of healthy young and older volunteers from the Cam-CAN open repository. The data show age-related changes in both rhythmic and arrhythmic signal strength and temporal variability in multiple deeper brain regions, including the hippocampus, striatum, and thalamus. We observe a slowing of neural activity in deeper brain regions, which echoes previous reports of cortical slowing. We also report reduced occipito-parietal alpha peak associated with increased theta-band activity and signal variability in the hippocampus, an effect that may reflect compensatory processes as theta activity and variability were more strongly expressed when cognitive performances are preserved. Overall, this study advances the understanding of the biological nature of inter-individual variability in aging. The data provide new insight of how hippocampus and subcortical neurophysiological activity evolve with biological age, and highlight frequency-specific effects associated with cognitive decline vs. cognitive maintenance.

                Performance changes dramatically both across (eccentricity) and around (polar angle) the visual field. All neurophysiological and virtually all behavioral studies of cortical magnification investigate eccentricity effects without considering polar angle. But, does cortical magnification underlie differences around the visual field? We magnified stimulus size according to eccentricity and polar angle to equate their cortical representation. We found that magnifying the stimulus eliminates differences across --but not around-- the visual field.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">SARM1 activation and its downstream pathways are distinct in neuronal compartments</a></h4>

              
                Sterile alpha and TIR motif containing 1 (SARM1) is a critical regulator of axon degeneration that acts through hydrolysis of NAD+ following injury. Recent work has defined the structure and catalytic activity of SARM1, yet the specific pathways controlled by SARM1 following diverse neuronal insults are not well defined. Here we show that the mechanisms of SARM1 activation and downstream signaling pathways are both context and localization dependent. Endogenous SARM1 is present in axons, dendrites and cell bodies and is primarily localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane. In cultured hippocampal neurons, knockout of SARM1 protects axons from degeneration by treatment with mitochondrial toxins but does not affect the degeneration of other cell compartments. In contrast, direct activation of SARM1 leads to degeneration of axons, dendrites, and cell bodies, indicating that SARM1 is present and can be activated in these neuronal compartments. Inhibition of dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK, MAP3K12) and caspases were not protective in these paradigms, though both SARM1-dependent and independent dendrite degeneration required calpain activity. Together, these results demonstrate that SARM1 activation is not specific to axons though distinct pathways regulate degeneration in axons and dendrites.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Diverse states and stimuli tune olfactory receptor expression levels to modulate food-seeking behavior</a></h4>

              
                Animals must weigh competing needs and states to generate adaptive behavioral responses to the environment. Sensorimotor circuits are thus tasked with integrating diverse external and internal cues relevant to these needs to generate context-appropriate behaviors. However, the mechanisms that underlie this integration are largely unknown. Here, we show that a wide range of states and stimuli converge upon a single C. elegans olfactory neuron to modulate food-seeking behavior. Using an unbiased ribotagging approach, we find that the expression of olfactory receptor genes in the AWA olfactory neuron is influenced by a wide array of states and stimuli, including feeding state, physiological stress, and recent sensory cues. We identify odorants that activate these state-dependent olfactory receptors and show that altered expression of these receptors influences food-seeking and foraging. Further, we dissect the molecular and neural circuit pathways through which these diverse cues are integrated by AWA. This reveals a modular organization in which state-related signals arising from different cell types in the body converge on AWA and independently control chemoreceptor expression. The synthesis of these signals by AWA allows animals to generate sensorimotor responses that reflect the animal's overall state. Our findings suggest a general model in which state-dependent transcriptional changes at the sensory periphery modulate animals' sensorimotor responses to meet their ongoing needs and states.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">tDCS induced GABA change is associated with the simulated electric field in M1, an effect mediated by grey matter volume in the MRS voxel</a></h4>

              
                Background and Objective: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has wide ranging applications in neuro-behavioural and physiological research, and in neurological rehabilitation. However, it is currently limited by substantial inter-subject variability in responses, which may be explained, at least in part, by anatomical differences that lead to variability in the electric field (E-field) induced in the cortex. Here, we tested whether the variability in the E-field in the stimulated cortex during tDCS, estimated using computational simulations, explains the variability in tDCS induced changes in GABA, a neurophysiological marker of stimulation effect. Methods: Data from five previously conducted MRS studies were combined. The anode was placed over the left primary motor cortex (M1, 3 studies, N = 24) or right temporal cortex (2 studies, N = 32), with the cathode over the contralateral supraorbital ridge. Single voxel spectroscopy was performed in a 2x2x2cm voxel under the anode in all cases. MRS data were acquired before and either during or after 1mA tDCS using either a sLASER sequence (7T) or a MEGA-PRESS sequence (3T). sLASER MRS data were analysed using LCModel, and MEGA-PRESS using FID-A and Gannet. E-fields were simulated in a finite element model of the head, based on individual MPRAGE images, using SimNIBS. Separate linear mixed effects models were run for each E-field variable (mean and 95th percentile; magnitude, and components normal and tangential to grey matter surface, within the MRS voxel). The model included effects of time (pre or post tDCS), E-field, grey matter volume in the MRS voxel, and a 3-way interaction between time, E-field and grey matter volume. Additionally, we ran a permutation analysis using PALM to determine whether E-field anywhere in the brain, not just in the MRS voxel, correlated with GABA change. Results: In M1, higher mean E-field magnitude was associated with greater tDCS-induced decreases in GABA (t(24) = 3.24, p = 0.003). Further, the association between mean E-field magnitude and GABA change was moderated by the grey matter volume in the MRS voxel (t(24) = -3.55, p = 0.002). These relationships were consistent across all E-field variables except the mean of the normal component. No significant relationship was found between tDCS-induced GABA decrease and E-field in the temporal voxel. No significant clusters were found in the whole brain analysis. Conclusions: Our data suggest that the electric field induced by tDCS within the brain is variable, and is significantly related to tDCS-induced decrease in GABA, a key neurophysiological marker of stimulation. These findings strongly support individualised dosing of tDCS, at least in M1. Further studies examining E-fields in relation to other outcome measures, including behaviour, will help determine the optimal E-fields required for any desired effects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">ALFF Response Interaction With Learning During Feedback in Individuals With Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) is defined as changes of BOLD signal during resting state (RS) brain activity. Previous studies identified differences in RS activation between healthy and multiple sclerosis (MS) participants. However, no research has investigated the relationship between ALFF and learning in MS. We thus examine this here. Twenty-five MS and 19 healthy participants performed a paired-associate word learning task where participants were presented with extrinsic or intrinsic performance feedback. Compared to healthy participants, MS participants showed higher local brain activation in the right thalamus. We also observed a positive correlation in the MS group between ALFF and extrinsic feedback within the left inferior frontal gyrus, and within the left superior temporal gyrus in association with intrinsic feedback. Healthy participants showed a positive correlation in the right fusiform gyrus between ALFF and extrinsic feedback. Findings suggest that while MS participants do not show a feedback learning impairment compared to the healthy participants, ALFF differences might suggest a general maladaptive pattern of task unrelated thalamic activation and adaptive activation in frontal and temporal regions. Results indicate that ALFF can be successfully used at capturing pathophysiological changes in local brain activation in MS in association with learning through feedback.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural dynamics and architecture of the heading direction circuit in a vertebrate brain</a></h4>

              
                Animals can use different strategies to navigate. They may guide their movements by relying on external cues in their environment or, alternatively, by using an internal cognitive map of the space around them and their position within it. An essential part of this representation are heading cells, neurons whose activity depends on the heading direction of the animal. Although those cells have been found in vertebrates, the full network has never been observed and there is very little mechanistic understanding of how these cells acquire their response properties. In this study, we use volumetric functional imaging in larval zebrafish to observe, for the first time in a vertebrate, a full network that encodes allocentric heading direction. This network of approximately one hundred inhibitory neurons is arranged in an anatomical circle in the anterior hindbrain. Its activity is driven purely by the integration of internally generated signals, indicating that a simple vertebrate brain can encode maps of how an animal moves within its surroundings. Single cell reconstructions of electron micrographs allow us to uncover how the connectivity pattern of neurons within the network supports the implementation of a ring attractor network. The neurons we identify share features with neurons in the dorsal tegmentum nucleus of rodents and the fly central complex, showing that similar connectivity and mechanistic principles underlie the generation of cognitive maps of heading direction across the animal kingdom.
