              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Epidemiology, survival and clinical characteristics of inclusion body myositis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We performed a population-based study on inclusion body myositis with the primary aims to define the prevalence, survival rate and incidence and to investigate the symptom profiles associated with disease duration and sex over a 33-year period.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients diagnosed between 1985 and 2017 in Region Västra Götaland, Sweden were identified according to the European Neuromuscular Centre diagnostic criteria from 2011.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 128 patients, 89 men and 39 women with the strict clinico-pathologically definition of inclusion body myositis. The prevalence was 32 per million inhabitants, 19 per million women and 45 per million men December 31st 2017. Mean incidence was 2.5 per million inhabitants and year. Mean age at symptom onset was 64.4 years with quadriceps weakness being the most common presenting symptom followed by finger flexor weakness. Dysphagia was a common presenting symptom being more frequent in women (23%) than men (10%) and was during the disease course reported in 74% of men and 84% of women. Seventy-three patients were deceased, with mean survival of 14 years from symptom onset. Survival rate from both diagnosis date and symptom onset was decreased compared to the matched population.</p>
<p>Twenty-one percent of the patients had an additional autoimmune disease. A cross-sectional analysis of autoantibodies in 50 patients and 28 matched controls showed autoantibodies to cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase 1A in 40% of the patients and 3.6% of controls.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Inclusion body myositis is an autoimmune disease with decreased survival rate and with marked sex differences in both prevalence and clinical manifestations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">MRI EVALUATION OF PERIVASCULAR SPACE ABNORMALITIES IN NEUROMYELITIS OPTICA</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Astrocytes outline the perivascular space (PVS) and regulate fluids exchange through the aquaporin-4 water channel. Since neuromyelitis optica is an autoimmune astrocytopathy targeting aquaporin-4, we hypothesize that it could be associatied with PVS abnormalities.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Thirty-four patients and 46 age- and sex-matched healthy controls from two independent cohorts (exploratory- and validation-dataset) underwent a standardized 3.0 T MRI protocol including conventional and diffusion-tensor imaging. Susceptibility-weighted imaging was also acquired in the exploratory-dataset. We evaluated macroscopic and microstructural abnormalities of PVS in terms of enlargement and water diffusivity (DTI-ALPS index). In the exploration-dataset, susceptibility-weighted sequence was used to draw the regions of interest for the DTI-ALPS index calculation in areas having veins perpendicular to lateral ventricles. Between-group comparisons, correlations and regression models were run to assess associations between PVS abnormalities, clinical and MRI variables.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients had higher frequency of severe PVS enlargement in the centrum semiovale (29.4% <i>vs</i>. 8.7%), which correlated with brain, deep grey matter atrophy and poorer cognitive performance (r values range: -0.44, -0.36; p values: 0.01-0.046).</p>
<p>In both datasets, patients had reduced DTI-ALPS index compared to controls (p values: 0.004-0.038). Lower DTI-ALPS index, deep grey matter volume and cortical volume could discriminate between patients and controls (R<sup>2</sup>=0.62), while lower DTI-ALPS index, higher number of myelitis, and higher T2-lesion volume associated with worse disability (R<sup>2</sup>=0.55).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder are characterized by abnormal enlargement and impaired water diffusion along PVS, whose clinical implications suggest a direct correlation with disease pathogenesis and its severity.</p>

<p>We have determined cuprizone demyelination and remyelination is correlated with a loss and restoration of bladder continence. Interestingly, while cuprizone-induced CNS demyelination severely affected conscious (cortical) urinary behavior, the brainstem and spinal cord reflex remained unchanged.

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, progressively debilitating demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Nearly 80% of MS patients experience lower urinary tract dysfunction early in their diagnosis. This significantly affects the quality of life, and in latter stages of disease is a leading cause of hospitalization. Previously, animal models have shown that inflammatory demyelination in the CNS causes profound bladder dysfunction, but the confounding influence of systemic inflammation limits the potential interpretation of the contribution of CNS demyelination to bladder dysfunction. Since the micturition circuit has myelinated neuronal connections in the cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord, we examined alterations in bladder function in the cuprizone model characterized by demyelinating lesions in the cortex and corpus callosum that are independent of T-cell–mediated autoimmunity. Herein, we report that a 4-week dietary cuprizone treatment in C57Bl/6J mice induced alterations in voiding behavior with increased micturition frequency and reduced volume voided, similar to human MS bladder dysfunction. Subsequently, recovery from cuprizone treatment restored normal bladder function. Demyelination and remyelination were confirmed by Luxol Fast Blue staining of the corpus callosum. Additionally, we also determined that an 8-week cuprizone treatment, resulting in chronic demyelination lacking spontaneous remyelination potential, is associated with an exacerbated voiding phenotype. Interestingly, while cuprizone-induced CNS demyelination severely affected conscious (cortical) urinary behavior, the brainstem and spinal cord reflex remained unchanged, as confirmed by urethane-anesthetized cystometry. This is the first study to show that cortical demyelination independent of inflammation can negatively impact urinary function.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inhibitory interneurons within the deep dorsal horn integrate convergent sensory input to regulate motor performance</a></h4>

              
                To achieve smooth motor performance in a rich and changing sensory environment, motor output must be constantly updated in response to sensory feedback. Although proprioception and cutaneous information are known to modulate motor output, it is unclear whether they work together in the spinal cord to shape complex motor actions such as locomotion. Here we identify the medial deep dorsal horn (mDDH) as a hot zone of convergent proprioception and cutaneous input for locomotion. Due to increased responsiveness to sensory input, inhibitory interneurons in the mDDH area are preferentially recruited in locomotion. To study inhibitory interneurons in this area, we utilize an intersectional genetic strategy to isolate and ablate a population of parvalbumin-expressing glycinergic interneurons in the mDDH (dPVs). Using histological and electrophysiological methods we find that dPVs integrate proprioceptive and cutaneous inputs while targeting ventral horn motor networks, suggesting a role in multimodal sensory processing for locomotion. Consistent with this, dPVs ablation alters step cycle parameters and kinematics in a speed and phase dependent manner. Finally, we use EMG muscle recordings to directly show that dPVs are part of a cutaneous-motor pathway. Our results indicate that dPVs form a critical node in the spinal sensorimotor circuitry.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Two therapeutic CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing approaches revert FTD/ALS cellular pathology caused by a C9orf72 repeat expansion mutation in patient derived cells</a></h4>

              
                CRISPR gene editing holds promise to cure or arrest genetic disease, if we can find and implement curative edits reliably, safely and effectively. Expansion of a hexanucleotide repeat in C9orf72 is the leading known genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We evaluated three approaches to editing the mutant C9orf72 gene for their ability to correct pathology in neurons derived from patient iPSCs: excision of the repeat region, excision of the mutant allele, and excision of regulatory region exon 1A. All three approaches normalized RNA abnormalities and TDP-43 pathology, but only repeat excision and mutant allele excision completely eliminated pathologic dipeptide repeats. Our work sheds light on the complex regulation of the C9orf72 gene and suggests that because of sense and anti-sense transcription, silencing a single regulatory region may not reverse all pathology. Our work also provides a roadmap for evaluating CRISPR gene correction using patient iPSCs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Increased GABA transmission to GnRH neurons after intrahippocampal kainic acid injection in mice is sex-specific and associated with estrous cycle disruption</a></h4>

              
                Patients with epilepsy develop reproductive endocrine comorbidities at a rate higher than that of the general population. Clinical studies have identified disrupted luteinizing hormone (LH) release patterns in patients of both sexes, suggesting potential epilepsy-associated changes in hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neuron function. In previous work, we found that GnRH neuron firing is increased in diestrous females and males in the intrahippocampal kainic acid (IHKA) mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Notably, GABAA receptor activation is depolarizing in adult GnRH neurons. Therefore, here we tested the hypothesis that increased GnRH neuron firing in IHKA mice is associated with increased GABAergic drive to GnRH neurons. When ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) were blocked to isolate GABAergic postsynaptic currents (PSCs), no differences in PSC frequency were seen between GnRH neurons from control and IHKA diestrous females. In the absence of iGluR blockade, however, GABA PSC frequency was increased in GnRH neurons from IHKA females with disrupted estrous cycles, but not saline-injected controls nor IHKA females without estrous cycle disruption. GABA PSC amplitude was also increased in IHKA females with disrupted estrous cycles. These findings suggest the presence of an iGluR-dependent increase in feed-forward GABAergic transmission to GnRH neurons specific to IHKA females with comorbid cycle disruption. In males, GABA PSC frequency and amplitude were unchanged but PSC duration was reduced. Together, these findings suggest that increased GABA transmission helps drive elevated firing in IHKA females on diestrus and indicate the presence of a sex-specific hypothalamic mechanism underlying reproductive endocrine dysfunction in IHKA mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cerebellum Directly Modulates the Substantia Nigra Dopaminergic Activity</a></h4>

              
                Evidence of direct reciprocal connections between the cerebellum and basal ganglia has challenged the long-held notion that these structures function independently. While anatomical studies have suggested the presence of cerebellar projections to the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), the nature and function of these connections (Cb-SNc) is unknown. Here we show that the Cb-SNc form monosynaptic glutamatergic synapses with both dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic neurons in the SNc. Optogenetic activation Cb-SNc axons in the SNc rapidly increases SNc activity, elevates striatal dopamine levels, and increases the probability of locomotion. During ongoing behavior, Cb-SNc axons are bilaterally activated prior to ambulation and unilateral lever manipulation. The Cb-SNc axons show prominent activation to water reward, and higher activation for sweet water, suggesting that the pathway also encodes reward value. Thus, the cerebellum directly, rapidly, and effectively modulates basal ganglia dopamine levels and conveys information related to movement initiation, vigor, and possibly reward processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical circuits modulate mouse social vocalizations</a></h4>

              
                Vocalizations provide a means of communication with high fidelity and information rate for many species. Male mice emit ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) during female courtship. Diencephalon and brainstem neural circuits have been shown to control the production of USVs, however, the role of cortical circuits in this process is debatable. We show that male mice produced USVs following intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) in a specific location of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Moreover, ACC Ca2+-imaging showed an increase in Ca2+ dynamics preceding USV initiation. Optogenetically suppressing ACC activity caused mice to emit fewer USVs during courtship. Neuropixel electrophysiological recordings in head-restrained male mice indicated a differential increase in neural activity in response to female social exposure (SE). The firing rate in SE trials where USVs were emitted was significantly higher when compared to SE leading to silence. Taken together, these results indicate that the ACC is a key node in the neuronal circuits controlling USV production.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Divergent projections from Locus Coeruleus to the cortico-basal ganglia system and ventral tegmental area of the zebra finch.</a></h4>

              
                The locus coeruleus (LC) is a small brainstem nucleus that is the primary source of noradrenaline (NA) throughout the vertebrate brain. Understanding the anatomical organization of the LC is important because NA plays a central role in regulating arousal, attention, and performance. In the mammalian brain, individual LC neurons make highly divergent axonal projections to different brain regions, which are distinguished in part by which NA receptor subtypes they express. Here we sought to determine whether similar organizational features - divergent LC projections acting regionally through different receptor subtypes - characterize cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuitry important to birdsong learning and performance. Single and dual retrograde tracer injections reveal that single LC-NA neurons make divergent projections to both cortical and basal ganglia components of this circuit, as well as to dopaminergic nuclei that innervate this circuit. Moreover, in situ hybridization revealed that differential expression of the 2A and 2C adrenoreceptor distinguish LC-recipient song nuclei. Therefore, LC - NA signaling in the songbird CBG circuit could employ a similar strategy as in mammals, which allows a relatively small number of LC neurons to exert widespread yet distinct effects across multiple brain regions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Local synaptic inhibition mediates cerebellar pattern separation necessary for learned sensorimotor associations</a></h4>

              
                The cerebellar cortex plays a key role in generating predictive sensorimotor associations. To do so, the granule cell layer is thought to establish unique sensorimotor representations for learning. However, how this is achieved, and how granule cell population responses contribute to behavior, has remained unclear. To address these questions, we have used in vivo calcium imaging and granule cell specific pharmacological manipulation of synaptic inhibition in awake, behaving mice. We find that inhibition sparsens and thresholds sensory responses, limiting overlap between sensory ensembles, and preventing spiking in many granule cells that receive excitatory input. Moreover, we find that inhibition can be recruited in a stimulus-specific manner to powerfully decorrelate multisensory ensembles. Consistent with these results, we find that granule cell inhibition is required for sensory discrimination in a cerebellum-dependent behavior. These data thus reveal new mechanisms for granule cell layer pattern separation beyond those envisioned by classical models.

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disease that is increasingly becoming a global threat to the health and life of the elderly worldwide. Although there are some drugs clinically available for treating PD, these treatments can only alleviate the symptoms of PD patients but cannot completely cure the disease. Therefore, exploring other potential mechanisms to develop more effective treatments that can modify the course of PD is still highly desirable. Over the last two decades, histone deacetylases, as an important group of epigenetic targets, have attracted much attention in drug discovery. This review focused on the current knowledge about histone deacetylases involved in PD pathophysiology and their inhibitors used in PD studies. Further perspectives related to small molecules that can inhibit or degrade histone deacetylases to treat PD were also discussed.</p>

	<p>Background: Inflammation, particularly cytokine release, contributes to epileptogenesis by influencing the cerebral tissue remodeling and neuronal excitability that occurs after a precipitating epileptogenic insult. While several cytokines have been explored in this process, release kinetics are less well investigated. Determining the time course of cytokine release in the epileptogenic zone is necessary for precisely timed preventive or therapeutic anti-inflammatory interventions. Methods: Hippocampal extracellular levels of six cytokines and chemokines (IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, IL-6, IL-10, CCL2, CCL3, and CCL5) were quantified at various time points during epileptogenesis in a rat model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (mTLE-HS) using microdialysis (MD). Results: The analysis of microdialysates demonstrated consistent elevation at all time points during epileptogenesis for IL-1&amp;amp;beta; and IL-10. IL-10 release was maximal on day 1, IL-1&amp;amp;beta; release peaked at day 8. No correlation between local hippocampal IL-1&amp;amp;beta; concentrations and IL-1&amp;amp;beta; blood levels was found. Conclusion: The release kinetics of IL-1&amp;amp;beta; are consistent with its established pro-epileptogenic properties, while the kinetics of IL-10 suggest a counter-regulatory effect. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of intraindividual longitudinal monitoring of hippocampal molecular inflammatory processes via repetitive MD over several weeks and sheds light on the kinetics of hippocampal cytokine release during epileptogenesis.</p>

	<p>Pain is a minor problem compared with other Huntington Disease (HD) symptoms. Nevertheless, in HD it is poorly recognized and underestimated. So far, no study evaluated the presence of chronic pain in HD. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the presence and features of chronic pain in a cohort of HD gene carriers. An observational cross-sectional study was conducted in a cohort of HD gene carriers compared to not gene carriers (n.134 HD subjects, n.74 not gene mutation carriers). A specific pain interview, alongside a neurological, cognitive and behavioural examination, was performed in order to classify the type of pain, subjective intensity. A significant prevalence of &amp;amp;ldquo;no Pain&amp;amp;rdquo; in HD was found, which tended to increase with HD progression and a reduced frequency of pain in the last 3 months. A clear difference was found between manifest and premanifest HD in terms of intensity of pain, which did not change significantly with HD progression; however, a tendency emerges to a progressive reduction. No significant group difference was present in analgesic use, type and the site of pain. These findings could support a lower prevalence of chronic pain in manifest HD. Prevalence and intensity of chronic pain seem directly influenced by the process of neurodegeneration rather than by an incorrect cognitive and emotional functioning.</p>

	<p>Objective: Although some meta-analyses have shown a correlation between a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and low survival in patients with gliomas, their conclusions are controversial, and no study has specifically explored the relationship between a high pre-treatment and pre-operative NLR and low survival in patients with glioblastoma (GBM). Therefore, we further investigated this correlation through meta-analysis. Methods: We searched the PubMed, Metstr, and Cochrane databases in March 2022 for published literature related to high pre-treatment and pre-operative NLR and low survival in patients with GBM. The literature was rigorously searched according to inclusion and exclusion criteria to calculate the overall hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) corresponding to a high NLR using a random effects model. Results: The total HR for the pre-treatment and pre-operative NLR was 1.46 (95% CI: 1.17&amp;amp;ndash;1.75, p = 0.000, I2 = 76.5%), indicating a significant association between a high pre-treatment and pre-operative NLR, and low overall survival in patients with GBM. Sub-group analysis was performed because of the high heterogeneity. The results for the sub-group with a cut-off value of 4 showed an HR of 1.39 (95% CI: 1.12&amp;amp;ndash;1.65, p = 0.000, I2 = 22.2%), with significantly low heterogeneity, whereas those for the sub-group without a cut-off value of 4 showed an HR of 1.45 (95% CI: 1.01&amp;amp;ndash;1.89, p = 0.000, I2 = 83.3%). Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrate that a high pre-treatment and pre-operative NLR suggests low survival in patients with GBM based on data from a large sample. Furthermore, the meta-regression analysis results indicate that underlying data, such as age and extent of surgical resection, lead to a high degree of heterogeneity, providing a theoretical basis for further research.</p>

	<p>Motor coordination abilities are related to cognitive abilities and academic achievement in children with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the similarities and differences of these relationships in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD) have not been explored. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between motor coordination abilities, cognitive abilities, and academic achievement in Japanese children with ASD and AD/HD. Participants included 20 children with ASD, 20 children with AD/HD, and 20 typically developing children, matched for age and gender. Their motor coordination abilities were assessed with the Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2 (MABC-2). Furthermore, cognitive ability and academic achievement were assessed with the Kauffman Assessment Battery for Children-II (K-ABCII). Results demonstrated that the MABC-2 Total score significantly correlated with the K-ABCII Simultaneous processing, Planning, Total cognitive ability, Writing and Arithmetic scores in children with ASD. However, in children with AD/HD, there was no significant correlation between MABC-2 and K-ABCII subscale scores. The results of this study indicated that the relationship between motor coordination ability, cognitive ability, and academic achievement differs between ASD and AD/HD. This difference might indicate the non-similarity of neurological characteristics and encourage consideration for an approach that accommodates the features of neurodevelopmental disorders in children.</p>

                Hydroxyurea (HU) alone has the potential to prevent one out of every three deaths due to sickle cell disease (SCD) and almost all forms of disabilities caused by SCD. However, in Tanzania, only one out of every six registered SCD patients in the SPARCO-Tanzania Sickle Cell Cohort use HU. We conducted studies to understand factors influencing utilization of HU in Tanzania and discovered that among the reason for low utilization of HU include HU is classified as anticancer medication, only hematologists are supposed to prescribe HU, limited HU prescription to only National and Specialized hospitals, a special permit is required to access HU using National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) scheme and limited importation and absence of local manufacturing of HU limit availability of this important drug in Tanzania. Therefore, with this brief, the government should allow prescription of HU to the district hospitals level, should allow all clinicians with a minimum of a Bachelor of Medicine to prescribe HU, and accessibility of HU through NHIF should be friendly.

                Background: Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease that has been linked to enhanced risks for atherosclerosis. The impact of asthma on cardiovascular disease risk in children is less well established. Asthma is defined by a history of respiratory symptoms and accompanied by airflow limitation, with heterogeneous clinical manifestations, and variability in the intensity of airway inflammation and remodeling. Endothelial microparticles (EMP) are biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction in several chronic diseases. Endothelial microparticles initiate an event of atherosclerotic plaque formation. Our study aimed to evaluate the role of endothelial microparticles in children with asthma. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed on a total of 50 children with asthma aged seven‒17 years. Children with asthma exacerbations, infections, and steroid use were excluded. Endothelial microparticles were measured with beads, and the fluorescence signal was measured using a flow cytometer. Pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Results: Based on the results from 50 asthmatic children, it was found that most children had a normal nutritional status, intermittent, and allergic asthma. The results of this study also showed that the circulation of asthmatic children found that the mean levels (µL) of CD31+/CD62E+, CD31+/CD62E-, and CD62E+/CD31- were 2,392.99 ± 7,787.94; 922.14 ± 1,554.03; 198.97 ± 387.68, with the average ratio of CD31+/CD62E+, which was ≤1.0 and identifies apoptosis. Path analysis results found that IL-6, TNF-α, and CD31+/CD62E- EMP played a role in peak expiratory flow rate (%PEFR, p = 0.02; p = 0.003; p = 0.04) in children with allergic asthma. Conclusions: Endothelial microparticles play a role on peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) in children with allergic asthma. Further study is needed to investigate the role of these biomarkers and their correlation with pro-inflammatory cytokines in the mechanism of atherosclerosis progression.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A juxtamembrane basolateral targeting motif regulates signaling through a TGF-β pathway receptor in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Aidan J. Peterson, Stephen J. Murphy, Melinda G. Mundt, MaryJane Shimell, Edward B. Leof, Michael B. O’Connor</p>

In polarized epithelial cells, receptor–ligand interactions can be restricted by different spatial distributions of the 2 interacting components, giving rise to an underappreciated layer of regulatory complexity. We explored whether such regulation occurs in the <i>Drosophila</i> wing disc, an epithelial tissue featuring the TGF-β family member Decapentaplegic (Dpp) as a morphogen controlling growth and patterning. Dpp protein has been observed in an extracellular gradient within the columnar cell layer of the disc, but also uniformly in the disc lumen, leading to the question of how graded signaling is achieved in the face of 2 distinctly localized ligand pools. We find the Dpp Type II receptor Punt, but not the Type I receptor Tkv, is enriched at the basolateral membrane and depleted at the junctions and apical surface. Wit, a second Type II receptor, shows a markedly different behavior, with the protein detected on all membrane regions but enriched at the apical side. Mutational studies identified a short juxtamembrane sequence required for basolateral restriction of Punt in both wing discs and mammalian Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. This basolateral targeting (BLT) determinant can dominantly confer basolateral localization on an otherwise apical receptor. Rescue of <i>punt</i> mutants with transgenes altered in the targeting motif showed that flies expressing apicalized Punt due to the lack of a functional BLT displayed developmental defects, female sterility, and significant lethality. We also show that apicalized Punt does not produce an ectopic signal, indicating that the apical pool of Dpp is not a significant signaling source even when presented with Punt. Instead, we find that basolateral presentation of Punt is required for optimal signaling. Finally, we present evidence that the BLT acts through polarized sorting machinery that differs between types of epithelia. This suggests a code whereby each epithelial cell type may differentially traffic common receptors to enable distinctive responses to spatially localized pools of extracellular ligands.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Multiple molecular events underlie stochastic switching between 2 heritable cell states in fungi</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Naomi Ziv, Lucas R. Brenes, Alexander Johnson</p>

Eukaryotic transcriptional networks are often large and contain several levels of feedback regulation. Many of these networks have the ability to generate and maintain several distinct transcriptional states across multiple cell divisions and to switch between them. In certain instances, switching between cell states is stochastic, occurring in a small subset of cells of an isogenic population in a seemingly homogenous environment. Given the scarcity and unpredictability of switching in these cases, investigating the determining molecular events is challenging. White-opaque switching in the fungal species <i>Candida albicans</i> is an example of stably inherited cell states that are determined by a complex transcriptional network and can serve as an experimentally accessible model system to study characteristics important for stochastic cell fate switching in eukaryotes. In standard lab media, genetically identical cells maintain their cellular identity (either “white” or “opaque”) through thousands of cell divisions, and switching between the states is rare and stochastic. By isolating populations of white or opaque cells, previous studies have elucidated the many differences between the 2 stable cell states and identified a set of transcriptional regulators needed for cell type switching and maintenance of the 2 cell types. Yet, little is known about the molecular events that determine the rare, stochastic switching events that occur in single cells. We use microfluidics combined with fluorescent reporters to directly observe rare switching events between the white and opaque states. We investigate the stochastic nature of switching by beginning with white cells and monitoring the activation of Wor1, a master regulator and marker for the opaque state, in single cells and throughout cell pedigrees. Our results indicate that switching requires 2 stochastic steps; first an event occurs that predisposes a lineage of cells to switch. In the second step, some, but not all, of those predisposed cells rapidly express high levels of Wor1 and commit to the opaque state. To further understand the rapid rise in Wor1, we used a synthetic inducible system in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> into which a controllable <i>C</i>. <i>albicans</i> Wor1 and a reporter for its transcriptional control region have been introduced. We document that Wor1 positive autoregulation is highly cooperative (Hill coefficient > 3), leading to rapid activation and producing an “all or none” rather than a graded response. Taken together, our results suggest that reaching a threshold level of a master regulator is sufficient to drive cell type switching in single cells and that an earlier molecular event increases the probability of reaching that threshold in certain small lineages of cells. Quantitative molecular analysis of the white-opaque circuit can serve as a model for the general understanding of complex circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Diet-responsive transcriptional regulation of insulin in a single neuron controls systemic metabolism</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ava Handley, Qiuli Wu, Tessa Sherry, Rebecca Cornell, Roger Pocock</p>

Metabolic homeostasis is coordinated through a robust network of signaling pathways acting across all tissues. A key part of this network is insulin-like signaling, which is fundamental for surviving glucose stress. Here, we show that <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> fed excess dietary glucose reduce insulin-1 (INS-1) expression specifically in the BAG glutamatergic sensory neurons. We demonstrate that INS-1 expression in the BAG neurons is directly controlled by the transcription factor ETS-5, which is also down-regulated by glucose. We further find that INS-1 acts exclusively from the BAG neurons, and not other INS-1-expressing neurons, to systemically inhibit fat storage via the insulin-like receptor DAF-2. Together, these findings reveal an intertissue regulatory pathway where regulation of insulin expression in a specific neuron controls systemic metabolism in response to excess dietary glucose.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Unleashing frugal innovation in private higher education institutions via intellectual capital and Information technology capability: a systematic literature review [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Given the persistent challenges to the higher education business model, private higher education institutions (PHEIs) are exploring myriad ways to increase enrolment and income, while aggressively managing spending. Many PHEIs are facing financial distress and struggling because of decreasing budgets and declining revenue. Thus, carving unique strategies that direct the institution to focus on its core competencies, making additional budget cuts without compromising quality, developing new revenue streams, embracing new technology, and offering affordable programs, will ultimately lead to financial success. Frugal innovation (FI) can shed light on these challenges. Methods: This paper presents a systematic literature review to investigate and analyse prior research that focused on FI within the sphere of intellectual capital (IC) and information technology capabilities (ITC) research, and their relationships in PHEIs. Transfield’s five phases were employed to extract journal articles published over a thirty-year period (1990 to 2020) from major online databases using keyword searches. Although an initial search generated 76,025 papers, the search for IC and FI yielded 41 papers, and finally only two papers were selected as they clearly related IC with FI. Results: There was a research gap in the literature published from 1990 to 2020 regarding IC applications to achieve FI. This work revealed that IC and ITC research for FI in PHEI remain insufficiently explored.   Conclusions: Further research is required on the evaluation model of IC, ITC and FI, methodologies, empirical analysis, and the development of measurement metrics. A limitation to this study is the number of keywords selected.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A systematic review of retinoic acid in the journey of spermatogonium to spermatozoa: From basic to clinical application [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Retinoic acid plays an essential role in testicular development and functions, especially spermatogenesis. We have reviewed the role of retinoic acid from basic (molecular) to clinical application. Methods: A search was conducted in the online database including PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus for English studies published in the last eight years about this issue. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines in assessing the studies we are going to investigate. Results: Studies indicated that retinoic acid plays an essential role during pluripotent stem cell migration and lineage commitment, cell differentiation, apoptosis, stem cell number regulation, and maturation arrest in spermatogenic cells. Retinoic acid can also affect related protein expression and signaling pathways at different stages of spermatogenesis. Four studies have applied retinoic acid to humans, all of them in the single-arm observational study. The results look promising but need further research with more controlled study methods, randomization, and large samples. Conclusions: This current systematic review emphasizes a novel retinoic acid mechanism that has not been well described in the literature previously on its functions during the first seven days of spermatogenesis, leading to new directions or explanations of male infertility cause and treatments as a part of reproductive health care.

<p>NURR1 regulates the production of dopamine. Dopamine is present in dopaminergic neurons to regulate movement and emotion and in blood to control cardiac functions. Here, we demonstrated motor impairment, increased brain DA level and heart rate in old NURR1-deficient mice independently from sex, although sex affects their spontaneous locomotion.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The transcription factor NURR1 is essential to the generation and maintenance of midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons and its deregulation is involved in the development of dopamine (DA)-associated brain disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). The old male NURR1 heterozygous knockout (NURR1-KO) mouse has been proposed as a model of PD due to its altered motor performance that was, however, not confirmed in a subsequent study. Based on these controversial results, we explored the effects of the NURR1 deficiency on locomotor activity, motor coordination, brain and plasma DA levels, blood pressure and heart rate of old mice, also focusing on the potential effect of sex. As a probable consequence of the role of NURR1 in DA pathway, we observed that the old NURR1-KO mouse is characterized by motor impairment, and increased brain DA level and heart rate, independently from sex. However, we also observed an alteration in spontaneous locomotor activity that only affects males. In conclusion, NURR1 deficiency triggers sex- and age-specific alterations of behavioral responses, of DA levels and cardiovascular abnormalities. Further studies in simplified systems will be necessary to dissect the mechanism underlying these observations.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Using a multi-cohort, Discovery-Replication-Validation design, we sought new plasma biomarkers that predict which PD individuals will experience cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In 108 Discovery Cohort PD individuals and 83 Replication Cohort PD individuals, we measured 940 plasma proteins on an aptamer-based platform. Using proteins associating with subsequent cognitive decline in both cohorts, we trained a logistic regression model to predict which PD patients showed fast (&gt;=1 point drop/year on Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)) vs. slow (&lt;1 point drop/year on MoCA) cognitive decline in the Discovery Cohort, testing it in the Replication Cohort. We developed alternate assays for the top three proteins and confirmed their ability to predict cognitive decline – defined by change in MoCA or development of incident Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or dementia – in a Validation Cohort of 118 PD individuals. We investigated the top plasma biomarker for causal influence by Mendelian randomization.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A model with only three proteins (Melanoma Inhibitory Activity Protein (MIA), C-Reactive Protein (CRP), albumin) separated Fast vs. Slow cognitive decline subgroups with an AUC of 0.80 in the Validation Cohort. Validation Cohort PD individuals in the top quartile of risk for cognitive decline based on this model were 4.4 times more likely to develop incident MCI or dementia than those in the lowest quartile. Genotypes at <i>MIA</i> SNP rs2233154 associated with MIA levels and cognitive decline, providing evidence for MIA's causal influence.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>An easily-obtained plasma-based predictor identifies PD individuals at risk for cognitive decline. MIA may participate causally in development of cognitive decline.</p>

     alt="Resveratrol inhibits the activity of acid-sensing ion channels in male rat dorsal root ganglion neurons"/>
<p>Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are expressed in nociceptive sensory neurons to detect changes in extracellular pH. Once ASICs are activated by H<sup>+</sup>, cation influx (largely Na<sup>+</sup>) will cause depolarization of membrane potentials and bursts of action potentials (APs), then resulting in pain. Resveratrol can inhibit ASICs, so that H<sup>+</sup> produces reduced responses in the amplitude of membrane currents and the number of APs, leading to a relief of acid-induced pain.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Resveratrol can relieve pain under various pain conditions. One of the mechanisms of resveratrol analgesia is the regulation of ion channels. Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are expressed predominantly in nociceptive sensory neurons to detect changes in extracellular pH. ASICs are important players in pain associated with tissue acidification. However, it is still unclear whether ASICs are resveratrol targets. Electrophysiological recordings showed that resveratrol decreased acid-induced and ASIC-mediated currents in male rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in a concentration-dependent manner. Resveratrol downwardly shifted the concentration–response curve for protons, suggesting that it inhibited ASICs not by changing the pH<sub>0.5</sub>, but by suppressing the proton-induced maximum response. It also suppressed acid-triggered action potentials in the rat DRG neurons. Finally, intraplantar pretreatment with resveratrol relieved acid-induced nociceptive responses in male rats in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicated that resveratrol inhibited ASIC-mediated electrophysiological activity and nociception, suggesting a novel peripheral mechanism underlying its analgesic effect.</p>

To validate the correct trajectory, microelectrode recordings (MER) or local field potential recordings (LFP) can be used to extend neuroanatomical information (defined by magnetic resonance imaging) with neurophysiological activity patterns recorded from micro- and macroelectrodes probing the surgical target site. Currently, these two sources of information (imaging vs. electrophysiology) are analyzed separately, while means to fuse both data streams have not been introduced.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">WhyD tailors surface polymers to prevent premature bacteriolysis and direct cell elongation in Streptococcus pneumoniae</a></h4>

              
                Penicillin and related antibiotics disrupt cell wall synthesis in bacteria causing the downstream misactivation of cell wall hydrolases called autolysins to induce cell lysis. Despite the clinical importance of this phenomenon, little is known about the factors that control autolysins and how penicillins subvert this regulation to kill cells. In the pathogen <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> (<i>Sp</i>), LytA is the major autolysin responsible for penicillin-induced bacteriolysis. We recently discovered that penicillin treatment of <i>Sp</i> causes a dramatic shift in surface polymer biogenesis in which cell wall-anchored teichoic acids (WTAs) increase in abundance at the expense of lipid-linked teichoic acids (LTAs). Because LytA binds to both species of teichoic acids, this change recruits the enzyme to its substrate where it cleaves the cell wall and elicits lysis. In this report, we identify WhyD (SPD_0880) as a new factor that controls the level of WTAs in <i>Sp</i> cells to prevent LytA misactivation during exponential growth and premature lysis. We show that WhyD is a WTA hydrolase that restricts the WTA content of the wall to areas adjacent to active PG synthesis. Our results support a model in which the WTA tailoring activity of WhyD during exponential growth directs PG remodeling activity required for proper cell elongation in addition to preventing autolysis by LytA.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mapping brain-wide excitatory projectome of primate prefrontal cortex at submicron resolution and comparison with diffusion tractography</a></h4>

              
                Resolving trajectories of axonal pathways in the primate prefrontal cortex remains crucial to gain insights into higher-order processes of cognition and emotion, which requires a comprehensive map of axonal projections linking demarcated subdivisions of prefrontal cortex and the rest of brain. Here, we report a mesoscale excitatory projectome issued from the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) to the entire macaque brain by using viral-based genetic axonal tracing in tandem with high-throughput serial two-photon tomography, which demonstrated prominent monosynaptic projections to other prefrontal areas, temporal, limbic, and subcortical areas, relatively weak projections to parietal and insular regions but no projections directly to the occipital lobe. In a common 3D space, we quantitatively validated an atlas of diffusion tractography-derived vlPFC connections with correlative green fluorescent protein-labeled axonal tracing, and observed generally good agreement except a major difference in the posterior projections of inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. These findings raise an intriguing question as to how neural information passes along long-range association fiber bundles in macaque brains, and call for the caution of using diffusion tractography to map the wiring diagram of brain circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Visceral organ morphogenesis via calcium-patterned muscle constrictions</a></h4>

              
                Organ architecture is often composed of multiple laminar tissues arranged in concentric layers. During morphogenesis, the initial geometry of visceral organs undergoes a sequence of folding, adopting a complex shape that is vital for function. Genetic signals are known to impact form, yet the dynamic and mechanical interplay of tissue layers giving rise to organs' complex shapes remains elusive. Here, we trace the dynamics and mechanical interactions of a developing visceral organ across tissue layers, from sub-cellular to organ scale in vivo. Combining deep tissue light-sheet microscopy for in <i>toto</i> live visualization with a novel computational framework for multilayer analysis of evolving complex shapes, we find a dynamic mechanism for organ folding using the embryonic midgut of <i>Drosophila</i> as a model visceral organ. Hox genes, known regulators of organ shape, control the emergence of high-frequency calcium pulses. Spatiotemporally patterned calciumpulses triggermuscle contractions via myosin light chain kinase. Muscle contractions, in turn, induce cell shape change in the adjacent tissue layer. This cell shape change collectively drives a convergent extension pattern. Through tissue incompressibility and initial organ geometry, this in-plane shape change is linked to out-of-plane organ folding. Our analysis follows tissue dynamics during organ shape change in vivo, tracing organ-scale folding to a high-frequency molecular mechanism. These findings offer a mechanical route for gene expression to induce organ shape change: genetic patterning in one layer triggers a physical process in the adjacent layer - revealing post-translational mechanisms that govern shape change.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Individualized discovery of rare cancer drivers in global network context</a></h4>

              
                Late advances in genome sequencing expanded the space of known cancer driver genes several-fold. However, most of this surge was based on computational analysis of somatic mutation frequencies and/or their impact on the protein function. On the contrary, experimental research necessarily accounted for functional context of mutations interacting with other genes and conferring cancer phenotypes. Eventually, just such results become 'hard currency' of cancer biology. The new method, NEAdriver employs knowledge accumulated thus far in the form of global interaction network and functionally annotated pathways in order to recover known and predict novel driver genes. The driver discovery was individualized by accounting for mutations' co-occurrence in each tumour genome - as an alternative to summarizing information over the whole cancer patient cohorts. For each somatic genome change, probabilistic estimates from two lanes of network analysis were combined into joint likelihoods of being a driver. Thus, ability to detect previously unnoticed candidate driver events emerged from combining individual genomic context with network perspective. The procedure was applied to ten largest cancer cohorts followed by evaluating error rates against previous cancer gene sets. The discovered driver combinations were shown to be informative on cancer outcome. This revealed driver genes with individually sparse mutation patterns that would not be detectable by other computational methods and related to cancer biology domains poorly covered by previous analyses. In particular, recurrent mutations of collagen, laminin, and integrin genes were observed in the adenocarcinoma and glioblastoma cancers. Considering constellation patterns of candidate drivers in individual cancer genomes opens a novel avenue for personalized cancer medicine.

                Skillful, voluntary movements are underpinned by computations performed by networks of interconnected neurons in the primary motor cortex (M1). Computations are reflected by patterns of co-activity between neurons. Using spike time correlations, co-activity can be represented as functional networks (FNs). Here, we show that the structure of FNs constructed from instructed-delay reach trials in non-human primates are behaviorally specific: low dimensional embedding and graph alignment scores show that FNs constructed from closer target reach distances are also closer in network space. We next constructed temporal FNs using short intervals across a trial. We find that temporal FNs traverse a low-dimensional subspace in a reach-specific trajectory. Alignment scores show that FNs become separable and correspondingly, decodable shortly after the instruction cue. Finally, we observe that reciprocal connections in FNs transiently decrease following the instruction cue, suggesting the network momentarily switches from a recurrent system to one that is more feedforward.

                Beta oscillations in human sensorimotor cortex are hallmark signatures of healthy and pathological movement. In single trials, beta oscillations include bursts of intermittent, transient periods of high-power activity. These burst events have been linked to a range of sensory and motor processes, but their precise spatial, spectral, and temporal structure remains unclear. Specifically, a role for beta burst activity in information coding and communication suggests spatiotemporal patterns, or travelling wave activity, along specific anatomical gradients. We here show in human magnetoencephalography recordings that burst activity in sensorimotor cortex occurs in planar spatiotemporal wave-like patterns that dominate along two axes either parallel or perpendicular to the central sulcus. Moreover, we find that the two propagation directions are characterised by distinct anatomical and physiological features. Finally, our results suggest that sensorimotor beta bursts occurring before and after a movement share the same generator but can be distinguished by their anatomical, spectral and spatiotemporal characteristics, indicating distinct functional roles.

                Graph matching algorithms attempt to find the best correspondence between the nodes of two networks. These techniques have previously been used to match individual neurons in nanoscale connectomes - in particular, to find pairings of neurons across hemispheres. However, since graph matching techniques deal specifically with two isolated networks, they have only utilized the ipsilateral (same hemisphere) subgraphs when performing the matching. Here, we present a modification to a state-of-the-art graph matching algorithm which allows it to solve what we call the bisected graph matching problem. This modification allows us to also use connections between the brain hemispheres when predicting neuron pairs. Via simulations and real connectome datasets we show that when edge correlation is present between the contralateral (between hemisphere) subgraphs, this approach improves matching accuracy. We expect that our proposed method will improve future endeavors to accurately match neurons across hemispheres in connectomes, and be useful in other applications where the bisected graph matching problem arises.

                Failures in mitophagy, a process by which damaged mitochondria are cleared, results in neurodegeneration, while enhancing mitophagy promotes the survival of dopaminergic neurons. Using an artificial intelligence platform, we employed a natural language processing approach to evaluate the semantic similarity of candidate molecules to a set of well-established mitophagy enhancers. Top candidates were screened in a cell-based mitochondrial clearance assay. Probucol, a lipid-lowering drug, was validated across several orthogonal mitophagy assays. In vivo, probucol improved survival, locomotor function and dopaminergic neuron loss in zebrafish and fly models of mitochondrial damage. Probucol functioned independently of PINK1/Parkin but its effects on mitophagy and in vivo depended on ABCA1, which negatively regulated mitophagy following mitochondrial damage. Autophagosome and lysosomal markers were elevated under basal conditions by probucol treatment in addition to increased contact between lipid droplets and mitochondria. Conversely, lipid droplet expansion, which occurs following mitochondrial damage was suppressed by probucol and probucol-mediated mitophagy enhancement required lipid droplets. Probucol-mediated lipid droplet dynamics changes may prime the cell for a more efficient mitophagic response to mitochondrial damage.

                The encoding of touch in the spinal cord dorsal horn (DH) and its influence on tactile representations in the brain are poorly understood. Using a range of mechanical stimuli applied to the skin, large scale in vivo electrophysiological recordings, and genetic manipulations, here we show that neurons in the mouse spinal cord DH receive convergent inputs from both low- and high-threshold mechanoreceptor subtypes and exhibit one of six functionally distinct mechanical response profiles. Genetic disruption of DH feedforward or feedback inhibitory motifs, comprised of interneurons with distinct mechanical response profiles, revealed an extensively interconnected DH network that enables dynamic, flexible tuning of postsynaptic dorsal column (PSDC) output neurons and dictates how neurons in primary somatosensory cortex respond to touch. Thus, mechanoreceptor subtype convergence and nonlinear transformations at the earliest stage of the somatosensory hierarchy shape how touch of the skin is represented in the brain.

                Animals constantly perceive and integrate information across sensory modalities, and their nervous systems must select behavioral responses appropriate to the current situation and prior experience. Genetic factors supporting this behavioral flexibility are often disrupted in neuropsychiatric conditions, and our previous work revealed the disease-associated ap2s1 critically supports habituation learning in acoustically-evoked escape behavior of zebrafish. ap2s1 encodes a subunit of the AP2 endocytosis adaptor complex and has been linked to autism spectrum disorder, though its mechanism and direct behavioral importance have not been established. Here, we show that multiple domains and subunits of the AP2 complex regulate acoustically-evoked behavior selection and habituation learning. Furthermore, ap2s1 biases the choice between distinct escape behaviors in sensory modality-specific manners, and more broadly regulates action selection across different sensory contexts. Using tissue-specific and inducible transgenic rescue, we demonstrate that the AP2 complex functions acutely and in the nervous system to modulate acoustically-evoked habituation, identifying at least three spatially and temporally distinct mechanisms through which AP2 regulates different aspects of escape behavior selection and performance. Altogether, we demonstrate that the AP2 complex coordinates action selection across stimulus modalities and contexts, providing a new vertebrate model for the role of ap2s1 in human conditions including autism spectrum disorder.

                An altered neuronal excitability of spinal motoneurones has consistently been implicated in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) leading to several investigations of synaptic input to these motoneurones. One such input that has repeatedly been shown to be affected is a population of large cholinergic synapses terminating mainly on the soma of the motoneurones referred to as C-boutons. Most research on these synapses during disease progression has used transgenic Superoxide Dismutase 1 (SOD1) mouse models of the disease which have not only produced conflicting findings, but also fail to recapitulate the key pathological feature seen in ALS; cytoplasmic accumulations of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43). Additionally, they fail to distinguish between slow and fast motoneurones, the latter of which have more C-boutons but are lost earlier in the disease. To circumvent these issues, we quantified the frequency and volume of C-boutons on traced soleus and gastrocnemius motoneurones, representing predominantly slow and fast motor pools respectively. Experiments were performed using the TDP-43{Delta}NLS mouse model that carries a transgenic construct of TDP-43 devoid of its nuclear localization signal, preventing its nuclear import. This results in the emergence of pathological TDP-43 inclusions in the cytoplasm, modelling the main pathology seen in this disorder, accompanied by a severe and lethal ALS phenotype. Our results confirmed changes in both the number and volume of C-boutons with a decrease in number on the more vulnerable, predominantly fast gastrocnemius motoneurones and an increase in number on the less vulnerable, predominantly slow soleus motoneurones. Importantly, these changes were only found in male mice. However, both sexes and motor pools showed a decrease in C-bouton volume. Our experiments confirm that cytoplasmic TDP-43 accumulation is sufficient to drive C-bouton changes.

                Neurological symptoms are increasingly associated with COVID-19, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 is neuroinvasive. Although studies have focused on neuroinvasion through infection of olfactory neurons and supporting cells or hematogenous spread, little attention has been paid to the susceptibility of the peripheral nervous system to infection or to alternative routes of neural invasion. We show that neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems are susceptible to productive infection with SARS-CoV-2. Infection of K18-hACE2 mice, wild-type mice, and primary neuronal cultures demonstrates viral RNA, protein, and infectious virus in peripheral nervous system neurons, spinal cord, specific brain regions, and satellite glial cells. Moreover, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infects neurons at least in part via neuropilin-1. Our data show that SARS-CoV-2 rapidly invades and establishes productive infection in previously unassessed sites in the nervous system via direct invasion of neurons before viremia, which may underlie some cognitive and sensory symptoms associated with COVID-19.

                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a dementia characterized by progressive memory decline and neurodegeneration caused by the accumulation of amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) peptides. Last findings point to an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission as the initial impairment in early stages, and the hippocampus as one of the most susceptible brain areas. The G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GirK) channel has been proposed as a potential target to restore excitatory/inhibitory balance in amyloidosis models. Moreover, cognitive training may counteract early AD symptoms, although its effect on GirK channels remains unknown. Here, the effect of genotype, age, and training in a hippocampal-dependent memory task on the protein expression of GirK subunits and modulators were studied using APPSw,Ind mice. Results showed a reduction of GirK2 expression as well as an increased expression of SNX27 in the hippocampus of 6-month-old APPSw,Ind mice. Training in a memory task restored GirK2 and SNX27 levels. Thus, the effect of A{beta} on GirK2 could account for the excitatory/inhibitory imbalance transmission found in AD models, and training in a cognitive hippocampal-dependent task reverses this effect and lessens early A{beta}-dependent AD deficits.

                Knowledge about the consequences of stroke on high level vision comes primarily from single case studies of patients who were investigated because they presented with a deficit in the recognition of a specific visual category, typically faces or words. There are, however, no systematic, detailed, large-scale evaluations of the more typical clinical behavioural and lesion profiles of impairments in high level vision that may follow posterior cerebral artery (PCA) stroke. These goals were met by the current study through the data collected in the Back of the Brain (BoB) project: to date, the largest (N=64) and most detailed examination of patients with cortical PCA strokes selected based on lesion location rather than behavioural symptoms. We present here two complementary analyses of the structural neuroimaging data and key indices of behavioural performance with the visual processing words, objects and faces: (1) a multivariate multiple regression analysis to establish the relationships between lesion volume, lesion laterality or the presence of a bilateral lesion with performance on words, objects and faces; and, (2) a voxel-based correlational method (VBCM) analysis to establish whether there are distinct or separate regions within the PCA territory that underpin the visual processing of these categories. In contrast to the characterization of specific stroke syndromes like pure alexia or prosopagnosia in the literature, most patients in our cohort showed more general deficits in high level vision (n=22) or no deficits at all (n=21). Category-selective deficits were rare (n=6), and were only found for words, which, interestingly could follow left or right hemisphere lesions. The lesion analyses mainly confirmed the pattern reported in more selective cases: word recognition impairments are associated with a left-sided pattern of damage and face recognition deficits with a bilateral albeit right-dominant lesion pattern. Importantly, however, both general and more selective impairment may follow from left or right unilateral as well as bilateral lesions. While the findings provide partial support for the relative laterality of posterior brain regions supporting reading in the left and, to a lesser extent, face processing in the right hemisphere, the results suggest that both hemispheres are involved in the visual processing of faces, words and objects. This has ramifications for researchers studying the healthy brain and for clinicians working with patients with PCA stroke. Clinicians are recommended to carry out formal assessment of face, word and object recognition as most patients are expected to present with a mixed picture of deficits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evidence for different greater-persistence strategies under lower and higher challenge for alcohol in female rats</a></h4>

              
                Problem alcohol drinking is a substantial social and economic burden. Studies show that the misuse of alcohol is increasing in women, and that women can face higher consequences from alcohol exposure, but females have historically been understudied. Thus, there is considerable interest in understanding potential sex-different and -similar cognitive/emotional strategies, and underlying mechanisms, for alcohol responding, which would inform more effective, personalized treatments. Here, we used large cohorts of adult Wistar rats (28 females, 30 males) to provide robust assessment of potential sex differences in responding for alcohol-only and under compulsion-like drinking with moderate or higher challenge (since intake despite negative consequences can be a major obstacle to human treatment). Females had similar total licking but higher intake for all drinking conditions. However, females had significantly longer bouts under alcohol-only and moderate challenge, but not higher challenge. Further, under higher challenge, females retained several aspects of responding not seen in males, including more efficient lick volume and earlier onset of longer bouts. In addition, females overall licked slightly faster, but licking speed averaged within-bout showed no sex differences, and female intake level under alcohol-only and moderate challenge was unlinked from licking speed (unlike males, where slower licking predicted lower intake). We interpret these differences as greater persistence-like responding but not vigor per se in females, and with different strategies under lower versus higher challenge. Finally, drinking levels did not differ across the estrous cycle, although ovariectomy reduced alcohol-only and moderate-challenge intake. Together, while many aspects were sex-similar, suggesting some common drinking mechanisms, there was clear evidence for (perhaps more nuanced) sex-different alcohol strategies, which might make an outsized contribution to excessive drinking since women can have more drinking problems. Thus, our studies provide important context for future work examining sex differences in pathological drinking mechanisms.

                Parkinsons Disease (PD) associated state of neuroinflammation due to the aggregation of aberrant proteins is widely reported. One type of post-translational modification involved in protein stability is glycosylation. Here, we aimed to spatially characterise the human Parkinsonian nigro-striatal N-glycome, and related transcriptome/proteome, and its correlation with endoplasmic reticulum stress and unfolded protein response (UPR), providing a comprehensive characterisation of the PD molecular signature. Significant changes were seen upon PD: 3% increase in sialylation and 5% increase in fucosylation in both regions, and 2% increase in oligomannosylated N-glycans in the substantia nigra. In the latter, a decrease in the mRNA expression of sialidases and an upregulation in the UPR pathway were also seen. This complete characterisation of the human nigro-striatal N-glycome provides an insight into the glycomic profile of PD through a transversal approach while combining the other PD omicspieces, which can potentially assist in the development of glyco-focused therapeutics.

                This paper analyzes the behaviour of Alzheimer's disease simulation in artificial neural networks and thereby suggests a new possible diagnosis for Alzheimer. Alzheimer's disease is one of the most common diseases, increasing severity over time. Despite its high prevalence and thousands of yearly publications in this area, no cure has been found to date and early detection is one of the most important factor towards fighting the disease and possibly finding a cure. This paper analyses the behaviour of simulated Alzheimer in Hopfield memories and observes that the main factor influenced by the loss of connections is the time needed to recognize distorted symbols - while the recognition performance stays surprisingly high for a long time. Hence, I suggest a new early diagnosis approach which is based on slightly distorted elements (e.g., characters) and measures the time needed to perform the task, instead of just focusing on the subject's recognition performance. This insight could have a large impact to future diagnose setups, once being validated in a clinical study.

                Synaptic plasticity is a process that shapes neuronal connections during neurodevelopment, learning, and memory. Autophagy is a mechanism that allows cells to degrade their unnecessary or dysfunctional components. Autophagosomes appear at dendritic spines in response to plasticity-inducing stimuli. Autophagy defects contribute to altered dendritic spine development, autistic-like behavior in mice, and neurological disease. While several studies explored the involvement of autophagy in synaptic plasticity, the steps preceding autophagosome emergence at the postsynapse remain unknown. Here we show a postsynaptic association of autophagy-related protein 9A (Atg9A), known to be involved in the initial stages of autophagosome formation, with Rab11, a small GTPase that regulates endosomal trafficking. Rab11 activity is necessary for the maintenance of Atg9A-positive structures at dendritic spines. Inhibition of mTOR increased Rab11 and Atg9A interaction and increased the emergence of autophagosomes in dendritic spines when coupled to NMDA receptor stimulation. Dendritic spines with newly formed autophagosomes were more resistant to NMDA-induced morphologic change. These results collectively suggest that autophagy initiation in dendritic spines depends on an activity-dependent Rab11a-Atg9A interaction regulated by mTOR.

                The blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) tightly regulates molecular transport from the blood to the spinal cord. Herein, we present a novel approach for transient modulation of BSCB permeability and localized delivery of peptides into the spinal cord for behavior modulation with high spatial resolution. This approach utilizes optical stimulation of vasculature-targeted nanoparticles and allows delivery of BSCB-nonpermeable molecules into the spinal cord without significant glial activation or impact on animal locomotor behavior. We demonstrate minimally invasive light delivery into the spinal cord using an optical fiber and BSCB permeability modulation in the lumbar region. Our method of BSCB modulation allows delivery of bombesin, a centrally-acting and itch-inducing peptide, into the spinal cord and induces a rapid and transient increase in itching behaviors in mice. This minimally invasive approach enables behavior modulation without genetic modifications and is promising for delivering a wide range of biologics into the spinal cord for behavior modulation and potentially therapy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Single cell analysis of the dorsal V-SVZ reveals differential quiescence of postnatal pallial and subpallial neural stem cells driven by TGFbeta/BMP-signalling</a></h4>

              
                The ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) is the largest neurogenic region of the postnatal forebrain, containing neural stem cells (NSCs) that emerge from both the embryonic pallium and subpallium. Despite of this dual origin, glutamatergic neurogenesis declines rapidly after birth, while gabaergic neurogenesis persists throughout life. Here, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) of the postnatal dorsal V-SVZ for unravelling the mechanisms leading to pallial lineage germinal activity silencing. We identify cell lineage-specific NSCs primed for the generation of neurons or glial cells, as well as a large population of so far uncharacterized quiescent NSCs (qNSC). Pallial qNSCs enter a state of deep quiescence, characterized by persistent TGFbeta/BMP signalling, reduced transcriptional activity and Hopx expression, whilst in contrast, subpallial qNSCs remain transcriptionally primed for activation. Induction of deep pallial quiescence is paralleled by a rapid blockade of glutamatergic neuron production and differentiation. Finally, manipulation of the TGFbeta/BMP receptor Bmpr1a demonstrate its key role in mediating these effects at early postnatal times. Together, our results highlight a central role of TGFbeta/BMP-signalling in synchronizing quiescence induction and blockade of neuronal differentiation to rapidly silence pallial germinal activity after birth.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Connectivity by the Frontal Aslant Tract (FAT) explains local functional specialization of the superior and inferior frontal gyri in humans while choosing predictive over reactive strategies: a tractography-guided TMS study</a></h4>

              
                Predictive and reactive behaviors represent two mutually exclusive strategies for successfully completing a sensorimotor task. It is thought that predictive actions are based on the medial premotor system, in the superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and reactive stimulus-response behaviors rely on a lateral premotor system, in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). The frontal aslant tract (FAT), a white matter tract connecting SFG and IFG, is a possible neural substrate of the predictive/reactive interactions. We used diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of 17 male and female healthy human volunteers, to dissect 3 sub-bundles of fibers belonging to the left FAT (bundles 1, 2 and 3), arising ventrally from 1) the ventral precentral gyrus, 2) midway between the PCG and pars opercularis (POp) and 3) the POp and terminating dorsally in 3 different parts of the SFG, in a caudal-rostral order. We applied online transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to 6 spots, corresponding to the medial and lateral terminations of bundles 1-3 during the fixed-duration set period of a delayed reaction task, that can be solved using a predictive (anticipatory) strategy or with a reactive strategy. Results showed that TMS changed the frequency of predictive/reactive strategies only when applied over 2 spots, the SFG and IFG terminations of bundle 2. Importantly, the effects of TMS were opposite when applied to the SFG or to the IFG. Our data show that the SFG and the IFG have opposite roles in producing predictive or reactive behavior and that reciprocal integration or competition is probably mediated by the FAT.

                Rhythmic oscillations of neural activity permeate sensory systems. Studies in the visual system propose that broadband gamma oscillations (30 - 80 Hz) facilitate neuronal communication underlying visual perception. However, broadband gamma oscillations within and across visual areas show widely varying frequency and phase, providing constraints for synchronizing spike timing. Here, we analyzed data from the Allen Brain Observatory and performed new experiments that show narrowband gamma (NBG) oscillations (50 - 70 Hz) propagate and synchronize throughout the awake mouse thalamocortical visual system. Lateral geniculate (LGN) neurons fired with millisecond precision relative to NBG phase in primary visual cortex (V1) and multiple higher visual areas (HVAs). NBG in HVAs depended upon retinotopically aligned V1 activity, and neurons that fired at NBG frequencies showed enhanced functional connectivity within and across visual areas. Remarkably, LGN ON versus OFF neurons showed distinct and reliable spike timing relative to NBG oscillation phase across LGN, V1, and HVAs. Taken together, NBG oscillations may serve as a novel substrate for precise coordination of spike timing in functionally distinct subnetworks of neurons spanning multiple brain areas during awake vision

The QTAB dataset comprises multimodal neuroimaging, as well as cognitive and mental health data collected in adolescent twins over two sessions (session 1: N = 422, age 9-14 years; session 2: N = 304, 10-16 years). The MRI protocol consisted of T1-weighted (MP2RAGE), T2-weighted, FLAIR, high-resolution TSE, SWI, resting-state fMRI, DWI, and ASL scans. Two fMRI tasks were added in session 2 to probe emotion-relevant neural processes (emotional conflict task) and evoke activity in the Theory of Mind network (passive movie watching task). Outside of the scanner, we assessed cognitive function using standardised tests. We also obtained self-reports of symptoms for anxiety and depression, perceived stress, sleepiness, pubertal development measures, and risk and protective factors. We additionally collected several biological samples for genomic and metagenomic analysis. The QTAB project was established to promote health-related research in adolescence.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Model metamers illuminate divergences between biological and artificial neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Deep neural network models of sensory systems are often proposed to learn representational transformations with invariances like those in the brain. To reveal these invariances we generated "model metamers" -- stimuli whose activations within a model stage are matched to those of a natural stimulus. Metamers for state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised neural network models of vision and audition were often completely unrecognizable to humans when generated from deep model stages, suggesting differences between model and human invariances. Targeted model changes improved human-recognizability of model metamers, but did not eliminate the overall human-model discrepancy. The human-recognizability of a model's metamers was well predicted by their recognizability by other models, suggesting that models learn idiosyncratic invariances in addition to those required by the task. Metamer recognition dissociated from both traditional brain-based benchmarks and adversarial vulnerability, revealing a distinct failure mode of existing sensory models and providing a complementary benchmark for model assessment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Variational and phase response analysis for limit cycles with hard boundaries, with applications to neuromechanical control problems</a></h4>

              
                Motor systems show an overall robustness, but because they are highly nonlinear, understanding how they achieve robustness is difficult. In many rhythmic systems, robustness against perturbations involves response of both the shape and the timing of the trajectory. This makes the study of robustness even more challenging. To understand how a motor system produces robust behaviors in a variable environment, we consider a neuromechanical model of motor patterns in the feeding apparatus of the marine mollusk Aplysia californica {shaw2015,lyttle2017}. We established in {WGCT2021} the tools for studying combined shape and timing responses of limit cycle systems under sustained perturbations and here apply them to study robustness of the neuromechanical model against increased mechanical load during swallowing. Interestingly, we discover that nonlinear biomechanical properties confer resilience by immediately increasing resistance to applied loads. In contrast, the effect of changed sensory feedback signal is significantly delayed by the firing rates' hard boundary properties. Our analysis suggests that sensory feedback contributes to robustness in swallowing primarily by shifting the timing of neural activation involved in the power stroke of the motor cycle (retraction). This effect enables the system to generate stronger retractor muscle forces to compensate for the increased load, and hence achieve strong robustness. The approaches that we are applying to understanding a neuromechanical model in Aplysia, and the results that we have obtained, are likely to provide insights into the function of other motor systems that encounter changing mechanical loads and hard boundaries, both due to mechanical and neuronal firing properties.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Gpr88 deletion impacts motivational control independently of striatal dopamine function</a></h4>

              
                Background: Disrupted motivational control is a common, but poorly treated, feature of psychiatric disorders. Aberrant mesolimbic dopamine signalling is implicated in motivational symptoms, however direct manipulations to these pathways have yielded suboptimal therapeutic effects. GPR88 is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor highly expressed in the striatum on medium spiny neurons, and therefore well-placed to modulate striatal signalling. While the phenotype of Gpr88 knockout mice supports a disruption of motivational pathways, it is unclear whether GPR88 is involved in reward valuation and/or effort-based decision making in a sex-dependent manner, and if this involves altered dopamine function. Methods: In male and female Gpr88 knockout mice, we used touchscreen-based progressive ratio, with and without reward devaluation, and effort-related choice tasks to assess motivation and cost/benefit decision making, respectively. To explore whether these motivational behaviours were related to altered striatal dopamine, we quantified expression of dopamine-related genes and/or proteins, and used [18F]DOPA PET and GTP{gamma}[35S] binding to assess pre- and postsynaptic dopamine function, respectively. Results: We show that male and female Gpr88 knockout mice display greater motivational drive than wild-type mice, which was maintained following reward devaluation. Further, we show that cost/benefit decision making is impaired in male, but not female, Gpr88 knockout mice. Surprisingly, we found that Gpr88 deletion had no effect on striatal dopamine by any of the measures assessed. Conclusion: Our results highlight that GPR88 regulates motivational control of behaviour through a dopaminergic-independent mechanism, providing further support for GPR88 as target for mood symptoms in psychiatric disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A single closed head injury in mice induces chronic, progressive white matter atrophy and increased phospho-tau expressing oligodendrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) acutely damages the brain; this injury can evolve into chronic neurodegeneration. While much is known about the chronic effects arising from multiple mild TBIs, far less is known about the long-term effects of a single moderate to severe TBI. We found that a single moderate closed head injury to mice induces diffuse axonal injury within 1-day post-injury (DPI). At 14 DPI, injured animals have atrophy of ipsilesional cortex, thalamus, and corpus callosum, with bilateral atrophy of the dorsal fornix. Atrophy of the ipsilesional corpus callosum is accompanied by decreased fractional anisotropy and increased mean and radial diffusivity that remains unchanged between 14 and 180 DPI. Injured animals increased density of phospho-tau immunoreactive (pTau+) cells in the ipsilesional cortex and thalamus, and bilaterally in corpus callosum. Between 14 and 180 DPI, atrophy occurs in the ipsilesional ventral fornix, contralesional corpus callosum, and bilateral internal capsule. Diffusion tensor MRI parameters remain unchanged in white matter regions with delayed atrophy. Between 14 and 180 DPI, pTau+ cell density increases bilaterally in corpus callosum, but decreases in cortex and thalamus. The location of pTau+ cells within the ipsilesional corpus callosum changes between 14 and 180 DPI; density of all cells increases including pTau+ or pTau- cells. Greater than 90% of the pTau+ cells are in the oligodendrocyte lineage in both gray and white matter. Density of thioflavin-S+ cells in thalamus increases by 180 DPI. These data suggest a single closed head impact produces multiple forms of chronic neurodegeneration. Gray and white matter regions proximal to the impact site undergo rapid atrophy. More distal white matter regions undergo chronic, progressive white matter atrophy with an increasing density of oligodendrocytes containing pTau. These data suggest that the chronic neurodegeneration arising from a single moderate CHI differs greatly from the chronic traumatic encephalopathy produced by multiple mild head injuries.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prelimbic cortex neural encoding dynamically tracks expected outcome value</a></h4>

              
                Animals must modify their behavior based on updated expected outcomes in a changing environment. Prelimbic cortex (PrL) neural encoding during learning predicts and is necessary for appropriately altering behavior based on new expected outcome value following devaluation. We aimed to determine how PrL neural activity encodes reward predictive cues after the expected outcome value of those cues is decreased following conditioned taste aversion. In one post-devaluation session, rats were tested under extinction to determine their ability alter their behavior to the expected outcome values (i.e., extinction test). In a second post-devaluation session, rats were tested with the newly devalued outcome delivered so that the rats experienced the updated outcome value within the session (i.e., re-exposure test). We found that PrL neural encoding to the cue associated with the devalued reward predicted the ability of rats to suppress behavior in the extinction test session, but not in the re-exposure test session. While all rats were able to successfully devalue the outcome during conditioned taste aversion, a subset of rats continued to consume the devalued outcome in the re-exposure test session. We found differential patterns of PrL neural encoding in the population of rats that did not avoid the devalued outcome during the re-exposure test compared to the rats that successfully avoided the devalued outcome. Our findings suggest that PrL neural encoding dynamically tracks expected outcome values, and differential neural encoding in the PrL to reward predictive cues following expected outcome value changes may contribute to distinct behavioral phenotypes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Accurate speech decoding requires high-resolution neural interfaces</a></h4>

              
                Patients suffering from debilitating neurodegenerative diseases often lose the ability to communicate, detrimentally affecting their quality of life. One promising solution to restore communication is to decode signals directly from the brain to enable neural speech prostheses. However, decoding has been limited by coarse recordings, which inadequately capture the rich spatio-temporal structure of human brain signals. To resolve this limitation, we performed novel high-resolution, micro-electrocorticographic (uECoG) neural recordings during speech production. We obtained neural signals with 56x spatial resolution and 2.5x higher signal-to-noise ratio compared to standard invasive recordings. This increased signal quality nearly doubled decoding accuracy compared to standard intracranial signals. Accurate decoding was dependent on the high-spatial resolution of the neural interface. Further, non-linear decoding models designed to utilize enhanced spatio-temporal neural information produced better results than standard techniques. We show for the first time that micro-scale neural interfaces can enable high-quality speech decoding for neural speech prostheses.

                Microglia is one of the major immune cell types in the human brain and plays pivotal roles in regulating inflammatory and immune response in healthy as well as disease states. By analyzing whole transcriptomic data derived from a large cohort of postmortem cortex tissues, we identified two distinct microglial subtypes within the population. The main difference between the two subtypes lies in the differential expression levels of the C1q complex components, Fc {gamma} receptor (CD16) components and CD14. We validated our discovery in independent cohorts of brain autopsy tissues as well as in RNA-seq data generated from isolated microglia. Future investigations into the causes and physiological implications of these subtypes may shed more light on the homeostasis and regulation of the immune related processes in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Coordination of Pickpocket ion channel delivery and dendrite growth in Drosophila sensory neurons</a></h4>

              
                Sensory neurons enable an organism to perceive external stimuli, which is essential for survival. The sensory capacity of a neuron depends on the elaboration of its dendritic arbor and the delivery of sensory ion channels to the dendritic membrane. However, it is not well understood how ion channels are trafficked to sensory dendrites and whether their delivery is coordinated with dendrite growth. We investigated the trafficking of the DEG/ENaC/ASIC ion channel Pickpocket (Ppk) in peripheral sensory neurons in fruit fly larvae. We used CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering to tag endogenous Ppk1 and visualize it live, including monitoring Ppk1 membrane localization via a novel secreted split-GFP approach. Strikingly, Ppk1 is present throughout the membrane of actively growing dendrites, and Ppk1 density scales in proportion to dendritic membrane, even when dynein-mediated transport to dendrites is disrupted. Our data suggest that Ppk1 is integral to the membrane of growing dendrites and implicate the recycling endosome GTPase Rab11 in the forward trafficking of Ppk1 to dendrites. Together, our results suggest that Ppk channel transport is coordinated with dendrite morphogenesis, thus ensuring proper ion channel levels and distribution in sensory dendrites.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Maximum a posteriori natural scene reconstruction from retinal ganglion cells with deep denoiser priors</a></h4>

              
                A fraction of the visual information arriving at the retina is transmitted to the brain by signals in the optic nerve, and the brain must rely solely on these signals to make inferences about the visual world. Previous work has probed the visual information contained in retinal signals by reconstructing images from retinal activity using linear regression and nonlinear regression with neural networks. Maximum a posteriori (MAP) reconstruction offers a more general and principled approach. We develop a novel method for approximate MAP reconstruction by combining a generalized linear model of light responses in retinal neurons and their dependence on spike history and spikes of neighboring cells, with an image prior implicitly embedded in a deep convolutional neural network trained for image denoising. We use this method to reconstruct natural images from ex vivo simultaneously- recorded spikes of hundreds of ganglion cells uniformly sampling a region of the retina. The method produces reconstructions that match or exceed the state-of-the-art in perceptual similarity and exhibit additional fine detail, while using substantially fewer model parameters than previous approaches. The use of more rudimentary encoding models (a linear-nonlinear-Poisson cascade) or image priors (a 1/F spectral model) significantly reduces reconstruction performance, indicating the essential role of both components in achieving high-quality reconstructed images from the retinal signal.

                The interaction between hippocampus and cortex is key to memory formation and representation learning. Based on anatomical wiring and transmission delays, we proposed a self-supervised recurrent neural network (PredRAE) with a predictive reconstruction loss to account for the cognitive functions of hippocampus. This framework extends predictive coding in the time axis and incorporates predictive features in Bayes filters for temporal prediction. In simulations, we were able to reproduce characteristic place cell features such as one-shot plasticity, localized spatial representation and replay, which marks the trace of memory formation. The simulated place cells also exhibited precise spike timing, evidenced by phase precession. Trained on MNIST sequences, PredRAE learned the underlying temporal dependencies and a spontaneous representation of digit labels and rotation dynamics in the linear transformation of its hidden unit activities. Such learning is robust against 16 different image corruptions. Inspired by the brain circuit, the simple and concise framework has great potential to approximate human performance with its capacity to robustly disentangle representations and generalize temporal dynamics.

                Prior studies have shown that providing task-specific vibrotactile feedback (VTF) during reaching and stabilizing with the arm can immediately improve the accuracy and efficiency. However, such studies typically evaluate performance after less than 1 hour of practice using VTF. Here we tested the effects of extended practice using supplemental kinesthetic VTF on goal-directed reaching with the arm. Healthy young adults performed a primary reaching task and a secondary choice reaction task individually and as a dual-task. The reaching task was performed under three feedback conditions: visual feedback, proprioceptive feedback, and with supplemental kinesthetic VTF applied to the non-moving arm. We compared performances before, during, and after approximately 10 hours of practice on the VTF-guided reaching task, distributed across 20 practice sessions. Upon initial exposure to VTF-guided reaching, participants were immediately able to use the VTF to improve reaching accuracy. Performance improvements were retained from one practice session to the next. After 10 hours of practice, the accuracy and temporal efficiency of VTF-guided reaching were equivalent to or better than reaching performed without vision or VTF. However, hand paths during VTF-guided reaching exhibited a persistent strategy whereby movements were decomposed into discrete sub-movements along the cardinal axes of the VTF interface. Dual-tasking capability also improved, such that the primary and secondary tasks we performed more concurrently after extended practice. Our results demonstrate that extended practice on VTF-guided reaching can yield performance improvements that accrue in a manner increasingly resistant to dual-task interference.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Temporal origin of mouse claustrum and development of its cortical projections</a></h4>

              
                The claustrum is known for its extensive connectivity with many other forebrain regions, but its elongated shape and deep location have made further study difficult. We have sought to understand when mouse claustrum neurons are born, where they are located in developing brains and when they develop their widespread connections to cortex. We established that a well-characterised parvalbumin-plexus, which identifies the claustrum in adults, is only present from postnatal day (P)21. A myeloarchitectonic outline of the claustrum can be derived from a triangular fibre arrangement from P15. A dense patch of Nurr1+ cells is present at its core, and is already evident at birth. BrdU-birthdating of forebrain progenitors reveals that the majority of claustrum neurons are born during a narrow time window centred on embryonic day (E)12.5, which is later than the adjacent subplate and endopiriform nucleus. Retrograde tracing revealed that claustrum projections to anterior cingulate (ACA) and retrosplenial cortex (RSP) follow distinct developmental trajectories. Claustrum-ACA connectivity matures rapidly, and reaches adult-like innervation density by P10, whereas claustrum-RSP innervation emerges later over a protracted time window. This work establishes the timeline of claustrum development, and provides a framework for understanding how the claustrum is built and develops its unique connectivity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain morphometric changes in congenitally blind subjects: a 7 Tesla MRI study</a></h4>

              
                We used ultra-high field (7 Tesla) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at submillimeter resolution to assess structural brain changes in congenitally blind (CB) compared to matched normal sighted control (SC) subject groups. Region-of-interest analysis revealed grey matter (GM) volumetric reductions in the CB group in left cuneus and occipital pole, right posterior collateral sulcus and right occipito-temporal medial lingual sulcus. Non-visual areas with GM reductions in CB included the left central, postcentral and superior frontal gyri, and the right subcallosal gyrus. In contrast, there were no significant group differences in cortical thickness when using stringent statistical criteria. Regional differences in white matter (WM) showed an overall pattern similar as that of GM changes, characterized by volume reductions in occipital, parietal and temporal areas, but with additional reductions in precuneus and medial orbitofrontal cortex. Differences in cortical curvature were mostly situated in the occipital cortex and bore a close relationship with areas showing GM alterations; they may be indicative of increased cortico-cortical connectivity of the visually-deprived occipital cortex. The CB group had GM reductions in the basal ganglia, i.e., caudate nucleus, putamen, nucleus accumbens, globus pallidus, and thalamus. Within the cerebellum, GM and WM volumes were also reduced in the CB. Segmentation of the thalamus, hippocampus and amygdala into anatomic divisions revealed GM reductions in a number of thalamic nuclei, a few hippocampal regions, but not within amygdala. There were no findings of increased volume or cortical thickness in the CB group. Together, these data reveal a multitude of GM and WM reductions in CB, comprising not only the occipital cortex, but also temporal, parietal, and prefrontal cortices, as well as the basal ganglia and cerebellum. These findings in the CB stand may seem at odds with the large literature showing that the visually-deprived occipital cortex becomes a multimodal cortex responding to diverse non-visual sensory and cognitive inputs. The seeming mismatch between morphological atrophy and enhanced multimodality of occipital areas combined with superior performance by the CB in various non-visual tasks poses a challenge for our understanding of brain plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transient and sustained visuomotor selection during working-memory guided behavior.</a></h4>

              
                Many recent studies have documented links between circuit-, network-, and brain-level mechanisms supporting the initiation of working memory-guided behaviors. However, few have examined how sensorimotor representations stored in working memory are used to plan future behaviors. We leverage the high temporal resolution of human EEG recordings to show that when planning future memory-guided behaviors the brain switches from an initial joint visuomotor code to a subsequent motor-only code.

	<p>Male predominance is a known feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although ASD mouse models can be useful for elucidating mechanisms underlying abnormal behaviors relevant to human ASD, suitable models to analyze sex differences in ASD pathogenesis remain insufficient. Herein, we used collapsin response mediator protein 4 (Crmp4)-knockout (KO) mice exhibiting ASD-like phenotypes in a male-predominant manner and analyzed ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) to detect potential differences between genotypes and sexes during the early postnatal period. We recorded isolation-induced USVs emitted from wild-type (WT) and Crmp4-KO littermates and compared the total number of USVs between genotypes and sexes. We classified USVs into 10 types based on internal pitch changes, lengths, and shapes and compared the number of USVs in each type by genotypes and sex. Male Crmp4-KO mice exhibited a reduction in the total number of USVs. Crmp4-KO decreased the number of USVs in 7 out of 10 USV types, and male KO mice exhibited a greater reduction than females in 3 of the 7 types. This study offers a suitable ASD animal model and tool for assessing sex-based communication deficits during the early postnatal period, both of which would be valuable for elucidating the underlying mechanism.</p>

	<p>Models on L3/Ln acquisition differ with respect to how they envisage degree (holistic vs. selective transfer of the L1, L2 or both) and/or timing (initial stages vs. development) of how the influence of source languages unfolds. This study uses EEG/ERPs to examine these models, bringing together two types of bilinguals: heritage speakers (HSs) (Italian-German, n = 15) compared to adult L2 learners (L1 German, L2 English, n = 28) learning L3/Ln Latin. Participants were trained on a selected Latin lexicon over two sessions and, afterward, on two grammatical properties: case (similar between German and Latin) and adjective&amp;amp;ndash;noun order (similar between Italian and Latin). Neurophysiological findings show an N200/N400 deflection for the HSs in case morphology and a P600 effect for the German L2 group in adjectival position. None of the current L3/Ln models predict the observed results, which questions the appropriateness of this methodology. Nevertheless, the results are illustrative of differences in how HSs and L2 learners approach the very initial stages of additional language learning, the implications of which are discussed.</p>

	<p>The pathological basis of migraine is not fully understood. Familial hemiplegic migraines (FHM) are monogenic forms of severe migraine, caused by mutations in genes encoding various neuronal and/or astrocytic ion transporting proteins. The leading hypothesis regarding the mechanism underlying migraine in FHM is that enhanced electrical excitability leads to increased extracellular potassium levels with subsequent cortical spreading depression. In this short commentary we would like to propose an additional mechanism distinct from enhanced electrical excitability per se. Rather, we propose that FHM mutations cause substantially increased energy expenditure of neurons for re-establishing ion gradients and/or for increased synaptic activity, a mechanism we call neuronal fatigue. Such a metabolic mechanism had been proposed earlier for common migraine and has received recent experimental evidence in particular for the case of FHM3. The hypothesis could be tested in future studies of FHM related models that would need to take metabolic parameters into account.</p>

	<p>Depressive disorders are common among people with epilepsy (PwE). We here aimed to report an unbiased automatic classification of epilepsy comorbid depressive disorder cases via training a linear support vector machine (SVM) model using the interictal heart rate variability (HRV) data. One hundred and eighty-six subjects participated in this study. Among all participants, we recorded demographic information, epilepsy states and neuropsychiatric features. For each subject, we performed simultaneous electrocardiography and electroencephalography recordings both in wakefulness and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep stage. Using these data, we systematically explored the full parameter space in order to determine the most effective combinations of data to classify the depression status in PwE. PwE with depressive disorders exhibited significant alterations in HRV parameters, including decreased time domain and nonlinear domain values both in wakefulness and NREM sleep stage compared with without depressive disorders and non-epilepsy controls. Interestingly, PwE without depressive disorder showed the same level of HRV values as the non-epilepsy control subjects. The SVM classification model of PwE depression status achieved a higher classification accuracy with the combination of HRV parameters in wakefulness and NREM sleep stage. Furthermore, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the SVM classification model showed a satisfying area under the ROC curve (AUC: 0.758). Intriguingly, we found that the HRV measurements during NREM sleep are particularly important for correct classification, suggesting a mechanistic link between the dysregulation of heart rate during sleep and the development of depressive disorders in PwE. Our classification model may provide an objective measurement to assess the depressive status in PwE.</p>

	<p>Sitting ability in the early post-stroke phase affects functional balance ability and other prognoses. We investigated whether dynamic sitting exercise with delayed visual feedback in the mediolateral and anteroposterior directions affected postural control in the early post-stroke phase. In this pilot randomized controlled trial, 27 hemiparetic stroke patients were randomized to experimental (n = 13) and control (n = 14) groups. Dynamic sitting exercise (30 times/day, 5 days/week) in the mediolateral and anteroposterior directions, with 500-ms-delayed (experimental group) or real-time (control group) visual feedback on a computer, was added to usual physical therapy. We evaluated the postural assessment scale for stroke (PASS), static and dynamic sitting balance tasks, the five-times sit-to-stand test, trunk impairment scale, functional ambulation category, and functional independence measure&amp;amp;ndash;motor items. In intention-to-treat analysis, the experimental group demonstrated a significant intervention effect on the PASS score (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The mean percentage of body weight on the moving side in the lateral sitting task and the number of successes in the five-times sit-to-stand test were significantly higher in the experimental group than those in the control group (P &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Thus, the proposed exercise improves postural control, dynamic sitting balance, and sit-to-stand ability in early post-stroke patients.</p>

	<p>This paper a novel core-strengthening intervention (CSI) delivered using the AllCore360&amp;amp;deg;, a device that targets trunk muscles through a systematic, high-intensity rotating-plank exercise. Three individuals (age: 61.7 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.2 years; range: 58&amp;amp;ndash;64 years) with post-stroke hemiplegia participated in 12-sessions of the CSI. The participants completed up to 142 rotating planks at inclination angles (IAs) that ranged from 40&amp;amp;deg; to 65&amp;amp;deg;, over 12 sessions. The interventional effects on the functional outcomes of trunk performance, balance and mobility were assessed using the Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS), the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), the Timed-Up and Go (TUG) test, the 10-m walk test (10MWT), and the 6-min walk test (6MWT). Postural outcomes were assessed using the center of pressure (CoP) data recorded during quiet standing on a balance platform, and neuromuscular outcomes were assessed using electromyography (EMG) during AllCore360&amp;amp;deg; rotations. All participants completed the CSI (minimum of 120 rotations), demonstrating the feasibility of the CSI in chronic stroke. The CoP data suggested improved lateral control of posture during standing across participants (averaging an over 30% reduction in lateral sway), while the EMG data revealed the ability of the CSI to systematically modulate trunk muscle responses. In summary, the current investigation presents the feasibility of a novel delivery method for core strengthening to maximize rehabilitation outcomes in the chronic phase of stroke.</p>

	<p>Plants and animals are among the most behaviorally significant superordinate categories for humans. Visually assigning objects to such high-level classes is challenging because highly distinct items must be grouped together (e.g., chimpanzees and geckos) while more similar items must sometimes be separated (e.g., stick insects and twigs). As both animals and plants typically possess complex multi-limbed shapes, the perceptual organization of shape into parts likely plays a crucial rule in identifying them. Here, we identify a number of distinctive growth characteristics that affect the spatial arrangement and properties of limbs, yielding useful cues for differentiating plants from animals. We developed a novel algorithm based on shape skeletons to create many novel object pairs that differ in their part structure but are otherwise very similar. We found that particular part organizations cause stimuli to look systematically more like plants or animals. We then generated other 110 sequences of shapes morphing from animal- to plant-like appearance by modifying three aspects of part structure: sprouting parts, curvedness of parts, and symmetry of part pairs. We found that all three parameters correlated strongly with human animal/plant judgments. Together our findings suggest that subtle changes in the properties and organization of parts can provide powerful cues in superordinate categorization.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Bilateral peritonsillar abscess with complications of upper airway obstruction [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Peritonsillar abscess is a collection of pus between the tonsillar fibrous capsule and the pharyngeal constrictor muscle. Unilateral peritonsillar abscess is a common complication of acute tonsillitis, whereas bilateral peritonsillar abscess is rare. The incidence of bilateral peritonsillar abscess remains unknown but is estimated to be 4.9% of all peritonsillar abscess cases. Case report: A 20-year-old man came to the emergency room with bilateral peritonsillar abscess and complaining of shortness of breath for two weeks. Physical examination showed muffled voice, 82% oxygen saturation, and inspiratory stridor. The isthmus faucium was narrow, with approximately 30% remaining. Peritonsillar puncture revealed pus mixed with blood. The treatment for this patient included bilateral peritonsillar incision and drainage and intravenous antibiotics of levofloxacin and metronidazole. The patient came to the Ear, Nose, Throat, Head, and Neck (ENTHN) Outpatient Unit eight days after the procedure for a control checkup and was in good condition. Conclusion: We have reported a bilateral peritonsillar abscess with complications of upper airway obstruction, in which we performed incision and drainage. Prompt and appropriate management is needed to avoid unwanted morbidity and mortality.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">ALL-IN meta-analysis: breathing life into living systematic reviews [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Science is justly admired as a cumulative process (“standing on the shoulders of giants”), yet scientific knowledge is typically built on a patchwork of research contributions without much coordination. This lack of efficiency has specifically been addressed in clinical research by recommendations for living systematic reviews and against research waste. We propose to further those recommendations with ALL-IN meta-analysis: Anytime Live and Leading INterim meta-analysis. ALL-IN provides statistical methodology for a meta-analysis that can be updated at any time—reanalyzing after each new observation while retaining type-I error guarantees, live—no need to prespecify the looks, and leading—in the decisions on whether individual studies should be initiated, stopped or expanded, the meta-analysis can be the leading source of information. We illustrate the method for time-to-event data, showing how synthesizing data at interim stages of studies can increase efficiency when studies are slow in themselves to provide the necessary number of events for completion. The meta-analysis can be performed on interim data, but does not have to. The analysis design requires no information about the number of patients in trials or the number of trials eventually included. So it can breathe life into living systematic reviews, through better and simpler statistics, efficiency, collaboration and communication

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Estimated number of deaths directly avoided because of COVID-19 vaccination among older adults in Colombia in 2021: an ecological, longitudinal observational study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Colombia’s national COVID-19 vaccination plan began in February of 2021. It gave priority to older adults, who constituted 77.7% of deaths from this illness in the year 2020. The main goal of the plan is to decrease specific mortality and the number of serious COVID-19 cases, however, the number of deaths avoided by this strategy is unknown. The objective of this study was to estimate the number of avoided deaths in Colombia by fully vaccinating older adults against COVID-19, during the first year of the implementation of the national vaccination plan. Methods: This study took on the design of an ecological, longitudinal study. Full vaccination coverage for older adults was calculated for each epidemiological week and age group from March to December 2021, based on which the number of avoided COVID-19 deaths was estimated. A sensitivity analysis was performed taking into account variations in the vaccines’ effectiveness by age group. Results: In Colombia, over 5.3 million adults 60 years of age and older received full COVID-19 vaccinations between March and December 2021. During that same period, nearly 46,000 deaths of older adults from this cause were registered. We estimated that vaccination has avoided around 22,000 more older adults from dying from COVID-19 in Colombia, that is, 32.4% of expected deaths in 2021. According to the sensitivity analysis, the number of lives saved ranged from 19,597 to 36,507. Conclusions: Colombia’s strategy to vaccinate older adults against COVID-19 has avoided mortality for this age group from being 48.0% higher than what was observed during the study period. Even more lives have been saved when taking into account the parameters that were defined and the omission of the contribution from partial vaccinations.

                Avian influenza virus subtype H9N2 was first documented in Indonesia in 2017. It has become prevalent in chickens in many provinces of Indonesia as a result of reassortment in live bird markets. Low pathogenic avian influenza subtype H9N2 virus-infected poultry provides a new direction for influenza virus. According to the latest research, the Indonesian H9N2 viruses may have developed through antigenic drift into new genotype, posing a significant hazard to poultry and public health. The latest proof of interspecies transmission proposes that, the next human pandemic variant will be avian influenza virus subtype H9N2. Manipulation and elimination of H9N2 viruses in Indonesia, constant surveillance of viral mutation, and vaccines updates are required to achieve effectiveness. The current review examines should be investigates/assesses/report on the development and evolution of newly identified H9N2 viruses in Indonesia and their vaccination strategy.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Post-pandemic e-learning: a pre-protocol to assess the impact of mobile VR on learner motivation and engagement for VARK learning styles [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in an abrupt but accelerated shift to e-learning worldwide. Education in a post-pandemic world has to amalgamate the advantages of e-learning with important pedagogical goals associated with in-person teaching. Although various advanced technologies are present at our fingertips today, we are still unable to use their full potential in teaching and learning. In this regard, mobile VR technology is both cost-efficient, versatile and engaging for students. Developing countries have more smartphone users than developed countries, implying that developing countries, like Malaysia, should utilize mobile or cellphones more significantly. With that in mind, we propose here a pre-protocol to investigate learner motivation and levels of engagement for e-learning with smartphone-integrated VR, based on their VARK (Visual, Auditory, Read/Write, Kinesthetic) learning styles. Proposed methodology: This study intends to look into students from the same age group under the K-12 (particularly grade 9-12) belonging to STEM curriculum. The Google Cardboard VR set will be used as the prime technology for its affordability, easy build feature and variety of available vendors. A mixed-method (survey and activity log/tracking) for data collection is suggested to find the degree of engagement and motivation of the learners’ learning in the mobile VR-assisted e-learning context. The students will be taught a topic using the mobile VR and then be assessed through simple classroom quizzes to assess how well they grasped the concept. The data collected through activity logs (while teaching the topic in mobile VR) and questionnaires will be mapped to each individual learner and organized in a data repository. Further visualization, analysis and investigation will be performed using Smart PLS, Python or R language. Conclusions: The study aims to provide context for smartphone and software companies to develop technologies that could facilitate learner motivation and engagement during the post-pandemic state.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Linear viscoelastic properties of the vertex model for epithelial tissues</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sijie Tong, Navreeta K. Singh, Rastko Sknepnek, Andrej Košmrlj</p>

Epithelial tissues act as barriers and, therefore, must repair themselves, respond to environmental changes and grow without compromising their integrity. Consequently, they exhibit complex viscoelastic rheological behavior where constituent cells actively tune their mechanical properties to change the overall response of the tissue, e.g., from solid-like to fluid-like. Mesoscopic mechanical properties of epithelia are commonly modeled with the vertex model. While previous studies have predominantly focused on the rheological properties of the vertex model at long time scales, we systematically studied the full dynamic range by applying small oscillatory shear and bulk deformations in both solid-like and fluid-like phases for regular hexagonal and disordered cell configurations. We found that the shear and bulk responses in the fluid and solid phases can be described by standard spring-dashpot viscoelastic models. Furthermore, the solid-fluid transition can be tuned by applying pre-deformation to the system. Our study provides insights into the mechanisms by which epithelia can regulate their rich rheological behavior.

                <p>by Gabrielle Bonnet, Francesco Pizzitutti, Eloy A. Gonzales-Gustavson, Sarah Gabriël, William K. Pan, Hector H. Garcia, Javier A. Bustos, Percy Vilchez, Seth E. O’Neal, for the Cysticercosis Working Group in Peru </p>
Introduction <p>The <i>Taenia solium</i> tapeworm is responsible for cysticercosis, a neglected tropical disease presenting as larvae in the body of a host following taenia egg ingestion. Neurocysticercosis (NCC), the name of the disease when it affects the human central nervous system, is a major cause of epilepsy in developing countries, and can also cause intracranial hypertension, hydrocephalus and death. Simulation models can help identify the most cost-effective interventions before their implementation. Modelling NCC should enable the comparison of a broad range of interventions, from treatment of human taeniasis (presence of an adult taenia worm in the human intestine) to NCC mitigation. It also allows a focus on the actual impact of the disease, rather than using proxies as is the case for other models.</p> Methods <p>This agent-based model is the first model that simulates human NCC and associated pathologies. It uses the output of another model, CystiAgent, which simulates the evolution of pig cysticercosis and human taeniasis, adding human and cyst agents, including a model of cyst location and stage, human symptoms, and treatment. CystiHuman also accounts for delays in the appearance of NCC-related symptoms. It comprises three modules detailing cyst development, seizure probability and timing, and intracranial hypertension/hydrocephalus, respectively. It has been implemented in Java MASON and calibrated in three endemic villages in Peru, then applied to another village (Rica Playa) to compare simulation results with field data in that village.</p> Results and discussion <p>Despite limitations in available field data, parameter values found through calibration are plausible and simulated outcomes in Rica Playa are close to actual values for NCC prevalence and the way it increases with age and cases with single lesions. Initial simulations further suggest that short-term interventions followed by a rapid increase in taeniasis prevalence back to original levels may have limited impacts on NCC prevalence.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Enhancing long-term forecasting: Learning from COVID-19 models</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hazhir Rahmandad, Ran Xu, Navid Ghaffarzadegan</p>

While much effort has gone into building predictive models of the COVID-19 pandemic, some have argued that early exponential growth combined with the stochastic nature of epidemics make the long-term prediction of contagion trajectories impossible. We conduct two complementary studies to assess model features supporting better long-term predictions. First, we leverage the diverse models contributing to the CDC repository of COVID-19 USA death projections to identify factors associated with prediction accuracy across different projection horizons. We find that better long-term predictions correlate with: (1) capturing the physics of transmission (instead of using black-box models); (2) projecting human behavioral reactions to an evolving pandemic; and (3) resetting state variables to account for randomness not captured in the model before starting projection. Second, we introduce a very simple model, SEIRb, that incorporates these features, and few other nuances, offers informative predictions for as far as 20-weeks ahead, with accuracy comparable with the best models in the CDC set. Key to the long-term predictive power of multi-wave COVID-19 trajectories is capturing behavioral responses endogenously: balancing feedbacks where the perceived risk of death continuously changes transmission rates through the adoption and relaxation of various Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Scalable and flexible inference framework for stochastic dynamic single-cell models</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sebastian Persson, Niek Welkenhuysen, Sviatlana Shashkova, Samuel Wiqvist, Patrick Reith, Gregor W. Schmidt, Umberto Picchini, Marija Cvijovic</p>

Understanding the inherited nature of how biological processes dynamically change over time and exhibit intra- and inter-individual variability, due to the different responses to environmental stimuli and when interacting with other processes, has been a major focus of systems biology. The rise of single-cell fluorescent microscopy has enabled the study of those phenomena. The analysis of single-cell data with mechanistic models offers an invaluable tool to describe dynamic cellular processes and to rationalise cell-to-cell variability within the population. However, extracting mechanistic information from single-cell data has proven difficult. This requires statistical methods to infer unknown model parameters from dynamic, multi-individual data accounting for heterogeneity caused by both intrinsic (e.g. variations in chemical reactions) and extrinsic (e.g. variability in protein concentrations) noise. Although several inference methods exist, the availability of efficient, general and accessible methods that facilitate modelling of single-cell data, remains lacking. Here we present a scalable and flexible framework for Bayesian inference in state-space mixed-effects single-cell models with stochastic dynamic. Our approach infers model parameters when intrinsic noise is modelled by either exact or approximate stochastic simulators, and when extrinsic noise is modelled by either time-varying, or time-constant parameters that vary between cells. We demonstrate the relevance of our approach by studying how cell-to-cell variation in carbon source utilisation affects heterogeneity in the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> SNF1 nutrient sensing pathway. We identify hexokinase activity as a source of extrinsic noise and deduce that sugar availability dictates cell-to-cell variability.

                <p>by Lucas Cardoso Lázari, Ivan Rodrigo Wolf, Amanda Piveta Schnepper, Guilherme Targino Valente</p>

Ethanol alters many subsystems of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, including the cell cycle. Two ethanol-responsive lncRNAs in yeast interact with cell cycle proteins, and here, we investigated the role of these RNAs in cell cycle. Our network dynamic modeling showed that higher and lower ethanol-tolerant strains undergo cell cycle arrest in mitosis and G1 phases, respectively, during ethanol stress. The higher population rebound of the lower ethanol-tolerant phenotype after stress relief responds to the late phase arrest. We found that the lncRNA lnc9136 of SEY6210 (a lower ethanol-tolerant strain) induces cells to skip mitosis arrest. Simulating an overexpression of lnc9136 and analyzing CRISPR–Cas9 mutants lacking this lncRNA suggest that lnc9136 induces a regular cell cycle even under ethanol stress, indirectly regulating Swe1p and Clb1/2 by binding to Gin4p and Hsl1p. Notably, lnc10883 of BY4742 (a higher ethanol-tolerant strain) does not prevent G1 arrest in this strain under ethanol stress. However, lnc19883 circumvents DNA and spindle damage checkpoints, maintaining a functional cell cycle by interacting with Mec1p or Bub1p even in the presence of DNA/spindle damage. Overall, we present the first evidence of direct roles for lncRNAs in regulating yeast cell cycle proteins, the dynamics of this system in different ethanol-tolerant phenotypes, and a new yeast cell cycle model.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A computational model of stereoscopic prey capture in praying mantises</a></h4>

              
                <p>by James O’Keeffe, Sin Hui Yap, Ichasus Llamas-Cornejo, Vivek Nityananda, Jenny C. A. Read</p>

We present a simple model which can account for the stereoscopic sensitivity of praying mantis predatory strikes. The model consists of a single “disparity sensor”: a binocular neuron sensitive to stereoscopic disparity and thus to distance from the animal. The model is based closely on the known behavioural and neurophysiological properties of mantis stereopsis. The monocular inputs to the neuron reflect temporal change and are insensitive to contrast sign, making the sensor insensitive to interocular correlation. The monocular receptive fields have a excitatory centre and inhibitory surround, making them tuned to size. The disparity sensor combines inputs from the two eyes linearly, applies a threshold and then an exponent output nonlinearity. The activity of the sensor represents the model mantis’s instantaneous probability of striking. We integrate this over the stimulus duration to obtain the expected number of strikes in response to moving targets with different stereoscopic disparity, size and vertical disparity. We optimised the parameters of the model so as to bring its predictions into agreement with our empirical data on mean strike rate as a function of stimulus size and disparity. The model proves capable of reproducing the relatively broad tuning to size and narrow tuning to stereoscopic disparity seen in mantis striking behaviour. Although the model has only a single centre-surround receptive field in each eye, it displays qualitatively the same interaction between size and disparity as we observed in real mantids: the preferred size increases as perceived prey distance increases beyond the preferred distance. We show that this occurs because of a stereoscopic “false match” between the leading edge of the stimulus in one eye and its trailing edge in the other; further work will be required to find whether such false matches occur in real mantises. Importantly, the model also displays realistic responses to stimuli with vertical disparity and to pairs of identical stimuli offering a “ghost match”, despite not being fitted to these data. This is the first image-computable model of insect stereopsis, and reproduces key features of both neurophysiology and striking behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Major environmental drivers determining life and death of cold-water corals through time</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rodrigo da Costa Portilho-Ramos, Jürgen Titschack, Claudia Wienberg, Michael Georg Siccha Rojas, Yusuke Yokoyama, Dierk Hebbeln</p>

Cold-water corals (CWCs) are the engineers of complex ecosystems forming unique biodiversity hotspots in the deep sea. They are expected to suffer dramatically from future environmental changes in the oceans such as ocean warming, food depletion, deoxygenation, and acidification. However, over the last decades of intense deep-sea research, no extinction event of a CWC ecosystem is documented, leaving quite some uncertainty on their sensitivity to these environmental parameters. Paleoceanographic reconstructions offer the opportunity to align the on- and offsets of CWC proliferation to environmental parameters. Here, we present the synthesis of 6 case studies from the North Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, revealing that food supply controlled by export production and turbulent hydrodynamics at the seabed exerted the strongest impact on coral vitality during the past 20,000 years, whereas locally low oxygen concentrations in the bottom water can act as an additional relevant stressor. The fate of CWCs in a changing ocean will largely depend on how these oceanographic processes will be modulated. Future ocean deoxygenation may be compensated regionally where the food delivery and food quality are optimal.

                We report a rare case of a vertebro-vertebral arteriovenous fistula (VVAVF) manifesting as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A 76-year-old female patient presented with progressive weakness, muscle atrophy, fasciculation, and preserved deep tendon reflexes in the right upper limb. Electrophysiological testing showed lower motor neuron dysfunction. The patient was suspected to have ALS, but cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed enlarged blood vessels in the spinal canal, which compressed the cervical spinal cord and nerve roots. Angiography showed a shunt from the right vertebral artery to the right intervertebral vein and the vertebral venous plexus; therefore, the patient was diagnosed with VVAVF. Transarterial embolization was performed to obliterate the shunt, and weakness in the patient’s right upper limb subsequently improved. It is worth considering VVAVF as a differential diagnosis of ALS-like diseases.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy is associated with various degrees of cognitive impairment and behavioral disturbances. Emotional and memory deficits also constitute reliable outcome measures to assess efficacy of treatments in the <i>mdx</i> mouse lacking the muscle and neuronal full-length dystrophins. The present study aims at evaluating whether these deficits could be alleviated by the restoration of brain dystrophin.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed intracerebroventricular administration of a new potent tricyclo-DNA antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) containing a full phosphodiester backbone (PO) conjugated to a palmitic acid moiety (tcDNA-ASO), designed to skip the mutated exon 23 of <i>mdx</i> mice.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We first show that the tcDNA-ASO rescues expression of brain dystrophin to 10-30% of WT levels and significantly reduces the abnormal unconditioned fear responses in <i>mdx</i> mice in a dose-dependent manner, 5 weeks post-injection. Exon skipping efficiency, ASO biodistribution, protein restoration and effect on the fear response were optimal with a dose of 400 μg at 6-7 weeks post-injection, with synaptic-like expression in brain tissues such as hippocampus and amygdala. Moreover, this dose of tcDNA-ASO restored long-term memory retention of <i>mdx</i> mice in an object recognition task, but only had minor effects on fear conditioning.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results suggest for the first time that postnatal re-expression of brain dystrophin could reverse or at least alleviate some cognitive deficits associated with DMD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Student teachers' perceptions of the collaborative relationships form between universities and inclusive elementary schools in Indonesia [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The collaborative relationship between universities and inclusive elementary schools has not been maximally practiced. The form of collaboration that universities with inclusive elementary schools have carried out is still limited to the need to complete lecture materials during the semester. There is a gap between the theory and practice obtained by student teachers at universities when they have to teach in inclusive elementary schools. As a result, they have not contributed to solving problems that occur in inclusive elementary schools. The collaborative relationship between inclusive elementary schools and universities directly implies that the success of inclusive education is determined by the competence of student teachers whose lecturers have successfully educated them in order to teach in inclusive elementary schools. Compared to the background that the inclusive education system is developing in Indonesia, the researchers investigated student teachers' perceptions at universities regarding inclusive university-inclusive elementary school collaborative relationships. Methods: During data collection, an online survey and in-depth interviews of student teachers about individual experiences and their ideas about the form of inclusive elementary schools-university partnerships was conducted. The data analysis used was a thematic analysis technique. Result: The result summarizes student teachers' statements, revealed three main themes: provision of inclusive education needs, research, and field practice. The student teachers revealed that the collaborative relationship between universities and inclusive elementary schools is essential in order to develop holistic, inclusive practices in a collaborative partnership based on input-needs, which has a two-way impact or benefit for both parties. Conclusions: Furthermore, collaborative relationships must be in the form of long-term programs, such as continuous assistance, and adaptation to the development of inclusive education through lecture materials. To achieve successful inclusive education in Indonesia, we also recommended that the government make policies on multi-sectoral collaboration in order to support inclusive education.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">On the essence of cardiopulmonary resuscitation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This article discusses that the essence of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is energy transfer. The concept of occult cardiac arrest is proposed, and cardioversion after cardiac arrest is divided into spontaneous cardioversion and CPR according to the principle of energy transfer: the internal energy transmission of the body makes the cardioversion that is known as spontaneous cardioversion, and energy is mainly transfers from the outside leads to cardioversion, that is, CPR. The concept of domain energy in CPR is proposed, and it is argued that only energy transfer beyond the domain energy can lead to cardioversion in both spontaneous cardioversion and CPR. The principle of energy transfer is used to explain the common clinical electrocardiographic phenomena: dysrhythmia can occur when the energy required for the cardiac functions is insufficient, it is a manifestation of self-protection of the heart and the body, and the mechanism is further argued. It is demonstrated that serious cardiac events, such as ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest, are special types of cardiac self-protection. The mechanisms, general rules, and energy properties of modern CPR energy transfer are described, and the influence and interaction of energy transfer principle on the three states of time, space, and energy transfer during CPR are assessed, which will be significant for future research on CPR.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Recommendations for the formatting of Variant Call Format (VCF) files to make plant genotyping data FAIR [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                In this opinion article, we discuss the formatting of files from (plant) genotyping studies, in particular the formatting of metadata in Variant Call Format (VCF) files. The flexibility of the VCF format specification facilitates its use as a generic interchange format across domains but can lead to inconsistency between files in the presentation of metadata. To enable fully autonomous machine actionable data flow, generic elements need to be further specified. We strongly support the merits of the FAIR principles and see the need to facilitate them also through technical implementation specifications. They form a basis for the proposed VCF extensions here. We have learned from the existing application of VCF that the definition of relevant metadata using controlled standards, vocabulary and the consistent use of cross-references via resolvable identifiers (machine-readable) are particularly necessary and propose their encoding. VCF is an established standard for the exchange and publication of genotyping data. Other data formats are also used to capture variant data (for example, the HapMap and the gVCF formats), but none currently have the reach of VCF. For the sake of simplicity, we will only discuss VCF and our recommendations for its use, but these recommendations could also be applied to gVCF. However, the part of the VCF standard relating to metadata (as opposed to the actual variant calls) defines a syntactic format but no vocabulary, unique identifier or recommended content. In practice, often only sparse descriptive metadata is included. When descriptive metadata is provided, proprietary metadata fields are frequently added that have not been agreed upon within the community which may limit long-term and comprehensive interoperability. To address this, we propose recommendations for supplying and encoding metadata, focusing on use cases from plant sciences. We expect there to be overlap, but also divergence, with the needs of other domains.

                Background: Lake Wanchi is one of the Ethiopian lakes that have huge ecological, socio-economic and aesthetic value. This study was conducted to assess the ecological condition of Lake Wanchi using the macroinvertebrate-based index of biotic integrity between September 2016 and should 2017. Methods: Four sampling sites (LWS 1, LWS 2, LWS 3, and LWS 4) were purposively selected. A rapid bioassessment protocol criterion was accustomed to categorize the sites. About 1249 macroinvertebrate individuals were collected using the D-frame net with a mesh size of 500µm. Physico-chemical analysis was also done to assess the link between the benthic macroinvertebrate structure and environmental factors within the system. Results: The benthic index of biotic integrity ranged from 12.54 to 100 and also the sites were categorized into three quality ranks: LWS 1 and 3 as fair, LWS 2 as good, and LWS 4 as very good.  Conclusions: The study confirmed that Lake Wanchi was largely influenced by agricultural and other anthropogenic factors. This study concluded that the benthic index of biotic integrity is an appropriate tool for water quality and ecological assessment in the lakes.

                Background: Management of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis (LN) in pregnancy has been improving in recent decades. However, SLE can still lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes if not appropriately treated. Optimal dose of steroids, as one of the most commonly used for the treatment of SLE and LN in pregnancy is still a subject of debate. In this review, we determine the pregnancy outcomes in SLE and LN patients treated with low vs high doses of steroids. Methods: ProQuest, Pubmed, Science Direct, Scopus, and Web of Science were carefully searched for relevant studies published in English. A total of 2,596 studies were reviewed. We extracted the data from previous studies showing the use of steroids treatment in high-dose and low-dose related to pregnancy outcomes. We provide larger data about maternal (preterm rupture of membrane, fetal loss, pre-eclampsia, and flare up) and fetal outcomes (prematurity, small gestational age, low birth weight) receiving high vs low steroid in patients with SLE and LN in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Results: A total of 13 studies were included. Of these, one study discussed a group with LN and 12 other studies discussed SLE with related maternal and fetal outcomes. Maternal outcome in the group with low-dose steroid showed a lower risk of fetal loss (odds ratio (OR): 1.93; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-3.70), but there were no differences in other maternal outcomes. The low-dose steroid group showed a better fetal outcome, with a lower risk of prematurity (OR: 3.06; 95% CI 1.98-4.71), small gestational age (OR: 2.63; 95% CI 1.15-6.00), and low birth weight (OR: 2.43; 95% CI 1.23-4.79). Conclusions: In pregnant patients with SLE or LN, high-dose steroids are associated with the high risk of fetal loss during pregnancy, preterm birth, small gestational age, and low birth weight.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Unprecedented early-summer heat stress and forecast of coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef, 2021-2022 [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is predicted to undergo its sixth mass coral bleaching event during the Southern Hemisphere summer of 2021-2022. Coral bleaching-level heat stress over the GBR is forecast to start earlier than any previous year in the satellite record (1985-present). The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coral Reef Watch (CRW) near real-time satellite-based heat stress products were used to investigate early-summer sea surface temperature (SST) and heat stress conditions on the GBR during late 2021. As of 14 December 2021, values of instantaneous heat stress (Coral Bleaching HotSpots) and accumulated heat stress over a 12-week running window (Degree Heating Weeks) on the GBR were unprecedented in the satellite record. Further, 89% of GBR satellite reef pixels for this date in 2021 had a positive seven-day SST trend of greater than 0.2 degrees Celsius/week. Background temperatures (the minimum temperature over the previous 29 days) were alarmingly high, with 87% of GBR reef pixels on 14 December 2021 being greater than the maximum SST over that same 29-day period for any year from 1985-2020. The GBR is starting the 2021-2022 summer season with more accumulated heat than ever before, which could have disastrous consequences for the health, recovery, and future of this critical reef system.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evaluation of clinical, histology, TNF-α, and collagen expressions on oral ulcer in rats after treatment with areca nut and chrysanthemum oral gel [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Areca nut (Areca catechu Linn.) is the seed of the fruit of the oriental palm that is commonly used among Southeast Asian communities. Chrysanthemum (Dendrathema grandiflora) is a flowering plant originating from East Asia and dominantly grows in China. Both of these plants have strong antioxidant activities. To investigate the mechanism of their wound healing activities, we prepared areca nut and chrysanthemum polyethylene oral gel and performed several in vivo assays using Sprague–Dawley rats. Methods: Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into five groups: Negative control group (rats with base gel treatment), positive control group (rats treated with triamcinolone acetonide), F1 (treatment with 20% areca nut:80% chrysanthemum), F2 (treatment with 50% areca nut:50% chrysanthemum), and F3 (treatment with 80% areca nut:20% chrysanthemum). Traumatic ulcers were performed on the buccal mucosa of all experimental animals that received topical oral gel and triamcinolone acetonide twice a day for seven days. The clinical and histological characteristics were analyzed and scored. Results: During the six days, the ulcerated area receded linearly over time and was completely cicatrized in F2, F3, and positive control group (Dependent t-test, p<0.05). There were significant increases in body weight in F2 and positive control groups. There were no significant differences between groups in histology examination (Kruskal Wallis test, p<0.05). The moderate score of TNF-α levels was seen in F2 and positive control groups (ANOVA/Tukey test, p<0.05). In the collagenases assay, a high concentration of areca nut (F3) induced the abundance of collagen during the ulcer healing process. Conclusions: The combination of areca nut and chrysanthemum extract in the oral gel can optimize the healing of traumatic oral ulcers in Sprague-Dawley rats through the increase of TNF-α and collagen deposition.

                Background: This study focuses on identifying non-technical aspects that influence the sustainability of communal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in a peri-urban area of Indonesia. Methods: A questionnaire survey was conducted by random sampling using a method of descriptive analysis that combines qualitative and quantitative approaches. Economic support for communal WWTPs was measured by the community’s Willingness to Pay (WTP) and Ability to Pay (ATP). Results: The results indicate that social dimension, such as a community’s level of participation are critically important in sustaining communal WWTPs. In addition, institutional dimension influences the degree of satisfaction a community has toward the WWTP management. This support is reinforced by social capital in the form of a philosophy of mutual cooperation, like gotong royong (cooperation by members of a community to achieve a common goal) and swadaya (self-reliance). Conclusions: The findings of this study can be used in Indonesia to make policy recommendations for managing and ensuring sustainability of communal WWTPs on a non-technical dimension. Additionally, gotong royong deserves to be promoted internationally as a fundamental value for fostering participation and contribution.

                Portable electronic devices and miniaturized devices would require different operating voltages and load current which can be powered through DC-DC converter. In this paper, the proposed converter is based on a multiple topology of DC-DC converter circuit for more than one voltage gain regions using switched capacitor (SC) method. The post layout implementation showed that the high efficiency networks are achieved with low voltage drop and low internal resistance. The efficiency of 95% and 85% are shown, on the networks in the 1/2 and 2/3 voltage gain regions respectively, proving that this method is advantageous compared to other literature papers.

                Background: One of the fastest spreading vector-borne diseases in tropical and subtropical regions is dengue, which generates cost overruns for public health entities. Several factors can influence the dynamics of dengue virus transmission: environmental and climatic (abundance of vectors), interactions between hosts (infections by asymptomatic individuals), and population immunological factors. Given these conditions, it is necessary to carry out theoretical studies based on meteorological factors and asymptomatic transmission that are associated with both the existence of the vector and its incidence, in order to provide a scientific basis for health entities in decision-making. Methods: A mathematical model based on nonlinear ordinary differential equations is proposed to interpret the dynamics of dengue transmission in humans coupled to the dynamics of the Aedes aegypti species, considering the population of symptomatic and asymptomatic infected humans and the effect of temperature variability. The basic reproduction number was found and some simulation results based on the Runge-Kutta numerical method were obtained. Results: The simulations showed that the temperature had a directly proportional relationship with the basic reproduction number. The cases of infected people and carrier mosquitoes increased when the temperature peaks increased drastically; in low temperatures the infection persisted with low morbidity due to the survival of asymptomatic people. Conclusions: High temperatures tolerable by mosquitoes increase their life expectancy and their numbers in the environment which, together with a reservoir of asymptomatic infected people, leads to a higher incidence of the dengue virus in certain seasons or maintains its circulation in seasons of low temperatures, despite lower vector survival rates.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Construction of complex memories via parallel distributed cortical–subcortical iterative integration</a></h4>

              
                The construction of complex engrams requires hippocampal–cortical interactions. These include both direct interactions and ones via often-overlooked subcortical loops. Here, we review the anatomical organization of a hierarchy of parallel ‘Papez’ loops through the hypothalamus that are homologous in mammals from rats to humans. These hypothalamic loops supplement direct hippocampal–cortical connections with iterative reprocessing paced by theta rhythmicity. We couple existing anatomy and lesion data with theory to propose that recirculation in these loops progressively enhances desired connections, while reducing interference from competing external goals and internal associations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A crowd of BashTheBug volunteers reproducibly and accurately measure the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 13 antitubercular drugs from photographs of 96-well broth microdilution plates</a></h4>

              
                Tuberculosis is a respiratory disease that is treatable with antibiotics. An increasing prevalence of resistance means that to ensure a good treatment outcome it is desirable to test the susceptibility of each infection to different antibiotics. Conventionally this is done by culturing a clinical sample and then exposing aliquots to a panel of antibiotics, Using 96-well broth micro dilution plates with each well containing a lyophilised predetermined amount of an antibiotic is a convenient and cost-effective way to measure the MICs of several drugs at once for a clinical sample. Although accurate, this is still an expensive and slow process that requires highly skilled and experienced laboratory scientists. Here we show that, through the BashTheBug project hosted on the Zooniverse citizen science platform, a crowd of volunteers can reproducibly and accurately determine the MICs for 13 drugs and that simply taking the median or mode of 11-17 independent classifications is sufficient. There is therefore a potential role for crowds to support (but not supplant) the role of experts in antibiotic susceptibility testing.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Single-cell transcriptome reveals insights into the development and function of the zebrafish ovary</a></h4>

              
                Zebrafish are an established research organism that has made many contributions to our understanding of vertebrate tissue and organ development, yet there are still significant gaps in our understanding of the genes that regulate gonad development, sex, and reproduction. Unlike the development of many organs, such as the brain and heart that form during the first few days of development, zebrafish gonads do not begin to form until the larval stage (≥5 dpf). Thus, forward genetic screens have identified very few genes required for gonad development. In addition, bulk RNA sequencing studies which identify genes expressed in the gonads do not have the resolution necessary to define minor cell populations that may play significant roles in development and function of these organs. To overcome these limitations, we have used single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the transcriptomes of cells isolated from juvenile zebrafish ovaries. This resulted in the profiles of 10,658 germ cells and 14,431 somatic cells. Our germ cell data represents all developmental stages from germline stem cells to early meiotic oocytes. Our somatic cell data represents all known somatic cell types, including follicle cells, theca cells and ovarian stromal cells. Further analysis revealed an unexpected number of cell subpopulations within these broadly defined cell types. To further define their functional significance, we determined the location of these cell subpopulations within the ovary. Finally, we used gene knockout experiments to determine the roles of <i>foxl2l</i> and <i>wnt9b</i> for oocyte development and sex determination and/or differentiation, respectively. Our results reveal novel insights into zebrafish ovarian development and function and the transcriptome profiles will provide a valuable resource for future studies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Selection for infectivity profiles in slow and fast epidemics, and the rise of SARS-CoV-2 variants</a></h4>

              
                Evaluating the characteristics of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern is essential to inform pandemic risk assessment. A variant may grow faster if it produces a larger number of secondary infections ('R advantage') or if the timing of secondary infections (generation time) is better. So far, assessments have largely focused on deriving the R advantage assuming the generation time was unchanged. Yet, knowledge of both is needed to anticipate impact. Here we develop an analytical framework to investigate the contribution of <i>both</i> the R advantage and generation time to the growth advantage of a variant. It is known that selection on a variant with larger R increases with levels of transmission in the community. We additionally show that variants conferring earlier transmission are more strongly favoured when the historical strains have fast epidemic growth, while variants conferring later transmission are more strongly favoured when historical strains have slow or negative growth. We develop these conceptual insights into a new statistical framework to infer both the R advantage and generation time of a variant. On simulated data, our framework correctly estimates both parameters when it covers time periods characterized by different epidemiological contexts. Applied to data for the Alpha and Delta variants in England and in Europe, we find that Alpha confers a +54% [95% CI, 45-63%] R advantage compared to previous strains, and Delta +140% [98-182%] compared to Alpha, and mean generation times are similar to historical strains for both variants. This work helps interpret variant frequency dynamics and will strengthen risk assessment for future variants of concern.
