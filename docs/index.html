	<p>Flavonoids, a group of natural compounds with phenolic structure, are becoming popular as alternative medicines obtained from plants. These compounds are reported to have various pharmacological properties, including attenuation of inflammatory responses in multiple health issues. Epilepsy is a disorder of the central nervous system implicated with the activation of the inflammatory cascade in the brain. The aim of the present study was to summarize the role of various neuroinflammatory mediators in the onset and progression of epilepsy, and, thereafter, to discuss the flavonoids and their classes, including their biological properties. Further, we highlighted the modulation of anti-inflammatory responses achieved by these substances in different forms of epilepsy, as evident from preclinical studies executed on multiple epilepsy models. Overall, the review summarizes the available evidence of the anti-inflammatory potential of various flavonoids in epilepsy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Trapping of Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Ligands Assayed by In Vitro Cellular Studies and In Vivo PET Imaging</a></h4>

              
                <p>A question relevant to nicotine addiction is how nicotine and other nicotinic receptor membrane-permeant ligands, such as the anti-smoking drug varenicline (Chantix), distribute in brain. Ligands, like varenicline, with high pK<SUB>a</SUB> and high affinity for &alpha;4&beta;2-type nicotinic receptors (&alpha;4&beta;2Rs) are trapped in intracellular acidic vesicles containing &alpha;4&beta;2Rs <I>in vitro</I>. Nicotine, with lower pK<SUB>a</SUB> and &alpha;4&beta;2R affinity, is not trapped. Here, we extend our results by imaging nicotinic PET ligands <I>in vivo</I> in male and female mouse brain and identifying the trapping brain organelle <I>in vitro</I> as Golgi satellites (GSats). Two PET <sup>18</sup>F-labeled imaging ligands were chosen: [<sup>18</sup>F]2-FA85380 (2-FA) with varenicline-like pK<SUB>a</SUB> and affinity and [<sup>18</sup>F]Nifene with nicotine-like pK<SUB>a</SUB> and affinity. [<sup>18</sup>F]2-FA PET-imaging kinetics were very slow consistent with 2-FA trapping in &alpha;4&beta;2R-containing GSats. In contrast, [<sup>18</sup>F]Nifene kinetics were rapid, consistent with its binding to &alpha;4&beta;2Rs but no trapping. Specific [<sup>18</sup>F]2-FA and [<sup>18</sup>F]Nifene signals were eliminated in &beta;2 subunit knock-out (KO) mice or by acute nicotine (AN) injections demonstrating binding to sites on &beta;2-containing receptors. Chloroquine (CQ), which dissipates GSat pH gradients, reduced [<sup>18</sup>F]2-FA distributions while having little effect on [<sup>18</sup>F]Nifene distributions <I>in vivo</I> consistent with only [<sup>18</sup>F]2-FA trapping in GSats. These results are further supported by <I>in vitro</I> findings where dissipation of GSat pH gradients blocks 2-FA trapping in GSats without affecting Nifene. By combining <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I> imaging, we mapped both the brain-wide and subcellular distributions of weak-base nicotinic receptor ligands. We conclude that ligands, such as varenicline, are trapped in neurons in &alpha;4&beta;2R-containing GSats, which results in very slow release long after nicotine is gone after smoking.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Mechanisms of nicotine addiction remain poorly understood. An earlier study using <I>in vitro</I> methods found that the anti-smoking nicotinic ligand, varenicline (Chantix) was trapped in &alpha;4&beta;2R-containing acidic vesicles. Using a fluorescent-labeled high-affinity nicotinic ligand, this study provided evidence that these intracellular acidic vesicles were &alpha;4&beta;2R-containing Golgi satellites (GSats). <I>In vivo</I> PET imaging with F-18-labeled nicotinic ligands provided additional evidence that differences in PET ligand trapping in acidic vesicles were the cause of differences in PET ligand kinetics and subcellular distributions. These findings combining <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I> imaging revealed new mechanistic insights into the kinetics of weak base PET imaging ligands and the subcellular mechanisms underlying nicotine addiction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Pharmacological Signature and Target Specificity of Inhibitory Circuits Formed by Martinotti Cells in the Mouse Barrel Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the neocortex, fast synaptic inhibition orchestrates both spontaneous and sensory-evoked activity. GABAergic interneurons (INs) inhibit pyramidal neurons (PNs) directly, modulating their output activity and thus contributing to balance cortical networks. Moreover, several IN subtypes also inhibit other INs, forming specific disinhibitory circuits, which play crucial roles in several cognitive functions. Here, we studied a subpopulation of somatostatin-positive INs, the Martinotti cells (MCs) in layer 2/3 of the mouse barrel cortex (both sexes). MCs inhibit the distal portion of PN apical dendrites, thus controlling dendrite electrogenesis and synaptic integration. Yet, it is poorly understood whether MCs inhibit other elements of the cortical circuits, and the connectivity properties with non-PN targets are unknown. We found that MCs have a strong preference for PN dendrites, but they also considerably connect with parvalbumin-positive, vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing, and layer 1 (L1) INs. Remarkably, GABAergic synapses from MCs exhibited clear cell type-specific short-term plasticity. Moreover, whereas the biophysical properties of MC-PN synapses were consistent with distal dendritic inhibition, MC-IN synapses exhibited characteristics of fast perisomatic inhibition. Finally, MC-PN connections used &alpha;5-containing GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs), but this subunit was not expressed by the other INs targeted by MCs. We reveal a specialized connectivity blueprint of MCs within different elements of superficial cortical layers. In addition, our results identify &alpha;5-GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs as the molecular fingerprint of MC-PN dendritic inhibition. This is of critical importance, given the role of &alpha;5-GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs in cognitive performance and their involvement in several brain diseases.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Martinotti cells (MCs) are a prominent, broad subclass of somatostatin-expressing GABAergic interneurons, specialized in controlling distal dendrites of pyramidal neurons (PNs) and taking part in several cognitive functions. Here we characterize the connectivity pattern of MCs with other interneurons in the superficial layers (L1 and L2/3) of the mouse barrel cortex. We found that the connectivity pattern of MCs with PNs as well as parvalbumin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and L1 interneurons exhibit target-specific plasticity and biophysical properties. The specificity of &alpha;5-GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs at MC-PN synapses and the lack or functional expression of this subunit by other cell types define the molecular identity of MC-PN connections and the exclusive involvement of this inhibitory circuits in &alpha;5-dependent cognitive tasks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Synaptic Development in Diverse Olfactory Neuron Classes Uses Distinct Temporal and Activity-Related Programs</a></h4>

              
                <p>Developing neurons must meet core molecular, cellular, and temporal requirements to ensure the correct formation of synapses, resulting in functional circuits. However, because of the vast diversity in neuronal class and function, it is unclear whether or not all neurons use the same organizational mechanisms to form synaptic connections and achieve functional and morphologic maturation. Moreover, it remains unknown whether neurons united in a common goal and comprising the same sensory circuit develop on similar timescales and use identical molecular approaches to ensure the formation of the correct number of synapses. To begin to answer these questions, we took advantage of the <I>Drosophila</I> antennal lobe (AL), a model olfactory circuit with remarkable genetic access and synapse-level resolution. Using tissue-specific genetic labeling of active zones, we performed a quantitative analysis of synapse formation in multiple classes of neurons of both sexes throughout development and adulthood. We found that olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), projection neurons (PNs), and local interneurons (LNs) each have unique time courses of synaptic development, addition, and refinement, demonstrating that each class follows a distinct developmental program. This raised the possibility that these classes may also have distinct molecular requirements for synapse formation. We genetically altered neuronal activity in each neuronal subtype and observed differing effects on synapse number based on the neuronal class examined. Silencing neuronal activity in ORNs, PNs, and LNs impaired synaptic development but only in ORNs did enhancing neuronal activity influence synapse formation. ORNs and LNs demonstrated similar impairment of synaptic development with enhanced activity of a master kinase, GSK-3&beta;, suggesting that neuronal activity and GSK-3&beta; kinase activity function in a common pathway. ORNs also, however, demonstrated impaired synaptic development with GSK-3&beta; loss-of-function, suggesting additional activity-independent roles in development. Ultimately, our results suggest that the requirements for synaptic development are not uniform across all neuronal classes with considerable diversity existing in both their developmental time frames and molecular requirements. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms of synaptic development and lay the foundation for future work determining their underlying etiologies.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Distinct olfactory neuron classes in <I>Drosophila</I> develop a mature synaptic complement over unique timelines and using distinct activity-dependent and molecular programs, despite having the same generalized goal of olfactory sensation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Preferential Modulatory Action of 5-HT2A Receptors on the Dynamic Regulation of Basal Ganglia Circuits</a></h4>

              
                <p>In rodents, cortical information is transferred to the <I>substantia nigra pars reticulata</I> (SNr) through motor and medial prefrontal (mPF) basal ganglia (BG) circuits implicated in motor and cognitive/motivational behaviors, respectively. The serotonergic 5-HT<SUB>2A</SUB> receptors are located in both of these neuronal networks, displaying topographical differences with a high expression in the associative/limbic territories, and a very low expression in the subthalamic nucleus. This study investigated whether the stimulation of 5-HT<SUB>2A</SUB> receptors could have a specific signature on the dynamic regulation of BG circuits, preferentially modulating the mPF information processing through trans-striatal pathways. We performed <I>in vivo</I> single-unit extracellular recordings to assess the effect of the 5-HT<SUB>2A</SUB> agonist TCB-2 on the spontaneous and cortically evoked activity of lateral and medial SNr neurons in male rats (involved in motor and mPF circuits, respectively). TCB-2 (50&ndash;200 &micro;g/kg, i.v.) increased the basal firing rate and enhanced the cortically evoked inhibitory response of medial SNr neurons (transmission through the direct striato-nigral pathway). A prior administration of the preferential 5-HT<SUB>2A</SUB> receptor antagonist MDL11939 (200 &micro;g/kg, i.v.) did not modify any electrophysiological parameter, but occluded TCB-2-induced effects. In animals treated with the 5-HT synthesis inhibitor pCPA (4-chloro-<scp>dl</scp>-phenylalanine methyl ester hydrochloride), TCB-2 failed to induce the above-mentioned effects, thus suggesting the contribution of endogenous 5-HT. However, the mobilization of 5-HT induced by the acute administration of fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) did not mimic the effects triggered by TCB-2. Overall, these data suggest that 5-HT<SUB>2A</SUB> receptors have a preferential modulatory action on the dynamic regulation of BG circuitry.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Motor and medial prefrontal (mPF) basal ganglia (BG) circuits play an important role in integrative brain functions like movement control or cognitive/motivational behavior, respectively. Although these neuronal networks express 5-HT<SUB>2A</SUB> receptors, the expression is higher in associative/limbic structures than in the motor ones. We show a topographical-dependent dissociation in the effects triggered by the 5HT<SUB>2A</SUB> agonist TCB-2, which specifically increases the medial <I>substantia nigra pars reticulata</I> neuron activity and has a preferential action on mPF information processing through the striato-nigral direct pathway. These are very likely to be 5-HT<SUB>2A</SUB> receptor-mediated effects that require mobilization of the endogenous 5-HT system. These findings provide evidence about the specific signature of 5-HT<SUB>2A</SUB> receptors on the dynamic regulation of BG circuits.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Parallel Pathways Provide Hippocampal Spatial Information to Prefrontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Long-range synaptic connections define how information flows through neuronal networks. Here, we combined retrograde and anterograde trans-synaptic viruses to delineate areas that exert direct and indirect influence over the dorsal and ventral prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the rat (both sexes). Notably, retrograde tracing using pseudorabies virus (PRV) revealed that both dorsal and ventral areas of the PFC receive prominent disynaptic input from the dorsal CA3 (dCA3) region of the hippocampus. The PRV experiments also identified candidate anatomical relays for this disynaptic pathway, namely, the ventral hippocampus, lateral septum, thalamus, amygdala, and basal forebrain. To determine the viability of each of these relays, we performed three additional experiments. In the first, we injected the retrograde monosynaptic tracer Fluoro-Gold into the PFC and the anterograde monosynaptic tracer Fluoro-Ruby into the dCA3 to confirm the first-order connecting areas and revealed several potential relay regions between the PFC and dCA3. In the second, we combined PRV injection in the PFC with polysynaptic anterograde viral tracer (HSV-1) in the dCA3 to reveal colabeled connecting neurons, which were evident only in the ventral hippocampus. In the third, we combined retrograde adeno-associated virus (AAV) injections in the PFC with an anterograde AAV in the dCA3 to reveal anatomical relay neurons in the ventral hippocampus and dorsal lateral septum. Together, these findings reveal parallel disynaptic pathways from the dCA3 to the PFC, illuminating a new anatomical framework for understanding hippocampal&ndash;prefrontal interactions. We suggest that the representation of context and space may be a universal feature of prefrontal function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The known functions of the prefrontal cortex are shaped by input from multiple brain areas. We used transneuronal viral tracing to discover multiple prominent disynaptic pathways through which the dorsal hippocampus (specifically, the dorsal CA3) has the potential to shape the actions of the prefrontal cortex. The demonstration of neuronal relays in the ventral hippocampus and lateral septum presents a new foundation for understanding long-range influences over prefrontal interactions, including the specific contribution of the dorsal CA3 to prefrontal function.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Creation of Neuronal Ensembles and Cell-Specific Homeostatic Plasticity through Chronic Sparse Optogenetic Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cortical computations emerge from the dynamics of neurons embedded in complex cortical circuits. Within these circuits, neuronal ensembles, which represent subnetworks with shared functional connectivity, emerge in an experience-dependent manner. Here we induced ensembles in <I>ex vivo</I> cortical circuits from mice of either sex by differentially activating subpopulations through chronic optogenetic stimulation. We observed a decrease in voltage correlation, and importantly a synaptic decoupling between the stimulated and nonstimulated populations. We also observed a decrease in firing rate during Up-states in the stimulated population. These ensemble-specific changes were accompanied by decreases in intrinsic excitability in the stimulated population, and a decrease in connectivity between stimulated and nonstimulated pyramidal neurons. By incorporating the empirically observed changes in intrinsic excitability and connectivity into a spiking neural network model, we were able to demonstrate that changes in both intrinsic excitability and connectivity accounted for the decreased firing rate, but only changes in connectivity accounted for the observed decorrelation. Our findings help ascertain the mechanisms underlying the ability of chronic patterned stimulation to create ensembles within cortical circuits and, importantly, show that while Up-states are a global network-wide phenomenon, functionally distinct ensembles can preserve their identity during Up-states through differential firing rates and correlations.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The connectivity and activity patterns of local cortical circuits are shaped by experience. This experience-dependent reorganization of cortical circuits is driven by complex interactions between different local learning rules, external input, and reciprocal feedback between many distinct brain areas. Here we used an <I>ex vivo</I> approach to demonstrate how simple forms of chronic external stimulation can shape local cortical circuits in terms of their correlated activity and functional connectivity. The absence of feedback between different brain areas and full control of external input allowed for a tractable system to study the underlying mechanisms and development of a computational model. Results show that differential stimulation of subpopulations of neurons significantly reshapes cortical circuits and forms subnetworks referred to as neuronal ensembles.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Redundant Cortical Code for Speech Envelope</a></h4>

              
                <p>Animal communication sounds exhibit complex temporal structure because of the amplitude fluctuations that comprise the sound envelope. In human speech, envelope modulations drive synchronized activity in auditory cortex (AC), which correlates strongly with comprehension (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B17">Giraud and Poeppel, 2012</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B47">Peelle and Davis, 2012</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B20">Haegens and Zion Golumbic, 2018</cross-ref>). Studies of envelope coding in single neurons, performed in nonhuman animals, have focused on periodic amplitude modulation (AM) stimuli and use response metrics that are not easy to juxtapose with data from humans. In this study, we sought to bridge these fields. Specifically, we looked directly at the temporal relationship between stimulus envelope and spiking, and we assessed whether the apparent diversity across neurons' AM responses contributes to the population representation of speech-like sound envelopes. We gathered responses from single neurons to vocoded speech stimuli and compared them to sinusoidal AM responses in auditory cortex (AC) of alert, freely moving Mongolian gerbils of both sexes. While AC neurons displayed heterogeneous tuning to AM rate, their temporal dynamics were stereotyped. Preferred response phases accumulated near the onsets of sinusoidal AM periods for slower rates (&lt;8 Hz), and an over-representation of amplitude edges was apparent in population responses to both sinusoidal AM and vocoded speech envelopes. Crucially, this encoding bias imparted a decoding benefit: a classifier could discriminate vocoded speech stimuli using summed population activity, while higher frequency modulations required a more sophisticated decoder that tracked spiking responses from individual cells. Together, our results imply that the envelope structure relevant to parsing an acoustic stream could be read-out from a distributed, redundant population code.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Animal communication sounds have rich temporal structure and are often produced in extended sequences, including the syllabic structure of human speech. Although the auditory cortex (AC) is known to play a crucial role in representing speech syllables, the contribution of individual neurons remains uncertain. Here, we characterized the representations of both simple, amplitude-modulated sounds and complex, speech-like stimuli within a broad population of cortical neurons, and we found an overrepresentation of amplitude edges. Thus, a phasic, redundant code in auditory cortex can provide a mechanistic explanation for segmenting acoustic streams like human speech.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Activity Patterns of Individual Neurons and Ensembles Correlated with Retrieval of a Contextual Memory in the Dorsal CA1 of Mouse Hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <p>The hippocampus is crucial for retrieval of contextual memories. The activation of a subpopulation of neurons in the dorsal CA1 (dCA1) of the hippocampus is required for memory retrieval. Given that hippocampal neurons exhibit distinct patterns of response during memory retrieval, the activity patterns of individual neurons or ensembles may be critically involved in memory retrieval. However, this relation has been unclear. To investigate this question, we used an <I>in vivo</I> microendoscope calcium imaging technique to optically record neuronal activity in the dCA1 of male and female mice. We observed that a portion of dCA1 neurons increased their responses to the learned context after contextual fear conditioning (FC), resulting in overall increase in response of neuronal population compared with simple context exposure. Such increased response was specific to the conditioned context as it disappeared in neutral context. The magnitude of increase in neuronal responses by FC was proportional to memory strength during retrieval. The increases in activity preferentially occurred during the putative sharp wave ripple events and were not simply because of animal's movement and immobility. At the ensemble level, synchronous cell activity patterns were associated with memory retrieval. Accordingly, when such patterns were more similar between conditioned and neutral context, animals displayed proportionally more similar level of freezing. Together, these results indicate that increase in responses of individual neurons and synchronous cell activity patterns in the dCA1 neuronal network are critically involved in representing a contextual memory recall.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neurons in the dorsal CA1 of the hippocampus are crucial for memory retrieval. By using <I>in vivo</I> calcium imaging methods for recording neuronal activity, we demonstrate that dCA1 neurons increased their responses to the learned context specifically by FC and such changes correlated with memory strength during retrieval. Moreover, distinct synchronous cell activity patterns were formed by FC and involved in representing contextual memory retrieval. These findings reveal dynamic activity features of dCA1 neurons that are involved in contextual memory retrieval.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Action Observation Network Activity Related to Object-Directed and Socially-Directed Actions in Adolescents</a></h4>

              
                <p>The human action observation network (AON) encompasses brain areas consistently engaged when we observe other's actions. Although the core nodes of the AON are present from childhood, it is not known to what extent they are sensitive to different action features during development. Because social cognitive abilities continue to mature during adolescence, the AON response to socially-oriented actions, but not to object-related actions, may differ in adolescents and adults. To test this hypothesis, we scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) male and female typically-developing teenagers (<I>n</I> = 28; 13 females) and adults (<I>n</I> = 25; 14 females) while they passively watched videos of manual actions varying along two dimensions: sociality (i.e., directed toward another person or not) and transitivity (i.e., involving an object or not). We found that action observation recruited the same fronto-parietal and occipito-temporal regions in adults and adolescents. The modulation of voxel-wise activity according to the social or transitive nature of the action was similar in both groups of participants. Multivariate pattern analysis, however, revealed that decoding accuracies in intraparietal sulcus (IPS)/superior parietal lobe (SPL) for both sociality and transitivity were lower for adolescents compared with adults. In addition, in the lateral occipital temporal cortex (LOTC), generalization of decoding across the orthogonal dimension was lower for sociality only in adolescents. These findings indicate that the representation of the content of others' actions, and in particular their social dimension, in the adolescent AON is still not as robust as in adults.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The activity of the action observation network (AON) in the human brain is modulated according to the purpose of the observed action, in particular the extent to which it involves interaction with an object or with another person. How this conceptual representation of actions is implemented during development is largely unknown. Here, using multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, we discovered that, while the action observation network is in place in adolescence, the fine-grain organization of its posterior regions is less robust than in adults to decode the abstract social dimensions of an action. This finding highlights the late maturation of social processing in the human brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Rapid Interactions of Widespread Brain Networks Characterize Semantic Cognition</a></h4>

              
                <p>Language comprehension requires the rapid retrieval and integration of contextually appropriate concepts ("semantic cognition"). Current neurobiological models of semantic cognition are limited by the spatial and temporal restrictions of single-modality neuroimaging and lesion approaches. This is a major impediment given the rapid sequence of processing steps that have to be coordinated to accurately comprehend language. Through the use of fused functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography analysis in humans (<I>n</I> = 26 adults; 15 females), we elucidate a temporally and spatially specific neurobiological model for real-time semantic cognition. We find that semantic cognition in the context of language comprehension is supported by trade-offs between widespread neural networks over the course of milliseconds. Incorporation of spatial and temporal characteristics, as well as behavioral measures, provide convergent evidence for the following progression: a hippocampal/anterior temporal phonological semantic retrieval network (peaking at ~300 ms after the sentence final word); a frontotemporal thematic semantic network (~400 ms); a hippocampal memory update network (~500 ms); an inferior frontal semantic syntactic reappraisal network (~600 ms); and nodes of the default mode network associated with conceptual coherence (~750 ms). Additionally, in typical adults, mediatory relationships among these networks are significantly predictive of language comprehension ability. These findings provide a conceptual and methodological framework for the examination of speech and language disorders, with additional implications for the characterization of cognitive processes and clinical populations in other cognitive domains.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The present study identifies a real-time neurobiological model of the meaning processes required during language comprehension (i.e., "semantic cognition"). Using a novel application of fused magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography in humans, we found that semantic cognition during language comprehension is supported by a rapid progression of widespread neural networks related to meaning, meaning integration, memory, reappraisal, and conceptual cohesion. Relationships among these systems were predictive of individuals' language comprehension efficiency. Our findings are the first to use fused neuroimaging analysis to elucidate language processes. In so doing, this study provides a new conceptual and methodological framework in which to characterize language processes and guide the treatment of speech and language deficits/disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Selective TLR4 Antagonism Prevents and Reverses Morphine-Induced Persistent Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction, Dysregulation of Synaptic Elements, and Impaired BDNF Signaling in Aged Male Rats</a></h4>

              
                <p>Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PNDs) are characterized by confusion, difficulty with executive function, and episodic memory impairment in the hours to months following a surgical procedure. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) represents such impairments that last beyond 30 d postsurgery and is associated with increased risk of comorbidities, progression to dementia, and higher mortality. While it is clear that neuroinflammation plays a key role in PND development, what factors underlie shorter self-resolving versus persistent PNDs remains unclear. We have previously shown that postoperative morphine treatment extends POCD from 4 d (without morphine) to at least 8 weeks (with morphine) in aged male rats, and that this effect is likely dependent on the proinflammatory capabilities of morphine via activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Here, we extend these findings to show that TLR4 blockade, using the selective TLR4 antagonist lipopolysaccharide from the bacterium <I>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</I> (LPS-RS Ultrapure), ameliorates morphine-induced POCD in aged male rats. Using either a single central preoperative treatment or a 1 week postoperative central treatment regimen, we demonstrate that TLR4 antagonism (1) prevents and reverses the long-term memory impairment associated with surgery and morphine treatment, (2) ameliorates morphine-induced dysregulation of the postsynaptic proteins postsynaptic density 95 and synaptopodin, (3) mitigates reductions in mature BDNF, and (4) prevents decreased activation of the BDNF receptor TrkB (tropomyosin-related kinase B), all at 4 weeks postsurgery. We also reveal that LPS-RS Ultrapure likely exerts its beneficial effects by preventing endogenous danger signal HMGB1 (high-mobility group box 1) from activating TLR4, rather than by blocking continuous activation by morphine or its metabolites. These findings suggest TLR4 as a promising therapeutic target to prevent or treat PNDs.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> With humans living longer than ever, it is crucial that we identify mechanisms that contribute to aging-related vulnerability to cognitive impairment. Here, we show that the innate immune receptor toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a key mediator of cognitive dysfunction in aged rodents following surgery and postoperative morphine treatment. Inhibition of TLR4 both prevented and reversed surgery plus morphine-associated memory impairment, dysregulation of synaptic elements, and reduced BDNF signaling. Together, these findings implicate TLR4 in the development of postoperative cognitive dysfunction, providing mechanistic insight and novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of cognitive impairments following immune challenges such as surgery in older individuals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Neural Signature of Impaired Inhibitory Control in Individuals with Heroin Use Disorder</a></h4>

              
                <p>Heroin addiction imposes a devastating toll on society, with little known about its neurobiology. Excessive salience attribution to drug over nondrug cues/reinforcers, with concomitant inhibitory control decreases, are common mechanisms underlying drug addiction. Although inhibitory control alterations generally culminate in prefrontal cortex (PFC) hypoactivations across drugs of abuse, patterns in individuals with heroin addiction (iHUDs) remain unknown. We used a stop-signal fMRI task designed to meet recent consensus guidelines in mapping inhibitory control in 41 iHUDs and 24 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). Despite group similarities in the stop-signal response time (SSRT; the classic inhibitory control measure), compared with HCs, iHUDs exhibited impaired target detection sensitivity (proportion of hits in go vs false alarms in stop trials; <I>p</I> = 0.003). Additionally, iHUDs exhibited lower right anterior PFC (aPFC) and dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) activity during successful versus failed stops (the hallmark inhibitory control contrast). Lower left dlPFC/supplementary motor area (SMA) activity was associated with slower SSRT specifically in iHUDs and lower left aPFC activity with worse target sensitivity across all participants (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05 corrected). Importantly, in iHUDs, lower left SMA and aPFC activity during inhibitory control was associated with shorter time since last use and higher severity of dependence, respectively (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05 corrected). Together, results revealed lower perceptual sensitivity and hypoactivations during inhibitory control in cognitive control regions (e.g., aPFC, dlPFC, SMA) as associated with task performance and heroin use severity measures in iHUDs. Such neurobehavioral inhibitory control deficits may contribute to self-control lapses in heroin addiction, constituting targets for prevention and intervention efforts to enhance recovery.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Heroin addiction continues its deadly impact, with little known about the neurobiology of this disorder. Although behavioral and prefrontal cortical impairments in inhibitory control characterize addiction across drugs of abuse, these patterns remain underexplored in heroin addiction. Here, we illustrate a significant behavioral impairment in target discrimination in individuals with heroin addiction compared with matched healthy controls. We further show lower engagement during inhibitory control in the anterior and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (key regions that regulate cognitive control) as associated with slower stopping, worse discrimination, and heroin use measures. Mapping the neurobiology of inhibitory control in heroin addiction for the first time, we identify potential treatment targets inclusive of prefrontal cortex-mediated cognitive control amenable for neuromodulation en route to recovery.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Automated Image Analysis Reveals Different Localization of Synaptic Gephyrin C4 Splice Variants</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Postsynaptic scaffolding proteins function as central organization hubs, ensuring the synaptic localization of neurotransmitter receptors, trans-synaptic adhesion proteins, and signaling molecules. Gephyrin is the major postsynaptic scaffolding protein at glycinergic and a subset of GABAergic inhibitory synapses. In contrast to cells outside the CNS, where one gephyrin isoform is predominantly expressed, neurons express different splice variants. In this study, we characterized the expression and scaffolding of neuronal gephyrin isoforms differing in the inclusion of the C4 cassettes located in the central C-domain. In hippocampal and cortical neuronal populations, gephyrin P1, lacking additional cassettes, is the most abundantly expressed isoform. In addition, alternative splicing generated isoforms carrying predominantly C4a, and minor amounts of C4c or C4d cassettes. We detected no striking difference in C4 isoform expression between different neuron types and a single neuron can likely express all C4 isoforms. To avoid the cytosolic aggregates that are commonly observed upon exogenous gephyrin expression, we used adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated expression to analyze the scaffolding behavior of individual C4 isoforms in murine dissociated hippocampal glutamatergic neurons. While all isoforms showed similar clustering at GABAergic synapses, a thorough quantitative analysis revealed localization differences for the C4c isoform (also known as P2). Specifically, synaptic C4c isoform clusters showed a more distal dendritic localization and reduced occurrence at P1-predominating synapses. Additionally, inhibitory currents displayed faster decay kinetics in the presence of gephyrin C4c compared with P1. Therefore, inhibitory synapse heterogeneity may be influenced, at least in part, by mechanisms relating to C4 cassette splicing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Spinal Cord Injury AIS Predictions Using Machine Learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>The study used machine learning to predict The American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) scores for newly injured spinal cord injury patients at hospital discharge time from hospital admission data. Additionally, machine learning was used to analyze the best model for feature importance to validate the criticality of the AIS score and highlight relevant demographic details. The data used for training machine learning models was from the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center (NSCISC) database of U.S. spinal cord injury patient details. Eighteen real features were used from 417 provided features, which mapped to 53 machine learning features after processing. Eight models were tuned on the dataset to predict AIS scores, and Shapely analysis was performed to extract the most important of the 53 features. Patients within the NSCISC database who sustained injuries were between 1972 and 2016 after data cleaning (<I>n</I> = 20,790). Outcomes were test set multiclass accuracy and aggregated Shapely score magnitudes. Ridge Classifier was the best performer with 73.6% test set accuracy. AIS scores and neurologic category at the time of admission were the best predictors of recovery. Demographically, features were less important, but age, sex, marital status, and race stood out. AIS scores on admission are highly predictive of patient outcomes when combined with patient demographic data.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">An Early Enriched Experience Drives an Activated Microglial Profile at Site of Corrective Neuroplasticity in Ten-m3 Knock-Out Mice</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Environmental enrichment (EE) is beneficial for brain development and function, but our understanding of its capacity to drive circuit repair, the underlying mechanisms, and how this might vary with age remains limited. Ten-m3 knock-out (KO) mice exhibit a dramatic and stereotyped mistargeting of ipsilateral retinal inputs to the thalamus, resulting in visual deficits. We have recently shown a previously unexpected capacity for EE during early postnatal life (from birth for six weeks) to drive the partial elimination of miswired axonal projections, along with a recovery of visually mediated behavior, but the timeline of this repair was unclear. Here, we reveal that with just 3.5 weeks of EE from birth, Ten-m3 KOs exhibit a partial behavioral rescue, accompanied by pruning of the most profoundly miswired retinogeniculate terminals. Analysis suggests that the pruning is underway at this time point, providing an ideal opportunity to probe potential mechanisms. With the shorter EE-period, we found a localized increase in microglial density and activation profile within the identified geniculate region where corrective pruning was observed. No comparable response to EE was found in age-matched wild-type (WT) mice. These findings identify microglia as a potential mechanistic link through which EE drives the elimination of miswired neural circuits during early postnatal development. Activity driven, atypical recruitment of microglia to prune aberrant connectivity and restore function may have important therapeutic implications for neurodevelopmental disorders such as autistic spectrum disorder.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Chinese culture became more individualistic: Evidence from family structure, 1953-2017 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Previous research has indicated that some aspects of Chinese culture became more individualistic. However, prior studies have suggested a decrease in individualism in other aspects of China. Thus, it was unclear whether China became more individualistic. Therefore, the current research investigated whether Chinese culture became more individualistic by examining historical changes in family structure. Specifically, I analyzed temporal shifts in the divorce rate and household size, which have been confirmed as valid representative indicators of individualism. Results showed that the divorce rate increased between 1978 and 2017 and household size decreased between 1953 and 2017, indicating a rise in individualism. Moreover, analyses suggested that the one-child policy was unlikely the sole and major factor in the decrease in household size. Additionally, the aggregated score of divorce rate and household size demonstrated a clear increase in individualism. Therefore, the present research provided further evidence of the rise in individualism in China.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Judicial breakfast as an external factor in judicial decision making in courts [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The objective of this article is to establish whether the judges depend on relevant facts, judicial rules, and the law when making their judgments or they use extraneous factors such as what a judge eats, personal ideology, beliefs, or the cultural and political environment. The discourse between the two sides is incomplete without exploring the grand theories: formalism and realism. The antimony between the two theories resulted in theoretical analysis and empirical research. The realism challenged the existing logical reasoning and legal rules that judges use in making their judgment as they contend that judges applying rules and law in their decision-making process are irrational and mechanical. Formalism insists on using the judicial rules and the law in making decisions as opposed to extraneous factors, which realists contend should be the basis for decision making with laws and rules only to support the findings. The continental legal theory holds that legal realism is a hard-nosed, down-to-earth, and practical school of thought that is opposed to mechanical and scientific theories. The scholarly analysis of the judicial decision-making process brings into focus the conduct of judicial officers and whether they base their reasoning on extrajudicial issues. However, the discussion should avoid denigrating into an attack on the personality of judges as it undermines the rule of law.

                Background: Patients with Crohn’s disease (CD) have an altered intestinal microbiome, which may facilitate novel diagnostic testing. However, accuracy of microbiome classification models across geographic regions may be limited. Therefore, we sought to examine geographic variation in the microbiome of patients with CD from North America and test the performance of a machine learning classification model across geographic regions. Methods: The RISK cohort included 447 pediatric patients with CD and 221 non-inflammatory bowel disease controls from across North America. Terminal ileum, rectal and fecal samples were obtained prior to treatment for microbiome analysis. We divided study sites into 3 geographic regions to examine regional microbiome differences. We trained and tested the performance of a machine learning classification model across these regions. Results: No differences were seen in the mucosal microbiome of patients with CD across regions or in either the fecal or mucosal microbiomes of controls. Machine learning classification algorithms for patients with CD performed well across regions (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] range of 0.85-0.91) with the best results from terminal ileum. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the feasibility of microbiome based diagnostic testing in pediatric patients with CD within North America, independently from regional influences.

                Background: The 44-question Thai Home Fall Hazard Assessment Tool (Thai-HFHAT) was developed to assist healthcare professionals in identifying the risk of falls among community-dwelling elderly from their home environment. However, the reliability of this tool has not been studied. This study aimed to examine reliability of the 44-question Thai-HFHAT and determine the person characteristics associated with home hazards. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study design was used for this research. The participants in this study were 51 elderly people from various types of Thai houses: a one-story elevated house, a one-story non-elevated house, and a house with two or more floors, 51 caregivers of elderly patients and 5 village health volunteers (VHV). All participants answered 44 Thai-HFHAT questions to determine inter-rater and test-retest reliabilities. The reliabilities were analyzed using an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Personal characteristics including sex, occupation, and education were used to identify the factors affecting home hazard and linear regression was used to analyze. Results: The ICC of inter-rater reliability of the 44-question Thai-HFHAT was 0.74 (95% CI: 0.57-0.84) and the test-retest reliability was 0.80 (95% CI: 0.64-0.88) for the elderly, 0.80 (95% CI: 0.65-0.89) for the caregivers and 0.70 (95% CI: 0.477-0.83) for the VHV. Personal business career and education level grade 1-3 are less than 0.05, which showed these factors had a significant relationship with the 44-question Thai-HFHAT score as dependent variable. Conclusions: The 44-question Thai-HFHAT is suitable for the home hazards assessment among the elderly in Thailand. Further studies are needed to investigate changes in the house environment after using the 44-question Thai-HFHAT to determine which changes can reduce the risk of fall.

                Foreign bodies (FB) in the aerodigestive tract are common, especially in children. The type of foreign body in the esophagus can vary and include magnets. A magnet that lodges in the esophagus should be extracted within 24 hours to prevent complications due to associated chemical reactions. In rural areas, there are several limitations to extracting FBs from the esophagus. We report a case of a magnetic FB that lodged in the esophagus of a three-year-old boy. The extraction was successfully done by esophagoscopy with the modification of a hook that was attached to the endoscope. This innovation may help otolaryngologists all over the world, especially in rural areas. In the future, this innovation could be produced on an industrial scale.

                Background: A growing body of research indicates that psychological coercive control poses a threat in academic environments. Little is known, however, about the process, the dynamics, and the phases used to impose silently a variety of non-violent assaults on students and academics. A lack of awareness of coercive intimidation and psychological coercive control obstructs a student’s path to academic achievement, which can have an impact on his or her emotional and mental well-being and diminishes the prosperity of society.   Methods: A methodological selection and review of the scientific literature, theories, and practice on psychological intimidation, coercive control, and systems thinking has been employed in this study. A comprehensive reflective analysis and critical synthesis of the relevant scientific literature were conducted to gain insight into the design of a model of psychological coercive control applicable to educational environments.   Results: This article identifies gaps in research theory and practice and examines critical issues of intimidation and psychological coercive control that is relevant to educational contexts. The article proposes a conceptual model of psychological coercive control as a direction for further research.   Conclusions: Adequate awareness, models, and training programmes in relation to coercive infiltration are missing at higher education institutions. There is an urgent need for a curriculum change that may serve to promote support systems thinking and security awareness in educational environments.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Polygenic variation accounts for a substantial portion of the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but its effect on the rate of fibrillar-tau accumulation as a key driver of dementia symptoms is unclear.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We combined the to-date largest number of genetic risk variants of AD (n = 85 lead single-nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]) from recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to generate a polygenic score (PGS). We assessed longitudinal tau-positron emission tomography (PET), amyloid-PET, and cognition in 231 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Using the PGS, together with global amyloid-PET, we predicted the rate of tau-PET increases in Braak-stage regions-of-interest and cognitive decline. We also assessed PGS-risk enrichment effects on the required sample size in clinical trials targeting tau pathology.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that a higher PGS was associated with higher rates of tau-PET accumulation, in particular at elevated amyloid-PET levels. The tau-PET increases mediated the association between PGS and faster cognitive decline. Risk enrichment through high PGS afforded sample size savings by 34%.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results demonstrate that the PGS predicts faster tau progression and thus cognitive decline, showing utility to enhance statistical power in clinical trials. ANN NEUROL 2023</p>

     alt="Biomarkers of Migraine and Cluster Headache: Differences and Similarities"/>
<p>We aimed to identify interictal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers that differentiate migraine from cluster headache patients, using a machine learning approach, and clinical and multimodal MRI data. The accuracy for classifying headache patients from controls was 80%. The MRI and MRI–clinical combined classifiers distinguishing cluster headache from migraine yielded an accuracy of 78% and 99%. Hypothalamic and periaqueductal gray functional networks were the most important MRI features in classifying headache patients from controls. The thalamic network was the most discriminative MRI feature in classifying migraine from cluster headache.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to identify magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers that differentiate migraine from cluster headache patients and imaging features that are shared.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical, functional, and structural MRI data were obtained from 20 migraineurs, 20 cluster headache patients, and 15 healthy controls. Support vector machine algorithms and a stepwise removal process were used to discriminate headache patients from controls, and subgroups of patients. Regional between-group differences and association between imaging features and patients' clinical characteristics were also investigated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The accuracy for classifying headache patients from controls was 80%. The classification accuracy for discrimination between migraine and controls was 89%, and for cluster headache and controls it was 98%. For distinguishing cluster headache from migraine patients, the MRI classifier yielded an accuracy of 78%, whereas MRI–clinical combined classification model achieved an accuracy of 99%. Bilateral hypothalamic and periaqueductal gray (PAG) functional networks were the most important MRI features in classifying migraine and cluster headache patients from controls. The left thalamic network was the most discriminative MRI feature in classifying migraine from cluster headache patients. Compared to migraine, cluster headache patients showed decreased functional interaction between the left thalamus and cortical areas mediating interoception and sensory integration. The presence of restlessness was the most important clinical feature in discriminating the two groups of patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Functional biomarkers, including the hypothalamic and PAG networks, are shared by migraine and cluster headache patients. The thalamocortical pathway may be the neural substrate that differentiates migraine from cluster headache attacks with their distinct clinical features. ANN NEUROL 2023</p>

However, no prior studies have validated these structural metrics with cholinergic nerve terminal in vivo imaging in Parkinson's disease. Here, we correlate cholinergic basal forebrain morphometry with the topography of vesicular acetylcholine transporter in a large Parkinson's sample.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>[<sup>18</sup>F]-Fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol vesicular acetylcholine transporter positron emission tomography was carried out in 101 non-demented people with Parkinson's (76.24% male, mean age 67.6 ± 7.72 years, disease duration 5.7 ± 4.4 years). Subregional cholinergic basal forebrain volumes were measured using magnetic resonance imaging morphometry. Relationships were assessed via volume-of-interest based correlation analysis.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Subregional volumes of the cholinergic basal forebrain predicted cholinergic nerve terminal loss, with most robust correlations occurring between the posterior cholinergic basal forebrain and temporofrontal, insula, cingulum and hippocampal regions, and with modest correlations in parieto-occipital regions. Hippocampal correlations were not limited to the cholinergic basal forebrain subregion Ch1-2. Correlations were also observed in the striatum, thalamus and brainstem.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Cholinergic basal forebrain morphometry is a robust predictor of regional cerebral vesicular acetylcholine transporter bindings, especially in the anterior brain. The relative lack of correlation between parieto-occipital binding and basal forebrain volumes may reflect the presence of more diffuse synaptopathy in the posterior cortex due to etiologies that extend well beyond the cholinergic system.</p>

                Classically, microglia recognize and internalize amyloid-β (Aβ) via it binding to cell surface receptors. In this issue of Neuron, Hu et al.1 report that microglia “feel” and internalize Aβ plaques using the stiffness-sensing channel Piezo1. This could allow new approaches to treating Alzheimer’s disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Disrupting the ciliary gradient of active Arl3 affects rod photoreceptor nuclear migration</a></h4>

              
                The small GTPase Arl3 is important for the enrichment of lipidated proteins to primary cilia, including the outer segment of photoreceptors. Human mutations in the small GTPase Arl3 cause both autosomal recessive and dominant inherited retinal dystrophies. We discovered that dominant mutations result in increased active G-protein—Arl3-D67V has constitutive activity and Arl3-Y90C is fast cycling—and their expression in mouse rods resulted in a displaced nuclear phenotype due to an aberrant Arl3-GTP gradient. Using multiple strategies, we go on to show that removing or restoring the Arl3-GTP gradient within the cilium is sufficient to rescue the nuclear migration defect. Together, our results reveal that an Arl3 ciliary gradient is involved in proper positioning of photoreceptor nuclei during retinal development.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Single-cell transcriptomic profiling of the zebrafish inner ear reveals molecularly distinct hair cell and supporting cell subtypes</a></h4>

              
                A major cause of human deafness and vestibular dysfunction is permanent loss of the mechanosensory hair cells of the inner ear. In non-mammalian vertebrates such as zebrafish, regeneration of missing hair cells can occur throughout life. While a comparative approach has the potential to reveal the basis of such differential regenerative ability, the degree to which the inner ears of fish and mammals share common hair cells and supporting cell types remains unresolved. Here we perform single-cell RNA sequencing of the zebrafish inner ear at embryonic through adult stages to catalog the diversity of hair cells and non-sensory supporting cells. We identify a putative progenitor population for hair cells and supporting cells, as well as distinct hair and supporting cell types in the maculae versus cristae. The hair cell and supporting cell types differ from those described for the lateral line system, a distributed mechanosensory organ in zebrafish in which most studies of hair cell regeneration have been conducted. In the maculae, we identify two subtypes of hair cells that share gene expression with mammalian striolar or extrastriolar hair cells. In situ hybridization reveals that these hair cell subtypes occupy distinct spatial domains within the three macular organs, the utricle, saccule, and lagena, consistent with the reported distinct electrophysiological properties of hair cells within these domains. These findings suggest that primitive specialization of spatially distinct striolar and extrastriolar hair cells likely arose in the last common ancestor of fish and mammals. The similarities of inner ear cell type composition between fish and mammals validate zebrafish as a relevant model for understanding inner ear-specific hair cell function and regeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Germline/soma distinction in Drosophila embryos requires regulators of zygotic genome activation</a></h4>

              
                In <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> embryos, somatic versus germline identity is the first cell fate decision. Zygotic genome activation (ZGA) orchestrates regionalized gene expression, imparting specific identity on somatic cells. ZGA begins with a minor wave that commences at nuclear cycle (NC)8 under the guidance of chromatin accessibility factors (Zelda, CLAMP, GAF), followed by the major wave during NC14. By contrast, primordial germ cell (PGC) specification requires maternally deposited and posteriorly anchored germline determinants. This is accomplished by a centrosome coordinated release and sequestration of germ plasm during the precocious cellularization of PGCs in NC10. Here, we report a novel requirement for Zelda and CLAMP during the establishment of the germline/soma distinction. When their activity is compromised, PGC determinants are not properly sequestered, and specification is disrupted. Conversely, the spreading of PGC determinants from the posterior pole adversely influences transcription in the neighboring somatic nuclei. These reciprocal aberrations can be correlated with defects in centrosome duplication/separation that are known to induce inappropriate transmission of the germ plasm. Interestingly, consistent with the ability of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling to influence specification of embryonic PGCs, reduction in the transcript levels of a BMP family ligand, <i>decapentaplegic</i> (<i>dpp</i>), is exacerbated at the posterior pole.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Metformin protects trabecular meshwork against oxidative injury via activating integrin/ROCK signals</a></h4>

              
                This study aimed to investigate the protective effect of metformin on trabecular meshwork (TM) and explore its molecular mechanisms in vivo and in vitro. Ocular hypertension (OHT) mouse models were induced with dexamethasone and further treated with metformin to determine the intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering effect. Cultured human TM cells (HTMCs) were pre-stimulated with tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP) to induce oxidative damage and then supplemented with metformin for another 24 hr. The expression of fibrotic markers and integrin/Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) signals, including α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), fibronectin, integrin beta 1, ROCK 1/2, AMP-activated protein kinase, myosin light chain 1, and F-actin were determined by western blotting and immunofluorescence. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) content was analysed using flow cytometry. Transmission electron microscopy was performed to observe microfilaments in HTMCs. It showed that metformin administration reduced the elevated IOP and alleviated the fibrotic activity of aqueous humour outflow in OHT models. Additionally, metformin rearranged the disordered cytoskeleton in the TM both in vivo and in vitro and significantly inhibited ROS production and activated integrin/ROCK signalling induced by tBHP in HTMCs. These results indicated that metformin reduced the elevated IOP in steroid-induced OHT mouse models and exerted its protective effects against oxidative injury by regulating cytoskeleton remodelling through the integrin/ROCK pathway. This study provides new insights into metformin use and preclinical evidence for the potential treatment of primary open-angle glaucoma.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Improved ANAP incorporation and VCF analysis reveals details of P2X7 current facilitation and a limited conformational interplay between ATP binding and the intracellular ballast domain</a></h4>

              
                The large intracellular C-terminus of the pro-inflammatory P2X7 ion channel receptor (P2X7R) is associated with diverse P2X7R-specific functions. Cryo-EM structures of the closed and ATP-bound open full-length P2X7R recently identified a membrane-associated anchoring domain, an open-state stabilizing 'cap' domain, and a globular 'ballast domain' containing GTP/GDP and dinuclear Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites with unknown functions. To investigate protein dynamics during channel activation, we improved incorporation of the environment-sensitive fluorescent unnatural amino acid L-3-(6-acetylnaphthalen-2-ylamino)-2-aminopropanoic acid (ANAP) into <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocyte-expressed P2X7Rs and performed voltage clamp fluorometry (VCF). While we confirmed predicted conformational changes within the extracellular and the transmembrane domains, only three out of 41 mutants containing ANAP in the C-terminal domain resulted in ATP-induced fluorescence changes. We conclude that the ballast domain functions rather independently from the extracellular ATP binding domain and might require activation by additional ligands and/or protein interactions. Novel tools to study these are presented.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mir155 regulates osteogenesis and bone mass phenotype via targeting S1pr1 gene</a></h4>

              
                MicroRNA-155 (miR155) is overexpressed in various inflammatory diseases and cancer, in which bone resorption and osteolysis are frequently observed. However, the role of miR155 on osteogenesis and bone mass phenotype is still unknown. Here, we report a low bone mass phenotype in the long bone of <i>Mir155</i>-Tg mice compared with wild-type mice. In contrast, <i>Mir155</i>-KO mice showed a high bone mass phenotype and protective effect against inflammation-induced bone loss. <i>Mir155</i>-KO mice showed robust bone regeneration in the ectopic and orthotopic model, but <i>Mir155</i>-Tg mice showed compromised bone regeneration compared with the wild-type mice. Similarly, the osteogenic differentiation potential of bone marrow stromal stem cells (BMSCs) from <i>Mir155</i>-KO mice was robust and <i>Mir155</i>-Tg was compromised compared with that of wild-type mice. Moreover, <i>Mir155</i> knockdown in BMSCs from wild-type mice showed higher osteogenic differentiation potential, supporting the results from <i>Mir155</i>-KO mice. TargetScan analysis predicted <i>S1pr1</i> as a target gene of <i>Mir155</i>, which was further confirmed by luciferase assay and <i>Mir155</i> knockdown. <i>S1pr1</i> overexpression in BMSCs robustly promoted osteogenic differentiation without affecting cell viability and proliferation. Furthermore, osteoclastogenic differentiation of <i>Mir155</i>-Tg bone marrow-derived macrophages was inhibited compared with that of wild-type mice. Thus, <i>Mir155</i> showed a catabolic effect on osteogenesis and bone mass phenotype via interaction with the <i>S1pr1</i> gene, suggesting inhibition of <i>Mir155</i> as a potential strategy for bone regeneration and bone defect healing.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dynamic metabolome profiling uncovers potential TOR signaling genes</a></h4>

              
                Although the genetic code of the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> was sequenced 25 years ago, the characterization of the roles of genes within it is far from complete. The lack of a complete mapping of functions to genes hampers systematic understanding of the biology of the cell. The advent of high-throughput metabolomics offers a unique approach to uncovering gene function with an attractive combination of cost, robustness, and breadth of applicability. Here, we used flow-injection time-of-flight mass spectrometry to dynamically profile the metabolome of 164 loss-of-function mutants in TOR and receptor or receptor-like genes under a time course of rapamycin treatment, generating a dataset with &gt;7000 metabolomics measurements. In order to provide a resource to the broader community, those data are made available for browsing through an interactive data visualization app hosted at <a href="https://rapamycin-yeast.ethz.ch">https://rapamycin-yeast.ethz.ch</a>. We demonstrate that dynamic metabolite responses to rapamycin are more informative than steady-state responses when recovering known regulators of TOR signaling, as well as identifying new ones. Deletion of a subset of the novel genes causes phenotypes and proteome responses to rapamycin that further implicate them in TOR signaling. We found that one of these genes, <i>CFF1,</i> was connected to the regulation of pyrimidine biosynthesis through URA10. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the approach for flagging novel potential TOR signaling-related genes and highlight the utility of dynamic perturbations when using functional metabolomics to deliver biological insight.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Behavioral and Neuroanatomical Investigation of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Pathogenesis in Juvenile Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats</a></h4>

              
                Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most prevalent neuropsychiatric disorders of childhood, characterized by locomotor hyperactivity, impaired sustained attention, impulsivity, and distractibility. Recently, the dysfunction of different synaptic circuits in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been shown. Previous studies have attributed the pathophysiological mechanism of ADHD to disturbances in the dopaminergic system. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), which are considered a validated animal model of ADHD, have altered dopaminergic innervation and increased locomotor activity. Here, we performed immunohistochemical tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) staining. The mesocortical dopaminergic system appears to be normal in juvenile SHR, as suggested by (i) no alteration in the area density of TH-immunoreactive (TH-ir) dopaminergic neurons in the VTA, (ii) no alterations in the volume density of TH-ir fibers in layer I of the PrL subregion of mPFC, (iii) no alteration in the percentage of TH-ir dopaminergic fibers in layer I of the PrL subregion of mPFC as revealed by TH and/or DBH immunoreactivity. Furthermore, the SHR showed increased locomotor activity than WKY in the open field test. The demonstration of no alteration in mesocortical dopaminergic neurons and fiber in SHR raises some concern about the position of SHR as an animal model of the inattentive subtype of ADHD. However, these results strengthen this strain as an animal model of hyperactive/impulsive subtype ADHD for future studies that may elucidate the underlying mechanism mediating hyperactivity and test various treatment strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">MNK1 and MNK2 expression in the human dorsal root and trigeminal ganglion</a></h4>

              
                Mitogen activated protein kinase interacting kinases (MNK) 1 and 2 are serine-threonine protein kinases that play an important role in translation of mRNAs through their phosphorylation of the RNA 5 prime-cap binding protein, eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 4E. These kinases are downstream targets for mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs), extracellular activity regulated protein kinase (ERK) and p38. MNKs have been implicated in the sensitization of peripheral nociceptors of the dorsal root and trigeminal ganglion (DRG and TG) using transgenic mouse lines and through the use of specific inhibitors of MNK1 and MNK2. While specific knockout of the Mknk1 gene suggests that it is the key isoform for regulation of nociceptor excitability and nociceptive behaviors in mice, both MKNK1 and MKNK2 genes are expressed in the DRG and TG of mice and humans based on RNA sequencing experiments. Single cell sequencing in mice suggests that Mknk1 and Mknk2 may be expressed in different populations of nociceptors. We sought to characterize mRNA expression in human DRG and TG for both MNK1 and MNK2. Our results show that both genes are expressed by nearly all neurons in both human ganglia with expression in other cell types as well. Our findings provide evidence that MNK1 and MNK2 are expressed by human nociceptors and suggest that efforts to pharmacologically target MNKs for pain would likely be translatable due its conserved expression in both species.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Coordinated electrical and chemical signaling between two neurons orchestrates switching of motor states</a></h4>

              
                To survive in a complex environment, animals must respond to external cues, e.g., to escape threats or to navigate towards favorable locations. Navigating requires transition between motor states, e.g. switching from forward to backward movement. Here, we investigated how two classes of interneurons, RIS and RIM, fine-tune this transition in the nematode C. elegans. By Ca2+ imaging in freely moving animals, we found that RIS gets active slightly before RIM and likely biases decision-making towards a reversal. In animals lacking RIS, we observed lowered Ca2+-levels in RIM prior to a reversal. Combined photo-stimulation and voltage imaging revealed that FLP-11, a neuropeptide released by RIS, has an excitatory effect on RIM, while tyramine, released from RIM, inhibits RIS. Voltage imaging of intrinsic activity provided evidence for tight electrical coupling between RIS and RIM via gap junctions harboring UNC-7 innexins. Asymmetric junctional current flow was observed from RIS to RIM, and vice versa. We propose that the interplay of RIS and RIM is based on concerted electrical and chemical signaling, with a fast junctional current exchange early during the transition from forward to backward movement, followed by chemical signaling, likely during reversal execution.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Structural circuit plasticity by a neurotrophin with a Toll modifies dopamine-dependent behaviour</a></h4>

              
                Toll receptors are expressed in the distinct anatomical brain modules and can regulate structural brain plasticity in adult Drosophila. Structural plasticity in response to neuronal activity and experience could enable adaptation, and its deficit could underlie brain dysfunction and disease. Thus, a key goal is to understand how structural circuit changes modify behaviour. Subjective experience requires dopamine, a neuromodulator that controls arousal, motivation and locomotion, and assigns a value to stimuli. Toll-6 is expressed in dopaminergic neurons (DANs), raising the intriguing possibility that Toll-6 could regulate plasticity in dopaminergic circuits. Drosophila neurotrophin-2 (DNT-2) is the ligand for Toll-6, but it is unknown whether it is required for structural circuit plasticity. Here, we show that structural plasticity depends on the activity-dependent increase and activation of DNT-2, which in turn functions via its Toll-6 and kinase-less Trk-like Kek-6 receptors in DANs, modifying behaviour. DNT-2 expressing neurons are anatomically and functionally connected with DANs, and they modulate each other. Loss of DNT-2 or Toll-6 and kek-6 function caused DAN loss and synapse loss, and alterations in their levels compromised dendritic size and complexity and axonal targeting of analysed single neurons. Neuronal activity-dependent synapse formation required DNT-2, Toll-6 and Kek-6. Furthermore, structural plasticity in an associative, dopaminergic circuit modified dopamine-dependent behaviours, including locomotion and long-term memory. We conclude that an activity-dependent feedback loop involving dopamine and DNT-2 labelled the circuits engaged, and DNT-2 with Toll-6 and Kek-6 induced structural plasticity in this circuit, modifying behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Altered hierarchical auditory predictive processing after lesions to the orbitofrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is classically linked to inhibitory control, emotion regulation and reward processing. Recent perspectives propose that the OFC also generates predictions about perceptual events, actions, and their outcomes. We tested the causal involvement of the OFC in detecting violations of prediction at two levels of abstraction (i.e., hierarchical predictive processing) by studying the event-related potentials (ERPs) of patients with focal OFC lesions (n = 12) and healthy controls (n = 14) while they detected deviant sequences of tones in a Local-Global paradigm. The structural regularities of the tones were controlled at two hierarchical levels by rules defined at a local (i.e., between tones within sequences) and at a global (i.e., between sequences) level. In OFC patients, ERPs elicited by standard tones were unaffected at both local and global levels compared to controls. However, patients showed an attenuated mismatch negativity (MMN) to local prediction violation, as well as a diminished and delayed MMN/P3a complex to the combined local and global level prediction violation. Importantly, the subsequent P3b component to conditions involving violations of prediction at the level of global rules was preserved in the OFC group. The altered magnitudes and time courses of MMN/P3a responses after lesions to the OFC indicate fundamental impairments in detecting violation of auditory regularity at two hierarchical levels of stimuli abstraction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct hypothalamus-habenula circuits govern risk preference</a></h4>

              
                Appropriate evaluation of risk is essential for survival in complex, uncertain environments. Confronted with choosing between a certain (safe) and an uncertain (risky) option, animals of various species show strong preferential traits which are stable across extended periods of time1-8. How such risk preference is encoded in the neural circuitry of the brain remains poorly understood. A candidate brain region is the lateral habenula (LHb), which has been shown to be prominently involved in various value-guided behaviors9-12. Here, using a balanced two-alternative choice task involving risk of loss, we find that neuronal activity in the LHb prior to action selection reflects risk preference and is governed by distinct inputs from hypothalamic subregions. Specifically, by employing multi-fiber photometry and targeted optogenetic perturbations, we identified glutamatergic LHb projections from both lateral and medial hypothalamus (LH/MH) that provide functionally distinct synaptic inputs to the LHb before action selection. Microendoscopic two-photon calcium imaging revealed risk-preference-selective LHb neurons that decreased their selectivity upon chemogenetic silencing of MH but not LH inputs. Finally, optogenetic stimulation of MH->LHb axons evoked both excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic responses in LHb neurons (indicative of glutamate/GABA co-release for fine-tuned gain control13), whereas LH->LHb projections were purely excitatory. Our results thus reveal functionally distinct hypothalamus-habenula circuits that govern risk preference in situations of economic decision-making.

                Background: Covert visuo-spatial attention is marked by the anticipatory lateralization of neuronal alpha activity in the posterior parietal cortex. Previous applications of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) at the alpha frequency, however, were inconclusive regarding the causal contribution of oscillatory activity during visuo-spatial attention. Objective: Attentional shifts of behavior and electroencephalography (EEG) after-effects were assessed in a cued visuo-spatial attention paradigm. We hypothesized that parietal alpha-tACS facilitates attention in the ipsilateral visual hemifield. Furthermore, we assumed that modulations of behavior and neurophysiology are related to individual electric field simulations. Methods: We applied personalized tACS at alpha and gamma frequencies to elucidate the role of oscillatory neuronal activity for visuo-spatial attention. Personalized tACS montages were algorithmically optimized to target individual left and right parietal regions that were defined by an EEG localizer. Results: Behavioral performance in the left hemifield was specifically increased by alpha-tACS compared to gamma-tACS targeting the left parietal cortex. This hemisphere-specific effect was observed despite the symmetry of simulated electric fields. In addition, visual event-related potential (ERP) amplitudes showed a reduced lateralization over posterior sites induced by left alpha-tACS. Neuronal sources of this effect were localized in the left premotor cortex. Interestingly, accuracy modulations induced by left parietal alpha-tACS were directly related to electric field magnitudes in the left premotor cortex. Conclusion: Overall, results corroborate the notion that alpha lateralization plays a causal role in covert visuo-spatial attention and indicate an increased susceptibility of parietal and premotor brain regions of the left dorsal attention network to subtle tACS-neuromodulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Manipulating mitochondrial dynamics in the NTS prevents diet-induced deficits in brown fat morphology and activity</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a potent thermogenic organ, activated by the central nervous system (CNS) through direct noradrenergic sympathetic innervation. Dysregulation of signalling modules in selective CNS areas such as the nucleus of tractus solitarius (NTS) are linked with altered BAT activity, obesity and diabetes. High-fat diet (HFD)-feeding increases mitochondrial fragmentation in the NTS triggering insulin resistance, hyperphagia and weight gain. Here we sought to determine whether changes in mitochondrial dynamics in the NTS can affect BAT activity. Methods: Eight-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats received DVC stereotactic surgery to facilitate brain infusion for local administration of viruses that express mutated Drp1 genes. PET/CT scans were used to measure BAT glucose uptake using. Biochemical assays and immunohistochemistry determined altered levels of key signalling molecules and neural innervation of BAT. Results: We show that short-term HFD-feeding decreases the ability of BAT to uptake glucose and decreases catecholaminergic innervation of BAT, observed by altered intensities and pools of Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) labelling. HFD also increased the infiltration of enlarged white fat droplets in the BAT. We demonstrate that inhibiting mitochondrial fragmentation in NTS-astrocytes of HFD-fed rats can prevent the effects on BAT morphology and neural innervation, and increase BAT glucose uptake while lowering blood glucose and insulin levels. In regular chow-fed rats, increasing mitochondrial fragmentation in the NTS-astrocytes reduces BAT glucose uptake, TH and {beta}3-adrenergic receptor levels. Conclusions: Our data suggest that targeting mitochondrial dynamics in the NTS-astrocytes could be a beneficial strategy to increase energy expenditure and protect from developing obesity and diabetes.

                Rhythmic flicker stimulation has gained interest as a treatment for neurodegenerative diseases and a method for frequency tagging neural activity in human EEG/MEG recordings. Yet, little is known about the way in which flicker-induced synchronization propagates across cortical levels and impacts different cell types. Here, we used Neuropixels to simultaneously record from LGN, V1, and CA1 while presenting visual flicker stimuli at different frequencies. LGN neurons showed strong phase locking up to 40Hz, whereas phase locking was substantially weaker in V1 units and absent in CA1 units. Laminar analyses revealed an attenuation of phase locking at 40Hz for each processing stage, with substantially weaker phase locking in the superficial layers of V1. Gamma-rhythmic flicker predominantly entrained fast-spiking interneurons. Optotagging experiments showed that these neurons correspond to either PV+ or narrow-waveform Sst+ neurons. A computational model could explain the observed differences in phase locking based on the neurons' capacitative low-pass filtering properties. In summary, the propagation of synchronized activity and its effect on distinct cell types strongly depend on its frequency.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Deep brain stimulation and dopamine medication enhance free choice preference in Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Human decisions are frequently explained as the balancing of potential rewards and punishments, such as food, money, or lost time. However, rational models of decision making based on this idea often fail to accurately predict human behavior. Humans and other animals appear to base decisions on value estimation that is often not clearly linked to extrinsic outcomes. For example, humans prefer to choose, even when doing so has no clear impact on impending rewards or punishments. Thus, choice opportunities may be intrinsically rewarding. There is limited evidence about the mechanisms underlying intrinsic rewards, and it is unclear how deficits in motivation for intrinsic rewards manifest themselves following impairment of brain networks involved in reward processing such as the dopaminergic and cortico-basal ganglia systems. Here we seek to understand how extrinsic and intrinsic rewards act together to guide decisions. We designed a decision-making task that separates the intrinsic value of free choice from the value of extrinsic rewards received for correct performance. We investigated the neural mechanisms underlying choice preference by asking Parkinson's disease patients to perform the task ON and OFF treatment. We tested two groups of patients to explore the effects of dopamine medication and potential modulation of wider cortical areas by deep brain stimulation. One group was treated with acute dopamine replacement therapy, and another group was treated with subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation. On average, patients ON dopaminergic treatment preferred to choose even when they risked losing extrinsic rewards (z=3.736, P=0.004). However, we found a significant interaction with the level of chronic levodopa therapy (z=2.643, P=0.008); patients with low doses of levodopa treatment in their daily lives did not prefer to choose (z=0.901, P=0.60), nor was this indifference modulated by acute levodopa administration (z=0.227, P=0.996). Deep brain stimulation patients were similarly indifferent to choice opportunities when OFF stimulation (z=-0.95, P=0.339). Like patients with low chronic levodopa treatment in the first group, all deep brain stimulation patients received low-dosage chronic levodopa treatment, which is one of the principal effects of this surgical intervention. Interestingly, in deep brain stimulation patients, choice preference could be re-established by subthalamic nucleus stimulation (z=3.07, P=0.011). This was associated with increased structural connectivity between subthalamic nucleus stimulation sites and the medial frontal cortex (including Brodmann areas 8, 9, and 32; P<0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons). In contrast to healthy humans who typically prefer choice, patients with the most severe dopamine depletion (advanced disease together with low chronic dopamine replacement therapy) did not prefer to choose. Our results suggests that higher levels of chronic dopamine medication or deep brain stimulation can increase motivation to seek choice opportunities. This is likely due to different mechanisms, with dopamine medication affecting sensitivity to all rewards and deep brain stimulation affecting impulsivity. These results advance our understanding of intrinsic reward and its interplay with general motivational processes associated with behavioral impairments observed in Parkinson's disease and other neuropsychiatric disorders involving the dopaminergic system.

                Multiple Sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease in which disability results from the disruption of myelin and axons. During the initial stages of the disease, injured myelin is replaced by mature myelinating oligodendrocytes that differentiate from oligodendrocyte precursor cells. However, myelin repair fails in secondary and chronic progressive stages of the disease and with aging, as the environment becomes progressively more hostile. This may be attributable to inhibitory molecules in the multiple sclerosis environment including activation of the p38MAPK family of kinases. We explored oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation and myelin repair using animals with conditional ablation of p38MAPKg from oligodendrocyte precursors. We found that p38{gamma}MAPK ablation accelerated oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation and myelination. This resulted in an increase in both the total number of oligodendrocytes and the migration of progenitors ex vivo and faster remyelination in the cuprizone model of demyelination/remyelination. Consistent with its role as an inhibitor of myelination, p38{gamma}MAPK was significantly downregulated as oligodendrocyte precursor cells matured into oligodendrocytes. Notably, p38{gamma}MAPK was enriched in samples of leukocortical multiple sclerosis lesions from patients, which represent areas of failed remyelination. Our data suggest that p38{gamma} could be targeted to improve myelin repair in multiple sclerosis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Establishing a causal role for left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex in value-directed memory encoding with high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation</a></h4>

              
                One critical approach for promoting the efficiency of memory is to adopt selective encoding strategies to prioritize more valuable information. Past neuroimaging studies have shown that value-directed modulation of verbal memory depends heavily on engagement of left-lateralized semantic processing regions, particularly in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC). In the present study, we used high-definition direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) to seek evidence for a causal role of left VLPFC in supporting the memory advantage for high-value items. Three groups of healthy young adult participants were presented with lists of words to remember, with each word accompanied by an arbitrarily assigned point value. During the first session, all participants received sham stimulation as they encoded five lists of 30 words each. Two of these lists were immediately tested with free recall, with feedback given to allow participants to develop metacognitive insight and strategies to maximize their point total. The second session had the exact same structure as the first, but the groups differed in whether they received continued sham stimulation (N=22) or anodal stimulation of the left VLPFC (N=21) or right VLPFC (N=20). Those lists not tested with immediate recall were tested with recognition judgments after a one-day delay. Since no brain stimulation was applied during this Day 2 test, any performance differences can be attributed to the effects of stimulation on Day 1 encoding processes. Anodal stimulation of left VLPFC significantly boosted participants' memory encoding selectivity. In comparison, no such effect was seen in participants who received right VLPFC or sham stimulation. Estimates of recollection- and familiarity-based responding revealed that left VLPFC stimulation specifically amplified the effects of item value on recollection. These results demonstrate a causal role for left VLPFC in the implementation of selective value-directed encoding strategies, putatively by boosting deep semantic processing of high-value words. Our findings also provide further evidence on the hemispheric lateralization of value-directed verbal memory encoding.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Aging Decreases the Precision of Visual Working Memory</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: Working memory (WM) is a cognitive ability that enables us to hold information temporarily. As age increases during life, cognitive abilities such as WM performance decrease. Errors in WM tasks arise from different sources, such as decreasing precision and random response. In the current study, we investigated the effect of age on WM and elucidated sources of errors. Method: A total of 102 healthy individuals aged 18 to 71, participated in the study. A face-based visual WM task was designed and performed. Responses were collected using a graded scale in a delayed match-to-sample reproduction task. Results: The error of participants increased significantly as they aged. According to our analysis of the source of error, the standard deviation of error distribution increased considerably with age. However, there was no significant change in uniform probability with age. These observations were similar between male and female participants. Conclusion: We found that WM performance declines through the lifespan. Investigating the sources of error, we found that the precision of WM decreased with age. This decline was monotonous without any particular age at which a significant drop-off occurred. The results also indicated that the probability of guessing the response as a measure of random response is not affected by age.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Paternal morphine exposure enhances morphine self-administration and induces region-specific neural adaptations in reward-related brain regions of male offspring</a></h4>

              
                Background: A growing body of preclinical studies report that preconceptional experiences can have a profound and long-lasting impact on adult offspring behavior and physiology. However, less is known about paternal drug exposure and its effects on reward sensitivity in the next generation. Methods: Adult male rats self-administered morphine for 65 days; controls received saline. Sires were bred to drug-naive dams to produce first-generation (F1) offspring. Morphine, cocaine, and nicotine self-administration were measured in adult F1 progeny. Molecular correlates of addiction-like behaviors were measured in reward-related brain regions of drug naive F1 offspring. Results: Male, but not female offspring produced by morphine-exposed sires exhibited dose-dependent increased morphine self-administration and increased motivation to earn morphine infusions under a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement. This phenotype was drug-specific as self-administration of cocaine, nicotine, and sucrose were not altered by paternal morphine history. The male offspring of morphine-exposed sires also had increased expression of mu-opioid receptors in the ventral tegmental area but not in the nucleus accumbens. Conclusions: Paternal morphine exposure increased morphine addiction-like behavioral vulnerability in male but not female progeny. This phenotype is likely driven by long-lasting neural adaptations within the reward neural brain pathways.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modelling the stable subspace of distributed brain responses in stimulus processing</a></h4>

              
                Each brain response to a stimulus is, to a large extent, unique. However this variability, our perceptual experience feels stable. Standard decoding models, which utilise information across several areas to tap into stimuli distributed representations and processing, are fundamentally based on averages and, therefore, can focus precisely on the features that are most stable across stimulus presentations. But what are these stable features that may sustain stable perception across experiences is still poorly understood. This question is indeed difficult to address in the absence of a generative model of the signal. Here, I introduce genephys, a generative model of brain responses to stimulation that, when confronted with a decoding algorithm, can reproduce the structured patterns of decoding accuracy observed in real data. Using this approach, I characterise how these patterns can be brought about by the different aspects of the signal, which in turn may translate into distinct putative neural mechanisms. In particular, the model shows that the features in the data that support successful decoding -and, therefore, likely reflect stable mechanisms of stimulus representation- lie in a high-dimensional, multi-frequency space of phase resets and frequency entrainments, combined with an additive non-oscillatory response. At the individual trial level, still, responses are found to be highly variable, which can be due to various factors including phase noise and probabilistic activations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adolescent stress impairs postpartum social behavior via anterior insula-prelimbic pathway</a></h4>

              
                Adolescent stress can be a risk factor for abnormal social behavior in the postpartum period, which critically affects the safety of mothers and children. Nonetheless, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Using a newly established mouse model with optogenetics and in vivo calcium imaging, we found that adolescent psychosocial stress, combined with pregnancy and delivery, caused hypofunction of the glutamatergic pathway from the anterior insula to prelimbic cortex (AI-PrL pathway), which altered PrL neuronal activity, and in turn led to abnormal social behavior. Specifically, the AI-PrL pathway played a crucial role during recognizing the novelty of other mice by modulating ''stable neurons'' in PrL, which were constantly activated or inhibited by novel mice. We also observed that glucocorticoid receptor signaling in the AI-PrL pathway had a causal role in stress-induced postpartum changes. Our findings provide novel and functional insights into a cortico-cortical pathway underlying adolescent stress-induced postpartum social behavioral deficits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Representational geometry explains puzzling error distributions in behavioral tasks</a></h4>

              
                Measuring and interpreting errors in behavioral tasks is critical for understanding cognition. Conventional wisdom assumes that encoding/decoding errors for continuous variables in behavioral tasks should naturally have Gaussian distributions, so that deviations from normality in the empirical data indicate the presence of more complex sources of noise. This line of reasoning has been central for prior research on working memory. Here we re-assess this assumption, and find that even in ideal observer models with Gaussian encoding noise, the error distribution is generally non-Gaussian, contrary to the commonly held belief. Critically, we find that the shape of the error distribution is determined by the geometrical structure of the encoding manifold via a simple rule. In the case of a high-dimensional geometry, the error distributions naturally exhibit flat tails. Using this novel insight, we apply our theory to visual short-term memory tasks, and find that it can account for a large array of experimental data with only two free parameters. Our results call attention to the geometry of the representation as a critically important, yet underappreciated factor in determining the character of errors in human behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tool-sensed object information effectively supports vision for multisensory grasping</a></h4>

              
                Tools enable humans to extend their sensing abilities beyond the natural limits of their hands, allowing them to sense objects as if they were using their hands directly. The similarities between tool-mediated and hand-based sensing entail the existence of comparable processes for integrating tool- and hand-sensed information with vision, raising the intriguing question of whether tools can support vision in bimanual object manipulations. Here we investigated this question by measuring participants' performance while reaching for and grasping objects either held with a tool or with their hand. We found that tool-mediated sensing effectively supports vision in multisensory grasping. Even more intriguingly, tool-mediated sensing resembled hand-based sensing. In addition, by manipulating the object features (availability of position and size versus position only), we found that both tool- and hand-mediated action performance was not hindered by the absence of size information. Thus, integrating the tool-sensed position of the object with its vision is sufficient to promote a multisensory advantage in grasping. In sum, our findings indicate that multisensory integration mechanisms significantly improve grasping actions, fine-tuning contralateral hand movements even when object information is only indirectly sensed through the hand operating a tool.

                To produce goal-directed eye movements known as saccades, we must channel sensory input from our environment through a process known as sensorimotor transformation. The behavioral output of this phenomenon (an accurate eye movement) is straightforward, but the coordinated activity of neurons underlying it is not well understood. We searched for a neural correlate of sensorimotor transformation in the activity patterns of simultaneously recorded neurons in the superior colliculus (SC) of rhesus monkeys performing a standard delayed saccade task. Neurons in its intermediate layers produce a burst of spikes both following the appearance of a visual (sensory) stimulus and preceding an eye movement command, but many also exhibit a sustained activity level during the intervening time ("delay period"). Each session's population activity was summarized in a low-dimensional framework and assessed on a scale of visual- to motor-like throughout the delay period using a novel measure we call the Visuomotor Proximity Index (VMPI). On average, population activity slowly evolved from a more visual- to a more motor-like pattern throughout the delay period, but microsaccade perturbations transiently deviated it to a visual-like pattern. A correlation was also found between the VMPI and single trial saccadic reaction time, even hundreds of milliseconds before the cue to initiate a movement. Therefore, we conclude that SC population activity contains a neural signature of the sensorimotor transformation process, systematically drifting toward a motor-like representation and intermittently reverting to a visual-like representation following a microsaccade.

	<p>(1) Background: Although cognitive impairments in coma survivors are common, methods of measuring long-term cognitive outcomes in this population are inconsistent, precluding the development of a strong evidence-base to support clinical decision making. In this literature review, we identify and characterize the measures used to track cognitive recovery in coma survivors to data. (2) Methods: We extracted the instrument used for cognitive assessment, the cognitive domains assessed, methods administration and scoring, and timing of assessment from 134 of 996 screened records. (3) Results: A total of 133 unique cognitive tests and cognitive testing batteries were identified, with 97 cognitive instruments used in less than three articles. The instruments assessed 20 different cognitive domains, with 73 articles also using tests that assess general &amp;amp;ldquo;cognitive ability&amp;amp;rdquo;. Cognitive instruments ranged from subjective assessments to comprehensive cognitive batteries. There were inconsistent points of reference for the timing of assessment across studies, with few studies repeating assessments at more than one time point, and arbitrary time intervals between tests. (4) Conclusions: Overall, this review illustrates the enormous disparity between studies that track cognitive outcome in coma survivors, and the need for a systematic, patient-accessible method of assessing cognitive functioning in future studies with this population.</p>

	<p>Patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) have an elevated risk of suicidality. The same has been found for people within the penitentiary system, suggesting a cumulative effect for offender patients suffering from SSD. While there appear to be overlapping characteristics, there is little research on factors distinguishing between offenders and non-offenders with SSD regarding suicidality. Our study therefore aimed at evaluating distinguishing such factors through the application of supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms on a dataset of 232 offenders and 167 non-offender patients with SSD and history of suicidality. With an AUC of 0.81, Na&amp;amp;iuml;ve Bayes outperformed all other ML algorithms. The following factors emerged as most powerful in their interplay in distinguishing between offender and non-offender patients with a history of suicidality: Prior outpatient psychiatric treatment, regular intake of antipsychotic medication, global cognitive deficit, a prescription of antidepressants during the referenced hospitalisation and higher levels of anxiety and a lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation measured by an adapted positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS). Interestingly, neither aggression nor overall psychopathology emerged as distinguishers between the two groups. The present findings contribute to a better understanding of suicidality in offender and non-offender patients with SSD and their differing characteristics.</p>

	<p>Background: ACDF has become one of the established procedures for the surgical treatment of symptomatic cervical spondylosis, showing excellent clinical results and effective improvements in neural functions and neck pain relief. The main purpose of ACDF is neural decompression, and it is considered by some authors as an indirect result of the intervertebral distraction and cage insertion and the consequent restoration of the disc space and foramen height. Methods: Radiological data from 28 patients who underwent single-level ACDF were retrospectively collected and evaluated. For neural foramen evaluation, antero-posterior (A-P) and cranio-caudal (C-C) diameters were manually calculated; for intervertebral disc height the anterior, centrum and posterior measurement were calculated. All measurements were performed at surgical and adjacent (above and below) segments. NRS, NDI and also the mJOA and Nurick scale were collected for clinical examination and complete evaluation of patients&amp;amp;rsquo; postoperative outcome. Results: The intervertebral disc height in all its measurements, in addition to the height (C-C diameter) of the foramen (both right and left) increase at the surgical segment when comparing pre and postop results (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, and p = 0.033 and p = 0.001). NRS and NDI radiculopathy scores showed improved results from pre- to post-op evaluation (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and a negative statistical correlation with the improved disc height at the surgical level. Conclusions: The restoration of posterior disc height through cage insertion appears to be effective in increasing foraminal height in patients with symptomatic preoperative cervical foraminal stenosis.</p>

	<p>Gestures and speech, as linked communicative expressions, form an integrated system. Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have suggested that neural networks for gesture and spoken word production share similar brain regions consisting of fronto-temporo-parietal brain regions. However, information flow within the neural network may dynamically change during the planning of two communicative expressions and also differ between them. To investigate dynamic information flow in the neural network during the planning of gesture and spoken word generation in this study, participants were presented with spatial images and were required to plan the generation of gestures or spoken words to represent the same spatial situations. The evoked potentials in response to spatial images were recorded to analyze the effective connectivity within the neural network. An independent component analysis of the evoked potentials indicated 12 clusters of independent components, the dipoles of which were located in the bilateral fronto-temporo-parietal brain regions and on the medial wall of the frontal and parietal lobes. Comparison of effective connectivity indicated that information flow from the right middle cingulate gyrus (MCG) to the left supplementary motor area (SMA) and from the left SMA to the left precentral area increased during gesture planning compared with that of word planning. Furthermore, information flow from the right MCG to the left superior frontal gyrus also increased during gesture planning compared with that of word planning. These results suggest that information flow to the brain regions for hand praxis is more strongly activated during gesture planning than during word planning.</p>

	<p>Eating disorders (EDs) are psychiatric disorders with a neurobiological basis. ED-specific neuropsychological and brain characteristics have been identified, but often in individuals in the acute phase or recovered from EDs, precluding an understanding of whether they are correlates and scars of EDs vs. predisposing factors. Although familial high-risk (FHR) studies are available across other disorders, this study design has not been used in EDs. We carried out the first FMH study in EDs, investigating healthy offspring of women with EDs and controls. We preliminarily aimed to investigate ED-related neurocognitive and brain markers that could point to predisposing factors for ED. Sixteen girls at FHR for EDs and twenty control girls (age range: 8&amp;amp;ndash;15), completed neuropsychological tests assessing executive functions. Girls also underwent a resting-state fMRI scan to quantify functional connectivity (FC) within resting-state networks. Girls at FHR for EDs performed worse on a cognitive flexibility task compared with controls (F = 5.53, p = 0.02). Moreover, they showed different FC compared with controls in several resting-state networks (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05 FDR-corrected). Differences identified in cognitive flexibility and in FC are in line with those identified in individuals with EDs, strongly pointing to a role as potential endophenotypes of EDs.</p>

	<p>We would like to congratulate Sachdeva and colleagues for establishing an informative review regarding the effects of music/sound exposure on blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier permeability and meningeal lymphatic/glymphatic clearance, and would appreciate the opportunity to make a comment. The review by Sachdeva and colleagues documents the beneficial effects of sound interventions on blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier permeability and the activity of the meningeal lymphatic/glymphatic system. The authors further note that sound interventions may have the potential to reduce the accumulation of amyloid-&amp;amp;beta; within the brain in Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease through improved meningeal lymphatic/glymphatic clearance. The authors also nicely discuss evidence that music influences sleep quality, which may facilitate glymphatic solute clearance as a result of an increase in the interstitial space, which results in reduced resistance to fluid transport. We fully agree with this notion, since we recently hypothesized that immersive sound therapy may be an innovative approach to reduce the individual risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, by inducing EEG slow-wave delta oscillations (which characterize deep sleep), thereby promoting glymphatic clearance.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Right atrial organized thrombus three years after tricuspid annuloplasty [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Occurrence of right atrial masses, especially in patients with history of cardiac surgery, is rare. Differential diagnosis between malignant and non-malignant aetiologies might be cumbersome, and surgery is often required to prevent complications or disease evolution. Case: We report the case of a 16-year-old girl from a rural area of Sudan, who underwent surgery for a modified De Vega’s tricuspid annuloplasty, and mitral and aortic valve replacement with mechanical prostheses. The patient was on regular follow-up but demonstrated a poor compliance to anticoagulation therapy with a time in therapeutic range between 52% and 20%. She remained asymptomatic, but a right atrial mass was diagnosed by transthoracic echocardiography during a follow-up visit 41 months after the first operation. Surgical removal of the mass revealed an organized thrombus arising from the point where the Prolene stitches for the tricuspid annuloplasty were previously passed. The patient recovered from surgery, was discharged home on post-operative day 10 and the first follow-up visit at 30 days after discharge confirmed a good clinical status and a normal transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Conclusions: This case report describes the diagnostic and therapeutic work-out of a thrombus formation on the suture lines of a tricuspid annuloplasty. Moreover, it highlights the importance of a strict and long follow-up after valvular surgery and of the adherence to anticoagulation therapy, especially for patients living in rural areas of developing countries.

                Background: Sepsis is a life-threatening disease, and animal models of sepsis are minimal. This study aims to find the optimal dose to make a sepsis mouse model by examining the presence of target organ damage. Methods: This study used 30 mice divided into four groups. The control group injected 0.5 cc NaCl 0.9% intraperitoneally (i.p.). Group A was injected with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) 0.25 mg/kg B.W. i.p. given on the first and second day, group B was injected with LPS 0.3 mg/kg B.W. i.p. given on the first and second days, and group C was injected by LPS 0.3 mg/kg B.W. single dose i.p. Each group was terminated on the third, fourth, and fifth days. Results: NF-κB, C-reactive protein (CRP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), NF-κB examinations, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in all treatment groups increased when compared with the control. The highest degree of histopathological features of the kidneys and liver and the results of immunohistochemistry examinations on the liver and kidneys were shown in group C. Conclusions: Inflammatory markers (CRP, TNF-α, NF-κB, and expression of NF-κB in liver and kidneys) and characteristics of organ damage (ALT, liver, and kidneys histopathology scores) increase on day 3. The highest increase was in the group administered with LPS 0.3 mg/kg B.W. single dose.

                This dataset presents data collected to assess teaching and learning of quantum physics at the University of Rwanda - College of Education (UR-CE), Rwanda. Data were collected between August and November 2019 as the baseline, and between January and April 2022 under a quasi-experimental design. Three sets of data were collected. The first set was about students' performance and conceptual understanding collected before and after teaching intervention (lecture method or multimedia-aided approach) using mainly Quantum Physics Conceptual Survey (QPCS). The second set documented classroom practices during teaching and learning using the Classroom Observation Protocol for Undergraduate STEM (COPUS). The last set is comprised of the data related to lecturers' and students' perceptions before teaching and learning quantum physics and students' attitudes after learning Quantum physics. The Quantum Physics Attitude Test (QPAT) was mainly used to collect these data. The dataset is important to education stakeholders because university managers can visualize the status of teaching and learning outcomes, lecturers can reflect on the study, and researchers can use the data to analyze various independent variables.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The patent landscape in the field of stem cell therapy: closing the gap between research and clinic [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Stem cell technology is a powerful tool ready to respond to the needs of modern medicine that is experiencing rapid technological development. Given its potential in therapeutic applications, intellectual property rights (IPR) as a protection resource of knowledge are a relevant topic. Patent eligibility of stem cells has been controversial as restrictions to access the fundamental technologies open a gap between research and clinic. Therefore, we depicted the current patent landscape in the field to discuss if this approach moves forward in closing this breach by examining patent activity over the last decade from a transdisciplinary perspective. Stem cell therapeutic applications is an area of continuous growth where patent filing through the PCT is the preferred strategy. Patenting activity is concentrated in the USA, European Union, and Australia; this accumulation in a few key players leads to governance, regulation, and inequality concerns. To boost wealthiness and welfare in society - stem cell therapies' ultimate goal - while at post-pandemic recovery, critical elements in the field of IPR rise to overcome current limitations: to promote bridge builders able to connect the research and business worlds, regulatory updates, novel financing models, new vehicles (startups, spinouts, and spin-offs), and alternative figures of intellectual property.

                Background: Increasing dietary supplement (DS) consumption was observed during the COVID-19 pandemic, including during the post-Delta wave period. This study aimed to measure the practice of DS consumption and respondents’ knowledge of DS. Methods: An internet-based survey was distributed from October-December 2021 and obtained 541 valid and completed responses. Descriptive analysis was performed to present the practice of DS consumption, including frequency, duration, aim, preferable dosage form etc. Level of knowledge on DS principles, side effects and regulation were also measured. Inferential analyses were conducted to determine the predictors of the respondents’ DS practice and level of knowledge. Results: Data from 541 valid responses showed that 77.63% of respondents consumed DS in the last 3 months, with only 59.52% reporting also consuming DS before the COVID-19 pandemic. One half of the respondents had good knowledge about DS; however, some knowledge regarding side effects and possible drug-supplement interaction needed improvement. Their DS consumption practice was affected by their economic status and history of contracting COVID-19. Nevertheless, the level of knowledge was not affected by the sociodemographic factors and DS supplement experience. Conclusions: Taken together, the practice of self-consumption of DS in Indonesia is increasing; hence, knowledge of DS is necessary to avoid detrimental effects that might occur in the future. Increasing access to information on better labelling and educating consumers about DS are important actions to consider.

At a time when effective tools for monitoring malaria control and eradication efforts are crucial, the increasing availability of molecular data motivates their application to epidemiology. The multiplicity of infection (MOI), defined as the number of genetically distinct parasite strains co-infecting a host, is one key epidemiological parameter for evaluating malaria interventions. Estimating MOI remains a challenge for high-transmission settings where individuals typically carry multiple co-occurring infections. Several quantitative approaches have been developed to estimate MOI, including two cost-effective ones relying on molecular data: i) THE REAL McCOIL method is based on putatively neutral single nucleotide polymorphism loci, and ii) the <i>var</i>coding method is a fingerprinting approach that relies on the diversity and limited repertoire overlap of the <i>var</i> multigene family encoding the major <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> blood-stage antigen PfEMP1 and is therefore under selection. In this study, we assess the robustness of the MOI estimates generated with these two approaches by simulating <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum</i> malaria dynamics under three transmission conditions using an extension of a previously developed stochastic agent-based model. We demonstrate that these approaches are complementary and best considered across distinct transmission intensities. While <i>var</i>coding can underestimate MOI, it allows robust estimation, especially under high-transmission where repertoire overlap is extremely limited from frequency-dependent selection. In contrast, THE REAL McCOIL often considerably overestimates MOI, but still provides reasonable estimates for low- and moderate-transmission. Regardless of transmission intensity, results for THE REAL McCOIL indicate that an inaccurate tail at high MOI values is generated, and that at high transmission, an apparently reasonable estimated MOI distribution can arise from some degree of compensation between overestimation and underestimation. As many countries pursue malaria elimination targets, defining the most suitable approach to estimate MOI based on sample size and local transmission intensity is highly recommended for monitoring the impact of intervention programs.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Efficient computation of adjoint sensitivities at steady-state in ODE models of biochemical reaction networks</a></h4>

Dynamical models in the form of systems of ordinary differential equations have become a standard tool in systems biology. Many parameters of such models are usually unknown and have to be inferred from experimental data. Gradient-based optimization has proven to be effective for parameter estimation. However, computing gradients becomes increasingly costly for larger models, which are required for capturing the complex interactions of multiple biochemical pathways. Adjoint sensitivity analysis has been pivotal for working with such large models, but methods tailored for steady-state data are currently not available. We propose a new adjoint method for computing gradients, which is applicable if the experimental data include steady-state measurements. The method is based on a reformulation of the backward integration problem to a system of linear algebraic equations. The evaluation of the proposed method using real-world problems shows a speedup of total simulation time by a factor of up to 4.4. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve a substantial improvement in computation time, in particular for large-scale models, where computational efficiency is critical.

Background <p>Infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) typically results from transmission of a small and genetically uniform viral population. Following transmission, the virus population becomes more diverse because of recombination and acquired mutations through genetic drift and selection. Viral intrahost genetic diversity remains a major obstacle to the cure the HIV; however, the association between intrahost diversity and disease progression markers has not been investigated in large and diverse cohorts for which the majority of the genome has been deep-sequenced. Viral load (VL) is a key progression marker and understanding of its relationship to viral intrahost genetic diversity could help design future strategies for HIV monitoring and treatment.</p> Methods <p>We analysed deep-sequenced viral genomes from 2,650 treatment-naive HIV-infected persons to measure the intrahost genetic diversity of 2,447 genomic codon positions as calculated by Shannon entropy. We tested for associations between VL and amino acid (AA) entropy accounting for sex, age, race, duration of infection, and HIV population structure.</p> Results <p>We confirmed that the intrahost genetic diversity is highest in the <i>env</i> gene. Furthermore, we showed that mean Shannon entropy is significantly associated with VL, especially in infections of >24 months duration. We identified 16 significant associations between VL (p-value<2.0x10<sup>-5</sup>) and Shannon entropy at AA positions which in our association analysis explained 13% of the variance in VL. Finally, equivalent analysis based on variation in HIV consensus sequences explained only 2% of VL variance.</p> Conclusions <p>Our results elucidate that viral intrahost genetic diversity is associated with VL and could be used as a better disease progression marker than HIV consensus sequence variants, especially in infections of longer duration. We emphasize that viral intrahost diversity should be considered when studying viral genomes and infection outcomes.</p> Trial registration <p>Samples included in this study were derived from participants who consented in the clinical trial, START (NCT00867048) (23), run by the International Network for Strategic Initiatives in Global HIV Trials (INSIGHT).

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Dynamic interactions between the subregions of the hippocampus are required for the encoding and consolidation of memory. While the interplay and contributions of the CA1 and CA3 regions are well understood, we continue to learn more about how CA2 differentially contributes to the organization of network function. For example, CA2 place cells have been reported to be less spatially tuned during exploration, but uniquely capable of coding place while an animal stops. Here we applied chemogenetics to transiently silence CA2 pyramidal cells and found that CA2 influences hippocampal dynamics in a state-dependent manner. We find that during rest, CA2 inhibition reduces synchronization across regions (CA1, CA2, CA3) and frequency bands (low-gamma- and ripple-band). Moreover, during new learning CA1 place field formation is slower in the absence of CA2 transmission and during pausing, CA1 pyramidal cells are less excitable without CA2 drive. On the network level, a novel convolutional neural network (SpikeDecoder) was employed to show subregion and state-dependent changes in spatial coding that agree with our observations on the single cell level. Together these data suggest additional novel roles for CA2 in governing and differentiating hippocampal dynamics under discrete behavioral states.</p>

                Background: Young people with mental illness should be offered evidence-based treatments. In 2018, we developed a national evidence portal in Norway providing mental health professionals and others with living evidence summaries. This immense work has been an important contribution to mental health care in Norway but is also a rich data source for exploring the characteristics and evidence gaps of the existing research internationally. At the time of this study, eight overviews of systematic reviews (OoOs) had been published. These addressed treatments for attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, psychosis, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), self-harm and trauma/ post-traumatic stress disorder. The objective of this study was to do a secondary analysis of this evidence to describe the state-of-the art in this field, and to map: treatments evaluated for each patient group and the longest time of follow-up treatment comparisons evaluated for more than one patient group Methods: We performed a mapping review of the eight OoOs. Data extraction was performed by one author and double-checked by another. All data was entered into Excel. Findings were visualized in descriptive tables and using Sunburst-diagrams. We used statistical thresholds to determine the size of effect and report the associated certainty. Results: We identified 200 treatment comparisons including a wide variety of interventions. Some mental illnesses are treated mostly with pharmacological or combination therapies and others solely with psychological or psychosocial treatments or with more diversity. The evidence supporting most treatments is of low to very low certainty. Ten percent of the comparisons included follow-up assessments beyond 12 months. Cognitive behavioural therapy, dialectic behavioural therapy, physical activity and mindfulness interventions were effective across populations. Conclusions: The evidence supporting treatment of mental illness in young people has important limitations. Future research efforts should address these evidence gaps.

                Background: The enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene is a reporter gene that can be used to optimize protein isolation procedures and the functional working of a transduction protein. EGFP, with the addition of eleven arginine residues, has been engineered to functionally improve the protein transduction process, which can later be used for cell reprogramming like induced pluripotent stem cells. The addition of six histidine amino acid residues at its C-terminal is intended for the protein isolation process using the His-tag antibody. Methods: The study aimed to investigate the optimization of the EGFP polyarginine protein expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in sufficient quantities for the protein isolation stage. This study also analyzed EGFP expression without polyarginine to analyze the polyarginine addition effect on expression processes. Protein expression was qualitatively measured by looking at expression fluorescence and protein levels of EGFP and EGFP - PolyR proteins. Results: Bands on Western Blots with 6×His-tag monoclonal antibody (primary antibody) and Goat anti-mouse IgG HRP (secondary antibody) showed the EGFP polyarginine and EGFP proteins were expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae INVSc1 at relatively low levels. The lyticase incubation time modification and administration of 3-5 kDa microfilter to concentrate increased the yield of isolated protein. Conclusions: The sufficient amount of protein isolation in S. cerevisiae can be achieved by using lyticase and sonicators combination for the lysis process.

Identified primarily in former contact sports athletes with repeated mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), CTE is a distinct tauopathy that can only be diagnosed postmortem and for which no specific treatment is available. Although the hazards of repeated mTBI are generally acknowledged, a spirited controversy has developed because a firm link between sports concussion and CTE has been questioned.

     alt="Neurodegeneration in a novel invertebrate model system: Failed microtubule-mediated cell adhesion and unraveling of macroglia"/>
<p>Early stages of neurodegeneration in the spider, <i>Cupiennius salei</i>, show unraveling of macroglia around neurons, which is likely due to the catastrophic failure of microtubule-associated desmosomes. This unraveling is followed by the depletion of neuronal cytoplasmic content into the unraveling macroglia, inducing cell death of both neurons and glia cells.

</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neurodegenerative diseases are among the main causes of death in the United States, leading to irreversible disintegration of neurons. Despite intense international research efforts, cellular mechanisms that initiate neurodegeneration remain elusive, thus inhibiting the development of effective preventative and early onset medical treatment. To identify underlying cellular mechanisms that initiate neuron degeneration, it is critical to identify histological and cellular hallmarks that can be linked to underlying biochemical processes. Due to the poor tissue preservation of degenerating mammalian brain tissue, our knowledge regarding histopathological hallmarks of early to late degenerative stages is only fragmentary. Here, we introduce a novel model organism to study histological hallmarks of neurodegeneration, the spider <i>Cupiennius salei</i>. We utilized toluidine blue-stained 0.9-μm serial semithin and 50-nm ultrathin sections of young and old spider nervous tissue. Our findings suggest that the initial stages of neurodegeneration in spiders may be triggered by (1) dissociation of neuron- and glia-derived microtubules, and (2) the weakening of microtubule-associated desmosomal junctions that lead to the unraveling of neuron-insulating macroglia, compromising the structural integrity of affected neurons. The involvement of macroglia in the disposal of neuronal debris described here—although different in the proposed transport mechanisms—shows resemblance to the mammalian glymphatic system. We propose that this model system is highly suitable to investigate invertebrate neurodegenerative processes from early onset to scar formation and that this knowledge may be useful for the study of neurodegeneration in mammalian tissue.</p>

                Cephalopods are set apart from other mollusks by their advanced behavioral abilities and by the complexity of their nervous systems. Because of the great evolutionary distance that separates vertebrates from cephalopods, it is evident that higher cognitive features have evolved separately in these clades despite the similarities that they share. Alongside their complex behavioral abilities, cephalopods have evolved specialized cells and tissues, such as the chromatophores for camouflage or suckers to grasp prey. Despite significant progress in genome and transcriptome sequencing, the molecular identities of cell types in cephalopods remain largely unknown. We here combine single-cell transcriptomics with <i>in situ</i> gene expression analysis to uncover cell type diversity in the European squid <i>Loligo vulgaris</i>. We describe cell types that are conserved with other phyla such as neurons, muscles, or connective tissues but also cephalopod-specific cells, such as chromatophores or sucker cells. Moreover, we investigate major components of the squid nervous system including progenitor and developing cells, differentiated cells of the brain and optic lobes as well as sensory systems of the head. Our study provides a molecular assessment for conserved and novel cell types in cephalopods and a framework for mapping the nervous system of <i>L. vulgaris</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Antisense oligonucleotide therapy rescues disturbed brain rhythms and sleep in juvenile and adult mouse models of Angelman syndrome</a></h4>

              
                <i>UBE3A</i> encodes ubiquitin protein ligase E3A, and in neurons its expression from the paternal allele is repressed by the <i>UBE3A</i> antisense transcript (<i>UBE3A-ATS</i>). This leaves neurons susceptible to loss-of-function of maternal <i>UBE3A</i>. Indeed, Angelman syndrome, a severe neurodevelopmental disorder, is caused by maternal <i>UBE3A</i> deficiency. A promising therapeutic approach to treating Angelman syndrome is to reactivate the intact paternal <i>UBE3A</i> by suppressing <i>UBE3A-ATS</i>. Prior studies show that many neurological phenotypes of maternal <i>Ube3a</i> knockout mice can only be rescued by reinstating <i>Ube3a</i> expression in early development, indicating a restricted therapeutic window for Angelman syndrome. Here we report that reducing <i>Ube3a-ATS</i> by antisense oligonucleotides in juvenile or adult maternal <i>Ube3a</i> knockout mice rescues the abnormal electroencephalogram rhythms and sleep disturbance, two prominent clinical features of Angelman syndrome. Importantly, the degree of phenotypic improvement correlates with the increase of Ube3a protein levels. These results indicate that the therapeutic window of genetic therapies for Angelman syndrome is broader than previously thought, and electroencephalogram power spectrum and sleep architecture should be used to evaluate the clinical efficacy of therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The meningeal transcriptional response to traumatic brain injury and aging</a></h4>

              
                Emerging evidence suggests that the meningeal compartment plays instrumental roles in various neurological disorders, however, we still lack fundamental knowledge about meningeal biology. Here, we utilized high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) techniques to investigate the transcriptional response of the meninges to traumatic brain injury (TBI) and aging in the sub-acute and chronic time frames. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we first explored how mild TBI affects the cellular and transcriptional landscape in the meninges in young mice at one-week post-injury. Then, using bulk RNA-seq, we assessed the differential long-term outcomes between young and aged mice following TBI. In our scRNA-seq studies, we highlight injury-related changes in differential gene expression seen in major meningeal cell populations including macrophages, fibroblasts, and adaptive immune cells. We found that TBI leads to an upregulation of type I interferon (IFN) signature genes in macrophages and a controlled upregulation of inflammatory-related genes in the fibroblast and adaptive immune cell populations. For reasons that remain poorly understood, even mild injuries in the elderly can lead to cognitive decline and devastating neuropathology. To better understand the differential outcomes between the young and the elderly following brain injury, we performed bulk RNA-seq on young and aged meninges 1.5 months after TBI. Notably, we found that aging alone induced upregulation of meningeal genes involved in antibody production by B cells and type I IFN signaling. Following injury, the meningeal transcriptome had largely returned to its pre-injury signature in young mice. In stark contrast, aged TBI mice still exhibited upregulation of immune-related genes and downregulation of genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling. Overall, these findings illustrate the dynamic transcriptional response of the meninges to mild head trauma in youth and aging.

                Brain function relies on the generation of a large variety of morphologically and functionally diverse, but specific, neuronal synapses. Here, we show that, initially, synapse formation on a common target neuron, the cerebellar Purkinje cells, involves a presynaptic secreted protein common for all types of excitatory inputs. The molecular program then evolves only in one of the inputs with the additional expression of a combination of presynaptic secreted proteins that specify the mature pattern of connectivity on the target. These results show that some inputs actively and gradually specify their synaptic molecular identity while others rely on the "original code". Thus, the molecular specification of excitatory synapses, crucial for proper circuit function, is acquired in a stepwise manner during mouse postnatal development and obeys input-specific rules.

                Attention deficit is one of the most prominent and disabling symptoms in Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). Hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli contributes to attention difficulties by overwhelming and/or distracting affected individuals, which disrupts activities of daily living at home and learning at school. We find that auditory or visual distractors selectively impair visual discrimination performance in both humans and mice with FXS, but not their typically developing controls. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) neurons were significantly modulated by incorrect responses in the post-stimulus period during early distractor trials in WT mice, consistent with their known role as error signals. Strikingly, however, VIP cells from Fmr1-/- mice showed little modulation in error trials, and this correlated with their poor performance on the distractor task. Thus, VIP interneurons and their reduced modulatory influence on pyramidal cells, could be a potential therapeutic target for attentional difficulties in FXS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Decoding the relative contributions of extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms in mediating heterogeneous spiking activities of sensory neurons in vivo using computational modeling</a></h4>

              
                Neurons ubiquitously display heterogeneities in spiking activity even within a given cell type. To date, the relative contributions of extrinsic mechanisms (e.g., synaptic bombardment) and intrinsic mechanisms (e.g., conductances, cell morphology) towards determining spiking activity remain poorly understood. Here we address this important question using a novel approach that combines biophysical techniques, in which extracellular in vivo recordings of electrosensory pyramidal cells within weakly electric fish, are combined with computational modeling. Specifically, by varying parameters, a conductance-based computational model successfully reproduced the highly heterogeneous spiking activities seen experimentally. Model parameters that varied the most were then used to gauge the relative contributions of extrinsic vs. intrinsic mechanisms. Overall, extrinsic synaptic input was predicted to be the main factor accounting for spiking heterogeneities. We tested this prediction experimentally by performing two different manipulations: i) pharmacologically inactivating feedback; ii) applying the neuromodulator serotonin. Our model predicted that feedback inactivation should reduce while serotonin application should increase spiking heterogeneities. Experiments corroborated these predictions. Importantly, for serotonin application, increased heterogeneity occurred despite a strong reduction in intrinsic membrane conductance, further demonstrating that extrinsic synaptic input is the primary determinant of spiking heterogeneities in vivo. Taken together, our results demonstrate that devising a computational model to capture spiking heterogeneities in vivo and assessing which parameters are responsible can successfully determine the relative contributions of extrinsic vs. intrinsic inputs. We expect this approach to be generalizable to other systems and species.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An original potentiating mechanism revealed by the cryoEM structures of the human α7 nicotinic receptor in complex with nanobodies</a></h4>

              
                The human 7 nicotinic receptor is a pentameric channel mediating cellular and neuronal communication. It has attracted considerable interest to design ligands for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders. To develop a novel class of 7 ligands, we recently generated two nanobodies named E3 and C4 acting as positive and silent allosteric modulators respectively. Here, we solved the cryo-EM structures of the nanobody-receptor complexes. E3 and C4 bind to a common epitope involving two subunits at the apex of the receptor. They form by themselves a symmetric pentameric assembly that extends the extracellular domain. Unlike C4, the binding of E3 drives an active or desensitized conformation in the absence of orthosteric agonist, and mutational analysis shows a key contribution of a N-linked sugar moiety in mediating E3 potentiation. The nanobody E3, by remotely controlling the global allosteric conformation of the receptor, implements an original mechanism of regulation which opens new avenues for drug design.

                Microdeletion of a 3Mbp region encompassing 45 protein-coding genes at chromosome 22q11.2 (22q11.2DS) predisposes to multiple neurodevelopmental disorders and is one of the greatest genetic risk factors for schizophrenia. Defective mitochondrial function has been hypothesized to contribute to 22q11.2DS pathogenesis; however, which of the six mitochondrial genes contribute to neurodevelopmental phenotypes and their underlying mechanisms remain unresolved. To systematically test 22q11.2DS genes for functional roles in neurodevelopment and behavior, we generated genetic mutants for each of the 37 conserved zebrafish orthologs and performed high throughput behavioral phenotyping using seven behavioral assays. Through this unbiased approach, we identified five single-gene mutants with partially overlapping behavioral phenotypes. Two of these genes, mrpl40 and prodha, encode for mitochondrial proteins and, similar to what we observed in mrpl40 and prodha mutants, pharmacologic inhibition of mitochondrial function during development results in microcephaly. Finally, we show that both mrpl40 and prodha mutants display neural stem and progenitor cell phenotypes, with each gene regulating different neural stem cell populations. Combined, our results demonstrate a critical role for mitochondrial function in neural stem and progenitor cell populations in the developing vertebrate brain and provide compelling evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction during neurodevelopment is linked to brain volume and behavioral phenotypes observed in models of 22q11.2DS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">ErbB inhibition impairs cognition via disrupting myelination and aerobic glycolysis in oligodendrocytes</a></h4>

              
                White matter abnormalities are an emerging feature of schizophrenia, yet the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are largely unknown. Disruption of ErbB signaling that is essential for peripheral myelination has been genetically associated with schizophrenia and white matter lesions in schizophrenic patients. However, the roles of ErbB signaling in oligodendrocytes remain elusive. Here, we used a pan-ErbB inhibition strategy and demonstrated the synergistic functions of endogenous ErbB receptors in oligodendrocytes. Through analyses of the cellular, histological, biochemical, behavioral, and electrophysiological differences in mice with manipulation of ErbB activities in oligodendrocytes at different differentiation stages, we found that ErbB signaling regulates myelination and aerobic glycolysis in oligodendrocytes, and both functions are required for working memory. ErbB inhibition in oligodendrocytes at early differentiation stages induces hypomyelination by suppressing the differentiation of newly-formed oligodendrocytes. In contrast, ErbB inhibition in mature oligodendrocytes alters neither myelination nor oligodendrocyte numbers, but accelerates axonal conduction decline under energy stress. Mechanistically, mature oligodendrocytes with ErbB inhibition reduce the expression of lactate dehydrogenase A, failing to provide lactate to electrically active axons. Supplementation of L-lactate restores axonal conduction and working memory capacity that are suppressed by ErbB inhibition in mature oligodendrocytes. These findings reveal the indispensable roles of ErbB signaling in white matter integrity and function, and provide insights into the multifaceted contributions of white matter abnormalities to cognitive impairment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Generation of nanobodies acting as silent and positive allosteric modulators of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor</a></h4>

              
                The 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), a potential drug target for treating cognitive disorders, mediates communication between neuronal and non-neuronal cells. Although many competitive antagonists, agonists, and partial-agonists have been found and synthesized, they have not led to effective therapeutic treatments. In this context, small molecules acting as positive allosteric modulators binding outside the orthosteric, acetylcholine, site have attracted considerable interest. Two single-domain antibody fragments, C4 and E3, generated through alpaca immunization with cells expressing the extracellular domain of the human 7-nAChR, are herein described. They bind to the 7-nAChR but not to the other major nAChR subtypes, 4{beta}2 and 3{beta}4. E3 acts as a slowly associating type I positive allosteric modulator, strongly potentiating the acetylcholine-elicited currents, while not significantly altering the desensitization of the receptor. An E3-E3 bivalent construct shows similar potentiating properties but displays very slow dissociation kinetics conferring quasi-irreversible properties. Whereas, C4 does not alter the receptor function, but fully inhibits the E3-evoked potentiation, showing it is a silent allosteric modulator competing with E3 binding. Both nanobodies do not compete with -bungarotoxin, localizing at an allosteric extracellular binding site away from the orthosteric site. The functional differences of each nanobody, as well as the alteration of functional properties through nanobody modifications indicate the importance of this extracellular site. The nanobodies will be useful for pharmacological and structural investigations; moreover, they, along with the extracellular site, have a direct potential for clinical applications.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural correlates of face perception modeled with a convolutional recurrent neural network</a></h4>

              
                Event-related potential (ERP) sensitivity to faces is predominantly characterized by an N170 peak that has greater amplitude and shorter latency when elicited by human faces than images of other objects. We developed a computational model of visual ERP generation to study this phenomenon which consisted of a convolutional neural network (CNN) connected to a recurrent neural network (RNN). We used open-access data to develop the model, generated synthetic images for simulating experiments, then collected additional data to validate predictions of these simulations. For modeling, visual stimuli presented during ERP experiments were represented as sequences of images (time x pixels). These were provided as inputs to the model. The CNN transformed these inputs into sequences of vectors that were passed to the RNN. The ERP waveforms evoked by visual stimuli were provided to the RNN as labels for supervised learning. The whole model was trained end-to-end using data from the open-access dataset to reproduce ERP waveforms evoked by visual events. Cross-validation model outputs strongly correlated with open-access (r = 0.98) and validation study data (r = 0.78). Open-access and validation study data correlated similarly (r = 0.81). Some aspects of model behavior were consistent with neural recordings while others were not, suggesting promising albeit limited capacity for modeling the neurophysiology of face-sensitive ERP generation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Meditation attenuates Default-mode activity: a pilot study using ultra-high strength MRI</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: Mapping the neurobiology of meditation using 3 Tesla functional MRI (fMRI) has burgeoned recently. However, limitations in signal quality and neuroanatomical resolution have impacted reliability and precision of extant findings. Although ultra-high strength 7 Tesla MRI overcomes these limitations, investigation of meditation using 7 Tesla fMRI is still in its infancy. Methods: In this feasibility study, we scanned 10 individuals who were beginner meditators using 7 Tesla fMRI while they performed focused attention meditation and non-focused rest. We also measured and adjusted the fMRI signal for key physiological differences between meditation and rest. Finally, we explored the 2-week impact of the single fMRI meditation session on mindfulness, anxiety and focused attention attributes. Results: Group-level task fMRI analyses revealed significant reductions in activity during meditation relative to rest in Default-mode network hubs, i.e., antero-medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices, precuneus, as well as visual and thalamic regions. These findings survived stringent statistical corrections for fluctuations in physiological responses which demonstrated significant differences (p < 0.05/n, Bonferroni controlled) between meditation and rest. Compared to baseline, State Mindfulness Scale (SMS) scores were significantly elevated (F = 8.16, p<0.05/n, Bonferroni controlled) following the fMRI meditation session, and were closely maintained at 2-week follow up. Conclusions: This pilot study establishes the feasibility and utility of investigating focused attention meditation using ultra-high strength (7 Tesla) fMRI, by supporting widespread evidence that focused attention meditation attenuates Default-mode activity responsible for self-referential processing. Future functional neuroimaging studies of meditation should control for physiological confounds and include behavioural assessments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Expression profiling of the learning striatum</a></h4>

              
                During cortico-basal ganglia dependent learning, relevant environmental information is associated with certain outcomes; such learning is essential to generate adaptive behaviour in a continuously changing environment. Through repetitive trial-and-error experiences, actions are optimized and cognitive associative load can be relieved through consolidation and automatization. Although the molecular basis of learning is well studied, region-specific genome-wide expression profiles of the striatum, the major input region of cortico-basal ganglia circuits, during learning are lacking. Here we combined an automated operant conditioning paradigm with an efficient RNA-sequencing protocol to compare expression profiles among three learning stages in three striatal regions per hemisphere in a total of 240 striatal biopsies. Notably, the inclusion of matched yoked controls allowed reliably identifying learning-related expression changes. With 593 differently expressed genes (3.3% of all detected genes), we find the strongest effect of learning at an early, goal-directed stage across all three striatal region and identify a total of 921 learning-related expression changes. Our dataset provides a unique resource to study molecular markers of striatal learning.

                Chronic social stress in mice causes behavioral and physiological changes resulting in perturbed rhythms of body temperature, activity and sleep-wake cycle. To further understand the link between mood disorders and temperature rhythmicity, we measured core body temperature (Tcore) in mice before and after exposure to the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) paradigm. Our results revealed that Tcore amplitudes of stress resilient and susceptible mice are dampened during exposure to CSDS. However, after exposure to social stress, the temperature amplitude of resilient mice recovered faster than the susceptible mice. There were minimal changes in locomotor activity after stress exposure which correlates with regular rhythmic expression of Prok2, an output signal of the SCN (Suprachiasmatic nucleus). We also investigated the molecular changes associated with these dampened temperature rhythms, and determined the expression levels of thermosensitive genes Cirbp, Rbm3 and Hsf1. Expression of Rbm3 and Cirbp in the LHb (Lateral habenula) were blunted 1 day after CSDS. These molecular rhythms recovered 10 days later such that daytime expression was higher compared to nighttime, similar to stress-naive controls. Hsf1 did not show robust rhythmic expression in the LHb.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cognition's dependence on functional network integrity with age is conditional on structural network integrity</a></h4>

              
                Maintaining good cognitive function is crucial for well-being across the lifespan. We proposed that the degree of cognitive maintenance is determined by the functional interactions within and between large-scale brain networks. Such connectivity can be represented by the white matter architecture of structural brain networks that shape intrinsic neuronal activity into integrated and distributed functional networks. We explored how the function-structure connectivity convergence, and the divergence of functional connectivity from structural connectivity, contribute to the maintenance of cognitive function across the adult lifespan. Multivariate analyses were used to investigate the relationship between function-structure connectivity convergence and divergence with multivariate cognitive profiles, respectively. Cognitive function was increasingly dependent on function-structure connectivity convergence as age increased. The dependency of cognitive function on connectivity was particularly strong for high-order cortical networks and subcortical networks. The results suggest that brain functional network integrity sustains cognitive functions in old age, as a function of the integrity of the brain's structural connectivity.

                Whether neurodevelopmental defects underlie the selective neuronal death that characterizes neurodegenerative diseases is becoming an intriguing question. To address it, we focused on the motor neuron (MN) disease Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), caused by reduced levels of the ubiquitous protein SMN. Taking advantage of the first isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived SMA model that we have generated and a spinal cord organoid system, here we report that the relative and temporal expression of early neural progenitor and MN markers is altered in SMA. Furthermore, the corrected isogenic controls only partially reverse these abnormalities. These findings raise the relevant clinical implication that SMN-increasing treatments might not fully amend SMA pathological phenotypes. The approach we have taken demonstrates that the discovery of new disease mechanisms is greatly improved by using human isogenic models. Moreover, our study implies that SMA has a developmental component that might trigger the MN degeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">How honey bees make fast and accurate decisions</a></h4>

              
                Honey bee ecology demands they make both rapid and accurate assessments of which flowers are most likely to offer them nectar or pollen. To understand the mechanisms of honey bee decision-making we examined their speed and accuracy of both flower acceptance and rejection decisions. We used a controlled flight arena that varied both the likelihood of a stimulus offering reward and punishment and the quality of evidence for stimuli. We found that the sophistication of honey bee decision-making rivalled that reported for primates. Their decisions were sensitive to both the quality and reliability of evidence. Acceptance responses had higher accuracy than rejection responses and were more sensitive to changes in available evidence and reward likelihood. Fast acceptances were more likely to be correct than slower acceptances; a phenomenon also seen in primates and indicative that the evidence threshold for a decision changes dynamically with sampling time. To investigate the minimally sufficient circuitry required for these decision-making capacities, we developed a novel model of decision-making. Our model can be mapped to known pathways in the insect brain and is neurobiologically plausible. Our model proposes a system for robust autonomous decision-making with potential application in robotics.

                Even before the eyes move, visual sensitivity improves at the target of the planned eye movement. Yet, it is unknown if such "presaccadic" benefits are merely sensory, or also influence decisional processes. We teased apart these contributions with signal detection theory, and discovered a surprising absence of presaccadic benefits in visual change detection tasks. Participants planned and executed saccades while concurrently detecting and localizing either orientation or contrast changes. Spatial choice bias reliably improved presaccadically but, surprisingly, without a concomitant increase in perceptual sensitivity. Additional investigation with an orientation estimation task, and a Bayesian "variable precision" model, revealed that sensory precision increased at the saccade target, but only for the most recent of two successive stimuli. Moreover, the recent stimulus perceptually biased feature estimates of the prior stimulus, rendering accurate change detection even more challenging. Our results uncover novel perceptual and decisional mechanisms that mediate presaccadic change detection.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Optimizing FreeSurfer's Surface Reconstruction Parameters for Anatomical Feature Estimation</a></h4>

              
                Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful tool for non-invasive imaging of the human body. However, the quality and reliability of MRI data can be influenced by various factors, such as hardware and software configurations, image acquisition protocols, and preprocessing techniques. In recent years, the introduction of large-scale neuroimaging datasets has taken an increasingly prominent role in neuroscientific research. The advent of publicly available and standardized repositories has enabled researchers to combine data from multiple sources to explore a wide range of scientific inquiries. This increase in scale allows the study of phenomena with smaller effect sizes over a more diverse sample and with greater statistical power. Other than the variability inherent to the acquisition of the data across sites, preprocessing and feature generation steps implemented in different labs introduce an additional layer of variability which may influence consecutive statistical procedures. In this study, we show that differences in the configuration of surface reconstruction from anatomical MRI using FreeSurfer results in considerable changes to the estimated anatomical features. In addition, we demonstrate the effect these differences have on within-subject similarity and the performance of basic prediction tasks based on the derived anatomical features. Our results show that although FreeSurfer may be provided with either a T2w or a FLAIR scan for the same purpose of improving pial surface estimation (relative to based on the mandatory T1w scan alone), the two configurations have a distinctly different effect. In addition, our findings indicate that the similarity of within-subject scans and performance of a range of models for the prediction of sex and age are significantly effected, they are not significantly improved by either of the enhanced configurations. These results demonstrate the large extent to which elementary and sparsely reported differences in preprocessing workflow configurations influence the derived brain features. The results of this study are meant to underline the importance of optimizing preprocessing procedures based on experimental results prior to their distribution and consecutive standardization and harmonization efforts across public datasets. In addition, preprocessing configurations should be carefully reported and included in any following analytical workflows, to account for any variation originating from such differences. Finally, other representations of the raw data should be explored and studied to provide a more robust framework for data aggregation and sharing.

                Shape perception is essential for numerous everyday behaviors from object recognition to grasping and handling objects. Yet how the brain encodes shape remains poorly understood. Here, we probed shape representations using visual aftereffects (perceptual distortions that occur following extended exposure to a stimulus) to resolve a long-standing debate about shape encoding. We implemented contrasting low-level and high-level computational models of neural adaptation, which made precise and distinct predictions about the illusory shape distortions the observers experience following adaptation. Directly pitting the predictions of the two models against one another revealed that the perceptual distortions are driven by high-level shape attributes derived from the statistics of natural shapes. Our findings suggest that the diverse shape attributes thought to underlie shape encoding (e.g., curvature distributions, shape skeleton, aspect ratio) are the result of a visual system that learns to encode natural shape geometries based on observing many objects.

                Whether you are reading, running or sleeping, your brain and its fluid environment continuously interacts to distribute nutrients and clear metabolic waste. Yet, the precise mechanisms for solute transport within the human brain have remained hard to quantify using imaging techniques alone. From multi-modal human brain MRI data sets in sleeping and sleep-deprived subjects, we identify and quantify CSF tracer transport parameters using forward and inverse subject-specific computational modelling. Our findings support the notion that extracellular diffusion alone is not sufficient as a brain-wide tracer transport mechanism. Instead, we show that human MRI observations align well with transport by either substantially enhanced (3.5 times faster) extracellular diffusion in combination with local clearance rates corresponding to a tracer half-life of up to 5 hours, or by extracellular diffusion augmented by advection with brain-wide average flow speeds on the order of 1-9 micrometers/min. Reduced advection fully explains reduced tracer clearance after sleep-deprivation, supporting the role of sleep and sleep deprivation on human brain clearance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multiple independent components contribute to event-related potential correlates of conscious vision</a></h4>

              
                Research has revealed two major event-related potential (ERP) markers of visual awareness: the earlier Visual Awareness Negativity (VAN, around 150-250 ms after stimulus onset), and the following Late Positivity (LP, around 300-500 ms after stimulus onset). Understanding the neural sources that give rise to VAN and LP is important in order to understand what kind of neural processes enable conscious visual perception. Although the ERPs afford high temporal resolution, their spatial resolution is limited because multiple separate sources sum up at the scalp level. In the present study, we sought to characterize the locations and time-courses of independent neural sources underlying the ERP correlates of visual awareness by means of Independent Component Analysis (ICA). ICA allows identifying and localizing the temporal dynamics of different neural sources that contribute to the ERP correlates of conscious perception. The present results show that while LP reflects a combination of multiple sources distributed among frontal, parietal and occipito-temporal cortex, the sources of VAN are localized to posterior areas including occipital and temporal cortex. In addition, our analysis reveals that activity in very early sources (roughly -100-100 ms after stimulus onset) in temporal and fronto-parietal cortices correlates with conscious vision.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modulation of Giant Depolarizing Potentials (GDPs) in Human Large Basket Cells by Norepinephrine and Acetylcholine</a></h4>

              
                Rhythmic brain activity has been implicated in many brain functions and it is sensible to neuromodulation, but so far very few studies have been carried out from in vitro experiments in humans. In this study we revealed and characterized a novel rhythmic network activity in layer 2/3 (L2/3) of human neocortex. Intracellular patch-clamp recordings showed that giant depolarizing potentials (GDPs) were frequently found in human cortical neurons. GDPs appeared in a low frequency band (~ 0.3 Hz) similar to that described for slow oscillations in vivo, and displayed large amplitudes and long decay times. Under the same experimental conditions, no rhythmic activity was found in L2/3 of the rat neocortex. GDPs were predominantly observed in a subset of L2/3 interneurons considered to be large basket cells based on previously described morphological features. In addition, GDPs are highly sensitive to norepinephrine (NE) and acetylcholine (ACh), two neuromodulators known to affect slow waves in brain activity. NE increased the frequency of the GDPs by enhancing {beta}-adrenergic receptor activity while ACh decreased GDP frequency through M4 muscarinic receptor-activation. Multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings demonstrated that NE promoted synchronous oscillatory network activity while the application of ACh led to a desynchronization of neuronal activity. Our data indicate that the human neocortex is more prone to generate slow wave activity, which was reflected by more pronounced GDPs in L2/3 large basket cells. The distinct modulation of GDPs and slow wave activity by NE and ACh exerts a specific modulatory control over the human neocortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Facial representation comparisons between human brain and deep convolutional neural network reveal a fatigue repetition suppression mechanism</a></h4>

              
                Repetition suppression for faces, a phenomenon that neural responses are reduced to repeated faces in the visual cortex, have long been studied. However, the underlying primary neural mechanism of repetition suppression remains debated. In recent years, artificial neural networks can achieve the performance of face recognition at human level. In our current study, we combined human electroencephalogram (EEG) and the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) and applied reverse engineering to provide a novel way to investigate the neural mechanisms of facial repetition suppression. First, we used brain decoding approach to explore the representations of faces and demonstrates its repetition suppression effect in human brains. Then we constructed two repetition suppression models, Fatigue and Sharpening models, to modify the activation of DCNNs and conducted cross-modal representational similarity analysis (RSA) comparisons between human EEG signals and activations in two modified DCNNs, respectively. We found that representations of human brains were more similar to representations of Fatigue-modified DCNN instead of Sharpening modified DCNN. Our results suggests that the facial repetition suppression effect in face perception is more likely caused by the fatigue mechanism suggesting that the activation of neurons with stronger responses to face stimulus would be attenuated more. Therefore, the current study supports the fatigue mechanism as a more plausible neural mechanism of facial repetition suppression. The comparison between representations in the human brain and DCNN provides a promising tool to simulate and infer the brain mechanism underlying human behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The predictive power of intrinsic timescale during the perceptual decision-making process across the mouse brain</a></h4>

              
                Across the cortical hierarchy, single neurons are characterized by differences in the extent to which they can sustain their firing rate over time (i.e., their "intrinsic timescale"). Previous studies have demonstrated that neurons in a given brain region mostly exhibit either short or long intrinsic timescales. In this study, we sought to identify populations of neurons that accumulate information over different timescales in the mouse brain and to characterize their functions in the context of a visual discrimination task. Thus, we separately examined the neural population dynamics of neurons with long or short intrinsic timescales across different brain regions. More specifically, we looked at the decoding performance of these neural populations aligned to different task variables (stimulus onset, movement). Taken together, our population-level findings support the hypothesis that long intrinsic timescale neurons encode abstract variables related to decision formation. Furthermore, we investigated whether there was a relationship between how well a single neuron represents the animal's choice or stimuli and their intrinsic timescale. We did not observe any significant relationship between the decoding of these task variables and a single neuron's intrinsic timescale. In summary, our findings support the idea that the long intrinsic timescale population of neurons, which appear at different levels of the cortical hierarchy, are primarily more involved in representing the decision variable.

	<p>Objectives: Investigate the biomechanical characteristics in tracheostomized patients with aspiration following acquired brain injury (ABI) and further explore the relationship between the biomechanical characteristics and aspiration. Methods: This is a single-center cross-sectional study. The tracheostomized patients with aspiration following ABI and age-matched healthy controls were recruited. The biomechanical characteristics, including velopharynx (VP) maximal pressure, tongue base (TB) maximal pressure, upper esophageal sphincter (UES) residual pressure, UES relaxation duration, and subglottic pressure, were examined by high-resolution manometry and computational fluid dynamics simulation analysis. The penetration&amp;amp;ndash;aspiration scale (PAS) score was evaluated by a videofluoroscopic swallowing study. Results: Fifteen healthy subjects and fifteen tracheostomized patients with aspiration following ABI were included. The decreased VP maximal pressure, increased UES residual pressure, and shortened UES relaxation duration were found in the patient group compared with the control group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the subglottic pressure significantly decreased in patients (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), while no significant difference was found in TB maximal pressure between groups (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). In addition, in the patient group, VP maximal pressure (rs = &amp;amp;minus;0.439; p = 0.015), UES relaxation duration (rs = &amp;amp;minus;0.532; p = 0.002), and the subglottic pressure (rs = &amp;amp;minus;0.775; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) were negatively correlated with the PAS score, while UES residual pressure (rs = 0.807; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) was positively correlated with the PAS score (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), the correlation between TB maximal pressure and PAS score (rs = &amp;amp;minus;0.315; p = 0.090) did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: The biomechanical characteristics in tracheostomized patients with aspiration following ABI might manifest as decreased VP maximal pressure and subglottic pressure, increased UES residual pressure, and shortened UES relaxation duration, in which VP maximal pressure, UES relaxation duration, subglottic pressure, and UES residual pressure were correlated with aspiration.</p>

	<p>Nowadays, fostered by technological progress and contextual circumstances such as the economic crisis and pandemic restrictions, remote education is experiencing growing deployment. However, this growth has generated widespread doubts about the actual effectiveness of remote/online learning compared to face-to-face education. The present study was aimed at comparing face-to-face and remote education through a multimodal neurophysiological approach. It involved forty students at a driving school, in a real classroom, experiencing both modalities. Wearable devices to measure brain, ocular, heart and sweating activities were employed in order to analyse the students&amp;amp;rsquo; neurophysiological signals to obtain insights into the cognitive dimension. In particular, four parameters were considered: the Eye Blink Rate, the Heart Rate and its Variability and the Skin Conductance Level. In addition, the students filled out a questionnaire at the end to obtain an explicit measure of their learning performance. Data analysis showed higher cognitive activity, in terms of attention and mental engagement, in the in-presence setting compared to the remote modality. On the other hand, students in the remote class felt more stressed, particularly during the first part of the lesson. The analysis of questionnaires demonstrated worse performance for the remote group, thus suggesting a common &amp;amp;ldquo;disengaging&amp;amp;rdquo; behaviour when attending remote courses, thus undermining their effectiveness. In conclusion, neuroscientific tools could help to obtain insights into mental concerns, often &amp;amp;ldquo;blind&amp;amp;rdquo;, such as decreasing attention and increasing stress, as well as their dynamics during the lesson itself, thus allowing the definition of proper countermeasures to emerging issues when introducing new practices into daily life.</p>

	<p>Background: The number of geriatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients is increasing every year due to the population&amp;amp;rsquo;s aging in most of the developed countries. Unfortunately, there is no widely recognized tool for specifically evaluating the prognosis of geriatric TBI patients. We designed this study to compare the prognostic value of different machine learning algorithm-based predictive models for geriatric TBI. Methods: TBI patients aged &amp;amp;ge;65 from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) database were eligible for this study. To develop and validate machine learning algorithm-based prognostic models, included patients were divided into a training set and a testing set, with a ratio of 7:3. The predictive value of different machine learning based models was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and F score. Results: A total of 1123 geriatric TBI patients were included, with a mortality of 24.8%. Non-survivors had higher age (82.2 vs. 80.7, p = 0.010) and lower Glasgow Coma Scale (14 vs. 7, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) than survivors. The rate of mechanical ventilation was significantly higher (67.6% vs. 25.9%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) in non-survivors while the rate of neurosurgical operation did not differ between survivors and non-survivors (24.3% vs. 23.0%, p = 0.735). Among different machine learning algorithms, Adaboost (AUC: 0.799) and Random Forest (AUC: 0.795) performed slightly better than the logistic regression (AUC: 0.792) on predicting mortality in geriatric TBI patients in the testing set. Conclusion: Adaboost, Random Forest and logistic regression all performed well in predicting mortality of geriatric TBI patients. Prognostication tools utilizing these algorithms are helpful for physicians to evaluate the risk of poor outcomes in geriatric TBI patients and adopt personalized therapeutic options for them.</p>

	<p>Background: Balance impairment is a common disability in post-stroke survivors, leading to reduced mobility and increased fall risk. Robotic gait training (RAGT) is largely used, along with traditional training. There is, however, no strong evidence about RAGT superiority, especially on balance. This study aims to determine RAGT efficacy on balance of post-stroke survivors. Methods: PubMed, Cochrane Library, and PeDRO databases were investigated. Randomized clinical trials evaluating RAGT efficacy on post-stroke survivor balance with Berg Balance Scale (BBS) or Timed Up and Go test (TUG) were searched. Meta-regression analyses were performed, considering weekly sessions, single-session duration, and robotic device used. Results: A total of 18 trials have been included. BBS pre-post treatment mean difference is higher in RAGT-treated patients, with a pMD of 2.17 (95% CI 0.79; 3.55). TUG pre-post mean difference is in favor of RAGT, but not statistically, with a pMD of &amp;amp;minus;0.62 (95%CI &amp;amp;minus; 3.66; 2.43). Meta-regression analyses showed no relevant association, except for TUG and treatment duration (&amp;amp;beta; = &amp;amp;minus;1.019, 95% CI &amp;amp;minus; 1.827; &amp;amp;minus;0.210, p-value = 0.0135). Conclusions: RAGT efficacy is equal to traditional therapy, while the combination of the two seems to lead to better outcomes than each individually performed. Robot-assisted balance training should be the focus of experimentation in the following years, given the great results in the first available trials. Given the massive heterogeneity of included patients, trials with more strict inclusion criteria (especially time from stroke) must be performed to finally define if and when RAGT is superior to traditional therapy.</p>

	<p>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is widely regarded to be the intermediate stage to Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. Cerebral morphological alteration in cortical subregions can provide an accurate predictor for early recognition of MCI. Thirty patients with MCI and thirty healthy control subjects participated in this study. The Desikan&amp;amp;ndash;Killiany cortical atlas was applied to segment participants&amp;amp;rsquo; cerebral cortex into 68 subregions. A complexity measure termed fractal dimension (FD) was applied to assess morphological changes in cortical subregions of participants. The MCI group revealed significantly decreased FD values in the bilateral temporal lobes, right parietal lobe including the medial temporal, fusiform, para hippocampal, and also the orbitofrontal lobes. We further proposed a novel FD-based brain structural network to compare network parameters, including intra- and inter-lobular connectivity between groups. The control group had five modules, and the MCI group had six modules in their brain networks. The MCI group demonstrated shrinkage of modular sizes with fewer components integrated, and significantly decreased global modularity in the brain network. The MCI group had lower intra- and inter-lobular connectivity in all lobes. Between cerebral lobes, the MCI patients may maintain nodal connections between both hemispheres to reduce connectivity loss in the lateral hemispheres. The method and results presented in this study could be a suitable tool for early detection of MCI.</p>

     alt="Architecture of the inferior parietal cortex in capuchin monkey"/><p>Architectural subdivision of the inferior parietal cortex (IPC) of the capuchin monkey in a 3D reconstruction of the left hemisphere. Five architectural areas are shown: three areas in the IPC convexity (PFG, in red; PG, in blue; and Opt, in brown), and two areas in the IPC operculum (PFop, in purple; and PGop, in green).

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We studied the organization of the inferior parietal cortex (IPC) in five capuchin monkey (6 hemispheres) using cytoarchitectonic (Nissl), myeloarchitectonic (Gallyas), and immune-architectonic (SMI-32 monoclonal antibody) techniques. We partitioned the IPC into five distinct areas: PFG, PG, Opt, PFop, and PGop. Since we used parasagittal sections, we were not able to study area PF due to its far lateral position, which yielded slices that were tangential to the pial surface. Areas PFG, PG, and Opt were in the convexity close to the lateral sulcus, while PFop and PGop were positioned more posteriorly, in the opercular region of IPC. Of all the five regions, area Opt was the one most similar to its analogue in the macaque, especially as revealed with SMI-32 staining. Namely, in both primate species area Opt showed a low density of large pyramidal neurons. Additionally, the apical dendrites of these neurons were sparse and vertically orientated, resembling columns. We also found area PG to be similar: both species exhibited cell body layers with a radial arrangement. On the other hand, Nissl staining revealed area PFG to be architectonically different between New and Old-World monkeys: PFG in the capuchin showed a comparatively higher cell density than in macaques, especially in layers II and IV. These results suggest that evolution may have enabled the functional specialization of these brain regions based on behavioral demands of upper limb use. The small differences in the IPC of the two primates may be linked to interspecies variability.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate molecular biomarkers of a-synuclein and tau aggregation, autophagy, and inflammation in the saliva of de novo Parkinson's disease (PD) patients in comparison to healthy subjects (HS), and to correlate molecular data with clinical features of PD patients, in order to establish whether abnormalities of these parameters are associated with specific clusters of de novo PD patients, and their potential diagnostic power in differentiating PD patients from HS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We measured total and oligomeric a-synuclein, total-tau and phosphorylated-tau, microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 beta (MAP-LC3beta), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) in the saliva of 80 de novo PD patients and 62 HS, using quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent Assay analysis.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Oligomeric a-synuclein, total-tau, MAP-LC3beta, and TNFalpha levels resulted significantly higher in patients with respect to HS, while no significant differences were detected for total a-synuclein or phosphorylated-tau. Phosphorylated-tau directly correlated with MAP-LC3beta, whereas it inversely correlated with TNFalpha in PD patients. An inverse correlation was detected between MAP-LC3beta and non-motor symptoms severity. Principal Component Analysis showed that molecular and clinical parameters were independent of each other in de novo PD patients. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis reported an accurate diagnostic performance of oligomeric a-synuclein and MAP-LC3beta. The diagnostic accuracy of total a-synuclein increased when it was combined with other salivary biomarkers targeting different molecular pathways.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study proposes a novel biomarker panel using saliva, a non-invasive biofluid, in de novo PD patients, with implications in understanding the molecular pathways involved in PD pathogenesis and the relevance of different molecular pathways in determining clinical PD subtypes.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Rare Genetic Variation and Outcome of Surgery for Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Genetic factors have long been debated as a cause of failure of surgery for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). We investigated whether rare genetic variation influences seizure outcomes of MTLE surgery.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed an international, multicenter, whole exome sequencing study of patients who underwent surgery for drug-resistant, unilateral MTLE with normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or MRI evidence of hippocampal sclerosis and ≥2-year postsurgical follow-up. Patients with either sustained seizure freedom (favorable outcome) or ongoing uncontrolled seizures since surgery (unfavorable outcome) were included. Exomes of controls without epilepsy were also included. Gene set burden analyses were carried out to identify genes with significant enrichment of rare deleterious variants in patients compared to controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Nine centers from 3 continents contributed 206 patients operated for drug-resistant unilateral MTLE, of whom 196 (149 with favorable outcome and 47 with unfavorable outcome) were included after stringent quality control. Compared to 8,718 controls, MTLE cases carried a higher burden of ultrarare missense variants in constrained genes that are intolerant to loss-of-function (LoF) variants (odds ratio [OR] = 2.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.9–3.5, <i>p</i> = 1.3E-09) and in genes encoding voltage-gated cation channels (OR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.4–3.8, <i>p</i> = 2.7E-04). Proportions of subjects with such variants were comparable between patients with favorable outcome and those with unfavorable outcome, with no significant between-group differences.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Rare variation contributes to the genetic architecture of MTLE, but does not appear to have a major role in failure of MTLE surgery. These findings can be incorporated into presurgical decision-making and counseling. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sympathetic efferent axons regulate cardiac functions. However, the topographical distribution and morphology of cardiac sympathetic efferent axons remain insufficiently characterized due to the technical challenges involved in immunohistochemical labeling of the thick walls of the whole heart. In this study, flat-mounts of the left and right atria and ventricles of FVB mice were immunolabeled for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a marker of sympathetic nerves. Atrial and ventricular flat-mounts were scanned using a confocal microscope to construct montages. We found (1) <i>In the atria</i>: A few large TH-immunoreactive (IR) axon bundles entered both atria, branched into small bundles and then single axons that eventually formed very dense terminal networks in the epicardium, myocardium and inlet regions of great vessels to the atria. Varicose TH-IR axons formed close contact with cardiomyocytes, vessels, and adipocytes. Multiple intrinsic cardiac ganglia (ICG) were identified in the epicardium of both atria, and a subpopulation of the neurons in the ICG were TH-IR. Most TH-IR axons in bundles traveled through ICG before forming dense varicose terminal networks in cardiomyocytes. We did not observe varicose TH-IR terminals encircling ICG neurons. (2) <i>In the left and right ventricles and interventricular septum</i>: TH-IR axons formed dense terminal networks in the epicardium, myocardium, and vasculature. Collectively, TH labeling is achievable in flat-mounts of thick cardiac walls, enabling detailed mapping of catecholaminergic axons and terminal structures in the whole heart at single-cell/axon/varicosity scale. This approach provides a foundation for future quantification of the topographical organization of the cardiac sympathetic innervation in different pathological conditions.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Grasping with a twist: Dissociating action goals from motor actions in human frontoparietal circuits</a></h4>

              
                In daily life, prehension is typically not the end goal of hand-object interactions but a precursor for manipulation. Nevertheless, functional MRI (fMRI) studies investigating manual manipulation have primarily relied on prehension as the end goal of an action. Here, we used slow event-related fMRI to investigate differences in neural activation patterns between prehension in isolation and prehension for object manipulation. Eighteen participants were instructed either to simply grasp the handle of a rotatable dial (isolated prehension) or to grasp and turn it (prehension for object manipulation). We used representational similarity analysis to investigate whether the experimental conditions could be discriminated from each other based on differences in task-related brain activation patterns. We also used temporal multivoxel pattern analysis to examine the evolution of regional activation patterns over time. Importantly, we were able to differentiate isolated prehension and prehension for manipulation from activation patterns in the early visual cortex, the caudal intraparietal sulcus, and the superior parietal lobule. Our findings indicate that object manipulation extends beyond the putative cortical grasping network (anterior intraparietal sulcus, premotor and motor cortices) to include the superior parietal lobule and early visual cortex.

Significance statementA simple act such as turning an oven dial requires not only that the central nervous system encode the initial state (starting dial orientation) of the object but also the appropriate posture to grasp it in order to achieve the desired end state (final dial orientation) and the motor commands to achieve that state. Using advanced temporal neuroimaging analysis techniques, we reveal how such actions unfold over time and how they differ between object manipulation (turning a dial) vs. grasping alone. We find that a combination of brain areas implicated in visual processing and sensorimotor integration can distinguish between the complex and simple tasks during planning, with neural patterns that approximate those during the actual execution of the action.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Auditory and Reward Connectivity in Young and Older Adults During Music Listening and Rest</a></h4>

              
                The intrinsic organization of functional brain networks is known to change with age, and is affected by perceptual input and task conditions. Here, we compare functional activity and connectivity during music listening and rest between young (N=24) and older (N=24) adults, using whole brain regression, seed-based connectivity, and ROI-ROI connectivity analyses. We found that although auditory and reward regions follow expected patterns of activation in response to music listening across both groups, younger adults show higher within-network connectivity of auditory and reward regions as compared to older adults during both rest and music listening. We also show that this age-related difference was reduced during music listening, especially in individuals showing high self-reported musical reward. Furthermore, young adults showed higher connectivity between auditory network and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) that was specific to music listening and varied as a function of liking ratings. Meanwhile, older adults showed a more globally diffuse pattern of connectivity, including higher connectivity to bilateral lingual and inferior frontal gyri. Finally, connectivity between auditory and reward regions was higher during well-liked musical stimuli across all participants, and especially higher when listening to music selected by the participant. These results highlight the roles of aging and reward sensitivity on auditory and reward networks. Results may inform the design of music-based interventions in aging populations, and improve our understanding of functional network dynamics as a whole.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural Synchronization as a Function of Engagement with the Narrative</a></h4>

              
                We can all agree that a good story engages us, however, agreeing which story is good is far more debatable. In this study, we explored whether engagement with a narrative synchronizes listeners' brain responses, by examining individual differences in engagement to the same story. To do so, we pre-registered and re-analyzed a previously collected dataset by Chang et al. (2021) of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scans of 25 participants who listened to a one-hour story and answered questionnaires. We assessed the degree of their overall engagement with the story and their engagement with the main characters. The questionnaires revealed individual differences in engagement with the story, as well as different valence towards specific characters. Neuroimaging data showed that the auditory cortex, the default mode network (DMN) and language regions were involved in processing the story. Increased engagement with the story was correlated with increased neural synchronization within regions in the DMN (especially the medial prefrontal cortex), as well as regions outside the DMN such as the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex and the reward system. Interestingly, positively and negatively engaging characters elicited different patterns of neural synchronization. Finally, engagement increased functional connectivity within and between the DMN, the dorsal attention network and the control network. Taken together, these findings suggest that engagement with a narrative synchronizes listeners' responses in regions involved in mentalizing, reward, working memory and attention. By examining individual differences in engagement, we revealed that these synchronization patterns are due to engagement, and not due to differences in the narrative's content.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Learning Cortical Hierarchies with Temporal Hebbian Updates.</a></h4>

              
                A key driver of mammalian intelligence is the ability to represent incoming sensory information across multiple abstraction levels. For example, in the visual ventral stream, incoming signals are first represented as low-level edge filters and then transformed into high-level object representations. These same hierarchical structures routinely emerge in artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained for image/object recognition tasks, suggesting that a similar process might underlie biological neural networks. However, the classical ANN training algorithm, backpropagation, is considered biologically implausible, and thus several alternative biologically plausible methods have been developed. For instance, several cortical-inspired ANNs in which the apical dendrite of a pyramidal neuron encodes top-down prediction signals have been proposed. In this case, akin to theories of predictive coding, a prediction error can be calculated locally inside each neuron for updating its incoming weights. Notwithstanding, from a neuroscience perspective, it is unclear whether neurons could compare their apical vs. somatic spiking activities to compute prediction errors. Here, we propose a solution to this problem by adapting the framework of the apical-somatic prediction error to the temporal domain. In particular, we show that if the apical feedback signal changes the postsynaptic firing rate, we can use differential Hebbian updates, a rate-based version of the classical spiking time-dependent plasticity (STDP) updates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a cortical-like deep ANN has been trained using such time-based learning rules. Overall, our work removes a key requirement of biologically plausible models for deep learning that does not align with plasticity rules observed in biology and proposes a learning mechanism that would explain how the timing of neuronal activity can allow supervised hierarchical learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Both GEF domains of the autism and epilepsy-associated Trio protein are required for proper tangential migration of GABAergic interneurons</a></h4>

              
                Recessive mutations in the TRIO gene are associated with intellectual deficiency (ID), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and developmental epileptic encephalopathies (DEE). TRIO is a dual guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that activates Rac1, Cdc42 and RhoA. Trio has been extensively studied in excitatory neurons, and has recently been found to regulate the switch from tangential to radial migration in GABAergic interneurons (INs), through GEFD1-Rac1-dependent SDF1/CXCR4 signalling. Given the central role of Rho-GTPases during neuronal migration and the implication of IN pathologies in ASD and DEE, we investigated the relative roles of both Trios GEF domains in regulating the dynamics of INs tangential migration. In Trio-/- mice, we observed reduced numbers of tangentially migrating INs, with intact progenitor proliferation. Further, we noted increased growth cone collapse in developing INs, suggesting altered cytoskeleton dynamics. To bypass the embryonic mortality of Trio-/- mice, we generated Dlx5/6Cre;Trioc/c conditional mutant mice, which develop spontaneous seizures and behavioral deficits reminiscent of ASD and ID. These phenotypes are associated with reduced cortical IN density and functional cortical inhibition. Mechanistically, this reduction of cortical IN numbers reflects a premature switch to radial migration, with an aberrant early entry in the cortical plate, as well as major deficits in cytoskeletal dynamics, including enhanced leading neurite branching and slower nucleokinesis reflecting reduced actin filament condensation and turnover. Further, we show that both Trio GEFD1 and GEFD2 domains are required for proper IN migration, with a dominant role of the RhoA-activating GEFD2 domain. Altogether, our data show a critical role of the DEE/ASD-associated Trio gene in the establishment of cortical inhibition and the requirement of both GEF domains in regulating IN migration dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Incorporating models of subcortical processing improves the ability to predict EEG responses to natural speech</a></h4>

              
                The goal of describing how the human brain responds to complex acoustic stimuli has driven auditory neuroscience research for decades. Often, a systems-based approach has been taken, in which neurophysiological responses are modeled based on features of the presented stimulus. This includes a wealth of work modeling electroencephalogram (EEG) responses to complex acoustic stimuli such as speech. Examples of the acoustic features used in such modeling include the amplitude envelope and spectrogram of speech. These models implicitly assume a direct mapping from stimulus representation to cortical activity. However, in reality, the representation of sound is transformed as it passes through early stages of the auditory pathway, such that inputs to the cortex are fundamentally different from the raw audio signal that was presented. Thus, it could be valuable to account for the transformations taking place in lower-order auditory areas, such as the auditory nerve, cochlear nucleus, and inferior colliculus (IC) when predicting cortical responses to complex sounds. Specifically, because IC responses are more similar to cortical inputs than acoustic features derived directly from the audio signal, we hypothesized that linear mappings (temporal response functions; TRFs) fit to the outputs of an IC model would better predict EEG responses to speech stimuli. To this end, we modeled responses to the acoustic stimuli as they passed through the auditory nerve, cochlear nucleus, and inferior colliculus before fitting a TRF to the output of the modeled IC responses. Results showed that using model-IC responses in traditional systems analyses resulted in better predictions of EEG activity than using the envelope or spectrogram of a speech stimulus. Further, it was revealed that model-IC derived TRFs predict different aspects of the EEG than acoustic-feature TRFs, and combining both types of TRF models provides a more accurate prediction of the EEG response.

                The immediate molecular consequences of traumatic brain injuries or TBI are poorly understood. Here, we simulated TBI using an innovative laboratory apparatus that employs a 5.1 kg dummy head holding neuronal cells and generating a [&le;]4,000 g-force acceleration upon impact. Dynamic impact led to both reduction in neuron viability and massive solubility changes in the proteome profiled using Proteome Integral Solubility Alteration (PISA) assay. The affected proteins mapped not only to the expected pathways like cell adhesion, collagen and laminin structures, as well as response to stress, but also to other dense protein networks, such as immune response, complement and coagulation cascades. The cellular effects are found to be mainly due to the shockwave rather than the g-force acceleration. Soft materials could reduce the impact severity only until being fully compressed. This study shows way to develop a proteome-based meter for measuring irreversible shockwave-induced cell damage and provides a resource for identifying TBI protein biomarkers and potential drug targets for developing products aiming at primary prevention and intervention.

                Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is the leading cause of non-genetic intellectual disabilities in the Western world and is responsible of a wide spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders referred to as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Structural and functional deficits in brain connectivity have been reported in FASD patients; still, whether and how PAE affects the axonal development of neurons and disrupts the wiring between brain regions is not known. Here, we developed a mouse model of moderate alcohol exposure during prenatal brain wiring to study the impact of PAE on corpus callosum (CC) development, a major white matter tract reported to be affected in FASD patients. Our results show that PAE induces aberrant navigation of interhemispheric CC axons that persist even after the end of the exposure, causing their ectopic termination in the contralateral cortex. Furthermore, these defects in interhemispheric connectivity persist into adulthood and are associated with defective bilateral sensorimotor coordination in behavioral tasks requiring cortical control and interhemispheric communication. Finally, we identified neuronal miR-17-5p and its target Ephrin type A receptor 4 (EphA4) as mediators of the effect of alcohol on the contralateral targeting of CC axons. Taken together, our results suggest that alteration of miRNA-mediated regulation of axon guidance signaling by prenatal alcohol exposure affects interhemispheric cortical connectivity and associated behavior in FASD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The formation of brain shape in human newborns</a></h4>

              
                The neonatal period represents a critical phase of human brain development. During this time, the brain shows a dramatic increase in size, but it remains largely unclear how the morphology of the human brain develops in early post-partum life. Here we show that human newborns undergo a rapid formation of brain shape, beyond the expected growth in brain size. Using fractal analysis of structural neuroimaging data, we show that brain shape (i) strongly reflects infant maturity beyond differences in brain size, (ii) significantly outperforms brain size in predicting infant age at scan (mean error ~4 days), (iii) detects persistent alterations in prematurely born infants that are not captured by brain size, (iv) is consistently more sensitive to genetic similarity among neonates, and (v) is superior in predicting which newborns are twin siblings, with up to 97% accuracy. These findings identify the formation of brain shape as a fundamental maturational process in human brain development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evaluating the neural underpinnings of motivation for walking exercise</a></h4>

              
                Background: Motivation is critically important for rehabilitation, exercise, and motor performance, but its neural basis is poorly understood. Recent correlational research suggests that superior frontal gyrus medial area 9 (SFG9m) may be involved in motivation for walking activity. This study experimentally evaluated brain activity changes in periods of additional motivation during walking exercise, and tested how these brain activity changes relate to self-reported exercise motivation and walking speed. Methods: Non-disabled adults (N=26; 65% female; 25 {+/-} 5 years old) performed a vigorous exercise experiment involving 20 trials of maximal speed overground walking. Half of the trials were randomized to include "extra motivation" stimuli (lap timer, tracked best lap time and verbal encouragement). Wearable near-infrared spectroscopy measured oxygenated hemoglobin responses ({Delta}HbO2) from frontal lobe regions, including the SFG9m, primary motor, dorsolateral prefrontal, anterior prefrontal, supplementary motor and dorsal premotor cortices. Results: Compared with standard trials, participants walked faster during "extra-motivation" trials (2.67 vs. 2.43 m/s; p<0.0001) and had higher {Delta}HbO2 in all tested brain regions. This extra motivation effect on {Delta}HbO2 was greatest for SFG9m (+703 uM) compared with other regions (+45 to +354 uM; p[&le;]0.04). Greater SFG9m activity was correlated with more self-determined motivation for exercise and faster walking speed. Conclusions: Simple motivational stimuli during walking exercise seem to upregulate widespread brain regions, especially SFG9m. This could help explain the positive effects of motivational feedback on gait outcomes observed in prior rehabilitation research. Thus, these findings provide a potential biologic basis for the benefits of motivational stimuli, elicited with clinically-feasible methods during walking exercise. Future clinical studies could build on this information to develop prognostic biomarkers and test novel brain stimulation targets for enhancing exercise motivation (e.g. SFG9m).

                Memory problems are common among older adults with a history of alcohol use disorder (AUD). Employing a machine learning framework, the current study investigates the use of multi-domain features to classify individuals with and without alcohol-induced memory problems. A group of 94 individuals (ages 50-81 years) with alcohol-induced memory problems (Memory group) were compared with a matched Control group who did not have memory problems. The Random Forests model identified specific features from each domain that contributed to the classification of Memory vs. Control group (AUC=88.29%). Specifically, individuals from the Memory group manifested a predominant pattern of hyperconnectivity across the default mode network regions except some connections involving anterior cingulate cortex which were predominantly hypoconnected. Other significant contributing features were (i) polygenic risk scores for AUD, (ii) alcohol consumption and related health consequences during the past 5 years, such as health problems, past negative experiences, withdrawal symptoms, and the largest number of drinks in a day during the past 12 months, and (iii) elevated neuroticism and increased harm avoidance, and fewer positive "uplift" life events. At the neural systems level, hyperconnectivity across the default mode network regions, including the connections across the hippocampal hub regions, in individuals with memory problems may indicate dysregulation in neural information processing. Overall, the study outlines the importance of utilizing multidomain features, consisting of resting-state brain connectivity collected ~18 years ago, together with personality, life experiences, polygenic risk, and alcohol consumption and related consequences, to predict alcohol-related memory problems that arise in later life.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Garments that measure EEG: Evaluation of an EEG sensor layer fully implemented with smart textiles</a></h4>

              
                This paper presents the first garment capable of measuring EEG activity with accuracy comparable to state-of-the art dry EEG systems. The main innovation is an EEG sensor layer (i.e., the electrodes, the signal transmission, and the cap support) fully implemented as a garment, using threads, fabrics and smart textiles, without relying on any metal or plastic materials. The garment is interfaced via a connector to a mobile EEG amplifier to complete the measurement system. The new EEG system (Garment-EEG) has been characterized with respect to a state-of-the-art Ag/AgCl dry-EEG system (Dry-EEG) over the forehead area of healthy participants in terms of: (1) skin-electrode impedance; (2) electrophysiological measurements (spontaneous and evoked EEG activity); (3) artifacts; and (4) user ergonomics and comfort. The results show that the Garment-EEG system provides comparable recordings to Dry-EEG, but it is more prone to getting affected by artifacts in adverse recording conditions due to poorer contact impedances. Ergonomics and comfort favor the textile-based sensor layer with respect to its metal-based counterpart. User acceptance is the main obstacle for EEG systems to democratize neurotechnology and non-invasive brain-computer interfaces. EEG sensor layers encapsulated in wearables have the potential to enable neurotechnology that is naturally accepted by people in their daily lives. Furthermore, by supporting the EEG implementation in the textile industry it is manufactured with lower cost and much less pollution compared to the metal and plastic industries.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Autophagy collaborates with apoptosis pathways to control myelination specificity and function</a></h4>

              
                Oligodendrocytes are the sole myelin producing cells in the central nervous system. Oligodendrocyte numbers are tightly controlled across diverse brain regions to match local axon type and number, but the underlying mechanisms and functional significance remain unclear. Here, we show that autophagy, an evolutionarily conserved cellular process that promotes cell survival under canonical settings, elicits premyelinating oligodendrocyte apoptosis during development and regulates critical aspects of nerve pulse propagation. Autophagy flux is increased in premyelinating oligodendrocytes, and its genetic blockage causes ectopic oligodendrocyte survival throughout the entire brain. Autophagy acts in the TFEB-Bax/Bak pathway and elevates PUMA mRNA levels to trigger premyelinating oligodendrocyte apoptosis cell-autonomously. Autophagy continuously functions in the myelinating oligodendrocytes to limit myelin sheath numbers and fine-tune nerve pulse propagation. Our results provide in vivo evidence showing that autophagy promotes apoptosis in mammalian cells under physiological conditions and reveal key intrinsic mechanisms governing oligodendrocyte number.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The (Limited?) Utility of Brain Age as a Biomarker for Capturing Cognitive Decline</a></h4>

              
                For decades, neuroscientists have been on a quest to search for a biomarker that can help capture age-related cognitive decline. One well-known candidate is Brain Age, or a predicted value based on machine-learning models built to predict chronological age from brain MRI data. Here we aim to formally evaluate the utility of Brain Age as a biomarker for capturing cognitive decline. Using 504 aging participants (36-100 years old) from the Human Connectome Project in Aging, we created 26 age-prediction models for Brain Age based on different combinations of MRI modalities. We first tested how much Brain Age from these age-prediction models added to what we had already known from a chronological age in capturing cognitive decline. Based on the commonality analyses, we found a large degree of overlap between Brain Age and chronological age, so much so that, at best, Brain Age could uniquely add only around 1.6% in explaining the variation in cognitive decline. Next, the age-prediction models that performed better at predicting chronological age did not necessarily create better Brain Age for capturing cognitive decline beyond chronological age. Instead, better-performing age-prediction models created Brain Age that overlapped larger with chronological age, up to around 29% out of 32%, in explaining cognitive decline. Lastly, unlike Brain Age, Brain Cognition, or a predicted value based on machine-learning models built to predict cognitive abilities from brain MRI data, provided much higher unique effects. Brain Cognition added over 11% to explain the variation in cognitive decline beyond chronological age, leading to around a 1/3-time improvement of the total variation explained. Accordingly, while demonstrating the limited utility of Brain Age, we provided a solution to improve our ability to use brain MRI data as a biomarker for cognitive decline.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Population-level neural correlates of flexible avoidance learning in medial prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been proposed to link sensory inputs and behavioral outputs to mediate the execution of learned behaviors. However, how such a link is implemented has remained unclear. To measure prefrontal neural correlates of sensory stimuli and learned behaviors, we performed population calcium imaging during a novel tone-signaled active avoidance paradigm in mice. We developed a novel analysis approach based on dimensionality reduction and decoding that allowed us to identify and isolate population activity patterns related the tone stimulus, learned avoidance actions and general motion. While tone-related activity was not informative about behavior, avoidance-related activity was predictive of upcoming avoidance actions. Moreover, avoidance-related activity distinguished between two different learned avoidance actions, consistent with a model in which mPFC contributes to the selection between different goal-directed actions. Overall, our results suggest that mPFC circuit dynamics transform sensory inputs into specific behavioral outputs through distributed population-level computations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Induced Alpha And Beta Electroencephalographic Rhythms Covary With Single-Trial Speech Intelligibility In Competition</a></h4>

              
                Neurophysiological studies suggest that intrinsic brain oscillations influence sensory processing, especially of rhythmic stimuli like speech. Prior work suggests that brain rhythms may mediate perceptual grouping and selective attention to speech amidst competing sound, as well as more linguistic aspects of speech processing like predictive coding. However, we know of no prior studies that have directly tested, at the single-trial level, whether brain oscillations relate to speech-in-noise outcomes. Here, we combined electroencephalography while simultaneously measuring intelligibility of spoken sentences amidst two different interfering sounds: multi-talker babble or speech-shaped noise. We find that induced parieto-occipital alpha (7-15 Hz; thought to modulate attentional focus) and frontal beta (13-30 Hz; associated with speech-motor predictive coding) oscillations covary with trial-wise percent-correct scores; importantly, alpha and beta power provide significant independent contributions to predicting single-trial behavioral outcomes. Moreover, we observed large individual differences in the across-trial distribution of alpha and beta power as well as in the alpha-to-beta power ratio. This raises the possibility that listeners employed different task strategies: some may have relied heavily on focusing attention, while others on predictive coding. These results can inform models of speech processing and guide noninvasive measures to index different neural processes that together support complex listening.

	<p>Objective: To explore the characteristics and dynamic evolution of cognitive impairment in patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). Methods: Twenty-five patients with acute NMOSD and 30 age-matched healthy individuals were consecutively recruited in this study. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Chinese Version of Rey Auditory Vocabulary Learning Test (CRAVLT), Verbal Fluency Test (VFT), Digital Span Test (DST), Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task 3/2s version (PASAT-3/2), Rey&amp;amp;ndash;Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (ROCF) and Stroop Color and Word Test (CWT) were used to evaluate cognitive function. The correlations between cognitive function and serum aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) antibody titer were analyzed. Results: Sixty-four percent of patients with acute NMOSD had cognitive dysfunction. MoCA (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), CRAVLT-N7 (p = 0.004), CRAVLT-N8 (p = 0.011), ROCF-C (p = 0.005), ROCF-R (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), PASAT-3 (p = 0.013), PASAT-2 (p = 0.001) and CWT-A (p = 0.017) were significantly worse in patients with acute NMOSD than those in control group. During follow-up visits, significant differences of serum AQP-4 antibody titers were still noted in NMOSD patients (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), while no significant differences were found by MoCA. Conclusion: A high number of patients with acute NMOSD suffer from cognitive dysfunction. Serum AQP-4 antibody titers can decrease during disease remission, while obvious cognitive decline in these patients still exists.</p>

	<p>The objective of this meta-analysis was to present transparent data on the morphology of the pituitary gland (PG) using the available data in the literature. The main online medical databases, such as PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science, were searched to gather all relevant studies regarding PG morphology. The mean overall volume of the PG was found to be 597.23 mm3 (SE = 28.81). The mean overall height of the PG was established to be 5.64 mm (SE = 0.11). The mean overall length of the PG was found to be 9.98 mm (SE = 0.26). In the present study, the PG&amp;amp;rsquo;s overall morphology and morphometric features were analyzed. Our results showed that, on average, females from Asia have the highest volume of PG (706.69 mm3), and males from Europe have the lowest (456.42 mm3). These values are crucial to be aware of because they represent the normal average properties of the PG, which may be used as reference points when trying to diagnose potential pathologies of this gland. Furthermore, the present study&amp;amp;rsquo;s results prove how the PG&amp;amp;rsquo;s size decreases with age. The results of the present study may be helpful for physicians, especially surgeons, performing procedures on the PG.</p>

	<p>It is reasonable to assume that emotional processes are involved in creative tasks and the generation of creative ideas. In this pilot study, we investigate the emotional correlates in professional drummers during different degrees of creative music playing. Ten participants performed three tasks: repetitive rhythmic drum playing, pattern-based improvisation, and attention-intensive free improvisation, while their EEG activity was recorded. Arousal and valence levels were estimated from the EEG data at baseline and for the three tasks. Results show significantly increased levels of valence (i.e., increased prefrontal right alpha power compared to prefrontal left alpha power) during pattern-based and free improvisation relative to baseline, and significantly increased levels of valence during free improvisation relative to pattern-based improvisation. These results seem to indicate that positive emotion (characterized as increased valence) is associated with the creation of original ideas in drum playing and that the freer the creative process, the greater the positive effect. The implication of these results may be of particular relevance in the fields of music-based therapeutic interventions and music pedagogy.</p>

	<p>Objective: Anxiety symptoms are persistent in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), but the underlying neural substrates are still unclear. In the current study, we aimed to explore the underlying neural mechanisms in PD patients with anxiety symptoms. Methods: 42 PD-A patients, 41 PD patients without anxiety symptoms (PD-NA), and 40 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited in the present study. All the subjects performed 3.0T fMRI scans. The fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) analysis was used to investigate the alterations in neural activity among the three groups. A Pearson correlation analysis was performed between the altered fALFF value of the PD-A group and anxiety scores. Results: Compared with HCs, PD-A patients had higher fALFF values in the left cerebellum, cerebellum posterior lobe, bilateral temporal cortex, and brainstem and lower fALFF values in the bilateral inferior gyrus, bilateral basal ganglia areas, and left inferior parietal lobule. Moreover, between the two PD groups, PD-A patients showed higher fALFF values in the right precuneus and lower fALFF values in the bilateral inferior gyrus, bilateral basal ganglia areas, left inferior parietal lobule, and left occipital lobe. Furthermore, Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s correlation analysis demonstrated that the right precuneus and left caudate were correlated with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scores. Conclusion: Our study found that anxiety symptoms in PD patients may be related to alterations of neurological activities in multiple brain regions. Furthermore, these may be critical radiological biomarkers for PD-A patients. Therefore, these findings can improve our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying PD-A.</p>

	<p>These are the preliminary results of a 12-week non-randomized, open-label, non-inferiority study comparing the effectiveness of trazodone in an extended-release formulation (XR) versus SSRIs in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Participants (n = 76) were recruited, and 42 were assigned to the trazodone XR group and 34 to the SSRIs group. The choice of drug was based on clinical presentation and relied upon the attending physician. Assessments were made at five observation time points, at the following weeks: 0, and after 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. The evaluations included: symptoms of depression (MADRS, QIDS-clinician, and self-rated versions-primary study endpoints), anhedonia (SHAPS), anxiety (HAM-A), insomnia (AIS), psychosocial functioning (SDS), and therapeutic efficacy (CGI). At baseline, the trazodone group had significantly more severe depressive, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms and worse psychosocial functioning compared to the SSRIs group. After 12 weeks, trazodone XR was more effective than SSRIs in reducing the severity of insomnia and depression. There were no differences between the groups in the frequencies of therapeutic response and remission, which indicated the non-inferiority of the trazodone XR treatment. In conclusion, our results showed that in a &amp;amp;ldquo;real world&amp;amp;rdquo; setting, trazodone XR is effective in the treatment of patients with MDD.</p>

                Krämer et al. report a population of human "liver-type" innate lymphocytes that differs from other previously characterized cells. They are expanded in cirrhotic livers and can be generated from precursors in co-culture with liver endothelial cells. Cells with similar properties can also be found in tonsil or intestinal tissue.

	<p>(1) Background: We investigated the differences in the neuropsychological profile as well as the pneumological and motor functions in two groups of patients admitted to rehabilitation who received different respiratory support during their COVID-19 infection. (2) Methods: Group-1 (n = 18; 15 male, median age 67.5) consisted of patients who received non-invasive mechanical ventilation; Group-2 (n = 19; 16 male, median age 63) consisted of patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation. All patients underwent a neuropsychological assessment including Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), and the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (R-BANS) to evaluate the patients&amp;amp;rsquo; cognition. Depression and anxiety were also measured at admission and discharge to rehabilitation. (3) Results: At admission, patients impaired at MMSE were 44% in Group-1 and 5% in Group-2, while patients impaired at FAB were 88% in Group-1 and 26% in Group-2. Wilcoxon&amp;amp;rsquo;s effect size revealed meaningful differences between groups for FAB, R-BANS global score, immediate and delayed memory, and attention-coding task, with Group-2 performing better than Group-1 across all measures. At discharge, 52% of the 25 patients re-assessed still had mild to moderate cognitive deficits, while 19% had depression and 35% had anxiety. (4) Conclusions: Patients who received oxygen therapy experienced higher levels of acute and chronic stress compared to those who benefitted from invasive mechanical ventilation. Despite patients showing a meaningful improvement at discharge, cognitive impairment persisted in a great number of patients; therefore, long-term neuropsychological follow-up and treatment for COVID-19 patients are recommended.</p>

	<p>GGC repeat expansions in the 5&amp;amp;rsquo; untranslated region (5&amp;amp;rsquo;UTR) of the Notch Homolog 2 N-terminal-like C gene (NOTCH2NLC) have been reported to be the genetic cause of neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID). However, whether they exist in other neurodegenerative disorders remains unclear. To determine whether there is a medium-length amplification of NOTCH2NLC in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we screened 476 ALS patients and 210 healthy controls for the presence of a GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC by using repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction (RP-PCR) and fragment analysis. The repeat number in ALS patients was 16.11 &amp;amp;plusmn; 5.7 (range 7&amp;amp;ndash;46), whereas the repeat number in control subjects was 16.19 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.79 (range 10&amp;amp;ndash;29). An intermediate-length GGC repeat expansion was observed in two ALS patients (numbers of repeats: 45, 46; normal repeat number &amp;amp;le; 40) but not in the control group. The results suggested that the intermediate NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansion was associated with Chinese ALS patients, and further functional studies for intermediate-length variation are required to identify the mechanism.</p>

	<p>The aim of the present study was to examine the neurobiological correlates of the two negative symptom domains of schizophrenia, the Motivational Deficit domain (including avolition, anhedonia, and asociality) and the Expressive Deficit domain (including blunted affect and alogia), focusing on brain areas that are most commonly found to be associated with negative symptoms in previous literature. Resting-state (rs) fMRI data were analyzed in 62 subjects affected by schizophrenia (SZs) and 46 healthy controls (HCs). The SZs, compared to the HCs, showed higher rs brain activity in the right inferior parietal lobule and the right temporoparietal junction, and lower rs brain activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the bilateral anterior dorsal cingulate cortex, and the ventral and dorsal caudate. Furthermore, in the SZs, the rs brain activity in the left orbitofrontal cortex correlated with negative symptoms (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.436, p = 0.006), in particular with the Motivational Deficit domain (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.424, p = 0.002), even after controlling for confounding factors. The left ventral caudate correlated with negative symptoms (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.407, p = 0.003), especially with the Expressive Deficit domain (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.401, p = 0.003); however, these results seemed to be affected by confounding factors. In line with the literature, our results demonstrated that the two negative symptom domains might be underpinned by different neurobiological mechanisms.</p>

	<p>Prolactinomas have been reported to impair cognition in broad aspects. However, few studies investigated the influence of prolactinomas on cognitive flexibility never mentioning the underlying neural and electrophysiological mechanism. We recorded scalp electroencephalography (EEG) in a colour-shape switching task. Patients with prolactinomas showed longer reaction time in switch trials and larger switch costs relative to healthy controls (HCs). Compared to HCs who showed stronger frontal theta activity in switch trials, the generally weak frontal theta activity in patients implied that they could not afford the executive control to configure task sets. Meanwhile, machine-learning based classification revealed that patients manifested non-selective brain patterns in response to different task types (colour vs. shape task) and different task states (switch vs. repeat state), which collectively suggested the cognitive dysfunction in preparation for a changing environment. Compared to HCs who showed stronger frontoparietal synchronization in switch trials, this enhanced frontoparietal connectivity was disrupted among patients with severe prolactinomas. This finding implicated greater hyperprolactinemia was linked to a larger decrease in cognitive performance. Taken together, the present study highlighted frontal theta power, and frontoparietal connectivity at theta band as the electrophysiological markers of the impaired cognitive flexibility and task control in patients with prolactinomas.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to investigate the association between beta oscillations and brain iron deposition. Beta oscillations were filtered from the microelectrode recordings of local field potentials (LFP) in the subthalamic nucleus (STN), and the ratio of the power spectral density of beta oscillations (PSDXb) to that of the LFP signals was calculated. Iron deposition in the deep gray matter (DGM) structures was indirectly assessed using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). The Unified Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), part III, was used to assess the severity of symptoms. Spearman correlation coefficients were applied to assess the associations of PSDXb with QSM values in the DGM structures and the severity of symptoms. PSDXb showed a significant positive correlation with the average QSM values in DGM structures, including caudate and substantia nigra (SN) (p = 0.008 and 0.044). Similarly, the PSDXb showed significant negative correlations with the severity of symptoms, including axial symptoms and the gait in the medicine-off state (p = 0.006 for both). The abnormal iron metabolism in the SN and striatum pathways may be one of the underlying mechanisms for the occurrence of abnormal beta oscillations in the STN, and beta oscillations may serve as important pathophysiological biomarkers of PD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Longitudinal synaptic density PET with 11C‐UCB‐J 6 months after ischemic stroke</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To explore longitudinal changes in synaptic density after ischemic stroke in vivo with synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) PET.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We recruited patients with an ischemic stroke to undergo <sup>11</sup>C-UCB-J PET/MR within the first month and 6 months after stroke. We investigated longitudinal changes of partial volume corrected <sup>11</sup>C-UCB-J SUVR (standardized uptake value ratio; relative to centrum semiovale) within the ischemic lesion, peri-ischemic area and unaffected ipsilesional and contralesional grey matter. We also explored crossed cerebellar diaschisis at 6 months. Additionally, we defined brain regions potentially influencing upper limb motor recovery after stroke and studied <sup>11</sup>C-UCB-J SUVR evolution in comparison to baseline.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In 13 patients (age = 67±15 years) we observed decreasing <sup>11</sup>C-UCB-J SUVR in the ischemic lesion (ΔSUVR = -1.0, p=0.001) and peri-ischemic area (ΔSUVR = -0.31, p=0.02) at 6 months after stroke compared to baseline. Crossed cerebellar diaschisis as measured with <sup>11</sup>C-UCB-J SUVR was present in 11/13 (85%) patients at 6 months. <sup>11</sup>C-UCB-J SUVR did not augment in ipsilesional or contralesional brain regions associated with motor recovery. On the contrary, there was an overall trend of declining <sup>11</sup>C-UCB-J SUVR in these brain regions, reaching statistical significance only in the non-lesioned part of the ipsilesional supplementary motor area (ΔSUVR = -0.83, p=0.046).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>At 6 months after stroke, synaptic density further declined in the ischemic lesion and peri-ischemic area compared to baseline. Brain regions previously demonstrated to be associated with motor recovery after stroke did not show increases in synaptic density.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">The role of ascending ventral‐tegmental fibers for recovery after stroke</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>The integrity of cortical motor networks and their descending effector-pathway (the corticospinal tract; CST) is a major determinant motor recovery after stroke. However, this view neglects the importance of ascending tracts and their modulatory effects on cortical physiology. Here, we explore the role of such a tract that connects dopaminergic ventral tegmental midbrain nuclei to motor cortex (the VTMC-tract) for post-stroke recovery.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Lesion data and diffusivity parameters (fractional anisotropy) of the ipsi- and contralesional VTMC-tract and CST were obtained from 133 patients (63.9±13.4 years, 45 female) during acute and chronic stage after first-ever ischemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery territory. Degeneration of VTMC-tract and CST was quantified and related to clinical outcome parameters (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] with motor and cortical-symptom subscores; modified Fugl-Meyer upper extremity score [mFMMS]; modified Ranking Scale [mRS]).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A significant post-stroke degeneration occurred in both tracts, but only VTMC-degeneration was associated with lesion size. Using multiple regression models, we dissected the impact of particular tracts on recovery: Changes in VTMC-tract integrity were stronger associated with independence in daily activities (mRS), upper limb motor impairment (mFMMS) and cortical symptoms (aphasia, neglect) captured by NIHSS compared to CST. Changes in CST-integrity merely were associated with the degree of hemiparesis (NIHSS motor subscale).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Post-stroke outcome is influenced by ascending (VTMC) and descending (CST) fiber tracts. Favourable outcome regarding independence (mRS), upper limb motor function (mFMMS) and cortical symptoms (aphasia, neglect) was stronger related to the ascending than descending tract.</p>

                DNA repair via non-homologous end joining is regulated by poorly understood accessory factors. De Bragança et al. find that APLF promotes the stable joining of DNA ends by Ku70-Ku80, further reinforced by long non-coding RNA NIHCOLE. They propose that Ku70-Ku80 simultaneously binds DNA ends, APLF, and lncRNAs to strengthen DNA synapsis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Traumatic brain injury induced microglial and Caspase3 activation in the retina</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is among the main causes of sudden death after head trauma. These injuries can result in severe degeneration and neuronal cell death in the CNS, including the retina which is a crucial part of the brain responsible for perceiving and transmitting visual information. The long-term effects of mild-repetitive TBI (rmTBI) are far less studied thus far, even though damages induced by repetitive injuries occurring in the brain are more common, especially amongst athletes. rmTBI can also have a detrimental effect on the retina and the pathophysiology of these injuries are likely to differ from the severe TBI (sTBI) retinal injury.

Here we showed how rmTBI and sTBI can dissimilarly affect the retina. Our results indicate an increase in the number of activated microglial cells and Caspase3-positive cells in the retina in both traumatic models, suggesting a rise in the level of inflammation and cell death after TBI. The pattern of microglial activation appears evenly distributed and widespread but differs amongst the various retinal layers. sTBI induced microgial activation in both the superficial and deep retinal layers. In contrast to sTBI, no significant change occurred following the repetitive mild injury in the superficial layer, only the deep layer (spanning from the inner nuclear layer to the outer plexiform layer) shows microglial activation. This difference suggests that alternate response mechanisms play a role in the case of the different TBI incidents. The Caspase3 activation pattern showed a uniform increase in both the superficial and deep layers of the retina. This suggests a different action in the course of the disease in sTBI and rmTBI models and points to the need for new diagnostic procedures. Our present results suggest that the retina might serve as such a model of head injuries since the retinal tissue reacts to both forms of TBI and is the most accessible part of the human brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">CLIP-Seq Analysis Enables the Design of Ribosomal RNA Bait Oligonucleotides That Protect Against C9orf72 ALS/FTD-Associated Poly-GR Pathophysiology</a></h4>

              
                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia patients with a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9ORF72 (C9-HRE) accumulate poly-GR and poly-PR aggregates. The pathogenicity of these arginine-rich dipeptide repeats (R-DPRs) is thought to be driven by their propensity to bind to low complexity domains of multivalent proteins. However, the ability of R-DPRs to bind native RNA and the significance of this interaction remains unclear. We used computational and experimental approaches to characterize the physicochemical properties of R-DPRs and their interaction with RNA. We find that poly-GR predominantly binds ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in cells and exhibits an interaction that is predicted to be energetically stronger than that for associated ribosomal proteins. Critically, modified rRNA "bait" oligonucleotides restore poly-GR-associated ribosomal deficits in cells and ameliorate poly-GR toxicity in patient neurons and Drosophila models. Our work strengthens the hypothesis that ribosomal function is impaired by R-DPRs, highlights a role for direct rRNA binding in mediating ribosomal disfunction, and presents a strategy for protecting against C9-HRE pathophysiological mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A newly-recognized population of residual neural crest cells in the adult leptomeninges is re-activated for vascular repair</a></h4>

              
                The neural crest (NC) is a transient structure in vertebrate embryogenesis comprising highly migratory multipotent stem cells that give rise to a diverse array of cell types in organs throughout the body, including initiating neurovascular patterning. It is assumed that neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) disappear after development. Unexpectedly, using single-nucleus RNA-sequencing, we discovered residual quiescent NCSCs in the adult mouse meninges which are activated by injury and contribute to the brains homeostatic response. RNA velocity, pathway, and transcription factor analyses in a murine stroke model (combined with in vivo imaging) show that these adult NCSCs migrate towards the perivascular spaces of the infarct and undergo a perivascular stromal cell transition that is regulated by Ptp1b, Ghr, and Stat3. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments show that these "vestigial" NCSCs are required for restoring vascular endothelial barrier function via {beta}-catenin and Stat3 signaling. These findings suggest that, in the adult, an unexpected reservoir of cells -- once pivotal to embryogenesis and vascular morphogenesis -- are re-invoked for neurovascular repair.
