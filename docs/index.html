              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Hippocampal dentate gyrus integrity revealed with ultrahigh resolution diffusion imaging predicts memory performance in older adults</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy is a core feature of age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD). While regional volumes and thickness are often used as a proxy for neurodegeneration, they lack the sensitivity to serve as an accurate diagnostic test and indicate advanced neurodegeneration. Here, we used a submillimeter resolution diffusion weighted MRI sequence (ZOOMit) to quantify microstructural properties of hippocampal subfields in older adults (63–98 years old) using tensor derived measures: fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). We demonstrate that the high-resolution sequence, and not a standard resolution sequence, identifies dissociable profiles for CA1, dentate gyrus (DG), and the collateral sulcus. Using ZOOMit, we show that advanced age is associated with increased MD of the CA1 and DG as well as decreased FA of the DG. Increased MD of the DG, reflecting decreased cellular density, mediated the relationship between age and word list recall. Further, increased MD in the DG, but not DG volume, was linked to worse spatial pattern separation. Our results demonstrate that ultrahigh-resolution diffusion imaging enables the detection of microstructural differences in hippocampal subfield integrity and will lead to novel insights into the mechanisms of age-related memory loss.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">The fibro‐ and cyto‐architecture demarcating the border between the dentate gyrus and CA3 in sheep (Ovis aries) and domestic pig (Sus scrofa domesticus)</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampal formation is essential for spatial navigation and episodic memory. The anatomical structure is largely similar across mammalian species, apart from the deep polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus and the adjacent part of cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) which feature substantial variations. In rodents, the polymorphic layer has a triangular cross-section abutting on the end of the CA3 pyramidal layer, while in primates it is long and band-shaped capping the expanded CA3 end, which here lacks a distinct pyramidal layer. This structural variation has resulted in a confusing nomenclature and unclear anatomical criteria for the definition of the dentate-ammonic border. Seeking to clarify the border, we present here a light microscopic investigation based on Golgi-impregnated and Timm–thionin-stained sections of the Artiodactyla sheep and domestic pig, in which the dentate gyrus and CA3 end have some topographical features in common with primates. In short, the band-shaped polymorphic layer coincides with the Timm-positive mossy fiber collateral plexus and the Timm-negative subgranular zone. While the soma and excrescence-covered proximal dendrites of the mossy cells are localized within the plexus, the peripheral mossy cell dendrites extend outside the plexus, both into the granular and molecular layers, and the CA3. The main mossy fibers leave the collateral plexus in a scattered formation to converge gradually through the CA3 end in between the dispersed pyramidal cells, which are of three subtypes, as in monkey, with the classical apical subtype dominating near the hidden blade, the nonapical subtype near the exposed blade, and the dentate subtype being the only pyramidal cells that extend dendrites into the dentate gyrus. In agreement with our previous study in mink, the findings show that the border between the dentate gyrus and the CA3 end can be more accurately localized by the mossy fiber system than by cyto-architecture alone.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Learning shifts the preferred theta phase of gamma oscillations in CA1</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Hippocampal neuronal oscillations reflect different cognitive processes and can therefore be used to dissect the role of hippocampal subfields in learning and memory. In particular, it has been suggested that encoding and retrieval is associated with slow gamma (25–55 Hz) and fast gamma (60–100 Hz) oscillations, respectively, which appear in a nested manner at specific phases of the ongoing theta oscillations (4–12 Hz). However, the relationship between memory demand and the theta phase of gamma oscillations remains unclear. Here, we assessed the theta phase preference of gamma oscillations in the CA1 region, at the starting and junction zones of a T-maze, while rats were learning an appetitive task. We found that the theta phase preference of slow gamma showed a ~180° phase shift when animals switched from novice to skilled performance during task acquisition. This phase-shift was not present at the junction zone, where animals chose a right or left turn within the T-maze, suggesting that a recall/decision process had already taken place at the starting zone. Our findings indicate that slow gamma oscillations support both encoding and retrieval, depending on the theta phase at which they occur. These properties are particularly evident prior to cognitive engagement in an acquired spatial task.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Assessing mild cognitive impairment using object‐location memory in immersive virtual environments</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Pathological changes in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) are found in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and aging. The earliest pathological accumulation of tau colocalizes with the areas of the MTL involved in object processing as part of a wider anterolateral network. Here, we sought to assess the diagnostic potential of memory for object locations in iVR environments in individuals at high risk of AD dementia (amnestic mild cognitive impairment [aMCI] <i>n</i> = 23) as compared to age-related cognitive decline. Consistent with our primary hypothesis that early AD would be associated with impaired object location, aMCI patients exhibited impaired spatial feature binding. Compared to both older (<i>n</i> = 24) and younger (<i>n</i> = 53) controls, aMCI patients, recalled object locations with significantly less accuracy (<i>p</i> &lt; .001), with a trend toward an impaired identification of the object's correct context (<i>p</i> = .05). Importantly, these findings were not explained by deficits in object recognition (<i>p</i> = .6). These deficits differentiated aMCI from controls with greater accuracy (AUC = 0.89) than the standard neuropsychological tests. Within the aMCI group, 16 had CSF biomarkers indicative of their likely AD status (MCI+ <i>n</i> = 9 vs. MCI− <i>n</i> = 7). MCI+ showed lower accuracy in the object-context association than MCI− (<i>p</i> = .03) suggesting a selective deficit in object-context binding postulated to be associated with anterior-temporal areas. MRI volumetric analysis across healthy older participants and aMCI revealed that test performance positively correlates with lateral entorhinal cortex volumes (<i>p</i> &lt; .05) and hippocampus volumes (<i>p</i> &lt; .01), consistent with their hypothesized role in binding contextual and spatial information with object identity. Our results indicate that tests relying on the anterolateral object processing stream, and in particular requiring successful binding of an object with spatial information, may aid detection of pre-dementia AD due to the underlying early spread of tau pathology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Prefrontal and hippocampal theta rhythm show anxiolytic‐like changes during periaqueductal‐elicited “panic” in rats</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Anxiety and panic are both elicited by threat and co-occur clinically. But, at the neural level, anxiety appears to inhibit the generation of panic; and vice versa. Anxiety and panic are thought to engage more anterior (a) and mid-posterior (m) parts of the periaqueductal gray (PAG), respectively. Anxiety also engages the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex. Here, we tested if mPAG but not aPAG stimulation would suppress prefrontal and hippocampal theta rhythm as do anxiolytic drugs. Twelve male rats with implanted electrodes were stimulated alternately (30 s interval) in the left PAG or right reticular formation (reticularis pontis oralis [RPO]—as a positive control) with recording in the left prelimbic cortex and left and right hippocampus. PAG stimulation was set to produce freezing and RPO to produce 7–8 Hz theta rhythm before tests lasting 10 min on each of 5 days. mPAG stimulation decreased, and aPAG increased, theta power at all sites during elicited freezing. mPAG, but not aPAG, stimulation decreased prefrontal theta frequency. Stimulation did not substantially change circuit dynamics (pairwise phase consistency and partial directed coherence). Together with previous reports, our data suggest that panic- and anxiety-control systems are mutually inhibitory, and neural separation of anxiety and panic extends down to the aPAG and mPAG, respectively. Our findings are consistent with recent proposals that fear and anxiety are controlled by parallel neural hierarchies extending from PAG to the prefrontal cortex.</p>

	<p>The auditory phantom sensation of tinnitus is associated with neural hyperactivity. Modulating this hyperactivity using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has shown beneficial effects in human studies. Previously, we investigated rTMS in a tinnitus animal model and showed that rTMS over prefrontal cortex (PFC) attenuated tinnitus soon after treatment, likely via indirect effects on auditory pathways. Here, we explored the duration of these beneficial effects. Acoustic trauma was used to induce hearing loss and tinnitus in guinea pigs. Once tinnitus developed, high-frequency (20 Hz), high-intensity rTMS was applied over PFC for two weeks (weekdays only; 10 min/day). Behavioral signs of tinnitus were monitored for 6 weeks after treatment ended. Tinnitus developed in 77% of animals between 13 and 60 days post-trauma. rTMS treatment significantly reduced the signs of tinnitus at 1 week on a group level, but individual responses varied greatly at week 2 until week 6. Three (33%) of the animals showed the attenuation of tinnitus for the full 6 weeks, 45% for 1&amp;amp;ndash;4 weeks and 22% were non-responders. This study provides further support for the efficacy of high-frequency repetitive stimulation over the PFC as a therapeutic tool for tinnitus, but also highlights individual variation observed in human studies.</p>

	<p>High-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) has been shown to play an important role in improving consciousness in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOCs), but its neuroelectrophysiological evidence is still lacking. To better explain the electrophysiological mechanisms of the effects of HD-tDCS on patients with DOCs, 22 DOC patients underwent 10 anodal HD-tDCS sessions of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). This study used the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) to assess the level of consciousness in DOC patients. According to whether the CRS-R score increased before and after stimulation, DOC patients were divided into a responsive group and a non-responsive group. By comparing the differences in resting-state EEG functional connectivity between different frequency bands and brain regions, as well as the relationship between functional connectivity values and clinical scores, the electrophysiological mechanism of the clinical effects of HD-tDCS was further explored. The change of the phase locking value (PLV) on the theta frequency band in the left frontal&amp;amp;ndash;parietooccipital region was positively correlated with the change in the CRS-R scores. As the number of interventions increased, we observed that in the responsive group, the change in PLV showed an upward trend, and the increase in the PLV appeared in the left frontal&amp;amp;ndash;parietooccipital region at 4&amp;amp;ndash;8 Hz and in the intra-bifrontal region at 8&amp;amp;ndash;13 Hz. In the non-responsive group, although the CRS-R scores did not change after stimulation, the PLV showed a downward trend, and the decrease in the PLV appeared in the intra-bifrontal region at 8&amp;amp;ndash;13 Hz. In addition, at the three-month follow-up, patients with increased PLV in the intra-bifrontal region at 8&amp;amp;ndash;13 Hz after repeated HD-tDCS stimulation had better outcomes than those without. Repeated anodal stimulation of the left DLPFC with HD-tDCS resulted in improved consciousness in some patients with DOCs. The increase in functional connectivity in the brain regions may be associated with the improvement of related awareness after HD-tDCS and may be a predictor of better long-term outcomes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Hybrid Offspring of C57BL/6J Mice Exhibit Improved Properties for Neurobehavioral Research</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>C57BL/6 is the most commonly used mouse strain in neurobehavioral research, serving as a background for multiple transgenic lines. However, C57BL/6 exhibit behavioral and sensorimotor disadvantages that worsen with age. We bred FVB/NJ females and C57BL/6J males to generate first-generation hybrid offspring (FVB/NJ x C57BL/6J)F1. The hybrid mice exhibit reduced anxiety-like behavior, improved learning, and enhanced long-term spatial memory. In contrast to both progenitors, hybrids maintain sensorimotor performance upon aging and exhibit improved long-term memory. The hybrids are larger than C57BL/6J, exhibiting enhanced running behavior on a linear track during freely-moving electrophysiological recordings. Hybrids exhibit typical rate and phase coding of space by CA1 pyramidal cells. Hybrids generated by crossing FVB/NJ females with transgenic males of a C57BL/6 background support optogenetic neuronal control in neocortex and hippocampus. The hybrid mice provide an improved model for neurobehavioral studies combining complex behavior, electrophysiology, and genetic tools readily available in C57BL/6 mice.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cannabinoid 1 and mu-Opioid Receptor Agonists Synergistically Inhibit Abdominal Pain and Lack Side Effects in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>While effective in treating abdominal pain, opioids have significant side effects. Recent legalization of cannabis will likely promote use of cannabinoids as an adjunct or alternative to opioids, despite a lack of evidence. We aimed to investigate whether cannabinoids inhibit mouse colonic nociception, alone or in combination with opioids at low doses. Experiments were performed on C57BL/6 male and female mice. Visceral nociception was evaluated by measuring visceromotor responses (VMR), afferent nerve mechanosensitivity in flat-sheet colon preparations, and excitability of isolated DRG neurons. Blood oxygen saturation, locomotion, and defecation were measured to evaluate side effects. An agonist of cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R), arachidonyl-2'-chloroethylamide (ACEA), dose-dependently decreased VMR. ACEA and HU-210 (another CB1R agonist) also attenuated colonic afferent nerve mechanosensitivity. Additionally, HU-210 concentration-dependently decreased DRG neuron excitability, which was reversed by the CB1R antagonist AM-251. Conversely, cannabinoid 2 receptor (CB2R) agonists did not attenuate VMR, afferent nerve mechanosensitivity, or DRG neuron excitability. Combination of subanalgesic doses of CB1R and &micro;-opioid receptor agonists decreased VMR; importantly, this analgesic effect was preserved after 6 d of twice daily treatment. This combination also attenuated afferent nerve mechanosensitivity and DRG neuron excitability, which was inhibited by neuronal nitric oxide synthase and guanylate cyclase inhibitors. This combination avoided side effects (decreased oxygen saturation and colonic transit) caused by analgesic dose of morphine. Activation of CB1R, but not CB2R, decreased colonic nociception both alone and in synergy with &micro;-opioid receptor. Thus, CB1R agonists may enable opioid dose reduction and avoid opioid-related side effects.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> One of the most cited needs for patients with abdominal pain are safe and effective treatment options. The effectiveness of opioids in the management of abdominal pain is undermined by severe adverse side effects. Therefore, strategies to replace opioids or reduce the doses of opioids to suppress abdominal pain is needed. This study in mice demonstrates that cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R) agonists inhibit visceral sensation. Furthermore, a combination of subanalgesic doses of &micro;-opioid receptor agonist and CB1R agonist markedly reduce abdominal pain without causing the side effects of high-dose opioids. Thus, CB1R agonists, alone or in combination with low-dose opioids, may be a novel and safe treatment strategy for abdominal pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">T-Type Ca2+ Channels Boost Neurotransmission in Mammalian Cone Photoreceptors</a></h4>

              
                <p>It is a commonly accepted view that light stimulation of mammalian photoreceptors causes a graded change in membrane potential instead of developing a spike. The presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels serve as a crucial link for the coding of membrane potential variations into neurotransmitter release. Ca<SUB>v</SUB>1.4 L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels are expressed in photoreceptor terminals, but the complete pool of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in cone photoreceptors appears to be more diverse. Here, we discovered, employing whole-cell patch-clamp recording from cone photoreceptor terminals in both sexes of mice, that their Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents are composed of low- (T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels) and high- (L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels) voltage-activated components. Furthermore, Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels exerted self-generated spike behavior in dark membrane potentials, and spikes were generated in response to light/dark transition. The application of fast and slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelators revealed that T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels are located close to the release machinery. Furthermore, capacitance measurements indicated that they are involved in evoked vesicle release. Additionally, RT-PCR experiments showed the presence of Ca<SUB>v</SUB>3.2 T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in cone photoreceptors but not in rod photoreceptors. Altogether, we found several crucial functions of T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, which increase the functional repertoire of cone photoreceptors. Namely, they extend cone photoreceptor light-responsive membrane potential range, amplify dark responses, generate spikes, increase intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, and boost synaptic transmission.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Photoreceptors provide the first synapse for coding light information. The key elements in synaptic transmission are the voltage-sensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Here, we provide evidence that mouse cone photoreceptors express low-voltage-activated Ca<SUB>v</SUB>3.2 T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in addition to high-voltage-activated L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. The presence of T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in cone photoreceptors appears to extend their light-responsive membrane potential range, amplify dark response, generate spikes, increase intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, and boost synaptic transmission. By these functions, Ca<SUB>v</SUB>3.2 T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels increase the functional repertoire of cone photoreceptors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">DYRK1A Regulates the Bidirectional Axonal Transport of APP in Human-Derived Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p><I>Dyrk1a</I> triplication in Down's syndrome and its overexpression in Alzheimer's disease suggest a role for increased DYRK1A activity in the abnormal metabolism of APP. Transport defects are early phenotypes in the progression of Alzheimer's disease, which lead to APP processing impairments. However, whether DYRK1A regulates the intracellular transport and delivery of APP in human neurons remains unknown. From a proteomic dataset of human cerebral organoids treated with harmine, a DYRK1A inhibitor, we found expression changes in protein clusters associated with the control of microtubule-based transport and in close interaction with the APP vesicle. Live imaging of APP axonal transport in human-derived neurons treated with harmine or overexpressing a dominant negative DYRK1A revealed a reduction in APP vesicle density and enhanced the stochastic behavior of retrograde vesicle transport. Moreover, harmine increased the fraction of slow segmental velocities and changed speed transitions supporting a DYRK1A-mediated effect in the exchange of active motor configuration. Contrarily, the overexpression of DYRK1A in human polarized neurons increased the axonal density of APP vesicles and enhanced the processivity of retrograde APP. In addition, increased DYRK1A activity induced faster retrograde segmental velocities together with significant changes in slow to fast anterograde and retrograde speed transitions, suggesting the facilitation of the active motor configuration. Our results highlight DYRK1A as a modulator of the axonal transport machinery driving APP intracellular distribution in neurons, and stress DYRK1A inhibition as a putative therapeutic intervention to restore APP axonal transport in Down's syndrome and Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Axonal transport defects are early events in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying transport defects remain elusive. <I>Dyrk1a</I> kinase is triplicated in Down's syndrome and overexpressed in Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that DYRK1A dysfunction affects molecular pathways leading to early-onset neurodegeneration. Here, we show by live imaging of human-derived neurons that DYRK1A activity differentially regulates the intracellular trafficking of APP. Further, single-particle analysis revealed DYRK1A as a modulator of axonal transport and the configuration of active motors within the APP vesicle. Our work highlights DYRK1A as a regulator of APP axonal transport and metabolism, supporting DYRK1A inhibition as a therapeutic strategy to restore intracellular dynamics in Alzheimer's disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">V1-Origin Bidirectional Plasticity in Visual Thalamo-Ventral Pathway and Its Contribution to Saliency Detection of Dynamic Visual Inputs</a></h4>

              
                <p>Visual neural plasticity and V1 saliency detection are vital for efficient coding of dynamically changing visual inputs. However, how does neural plasticity contribute to saliency detection of temporal statistically distributed visual stream remains unclear. Therefore, we adopted randomly presented but unevenly distributed stimuli with multiple orientations and examined the single-unit responses evoked by this biased orientation-adaptation protocol by single-unit recordings in the visual thalamo&ndash;ventral pathway of cats (of either sex). We found neuronal responses potentiated when the probability of biased orientation was slightly higher than other nonbiased ones and suppressed when the probability became much higher. This single neuronal short-term bidirectional plasticity is selectively induced by optimal stimuli but is interocularly transferable. It is inducible in LGN, Area 17, and Area 21a with distinct and hierarchically progressive patterns. With the results of latency analysis, receptive field structural test, cortical lesion, and simulations, we suggest this bidirectional plasticity may principally originate from the adaptation competition between excitatory and inhibitory components of V1 neuronal receptive field. In our simulation, above bidirectional plasticity could achieve saliency detection of dynamic visual inputs. These findings demonstrate a rapid probability dependent plasticity on the neural coding of visual stream and suggest its functional role in the efficient coding and saliency detection of dynamic environment.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Novel elements within a dynamic visual stream can pop up from the context, which is vital for rapid response to a dynamically changing world. Saliency detection is a promising bottom-up mechanism contributing to efficient selection of visual inputs, wherein visual adaptation also plays a significant role. However, the saliency detection of dynamic visual stream is poorly understood. Here, we found a novel form of visual short-term bidirectional plasticity in multistages of the visual system that contributes to saliency detection of dynamic visual inputs. This bidirectional plasticity may principally originate from the local balance of excitation inhibition in primary visual cortex and propagates to lower and higher visual areas with progressive pattern change. Our findings suggest the excitation-inhibition balance within the visual system contributes to visual efficient coding.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Monkey Prefrontal Single-Unit Activity Reflecting Category-Based Logical Thinking Process and Its Neural Network Model</a></h4>

              
                <p>Category-based thinking is a fundamental form of logical thinking. Here, we aimed to investigate its neural process at the local circuit level in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). We recorded single-unit PFC activity while male monkeys (<I>Macaca fuscata</I>) performed a task in which the category and rule were prerequisites of logical thinking and the outcome contingency was its consequence. Different groups of neurons coded a single type of information discretely or multiple types in a transitional form. Results of time-by-time analysis of neuronal activity suggest an information flow from category-coding and rule-coding neurons to transitional intermediate neurons, and then to contingency-coding neurons. Category-coding, rule-coding, and contingency-coding neurons showed stable coding of information, whereas intermediate neurons showed dynamic coding, as if it integrated category and rule to derive contingency. A similar process was confirmed by using a spiking neural network model that consisted of subnetworks coding category and rule on the input layer and those coding contingency on the output layer, with a subnetwork for integration in the intermediate layer. These results suggest that category-based logical thinking is realized in the PFC by separated neural populations organized for working in a feedforward manner.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> To elucidate the neural process for logical thinking, we combined an in-depth analysis of single-unit activity data with a biologically plausible computational model. Results of time-by-time analysis of prefrontal neuronal activity suggest an information flow from category-coding and rule-coding neurons to transitional intermediate neurons, and then to contingency-coding neurons. Category-coding, rule-coding, and contingency-coding neurons showed stable coding, whereas intermediate neurons showed dynamic coding, as if they integrated category and rule to derive contingency. A spiking neural network model reproduced similar temporal changes of information as the recorded neuronal data. Our results suggest that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is critically involved in category-based thought process, and this process may be produced by separated neural populations organized for working in a feedforward manner.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Extensive Connections of the Canine Olfactory Pathway Revealed by Tractography and Dissection</a></h4>

              
                <p>The olfactory sense of the domestic dog is widely recognized as being highly sensitive with a diverse function; however, little is known about the structure of its olfactory system. This study examined a cohort of mixed-sex mesaticephalic canines and used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), an MRI technique, to map connections from the olfactory bulb to other cortical regions of the brain. The results were validated using the Klingler dissection method. An extensive pathway composed of five white matter tracts connecting to the occipital lobe, cortical spinal tract, limbic system, piriform lobe, and entorhinal pathway was identified. This is the first documentation of a direct connection between the olfactory bulb and occipital lobe in any species and is a step toward further understanding how the dog integrates olfactory stimuli into their cognitive function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The highly sensitive olfactory system of the domestic dog is largely unexplored. We applied diffusion tractography and dissection techniques to evaluate the white matter connections associated with the olfactory system in a large cohort of dogs. We discovered an extensive white matter network extending from the olfactory bulb to form novel connections directly to other cortices of the brain. This is the first documentation of these novel olfactory connections and provides new insight into how dogs integrate olfactory stimuli in their cognitive functioning.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Task Context Modulates Feature-Selective Responses in Area V4</a></h4>

              
                <p>Feature selectivity of visual cortical responses measured during passive fixation provides only a partial view of selectivity because it does not account for the influence of cognitive factors. Here we focus on primate area V4 and ask how neuronal tuning is modulated by task engagement. We investigated whether responses to colored shapes during active shape discrimination are simple, stimulus-agnostic, scaled versions of responses during passive fixation, akin to results from attentional studies. Alternatively, responses could be subject to stimulus-specific scaling, that is, responses to different stimuli are modulated differently, resulting in changes in underlying shape/color selectivity. Among 83 well-isolated V4 neurons in two male macaques, only a minority (16 of 83), which were weakly tuned to both shape and color, displayed responses during fixation and discrimination tasks that could be related by stimulus-agnostic scaling. The majority (67 of 83), which were strongly tuned to shape, color, or both, displayed stimulus-dependent response changes during discrimination. For some of these neurons (39 of 83), the shape or color of the stimulus dictated the magnitude of the change, and for others (28 of 83) it was the combination of stimulus shape and color. Importantly, for neurons with one strong and one weak tuning dimension, stimulus-dependent response changes during discrimination were associated with a relative increase in selectivity along the stronger tuning dimension, without changes in tuning peak. These results reveal that more strongly tuned V4 neurons may also be more flexible in their selectivity, and imbalances in selectivity are amplified during active task contexts.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Tuning for stimulus features is typically characterized by recording responses during passive fixation, but cognitive factors, including attention, influence responses in visual cortex. To determine how behavioral engagement influences neuronal responses in area V4, we compared responses to colored shapes during passive fixation and active behavior. For a large fraction of neurons, differences in responses between passive fixation and active behavior depended on the identity of the visual stimulus. For a subgroup of strongly feature-selective neurons, this response modulation was associated with enhanced selectivity for one feature at the expense of selectivity for the other. Such flexibility in tuning strength could improve performance in tasks requiring active judgment of stimuli.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Reward Enhances Memory via Age-Varying Online and Offline Neural Mechanisms across Development</a></h4>

              
                <p>Reward motivation enhances memory through interactions between mesolimbic, hippocampal, and cortical systems, both during and after encoding. Developmental changes in these distributed neural circuits may lead to age-related differences in reward-motivated memory and the underlying neural mechanisms. Converging evidence from cross-species studies suggests that subcortical dopamine signaling is increased during adolescence, which may lead to stronger memory representations of rewarding, relative to mundane, events and changes in the contributions of underlying subcortical and cortical brain mechanisms across age. Here, we used fMRI to examine how reward motivation influences the "online" encoding and "offline" postencoding brain mechanisms that support long-term associative memory from childhood to adulthood in human participants of both sexes. We found that reward motivation led to both age-invariant enhancements and nonlinear age-related differences in associative memory after 24 h. Furthermore, reward-related memory benefits were linked to age-varying neural mechanisms. During encoding, interactions between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) were associated with better high-reward memory to a greater degree with increasing age. Preencoding to postencoding changes in functional connectivity between the anterior hippocampus and VTA were also associated with better high-reward memory, but more so at younger ages. Our findings suggest that there may be developmental differences in the contributions of offline subcortical and online cortical brain mechanisms supporting reward-motivated memory.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A substantial body of research has examined the neural mechanisms through which reward influences memory formation in adults. However, despite extensive evidence that both reward processing and associative memory undergo dynamic change across development, few studies have examined age-related changes in these processes. We found both age-invariant and nonlinear age-related differences in reward-motivated memory. Moreover, our findings point to developmental differences in the processes through which reward modulates the prioritization of information in long-term memory, with greater early reliance on offline subcortical consolidation mechanisms and increased contribution of systems-level online encoding circuitry with increasing age. These results highlight dynamic developmental changes in the cognitive and neural mechanisms through which motivationally salient information is prioritized in memory from childhood to adulthood.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Experiencing Surprise: The Temporal Dynamics of Its Impact on Memory</a></h4>

              
                <p>To efficiently process information, the brain shifts between encoding and retrieval states, prioritizing bottom-up or top-down processing accordingly. Expectation violation before or during learning has been shown to trigger an adaptive encoding mechanism, resulting in better memory for unexpected events. Using fMRI, we explored (1) whether this encoding mechanism is also triggered during retrieval, and if so, (2) what the temporal dynamics of its mnemonic consequences are. Male and female participants studied object images, then, with new objects, they learned a contingency between a cue and a semantic category. Rule-abiding (expected) and violating (unexpected) targets and similar foils were used at test. We found interactions between previous and current similar events' expectation, such that when an expected event followed a similar but unexpected event, its performance was boosted, underpinned by activation in the hippocampus, midbrain, and occipital cortex. In contrast, a sequence of two unexpected similar events also triggered occipital engagement; however, this did not enhance memory performance. Taken together, our findings suggest that when the goal is to retrieve, encountering surprising events engages an encoding mechanism, supported by bottom-up processing, that may enhance memory for future related events.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Optimizing the balance between new learning and the retrieval of existing knowledge is an ongoing process, at the core of human cognition. Previous research into memory encoding suggests experiencing surprise leads to the prioritization of the learning of new memories, forming an adaptive encoding mechanism. We examined whether this mechanism is also engaged when the current goal is to retrieve information. Our results demonstrate that an expectation-driven shift toward an encoding state, supported by enhanced perceptual processing, is beneficial for the correct identification of subsequent expected similar events. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the temporal dynamics of the adaptive encoding of information into memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Role for the Anterior Hippocampus in Autobiographical Memory Construction Regardless of Temporal Distance</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mounting evidence suggests distinct functional contributions of the anterior and posterior hippocampus to autobiographical memory retrieval, but how these subregions function under different retrieval demands as memories age is not yet understood. Specifically, autobiographical memory retrieval is not a homogeneous process; rather, it is thought to consist of the following multiple stages: an early stage of memory construction and a later stage of detailed elaboration, which may differently engage the hippocampus over time. In the present study, we analyzed data from 40 participants (23 female/17 male) who constructed and overtly elaborated on recent and remote memories in response to picture cues in the fMRI scanner. We previously reported a temporal gradient in the posterior hippocampus during the elaboration period of autobiographical retrieval, with posterior hippocampal activation observed for recent but not remote time points. Here, we consider the previously unanalyzed construction stage of retrieval, where participants searched for and selected a memory. We found no evidence of a temporal gradient during memory construction, instead observing strong anterior hippocampus activity regardless of memory remoteness. Our findings suggest a unique contribution of the anterior hippocampus to the construction process of autobiographical retrieval over time. These findings highlight that retrieval processes, which have yet to be integrated with current models of systems consolidation, offer novel insights into hippocampal subregion function over time.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hippocampal contributions to autobiographical memory retrieval may depend on several distinct factors including memory age and the retrieval process engaged. We previously found that the contribution of the posterior hippocampus to detailed elaborative retrieval diminishes as memories age, with no reliable activation of the anterior hippocampus over time. Here, we report that consideration of the earlier "construction" period of retrieval, where participants search for and retrieve general aspects of the memory, yielded significant anterior hippocampus activation regardless of memory age. These results provide evidence for a unique contribution of the anterior hippocampus to the constructive process of autobiographical retrieval over time and suggest that component processes of retrieval should be integrated into models of systems consolidation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Genetic Mapping of APP and Amyloid-{beta} Biology Modulation by Trisomy 21</a></h4>

              
                <p>Individuals who have Down syndrome (DS) frequently develop early onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative condition caused by the buildup of aggregated amyloid-&beta; (A&beta;) and tau proteins in the brain. A&beta; is produced by amyloid precursor protein (<I>APP</I>), a gene located on chromosome 21. People who have DS have three copies of chromosome 21 and thus also an additional copy of <I>APP</I>; this genetic change drives the early development of AD in these individuals. Here we use a combination of next-generation mouse models of DS (Tc1, Dp3Tyb, Dp(10)2Yey and Dp(17)3Yey) and a knockin mouse model of A&beta; accumulation (<I>App<sup>NL-F</sup></I>) to determine how chromosome 21 genes, other than <I>APP</I>, modulate APP/A&beta; in the brain when in three copies. Using both male and female mice, we demonstrate that three copies of other chromosome 21 genes are sufficient to partially ameliorate A&beta; accumulation in the brain. We go on to identify a subregion of chromosome 21 that contains the gene(s) causing this decrease in A&beta; accumulation and investigate the role of two lead candidate genes, <I>Dyrk1a</I> and <I>Bace2</I>. Thus, an additional copy of chromosome 21 genes, other than <I>APP</I>, can modulate APP/A&beta; in the brain under physiological conditions. This work provides critical mechanistic insight into the development of disease and an explanation for the typically later age of onset of dementia in people who have AD in DS, compared with those who have familial AD caused by triplication of <I>APP</I>.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Trisomy of chromosome 21 is a commonly occurring genetic risk factor for early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), which has been previously attributed to people with Down syndrome having three copies of the amyloid precursor protein (<I>APP</I>) gene, which is encoded on chromosome 21. However, we have shown that an extra copy of other chromosome 21 genes modifies AD-like phenotypes independently of <I>APP</I> copy number (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B49">Wiseman et al., 2018</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B44">Tosh et al., 2021</cross-ref>). Here, we use a mapping approach to narrow down the genetic cause of the modulation of pathology, demonstrating that gene(s) on chromosome 21 decrease A&beta; accumulation in the brain, independently of alterations to full-length APP or C-terminal fragment abundance and that just 38 genes are sufficient to cause this.</p>

                <p>Atypical sensory processing is now thought to be a core feature of the autism spectrum. Influential theories have proposed that both increased and decreased neural response reliability within sensory systems could underlie altered sensory processing in autism. Here, we report evidence for abnormally increased reliability of visual-evoked responses in layer 2/3 neurons of adult male and female primary visual cortex in the MECP2-duplication syndrome animal model of autism. Increased response reliability was due in part to decreased response amplitude, decreased fluctuations in endogenous activity, and an abnormal decoupling of visual-evoked activity from endogenous activity. Similar to what was observed neuronally, the optokinetic reflex occurred more reliably at low contrasts in mutant mice compared with controls. Retinal responses did not explain our observations. These data suggest that the circuit mechanisms for combining sensory-evoked and endogenous signal and noise processes may be altered in this form of syndromic autism.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Atypical sensory processing is now thought to be a core feature of the autism spectrum. Influential theories have proposed that both increased and decreased neural response reliability within sensory systems could underlie altered sensory processing in autism. Here, we report evidence for abnormally increased reliability of visual-evoked responses in primary visual cortex of the animal model for MECP2-duplication syndrome, a high-penetrance single-gene cause of autism. Visual-evoked activity was abnormally decoupled from endogenous activity in mutant mice, suggesting in line with the influential "hypo-priors" theory of autism that sensory priors embedded in endogenous activity may have less influence on perception in autism.</p>

                <p>by Amir Akbari, Bernhard O. Palsson</p>

Identifying plausible mechanisms for compartmentalization and accumulation of the organic intermediates of early metabolic cycles in primitive cells has been a major challenge in theories of life’s origins. Here, we propose a mechanism, where positive membrane potentials elevate the concentration of the organic intermediates. Positive membrane potentials are generated by positively charged surfaces of protocell membranes due to accumulation of transition metals. We find that (i) positive membrane potentials comparable in magnitude to those of modern cells can increase the concentration of the organic intermediates by several orders of magnitude; (ii) generation of large membrane potentials destabilize ion distributions; (iii) violation of electroneutrality is necessary to induce nonzero membrane potentials; and (iv) violation of electroneutrality enhances osmotic pressure and diminishes reaction efficiency, resulting in an evolutionary driving force for the formation of lipid membranes, specialized ion channels, and active transport systems.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Understanding the structure of cognitive noise</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jian-Qiao Zhu, Pablo León-Villagrá, Nick Chater, Adam N. Sanborn</p>

Human cognition is fundamentally noisy. While routinely regarded as a nuisance in experimental investigation, the few studies investigating properties of cognitive noise have found surprising structure. A first line of research has shown that inter-response-time distributions are heavy-tailed. That is, response times between subsequent trials usually change only a small amount, but with occasional large changes. A second, separate, line of research has found that participants’ estimates and response times both exhibit long-range autocorrelations (i.e., 1/<i>f</i> noise). Thus, each judgment and response time not only depends on its immediate predecessor but also on many previous responses. These two lines of research use different tasks and have distinct theoretical explanations: models that account for heavy-tailed response times do not predict 1/<i>f</i> autocorrelations and vice versa. Here, we find that 1/<i>f</i> noise and heavy-tailed response distributions co-occur in both types of tasks. We also show that a statistical sampling algorithm, developed to deal with patchy environments, generates both heavy-tailed distributions and 1/<i>f</i> noise, suggesting that cognitive noise may be a functional adaptation to dealing with a complex world.

<i>Candida albicans</i> biofilms are a complex multilayer community of cells that are resistant to almost all classes of antifungal drugs. The bottommost layers of biofilms experience nutrient limitation where <i>C</i>. <i>albicans</i> cells are required to respire. We previously reported that a protein Ndu1 is essential for <i>Candida</i> mitochondrial respiration; loss of <i>NDU1</i> causes inability of <i>C</i>. <i>albicans</i> to grow on alternative carbon sources and triggers early biofilm detachment. Here, we screened a repurposed library of FDA-approved small molecule inhibitors to identify those that prevent NDU1-associated functions. We identified an antihelminthic drug, Niclosamide (NCL), which not only prevented growth on acetate, <i>C</i>. <i>albicans</i> hyphenation and early biofilm growth, but also completely disengaged fully grown biofilms of drug-resistant <i>C</i>. <i>albicans</i> and <i>Candida auris</i> from their growth surface. To overcome the suboptimal solubility and permeability of NCL that is well known to affect its in vivo efficacy, we developed NCL-encapsulated Eudragit EPO (an FDA-approved polymer) nanoparticles (NCL-EPO-NPs) with high niclosamide loading, which also provided long-term stability. The developed NCL-EPO-NPs completely penetrated mature biofilms and attained anti-biofilm activity at low microgram concentrations. NCL-EPO-NPs induced ROS activity in <i>C</i>. <i>albicans</i> and drastically reduced oxygen consumption rate in the fungus, similar to that seen in an NDU1 mutant. NCL-EPO-NPs also significantly abrogated mucocutaneous candidiasis by fluconazole-resistant strains of <i>C</i>. <i>albicans</i>, in mice models of oropharyngeal and vulvovaginal candidiasis. To our knowledge, this is the first study that targets biofilm detachment as a target to get rid of drug-resistant <i>Candida</i> biofilms and uses NPs of an FDA-approved nontoxic drug to improve biofilm penetrability and microbial killing.

Reductions in MBP immunoreactivity and myelin loss in the frontal cortex are associated with the presence of the <i>C9orf72</i> hexanucleotide expansion in FTLD and ALS

There was a negative correlation between MBP reduction and pTDP-43 pathology in the white matter in the <i>C9orf72</i> mutation carriers

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The most frequent genetic cause of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the hexanucleotide repeat expansion in <i>C9orf72</i>. An important neuropathological hallmark associated with this mutation is the accumulation of the phosphorylated form of TAR (trans-activation response element) DNA-binding protein 43 (pTDP-43). Glia plays a crucial role in the neurodegeneration observed in <i>C9orf72</i>-associated disorders. However, less is known about the role of oligodendrocytes (OLs). Here, we applied digital neuropathological methods to compare the expression pattern of glial cells in the frontal cortex (FrCx) of human post-mortem samples from patients with C9-FTLD and C9-FTLD/ALS, sporadic FTLD (sFTLD), and healthy controls (HCs). We also compared MBP levels in CSF from an independent clinical FTD cohort. We observed an increase in GFAP, and Iba1 immunoreactivity in C9 and sFTLD compared to controls in the gray matter (GM) of the FrCx. We observed a decrease in MBP immunoreactivity in the GM and white matter (WM) of the FrCx of C9, compared to HC and sFTLD. There was a negative correlation between MBP and pTDP-43 in C9 in the WM of the FrCx. We observed an increase in CSF MBP concentrations in C9 and sFTLD compared to HC. In conclusion, the C9 expansion is associated with myelin loss in the frontal cortex. This loss of MBP may be a result of oligodendroglial dysfunction due to the expansion or the presence of pTDP-43 in OLs. Understanding these biological processes will help to identify specific pathways associated with the <i>C9orf72</i> expansion.</p>

     alt="[18F]FDG brain uptake of C57Bl/6 male mice is affected by locomotor activity after cocaine use: A small animal positron emission tomography study"/>
<p>Cocaine effects on brain glucose metabolism were evaluated in three different situations: after maintaining animals in a home cage; exposing them to open field; keeping them under anesthesia. When performing brain PET scanning, locomotor activity induced by cocaine might be a relevant factor, as in animals under anesthesia an acute cocaine injection induced higher [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG brain uptake. This is not seen when animals are left awake to experience the locomotor stimulant effect of the drug.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We verified if cocaine-induced peripheral activation might disrupt [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG brain uptake after a cocaine challenge and suggested an optimal protocol to measure cocaine-induced brain metabolic alterations in mice. C57Bl/6 male mice were injected with [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG and randomly separated into three groups. Groups 1 and 2 were kept conscious after [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG administration and after 5 min received saline or cocaine (20 mg/kg). The animals in group 1 (<i>n</i> = 5) were then evaluated in the open field for 30 min and those from group 2 (<i>n</i> = 6) were kept alone in a home cage for the same period. Forty-five minutes after [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG administration, images were acquired for 30 min. Group 3 (<i>n</i> = 6) was kept anesthetized and image acquisition started immediately after tracer injection, for 75 min. Saline (Day 1) or cocaine (Day 2) was injected 5 min after starting acquisition. Another set of animals (<i>n</i> = 5) were treated with cocaine every other day for 10 days or saline (<i>n</i> = 6) and were scanned with the dynamic protocol to verify its efficacy. [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG uptake increased after cocaine administration when compared to baseline only in animals kept under anesthesia. No brain effect of cocaine was observed in animals submitted to the open field or kept in the home cage. The use of anesthesia is essential to visualize cocaine-induced changes in brain metabolism by [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET, providing an interesting preclinical approach to investigate naïve subjects and enabling a bidirectional translational science approach for better understanding of cocaine use disorder.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia characterized by polysomnography-confirmed REM sleep without atonia and dream-enacting behaviors. This disorder is considered a prodromal syndrome of alpha-synucleinopathies like Parkinson's disease (PD), where it affects more than 50% of PD patients. The underlying pathology of RBD has been generally understood to involve the pontine nuclei within the brainstem. However, the complete pathophysiology beyond the brainstem remains unclear as does its relationship with PD pathology. Therefore, this review aims to survey the neuroimaging literature involving PET, SPECT, and MR imaging techniques to provide an updated understanding of the neuro-chemical, structural, and functional changes in both RBD and PD patients comorbid with RBD. This review found neuroimaging evidence that indicate alterations to the dopaminergic and cholinergic system, blood perfusion, and glucose metabolism in both RBD patients and PD patients with RBD. Beyond the brainstem, structural and functional changes were found to involve the nigrostriatal system, limbic system, and the cortex—suggesting that RBD is a multi-systemic neurodegenerative process. Future investigations are encouraged to follow RBD patients longitudinally using multimodal imaging techniques to enhance our understanding of this parasomnia disorder. Uncovering which individuals are most likely to develop an alpha-synuclein disorder in the prodromal phase will improve patient outcomes and potentially aid in the development of novel treatments for patients affected by RBD.</p>

<p>The activity of spinal glymphatic system of rats with painful diabetic neuropathy was inhibited, and our results indicated that the increased number of GFAP positive astrocytes and aquaporin-4 polarity reversal may worked as its mechanism.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The glymphatic system is a recently discovered glial-dependent macroscopic interstitial waste clearance system that promotes the efficient elimination of soluble proteins and metabolites from the central nervous system. Its anatomic foundation is the astrocytes and aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channels on the endfeet of astrocytes. The aim of this study is to evaluate the plasticity of the spinal glymphatic system in male SD rats with painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) induced by type 2 diabetes mellitus. PDN rats were modeled under a high-fat and high-glucose diet with a low dose of streptozotocin. MRI was applied to observe the infiltration and clearance of contrast to indicate the functional variability of the glymphatic system at the spinal cord level. The paw withdrawal threshold was used to represent mechanical allodynia. The numerical change of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) positive astrocytes was assessed and the polarity reversal of AQP4 protein was measured by immunofluorescence. As a result, deceased contrast infiltration and clearance, enhanced mechanical allodynia, increased number of GFAP positive astrocytes, and reversed polarity of AQP4 protein were found in the PDN rats. The above molecular level changes may contribute to the impairment of the spinal glymphatic system in PDN rats. This study revealed the molecular and functional variations of the spinal glymphatic system in PDN rats and for the first time indicated that there might be a correlation between the impaired spinal glymphatic system and PDN rats.</p>

<p>Oxidative stress is induced by Kainate in neuroglobin KO and WT mice. In Ngb-KO mice this is not counter balanced and c-fos (a transcription factor) expression is increased leading to activation of downstream targets resulting in seizure.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuroglobin (Ngb) is found in the neurones of several different brain areas and is known to bind oxygen and other gaseous molecules and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vitro, but it does not seem to act as a respiratory molecule for neurones. Using male and female Ngb-knockout (KO) mice, we addressed the role of Ngb in neuronal brain activity using behavioral tests but found no differences in general behaviors, memory processes, and anxiety−/depression-like behaviors. Oxidative stress and ROS play key roles in epileptogenesis, and oxidative injury produced by an excessive production of free radicals is involved in the initiation and progression of epilepsy. The ROS binding properties led us to hypothesize that lack of Ngb could affect central coping with excitatory stimuli. We consequently explored whether exposure to the excitatory molecule kainate (KA) would increase severity of seizures in mice lacking Ngb. We found that the duration and severity of seizures were increased, while the latency time to develop seizures was shortened in Ngb-KO compared to wildtype adult female mice. Consistently, c-fos expression after KA was significantly increased in Ngb-KO mice in the amygdala and piriform cortex, regions rich in Ngb and known to be centrally involved in seizure generation. Moreover, the measured c-fos expression levels were correlated with seizure susceptibility. With these new findings combined with previous studies we propose that Ngb could constitute an intrinsic defense mechanism against neuronal hyperexcitability and oxidative stress by buffering of ROS in amygdala and other Ngb-containing brain regions.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology is the most common motor neurodegenerative disease that occurs due to the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal pathway of the brain. The histopathological hallmark of the disease is fibrillary aggregate called Lewy bodies which majorly contain α-synuclein, suggesting the critical implication of diminished protein degradation mechanisms in disease pathogenesis. This α-synuclein-containing Lewy bodies are evident in both experimental models as well as in postmortem PD brain and are speculated to be pathogenic but still, the lineal association between these aggregates and the complexity of disease pathology is not yet well established and needs further attention. However, it has been reported that α-synuclein aggregates have consorted with the declined proteasome and lysosome activities. Therefore, in this review, we reappraise intracellular protein degradation mechanisms during PD pathology. This article focused on the findings of the last two decades suggesting the implications of protein degradation mechanisms in disease pathogenesis and based on shreds of evidence, some of the approaches are also suggested which may be adopted to find out the novel therapeutic targets for the management of PD patients.</p>

     alt="Enhanced nociceptive behavior and expansion of associated primary afferents in a rabbit model of cerebral palsy"/>
<p>Most individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) experience pain, yet it is understudied. We demonstrate altered distribution of nociceptive afferents in the dorsal horn of neonatal rabbits that experienced hypoxic–ischemic injury in utero; these anatomical changes were associated with nocifensive behavior indicative of pain. Our findings suggest that CP-causative injuries alter spinal sensory pathways (not only descending motor circuits), contributing to increased pain in CP.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Spastic cerebral palsy (CP) is a movement disorder marked by hypertonia and hyperreflexia; the most prevalent comorbidity is pain. Since spinal nociceptive afferents contribute to both the sensation of painful stimuli as well as reflex circuits involved in movement, we investigated the relationship between prenatal hypoxia–ischemia (HI) injury which can cause CP, and possible changes in spinal nociceptive circuitry. To do this, we examined nociceptive afferents and mechanical and thermal sensitivity of New Zealand White rabbit kits after prenatal HI or a sham surgical procedure. As described previously, a range of motor deficits similar to spastic CP was observed in kits born naturally after HI (40 min at ~70%–80% gestation). We found that HI caused an expansion of peptidergic afferents (marked by expression of calcitonin gene-related peptide) in both the superficial and deep dorsal horn at postnatal day (P)5. Non-peptidergic nociceptive afferent arborization (labeled by isolectin B4) was unaltered in HI kits, but overlap of the two populations (peptidergic and non-peptidergic nociceptors) was increased by HI. Density of glial fibrillary acidic protein was unchanged within spinal cord white matter regions important in nociceptive transmission at P5. We found that mechanical and thermal nociception was enhanced in HI kits even in the absence of motor deficits. These findings suggest that prenatal HI injury impacts spinal sensory pathways in addition to the more well-established disruptions to descending motor circuits. In conclusion, changes to spinal nociceptive circuitry could disrupt spinal reflexes and contribute to pain experienced by individuals with CP.</p>

     alt="Effect of endogenous purines on electrically evoked ACh release at the mouse neuromuscular junction"/>
<p>At mammalian neuromuscular junction, ATP is co-released with the neurotransmitter ACh, and once in the synaptic cleft, it is hydrolyzed to adenosine. We report that, when motor nerve terminals are depolarized by electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerve, the activation of presynaptic purinergic receptors are able to modulate ACh release depending on the frequency and pattern of stimulation.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>At the mouse neuromuscular junction, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is co-released with the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh), and its metabolite adenosine, modulate neurotransmitter release by activating presynaptic inhibitory P2Y<sub>13</sub> receptors (a subtype of ATP/adenosine diphosphate [ADP] receptor), inhibitory A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>3</sub> adenosine receptors, and excitatory A<sub>2A</sub> adenosine receptors. To study the effect of endogenous purines, when phrenic-diaphragm preparations are depolarized by different nerve stimulation patterns, we analyzed the effect of the antagonists for P2Y<sub>13</sub>, A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>3</sub>, and A<sub>2A</sub> receptors (AR-C69931MX, 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine, MRS-1191, and SCH-58261, respectively) on the amplitude of the end-plate potentials of the trains, and contrasted these results with those obtained with the selective agonists of these receptors (2-methylthioadenosine 5′-diphosphate trisodium salt hydrate, 2-chloro-N<sup>6</sup>-cyclopentyl-adenosine, inosine, and PSB-0777, respectively). During continuous 0.5-Hz stimulation, the amount of endogenous purines was not enough to activate purinergic receptors, while at continuous 5-Hz stimulation, an incipient action of endogenous purines on P2Y<sub>13</sub>, A<sub>1</sub> and A3 receptors might be evident just at the end of the trains. During continuous 50-Hz stimulation, the concentration of endogenous ATP/ADP and adenosine exerted an inhibitory action on ACh release after of the initial phase of the train, but when the nerve was stimulated at intermittent 50 Hz (5 bursts), this behavior was not observed. Excitatory A<sub>2A</sub> receptors were only activated when continuous 100-Hz stimulation was applied. In conclusion, when motor nerve terminals are depolarized by repetitive stimulation of the phrenic nerve, endogenous ATP/ADP and adenosine are able to fine-tune neurosecretion depending on the frequency and pattern of stimulation.</p>

     alt="Sex differences in morphine sensitivity are associated with differential glial expression in the brainstem of rats with neuropathic pain"/>
<p>It is well known that males and females show significant differences in both the analgesic and emetic effects of opiates. Our data provide evidence that changes in the morphology and activity of astrocytes in morphine sensitive and pain modulatory medullary regions might underlie these clinically important effects.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Chronic pain is more prevalent and reported to be more severe in women. Opioid analgesics are less effective in women and result in stronger nauseant effects. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying these sex differences have yet to be clearly defined, though recent research has suggested neuronal–glial interactions are likely involved. We have previously shown that similar to people, morphine is less effective at reducing pain behaviors in female rats. In this study, we used the immunohistochemical detection of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression to investigate sex differences in astrocyte density and morphology in six medullary regions known to be modulated by pain and/or opioids. Morphine administration had small sex-dependent effects on overall GFAP expression, but not on astrocyte morphology, in the rostral ventromedial medulla, the subnucleus reticularis dorsalis, and the area postrema. Significant sex differences in the density and morphology of GFAP immunopositive astrocytes were detected in all six regions. In general, GFAP-positive cells in females showed smaller volumes and reduced complexity than those observed in males. Furthermore, females showed lower overall GFAP expression in all regions except for the area postrema, the critical medullary region responsible for opioid-induced nausea and emesis. These data support the possibility that differences in astrocyte activity might underlie the sex differences seen in the processing of opioids in the context of chronic neuropathic pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Targeting mitochondria in the regulation of neurodegenerative diseases: A comprehensive review</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Mitochondria are one of the essential cellular organelles. Apart from being considered as the powerhouse of the cell, mitochondria have been widely known to regulate redox reaction, inflammation, cell survival, cell death, metabolism, etc., and are implicated in the progression of numerous disease conditions including neurodegenerative diseases. Since brain is an energy-demanding organ, mitochondria and their functions are important for maintaining normal brain homeostasis. Alterations in mitochondrial gene expression, mutations, and epigenetic modification contribute to inflammation and neurodegeneration. Dysregulation of reactive oxygen species production by mitochondria and aggregation of proteins in neurons leads to alteration in mitochondria functions which further causes neuronal death and progression of neurodegeneration. Pharmacological studies have prioritized mitochondria as a possible drug target in the regulation of neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, the present review article has been intended to provide a comprehensive understanding of mitochondrial role in the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases mainly Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis followed by possible intervention and future treatment strategies to combat mitochondrial-mediated neurodegeneration.</p>

                Background: Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is a complex metabolic disease resulting from altered activity of the enzyme uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) in the liver resulting in accumulation of uroporphyrin. PCT presents as a blistering photodermatitis with skin fragility, vesicles, scarring and milia. Case: We report a case of PCT in a 67-year-old man with hemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutation who, following a major syncopal episode in response to venesection was commenced on low dose hydroxychloroquine. Conclusions: Low dose hydroxychloroquine provided a safe and effective alternative to venesection in this patient who was needle phobic.

                Social prescribing is a way of connecting individuals to a source of support within the community to help improve their health and well-being. Social prescribing programmes are being widely promoted within the United Kingdom (UK) and United States as non-pharmaceutical interventions for those living with addiction and substance misuse needs. These needs have been exasperated by the recent COVID-19 pandemic and global economic crisis, with emerging research indicating short-term and long-term detrimental effects on physical and mental health due to substance misuse and addictions. Psychosocial interventions utilize psychological or social factors rather than an overreliance on biological interventions to treat the health impacts of mental illnesses such as addictions and substance use disorder. In this paper, I will discuss the associated determinants of addictions and substance for the military veteran population, as well as how the social prescribing of psychosocial interventions could be used to reaffirm participant’s identity and enhance their sense of belonging for military veterans, using a real-world example in Wales, UK.

                Abstract: Umbilical cord prolapse is an uncommon obstetric emergency with high neonatal morbidity and mortality. It is a rare entity with incidence ranging from 0.1 to 0.6%. Timely recognition and immediate interventions are needed for better outcome. Here, we present a case of 28-year-old multigravida of term pregnancy with cord prolapse of seven hours following rupture of membrane. She was experiencing vaginal leakage in the absence of abdominal pain, and was referred from the peripheral health center with the provisional diagnosis of cord prolapse. She finally underwent emergency caesarean section with good neonatal outcome at tertiary care center.

                Background: Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is widely used to detect SARS-CoV-2 infections. A small proportion (3-5%) of the samples turn out to be inconclusive which are difficult to interpret and require repeat testing. Methods: This study utilizing RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 collected data from the viral RNA extracted using Maccura Mag-Bind RNA from NPOP specimen, then amplified and quantified using Maccura SARS-CoV-2 Fluorescent PCR kit. The data with inconclusive interpretation and re-test results were selected and further analysed. Results: The retrospective analysis of 247 inconclusive samples that were retested was included in the study. Among the inconclusive results from the first test, 80% of samples which expressed SARS-CoV-2 N and E genes (without ORF1ab gene) turned out to be positive in the repeat test (p < 0.001), while 55% of samples that had only one gene expressed initially, were positive on repeat testing. The E gene was detected (without N and ORF1ab gene) in nine samples, of which seven were negative on re-testing. Conclusions: Our study suggests that it is beneficial to repeat the SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR test, especially when two genes are expressed, while detection of only E gene in the first test can be regarded as negative.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Small sensory spinal lesions that affect hand function in monkeys greatly alter primary afferent and motor neuron connections in the cord</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Small sensory spinal injuries induce plasticity across the neuraxis, but little is understood about their effect on segmental connections or motor neuron (MN) function. Here, we begin to address this at two levels. First, we compared afferent input distributions from the skin and muscles of the digits with corresponding MN pools to determine their spatial relationship, in both the normal state and 4–6 months after a unilateral dorsal root/dorsal column lesion (DRL/DCL), affecting digits 1–3. Second, we looked at specific changes to MN inputs and membrane properties that likely impact functional recovery. Monkeys received a targeted unilateral DRL/DCL, and 4–6 months later, cholera toxin subunit B (CT-B) was injected bilaterally into either the distal pads of digits 1–3, or related intrinsic hand muscles, to label inputs to the cord, and corresponding MNs. In controls (unlesioned side), cutaneous and proprioceptive afferents from digits 1–3 showed different distribution patterns but similar rostrocaudal spread within the dorsal horn from C1 to T2. In contrast, MNs were distributed across just two segments (C7–8). Following the lesion, sensory inputs were significantly diminished across all 10 segments, though this did not alter MN distributions. Afferent and monoamine inputs, as well as KCC2 cotransporters, were also significantly altered on the cell membrane of CT-B labeled MNs postlesion. In contrast, inhibitory neurotransmission and perineuronal net integrity were not altered at this prechronic timepoint.  Our findings indicate that even a small sensory injury can significantly impact sensory and motor spinal neurons and provide new insight into the complex process of recovery.</p>

                Temporal summation in the spinal cord is linked to pathological pain. In a translational genetic association study in this issue of Neuron, Trendafilova et al. (2022) identify the sodium-calcium exchanger 3 as a negative regulator of temporal summation and hypersensitivity via its modulation of calcium homeostasis.

                In this issue of Neuron, three studies establish new strategies for efficient retinal neuroprotection and optic nerve regeneration. Tian et al. (2022) carry out a multi-omics screen and identify key transcriptional regulators of axon injury signaling leading to cell death; Jacobi et al. (2022) and Li et al. (2022) combine retrograde tracing and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to uncover a new molecular roadmap for axon regeneration.

                The function of serotonin in the mammalian brain has been challenging to unravel. In this issue of Neuron, Paquelet et al.

                Novelty and uncertainty are powerful drivers of exploration that are often conflated. In this issue of Neuron, Cockburn and colleagues dissociate the two and report a key interaction: close to task termination, novel options appear much more attractive relative to uncertain options.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/current.rss">Functional neuroimaging in psychiatry and the case for failing better</a></h4>

              
                The confluence of functional neuroimaging and cognitive neuroscience has revolutionized psychiatric research, yet clinical translation has been lacking. Nour et al. provide a critical perspective on this impasse and suggest how the field might fare better in the future.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Innate immune signaling in trophoblast and decidua organoids defines differential antiviral defenses at the maternal-fetal interface</a></h4>

              
                Infections at the maternal-fetal interface can directly harm the fetus and induce complications that adversely impact pregnancy outcomes. Innate immune signaling by both fetal-derived placental trophoblasts and the maternal decidua must provide antimicrobial defenses at this critical interface without compromising its integrity. Here, we developed matched trophoblast and decidua organoids from human placentas to define the relative contributions of these cells to antiviral defenses at the maternal-fetal interface. We demonstrate that trophoblast and decidua organoids basally secrete distinct immunomodulatory factors, including the constitutive release of the antiviral type III interferon IFN-λ2 from trophoblast organoids, and differentially respond to viral infections through the induction of organoid-specific factors. Lastly, we define the differential susceptibility and innate immune signaling of trophoblast and decidua organoids to human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and develop a co-culture model of trophoblast and decidua organoids which showed that trophoblast-derived factors protect decidual cells from HCMV infection. Our findings establish matched trophoblast and decidua organoids as <i>ex vivo</i> models to study vertically transmitted infections and highlight differences in innate immune signaling by fetal-derived trophoblasts and the maternal decidua.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Temporal and thermal profiling of the Toxoplasma proteome implicates parasite Protein Phosphatase 1 in the regulation of Ca2+-responsive pathways</a></h4>

              
                Apicomplexan parasites cause persistent mortality and morbidity worldwide through diseases including malaria, toxoplasmosis, and cryptosporidiosis. Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways have been repurposed in these eukaryotic pathogens to regulate parasite-specific cellular processes governing the replicative and lytic phases of the infectious cycle, as well as the transition between them. Despite the presence of conserved Ca<sup>2+</sup>-responsive proteins, little is known about how specific signaling elements interact to impact pathogenesis. We mapped the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-responsive proteome of the model apicomplexan <i>T. gondii</i> via time-resolved phosphoproteomics and thermal proteome profiling. The waves of phosphoregulation following PKG activation and stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release corroborate known physiological changes but identify specific proteins operating in these pathways. Thermal profiling of parasite extracts identified many expected Ca<sup>2+</sup>-responsive proteins, such as parasite Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinases. Our approach also identified numerous Ca<sup>2+</sup>-responsive proteins that are not predicted to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup>, yet are critical components of the parasite signaling network. We characterized protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) as a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-responsive enzyme that relocalized to the parasite apex upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> store release. Conditional depletion of PP1 revealed that the phosphatase regulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake to promote parasite motility. PP1 may thus be partly responsible for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated serine/threonine phosphatase activity in apicomplexan parasites.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Tradeoff breaking as model of evolutionary transitions in individuality and the limits of the fitness-decoupling metaphor</a></h4>

              
                Evolutionary transitions in individuality (ETIs) involve the formation of Darwinian collectives from Darwinian particles. The transition from cells to multicellular life is a prime example. During an ETI, collectives become units of selection in their own right. However, the underlying processes are poorly understood. One observation used to identify the completion of an ETI is an increase in collective-level performance accompanied by a decrease in particle-level performance, for example measured by growth rate. This seemingly counterintuitive dynamic has been referred to as 'fitness decoupling' and has been used to interpret both models and experimental data. Extending and unifying results from the literature, we show that fitness of particles and collectives can never decouple because calculations of particle and collective fitness performed over appropriate and equivalent time intervals are necessarily the same provided the population reaches a stable collective size distribution. By way of solution, we draw attention to the value of mechanistic approaches that emphasise traits, and tradeoffs among traits, as opposed to fitness. This trait-based approach is sufficient to capture dynamics that underpin evolutionary transitions. In addition, drawing upon both experimental and theoretical studies, we show that while early stages of transitions might often involve tradeoffs among particle traits, later—and critical-stages are likely to involve the rupture of such tradeoffs. Thus, when observed in the context of ETIs, tradeoff-breaking events stand as a useful marker for these transitions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The proportion of randomized controlled trials that inform clinical practice</a></h4>

              
                Prior studies suggest that clinical trials are often hampered by problems in design, conduct and reporting that limit their uptake in clinical practice. We have described 'informativeness' as the ability of a trial to guide clinical, policy or research decisions. Little is known about the proportion of initiated trials that inform clinical practice. We created a cohort of randomized interventional clinical trials in three disease areas (ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus and lung cancer), that were initiated between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2010 using ClinicalTrials.gov. We restricted inclusion to trials aimed at answering a clinical question related to the treatment or prevention of disease. Our primary outcome was the proportion of clinical trials fulfilling four conditions of informativeness: importance of the clinical question, trial design, feasibility, and reporting of results. Our study included 125 clinical trials. The proportion meeting four conditions for informativeness was 26.4% (95% CI 18.9 - 35.0). Sixty-seven percent of participants were enrolled in informative trials. The proportion of informative trials did not differ significantly between our three disease areas. Our results suggest that the majority of clinical trials designed to guide clinical practice possess features that may compromise their ability to do so. This highlights opportunities to improve the scientific vetting of clinical research.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Biphasic regulation of osteoblast development via the ERK MAPK-mTOR pathway</a></h4>

              
                Emerging evidence supports that osteogenic differentiation of skeletal progenitors is a key determinant of overall bone formation and bone mass. Despite extensive studies showing the function of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in osteoblast differentiation, none of these studies show in vivo evidence of a role for MAPKs in osteoblast maturation subsequent to lineage commitment. Here, we describe how the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway in osteoblasts controls bone formation by suppressing the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. We also show that, while ERK inhibition blocks the differentiation of osteogenic precursors when initiated at an early stage, ERK inhibition surprisingly promotes the later stages of osteoblast differentiation. Accordingly, inhibition of the ERK pathway using a small compound inhibitor or conditional deletion of the MAP2Ks Map2k1 (MEK1) and Map2k2 (MEK2), in mature osteoblasts and osteocytes, markedly increased bone formation due to augmented osteoblast differentiation. Mice with inducible deletion of the ERK pathway in mature osteoblasts. also displayed similar phenotypes, demonstrating that this phenotype reflects continuous postnatal inhibition of late-stage osteoblast maturation. Mechanistically, ERK inhibition increases mitochondrial function and SGK1 phosphorylation via mTOR2 activation, which leads to osteoblast differentiation and production of angiogenic and osteogenic factors to promote bone formation. This phenotype was partially reversed by inhibiting mTOR. Our study uncovers a surprising dichotomy of ERK pathway functions in osteoblasts, whereby ERK activation promotes the early differentiation of osteoblast precursors, but inhibits the subsequent differentiation of committed osteoblasts via mTOR-mediated regulation of mitochondrial function and SGK1.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Detecting molecular interactions in live-cell single-molecule imaging with proximity-assisted photoactivation (PAPA)</a></h4>

              
                Single-molecule imaging provides a powerful way to study biochemical processes in live cells, yet it remains challenging to track single molecules while simultaneously detecting their interactions. Here we describe a novel property of rhodamine dyes, proximity-assisted photoactivation (PAPA), in which one fluorophore (the 'sender') can reactivate a second fluorophore (the 'receiver') from a dark state. PAPA requires proximity between the two fluorophores, yet it operates at a longer average intermolecular distance than Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). We show that PAPA can be used in live cells both to detect protein-protein interactions and to highlight a sub-population of labeled protein complexes in which two different labels are in proximity. In proof-of-concept experiments, PAPA detected the expected correlation between androgen receptor self-association and chromatin binding at the single-cell level. These results establish a new way in which a photophysical property of fluorophores can be harnessed to study molecular interactions in single-molecule imaging of live cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">PI3K signaling specifies proximal-distal fate by driving a developmental gene regulatory network in SOX9+ mouse lung progenitors</a></h4>

              
                The tips of the developing respiratory buds are home to important progenitor cells marked by the expression of SOX9 and ID2. Early in embryonic development (prior to E13.5), SOX9+ progenitors are multipotent, generating both airway and alveolar epithelium, but are selective progenitors of alveolar epithelial cells later in development. Transcription factors, including <i>Sox9,</i> <i>Etv5</i>, <i>Irx</i>, <i>Mycn</i>, and <i>Foxp1/2</i> interact in complex gene regulatory networks to control proliferation and differentiation of SOX9+ progenitors. Molecular mechanisms by which these transcription factors and other signaling pathways control chromatin state to establish and maintain cell-type identity are not well-defined. Herein, we analyze paired gene expression (RNA-Seq) and chromatin accessibility (ATAC-Seq) data from SOX9+ epithelial progenitor cells (EPCs) during embryonic development in <i>Mus musculus</i>. Widespread changes in chromatin accessibility were observed between E11.5 and E16.5, particularly at distal cis-regulatory elements (e.g. enhancers). Gene regulatory network (GRN) inference identified a common SOX9+ progenitor GRN, implicating phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling in the developmental regulation of SOX9+ progenitor cells. Consistent with this model, conditional ablation of PI3K signaling in the developing lung epithelium in mouse resulted in an expansion of the SOX9+ EPC population and impaired airway epithelial cell differentiation. These data demonstrate that PI3K signaling is required for epithelial patterning during lung organogenesis, and emphasize the combinatorial power of paired RNA and ATAC seq in defining regulatory networks in development.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An increase of inhibition drives the developmental decorrelation of neural activity</a></h4>

              
                Throughout development, the brain transits from early highly synchronous activity patterns to a mature state with sparse and decorrelated neural activity, yet the mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. The developmental transition has important functional consequences, as the latter state is thought to allow for more efficient storage, retrieval and processing of information. Here, we show that, in the mouse medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), neural activity during the first two postnatal weeks decorrelates following specific spatial patterns. This process is accompanied by a concomitant tilting of excitation-inhibition (E-I) ratio towards inhibition. Using optogenetic manipulations and neural network modeling, we show that the two phenomena are mechanistically linked, and that a relative increase of inhibition drives the decorrelation of neural activity. Accordingly, in mice mimicking the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, subtle alterations in E-I ratio are associated with specific impairments in the correlational structure of spike trains. Finally, capitalizing on EEG data from newborn babies, we show that an analogous developmental transition takes place also in the human brain. Thus, changes in E-I ratio control the (de)correlation of neural activity and, by these means, its developmental imbalance might contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Value representations in the rodent orbitofrontal cortex drive learning, not choice</a></h4>

              
                Humans and animals make predictions about the rewards they expect to receive in different situations. In formal models of behavior, these predictions are known as value representations, and they play two very different roles. Firstly, they drive <i>choice</i>: the expected values of available options are compared to one another, and the best option is selected. Secondly, they support <i>learning</i>: expected values are compared to rewards actually received, and future expectations are updated accordingly. Whether these different functions are mediated by different neural representations remains an open question. Here we employ a recently-developed multi-step task for rats that computationally separates learning from choosing. We investigate the role of value representations in the rodent orbitofrontal cortex, a key structure for value-based cognition. Electrophysiological recordings and optogenetic perturbations indicate that these representations do not directly drive choice. Instead, they signal expected reward information to a learning process elsewhere in the brain that updates choice mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Aminomethanesulfonic acid illuminates the boundary between full and partial agonists of the pentameric glycine receptor</a></h4>

              
                To clarify the determinants of agonist efficacy in pentameric ligand-gated ion channels we examined a new compound, aminomethanesulfonic acid (AMS), a molecule intermediate in structure between glycine and taurine. Despite wide availability, to date there are no reports of AMS action on glycine receptors, perhaps because AMS is unstable at physiological pH. Here we show that at pH 5, AMS is an efficacious agonist, eliciting in zebrafish α1 glycine receptors a maximum single channel open probability of 0.85, much greater than that of β-alanine (0.54) or taurine (0.12), and second only to that of glycine itself (0.96). Thermodynamic cycle analysis of the efficacy of these closely related agonists shows supra-additive interaction between changes in the length of the agonist molecule and the size of the anionic moiety. Single particle cryo-EM structures of AMS-bound glycine receptors show that the AMS-bound agonist pocket is as compact as with glycine, and three-dimensional classification demonstrates that the channel populates the open and the desensitized states, like glycine, but not the closed intermediate state associated with the weaker partial agonists, β-alanine and taurine. Because AMS is on the cusp between full and partial agonists, it provides a new tool to help us understand agonist action in the pentameric superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Membrane-mediated dimerization potentiates PIP5K lipid kinase activity</a></h4>

              
                The phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K) family of lipid modifying enzymes generate the majority of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>) lipids found at the plasma membrane in eukaryotic cells. PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> lipids serve a critical role in regulating receptor activation, ion channel gating, endocytosis, and actin nucleation. Here we describe how PIP5K activity is regulated by cooperative binding to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> lipids and membrane-mediated dimerization of the kinase domain. In contrast to constitutively dimeric phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate 4-kinase (PIP4K, type II PIPK), solution PIP5K exists in a weak monomer-dimer equilibrium. PIP5K monomers can associate with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> containing membranes and dimerize in a protein density dependent manner. Although dispensable for cooperative PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding, dimerization enhances the catalytic efficiency of PIP5K through a mechanism consistent with allosteric regulation. Additionally, dimerization amplifies stochastic variation in the kinase reaction velocity and strengthens effects such as the recently described stochastic geometry sensing. Overall, the mechanism of PIP5K membrane binding creates a broad dynamic range of lipid kinase activities that are coupled to the density of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and membrane bound kinase.

                Automating the extraction of meaningful temporal information from sequences of microscopy images represents a major challenge to characterize dynamical biological processes. So far, strong limitations in the ability to quantitatively analyze single-cell trajectories have prevented large-scale investigations to assess the dynamics of entry into replicative senescence in yeast. Here, we have developed DetecDiv, a microfluidic-based image acquisition platform combined with deep learning-based software for high-throughput single-cell division tracking. We show that DetecDiv can automatically reconstruct cellular replicative lifespans with high accuracy and performs similarly with various imaging platforms and geometries of microfluidic traps. In addition, this methodology provides comprehensive temporal cellular metrics using time-series classification and image semantic segmentation. Last, we show that this method can be further applied to automatically quantify the dynamics of cellular adaptation and real-time cell survival upon exposure to environmental stress. Hence, this methodology provides an all-in-one toolbox for high-throughput phenotyping for cell cycle, stress response, and replicative lifespan assays.

                Cellular behaviors emerge from layers of molecular interactions: proteins interact to form complexes, pathways, and phenotypes. We show that hierarchical networks of protein interactions can be defined from the statistical pattern of proteome variation measured across thousands of diverse bacteria and that these networks reflect the emergence of complex bacterial phenotypes. Our results are validated through gene-set enrichment analysis and comparison to existing experimentally-derived databases. We demonstrate the biological utility of our approach by creating a model of motility in <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and using it to identify a protein that affects pilus-mediated motility. Our method, SCALES (Spectral Correlation Analysis of Layered Evolutionary Signals), may be useful for interrogating genotype-phenotype relationships in bacteria.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modulating behavioral signatures of rhythmic auditory entrainment with tACS</a></h4>

              
                Synchronization between auditory stimuli and brain rhythms is beneficial for processing auditory information. In principle, auditory perception could be improved by facilitating neural entrainment to sounds via brain stimulation. Here we aimed to modulate auditory perception by modulating neural entrainment to frequency modulated (FM) sounds using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). In addition, we aimed to evaluate the advantage of using tACS montages spatially optimized for each individual based on anatomy and functional data compared to a standard montage applied to all participants. Across two different sessions, 2-Hz tACS was applied targeting auditory brain regions either with a standard or with an individually optimized electrode montage. Concurrent with tACS, participants listened to FM stimuli with modulation rate matching the tACS frequency but with different phase lags relative to the tACS, and detected silent gaps embedded in the FM sound. As expected, gap detection was sinusoidally modulated by the phase of the 2-Hz FM stimulus into which the gap fell. TACS did not affect the optimal FM-stimulus phase for gap detection, but it modulated the amplitude of the FM-stimulus induced behavioral modulation, a behavioral signature of the strength of neural entrainment, in a phase-lag specific manner. Both the optimal tACS lag and the magnitude of the tACS effect were variable across participants and sessions. Inter-individual variability of tACS effects was explained by the interactions between different electric field properties including the strength of the inward electric field, the field focality and the proximity of the electric field peak to the target brain region. Although no main effect of tACS montage was observed on the strength of tACS effects, our results suggest lower inter-individual variability in the individualized-montage group compared to the standard group. Taken together, our results show that tACS is an effective tool to modulate behavioral entrainment to sounds, and its efficacy depends on the specific properties of the applied electric field. However, the lack of reliability on optimal tACS lags calls for caution when planning tACS experiments based on separate sessions.

                Protein aggregation is one of the major pathological events in age-related Parkinson disease (PD) pathology, predominantly regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). UPS essentially requires core component ubiquitin however, its role in PD pathology is obscure. This study aimed to investigate the role of ubiquitin encoding genes in the early phase of PD pathology. Wild-type human Myc--synuclein transfected neurons, -synuclein-PFFs treated cells, rotenone-induced sporadic models of PD and SNCA C57BL/6J-Tg (Th-SNCA*A30P*A53T)39 Eric/J transgenic mice showed downregulated level of UBA52 in conjunction with significant downregulation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and neuronal death. In silico predictions, mass spectrometric analysis and co-immunoprecipitation findings suggested strong interaction of UBA52 with -synuclein, HSP90 and E3-ubiquitin ligase CHIP, besides its co-localization with -synuclein in the mitochondrion. Next, in vitro ubiquitylation assay indicated an imperative requirement of the lysine-63 residue of UBA52 in CHIP-mediated HSP90 ubiquitylation. Myc-UBA52 expressed neurons exhibited the downregulated -synuclein protein abundance with increased TH and restored proteasome activity during the diseased condition. Furthermore, Myc-UBA52 expression inhibited the augmented HSP90 protein level along with its various client proteins, HSP75 (homologue of HSP90 in mitochondrion) and ER stress-related markers during early PD. Taken together, data highlights the critical role of UBA52 in HSP90 ubiquitylation in parallel to its potential contribution to the modulation of various disease-related neurodegenerative signaling targets during the early phase of PD pathology.

                Updating the value of sensory cues through experiences is a critical element of adaptive behavior. Although dopaminergic neurons (DANs) achieve this by driving associative learning, whether they contribute to assessment of sensory values outside the context of association remains largely unexplored. Here we show in Drosophila that DANs in the mushroom body encode the innate value of odors and constantly update the current value by inducing plasticity during olfactory navigation. Simulation of neuronal activity in a network based on the connectome data reproduced the characteristics of DAN responses, proposing a concrete circuit mechanism for computation. Notably, odors alone induced value- and dopamine-dependent changes in the activity of mushroom body output neurons, which store the current value of odors, as well as the behavior of flies steering in a virtual environment. Thus, the DAN circuit known for discrete, associative learning also continuously updates odor values during navigation in a non-associative manner.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Novel gene-intergenic fusion involving ubiquitin E3 ligase UBE3C causes distal hereditary motor neuropathy: A new mechanism for motor neuron degeneration.</a></h4>

              
                Distal hereditary motor neuropathies (dHMNs) are a group of inherited diseases involving the progressive, length-dependent axonal degeneration of the lower motor neurons. There are currently 29 reported causative genes and 4 disease loci implicated in dHMN. Despite the high genetic heterogeneity, mutations in the known genes account for less than 20% of dHMN cases with the mutations identified predominantly being point mutations or indels. We have expanded the spectrum of dHMN mutations with the identification of a 1.35 Mb complex structural variation (SV) causing a form of autosomal dominant dHMN (DHMN1 OMIM %182906). Given the complex nature of SV mutations and the importance of studying pathogenic mechanisms in a neuronal setting, we generated a patient-derived DHMN1 motor neuron model harbouring the 1.35 Mb complex insertion. The DHMN1 complex insertion creates a duplicated copy of the first 10 exons of the ubiquitin-protein E3 ligase gene (UBE3C) and forms a novel gene-intergenic fusion sense transcript by incorporating a terminal pseudo-exon from intergenic sequence within the DHMN1 locus. The UBE3C intergenic fusion (UBE3C-IF) transcript does not undergo nonsense-mediated decay and results in a significant reduction of wild type full length UBE3C (UBE3C-WT) protein levels in DHMN1 iPSC-derived motor neurons. An engineered transgenic C. elegans model expressing the UBE3C-IF transcript in GABA-ergic motor neurons shows neuronal synaptic transmission deficits. Furthermore, the transgenic animals are susceptible to heat stress which may implicate defective protein homeostasis underlying DHMN1 pathogenesis. Identification of the novel UBE3C-IF gene-intergenic fusion transcript in motor neurons highlights a potential new disease mechanism underlying axonal and motor neuron degeneration. These complementary models serve as a powerful paradigm for studying the DHMN1 complex SV and an invaluable tool for defining therapeutic targets for DHMN1.

                Early experience with food influences taste preference in adulthood. How gustatory experience influences development of taste preferences and refinement of cortical circuits has not been investigated. Here we exposed weanling mice to an array of tastants and determined the effects on the preference for sweet in adulthood. We demonstrate an experience-dependent shift in sucrose preference persisting several weeks following the termination of exposure. A shift in sucrose palatability, altered neural responsiveness to sucrose, and inhibitory synaptic plasticity in the gustatory portion of the insular cortex (GC) were also induced. The modulation of sweet preference occurred within a restricted developmental window, but restoration of the capacity for inhibitory plasticity in adult GC reactivated the sensitivity of sucrose preference to taste experience. Our results establish a fundamental link between gustatory experience, sweet-preference, inhibitory plasticity, and cortical circuit function, and highlight the importance of early life experience in setting taste preferences.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Internal states as a source of subject-dependent movement variability and their representation by large-scale networks</a></h4>

              
                A human's ability to adapt and learn relies on reflecting on past performance. Such reflections form latent factors called internal states that induce variability of movement and behavior to improve performance. Internal states are critical for survival, yet their temporal dynamics and neural substrates are less understood. Here, we link internal states with motor performance and neural activity using state-space models and local field potentials captured from depth electrodes in over 100 brain regions. Ten human subjects performed a goal-directed center-out reaching task with perturbations applied to random trials, causing subjects to fail goals and reflect on their performance. Using computational methods, we identified two internal states, indicating that subjects kept track of past errors and perturbations, that predicted variability in reaction times and speed errors. These states granted access to latent information indicative of how subjects strategize learning from trial history, impacting their overall performance. We further found that large-scale brain networks differentially encoded these internal states. The dorsal attention network encoded past errors in frequencies above 100 Hz, suggesting a role in modulating attention based on tracking recent performance in working memory. The default network encoded past perturbations in frequencies below 15 Hz, suggesting a role in achieving robust performance in an uncertain environment. Moreover, these networks more strongly encoded internal states and were more functionally connected in higher performing subjects, whose learning strategy was to respond by countering with behavior that opposed accumulating error. Taken together, our findings suggest large-scale brain networks as a neural basis of strategy. These networks regulate movement variability, through internal states, to improve motor performance.

                An essential feature of neurons is their ability to centrally integrate information from their dendrites. The activity of astrocytes, on the other hand, has been described to be mostly uncoordinated across the cellular compartments and therefore without central integration. Here, we describe conditional centripetal integration, a principle how astrocytes integrate calcium signals from their distal processes. We performed calcium imaging of hippocampal astrocytes and neurons in head-fixed mice, together with monitoring of body movements and pupil diameter. Global astrocytic activity was well explained by the concurrent pupil diameter as a proxy for arousal, but equally well as leaky integration of past neuronal and behavioral events on a timescale of seconds. This integration of past events occurred in a centripetal pattern in individual astrocytes, starting in distal processes followed by a slow propagation towards the soma. Centripetal propagation was facilitated by high levels of arousal but impeded when pre-event calcium levels were high. Together, our results establish astrocytes as computational units of the brain that slowly and conditionally integrate information about the past.

                The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is a forebrain region implicated in aversive responses to uncertain threat. Much of the work on the role of BNST in defensive behavior has used Pavlovian paradigms in which the subject reacts to aversive stimuli delivered in a pattern determined entirely by the experimenter. Here, we report that BNST also mediates proactive defensive responses in a task that allows subjects to prevent the delivery of an aversive outcome. In a standard two-way signaled active avoidance paradigm, male rats learned to shuttle during a tone to avoid shock. Our data demonstrate that chemogenetic inhibition (hM4Di) of BNST attenuates the expression of the avoidance response, whereas chemogenetic activation (hM3Dq) of BNST potentiates the response by extending the period of tone-evoked shuttling. This effect was specific to the BNST, as inactivation of the neighboring medial septum produced no effect on the expression of avoidance. These data support the novel conclusion that BNST mediates two-way avoidance behavior in male rats.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Patterns of NFkB activation resulting from damage, reactive microglia, cytokines, and growth factors in the mouse retina</a></h4>

              
                Muller glia are a cellular source for neuronal regeneration in vertebrate retinas. However, the capacity for retinal regeneration varies widely across species. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate the reprogramming of Muller glia into progenitor cells is key to reversing the loss of vision that occurs with retinal diseases. In the mammalian retina, NFkB signaling promotes glial reactivity and represses the reprogramming of Muller glia into progenitor cells. Here we investigate different cytokines, growth factors, cell signaling pathways, and damage paradigms that influence NFkB-signaling in the mouse retina. We find that exogenous TNF and IL1b; potently activate NFkB-signaling in Muller glia in undamaged retinas, and this activation is independent of microglia. By comparison, TLR1/2 agonist indirectly activates NFkB-signaling in Muller glia, and this activation depends on the presence of microglia as Tlr2 is predominantly expressed by microglia, but not other types of retinal cells. Exogenous FGF2 did not activate NFkB-signaling, whereas CNTF, Osteopontin, WNT4, or inhibition of GSK3b; activated NFkB in Muller glia in the absence of neuronal damage. By comparison, dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid agonist, suppressed NFkB-signaling in Muller glia in damaged retinas, in addition to reducing numbers of dying cells and the accumulation of reactive microglia. Although NMDA-induced retinal damage activated NFkB in Muller glia, optic nerve crush had no effect on NFkB activation within the retina, whereas glial cells within the optic nerve were responsive. We conclude that the NFkB pathway is activated in retinal Muller glia in response to many different cell signaling pathways, and activation often depends on signals produced by reactive microglia.

	<p>Exendin-4 (Ex-4), better known in its synthetic form and used clinically as exenatide, currently applied in the treatment of diabetes, induces a beneficial impact on nerve cells, and shows promising effects in obstructive lung diseases. At an advanced age, the development of the neurodegenerative process of brain tissue is masked by numerous concomitant diseases. The initial latent phase of neurodegenerative disease results in occurrence of manifestations at an advanced stage. To protect the brain and to simultaneously ensure proper treatment of common coexisting conditions in late life, such as diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or asthma, a pleiotropic medication should be chosen. Molecular mechanisms of Ex-4 exert neuroprotective effects or lead to secondary neurogenesis. Additionally, Ex-4 plays an important role in anti-inflammatory actions which are necessary both in the case of asthma and Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. Specific receptors in the lungs also reduce the secretion of surfactants, which decreases the risk of exacerbation in chronic obstructive lung disease. In a great number of patients suffering from diabetes, asthma, or chronic lung disease, there is a great potential for both treatment of the main condition and protection against brain neurodegeneration.</p>

	<p>Objective. To explore the most important predictors of post-operative efficacy in patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM). Methods. From January 2013 to January 2019, 284 patients with DCM were enrolled. They were categorized based on the different surgical methods used: single anterior cervical decompression and fusion (ACDF) (n = 80), double ACDF (n = 56), three ACDF (n = 13), anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion (ACCF) (n = 63), anterior cervical hybrid decompression and fusion (ACHDF) (n = 25), laminoplasty (n = 38) and laminectomy and fusion (n = 9). The follow-up time was 2 years. The patients were divided into two groups based on the mJOA recovery rate at the last follow-up: Group A (the excellent improvement group, mJOA recovery rate &amp;amp;gt;50%, n = 213) and Group B (the poor improvement group, mJOA recovery rate &amp;amp;le;50%, n = 71). The evaluated data included age, gender, BMI, duration of symptoms (months), smoking, drinking, number of lesion segments, surgical methods, surgical time, blood loss, the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), CCI classification, imaging parameters (CL, T1S, C2-7SVA, CL (F), T1S (F), C2-7SVA (F), CL (E), T1S (E), C2-7SVA (E), CL (ROM), T1S (ROM) and C2-7SVA (ROM)), maximum spinal cord compression (MSCC), maximum canal compromise (MCC), Transverse area (TA), Transverse area ratio (TAR), compression ratio (CR) and the Coefficient compression ratio (CCR). The visual analog score (VAS), neck disability index (NDI), modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) and mJOA recovery rate were used to assess cervical spinal function and quality of life. Results. We found that there was no significant difference in the baseline data among the different surgical groups and that there were only significant differences in the number of lesion segments, C2&amp;amp;ndash;7SVA, T1S (F), T1S (ROM), TA, CR, surgical time and blood loss. Therefore, there was comparability of the post-operative recovery among the different surgical groups, and we found that there were significant differences in age, the duration of symptoms, CL and pre-mJOA between Group A and Group B. A binary logistic regression analysis showed that the duration of the symptoms was an independent risk factor for post-operative efficacy in patients with DCM. Meanwhile, when the duration of symptoms was &amp;amp;ge;6.5 months, the prognosis of patients was more likely to be poor, and the probability of a poor prognosis increased by 0.196 times for each additional month of symptom duration (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, OR = 1.196). Conclusion. For patients with DCM (regardless of the number of lesion segments and the proposed surgical methods), the duration of symptoms was an independent risk factor for the post-operative efficacy. When the duration of symptoms was &amp;amp;ge;6.5 months, the prognosis of patients was more likely to be poor, and the probability of a poor prognosis increased by 0.196 times for each additional month of symptom duration (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, OR = 1.196).</p>

	<p>Task fMRI provides an opportunity to analyze the working mechanisms of the human brain during specific experimental paradigms. Deep learning models have increasingly been applied for decoding and encoding purposes study to representations in task fMRI data. More recently, graph neural networks, or neural networks models designed to leverage the properties of graph representations, have recently shown promise in task fMRI decoding studies. Here, we propose an end-to-end graph convolutional network (GCN) framework with three convolutional layers to classify task fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project dataset. We compared the predictive performance of our GCN model across four of the most widely used node embedding algorithms&amp;amp;mdash;NetMF, RandNE, Node2Vec, and Walklets&amp;amp;mdash;to automatically extract the structural properties of the nodes in the functional graph. The empirical results indicated that our GCN framework accurately predicted individual differences (0.978 and 0.976) with the NetMF and RandNE embedding methods, respectively. Furthermore, to assess the effects of individual differences, we tested the classification performance of the model on sub-datasets divided according to gender and fluid intelligence. Experimental results indicated significant differences in the classification predictions of gender, but not high/low fluid intelligence fMRI data. Our experiments yielded promising results and demonstrated the superior ability of our GCN in modeling task fMRI data.</p>

	<p>Warmth and competence are fundamental dimensions of social cognition. This also applies to the interpretation of ambiguous symbolic stimuli in terms of their relation to warmth or competence. The affective state of an individual may affect the way people interpret the neutral stimuli in the environment. As previous findings have shown, it is possible to alter the perception of neutral social stimuli in terms of warmth vs. competence by eliciting an incidental affect with the use of emotion-laden words. In the current experiment, we expected the valence and origin of an affective state, factors ascribing emotionally laden words, to be able to switch the interpretation of the neutral objects. We have shown in behavioural results that negative valence and reflective origins promote the interpretation of unknown objects in terms of competence rather than warmth. Furthermore, electrophysiological-response-locked analyses revealed differences specific to negative valence while making the decision in the ambiguous task and while executing it. The results of the current experiment show that the usage of warmth and competence in social cognition is susceptible to affective state manipulation. In addition, the results are coherent with the evolutionary perspective on social cognition (valence effects) as well as with predictions of the dual mind model of emotion (origin effects).</p>

	<p>Grey matter volume reductions in the right superior temporal gyrus (rSTG) were observed in young adults who learned to ride a unicycle. As these decreases were correlated with the acquired ability in unicycling, the authors interpreted the change as a brain tissue reorganization to increase postural control&amp;amp;rsquo;s automated and efficient coordination. The current study aims to further corroborate this interpretation by looking at changes in the functional brain network in the very same sample of participants. For this reason, we applied graph theory, a mathematics field used to study network structure functionality. Four global and two local graph-theoretical parameters were calculated to measure whole brain and rSTG specific changes in functional network activity following the three-week-unicycle training. Findings revealed that the Local Efficiency of the rSTG was significantly elevated after the intervention indicating an increase in fault tolerance of the rSTG, possibly reflecting decentralisation of rSTG specific functions to neighbouring nodes. Thus, the increased Local Efficiency may indicate increased task efficiency by decentralising the processing of functions crucial for balance.</p>

	<p>The cognitive impairment of pituitary adenomas (PAs) has received increasing attention. Hyperprolactinemia and tumor mass effect are the potential causes. The aim of this study was to identify possible cognitive impairment and to further explore the correlation between these indices and prolactin (PRL) levels, based on the control of tumor size. Twenty-seven patients with prolactinomas (patient group) and twenty-six matched health control group (HC group) were enrolled in this study. All participants performed the flanker task while we continuously recorded electroencephalography data. On the behavioral performance level, patients showed a significantly slower reaction time (RT) in both flanker types. Concerning the event-related potentials level, patients elicited reduced P2 and enhanced N2 amplitudes compared with the HC group, suggesting an impairment of attentional processing (P2) and conflict monitoring (N2). Moreover, the patient group also induced lower P3 amplitudes relative to the HC group in both types, indicating that there were deficits in attentional resource allocation ability. We also found a significant correlation between the P3 amplitudes and incongruent condition RTs, as well as the subsequent PRL levels in the patient group. In conclusion, this is an innovative study that reveals the impaired cognition abilities in prolactinomas, and also proposes the possible cognitive toxicity of oversecreted PRL levels, which provides evidence for further research on the cognitive decline in PAs.</p>

	<p>Local tirofiban infusion has been reported as a rescue strategy for intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS)-related stroke. However, the long-term outcomes of local tirofiban infusion during endovascular reperfusion therapy (ERT) for ICAS-related stroke are still uncertain. This study aimed to investigate the long-term outcomes of local tirofiban infusion during ERT. We retrospectively analyzed acute patients with ICAS-related stroke who were treated with local tirofiban as a rescue strategy during ERT. The primary outcomes were ischemic stroke, transient ischemic stroke (TIA), and stroke-related death within 30 days. Secondary outcomes included ischemic stroke and TIA beyond 30 days and up to 2 years after ERT in the corresponding treated vessel, symptomatic brain hemorrhage, any stroke, and non-stroke-related death. During a median follow-up of 24.0 months, 12 patients developed an ischemic stroke and TIA (4 within 30 days and 8 afterward). The 1-year risk of stroke and TIA was 9.2% (95% confidence interval, 8.0&amp;amp;ndash;18.6%). This study demonstrates that 1-year outcomes of local tirofiban infusion were comparable to the results of intracranial stenting in patients with symptomatic ICAS. Local tirofiban infusion for ICAS-related stroke may be a feasible rescue strategy that can have a bridging role until the maximum effect of antiplatelet agents is achieved.</p>

<p>Using immunohistochemical and stereological methods, immunofluorescence assays, RNA sequencing and qRT–PCR techniques, we found that running exercise increased the total number of astrocytes and the density of newborn astrocytes and reversed the changes in the gene expression levels of GFAP, S100b, and the glutamate transporters GLT-1 and GLAST in the mPFC of CUS animals. Our results suggested that changes in the astrocyte number and glutamate transporter function may be potential meditators of the effects of running exercise in the treatment of depression.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Depression is one of the most common mental illnesses and seriously affects all aspects of life. Running exercise has been suggested to prevent or alleviate the occurrence and development of depression; however, the underlying mechanisms of these effects remain unclear. Independent studies have indicated that astrocytes play essential roles and that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is an important brain region involved in the pathology underlying depression. However, it is unknown whether running exercise achieves antidepressant effects by affecting the number of astrocytes and glutamate transport function in the mPFC. Here, animal models of depression were established using chronic unpredictable stress (CUS), and depression-like behavior was assessed by the sucrose preference test. After successfully establishing the depression model, experimental animals performed running exercise. Glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive (GFAP<sup>+</sup>) cell number in the mPFC was precisely quantified using immunohistochemical and stereological methods<span style="text-decoration:underline">,</span> and the densities of bromodeoxyuridine-positive (BrdU<sup>+</sup>) and BrdU<sup>+</sup>/GFAP<sup>+</sup> cells in the mPFC were measured using a semiquantitative immunofluorescence assay. Changes in glutamate transporter gene expression in mPFC astrocytes were detected by mRNA sequencing and qRT–PCR. We found that running exercise reversed CUS-induced decreases in sucrose preference, increased astrocyte number and the density of newborn astrocytes, and reversed decreases in gene expression levels of GFAP, S100b, and the glutamate transporters GLT-1 and GLAST in the mPFC of CUS animals. These results suggested that changes in astrocyte number and glutamate transporter function may be potential meditators of the effects of running exercise in the treatment of depression.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Factors associated with health facility delivery in Kitui County: a cross sectional study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: High maternal mortality rate is a major public health concern in developing countries.  Skilled birth delivery is central to reducing maternal mortality, yet health facility delivery remains low in Kitui County, Kenya. Our study estimated prevalence of unskilled delivery and identified factors associated with health facility delivery in Kitui County. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted December 2017-February 2018. 245 women from five administrative wards were interviewed. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data. Variables that had p value ≤0.05 in bivariate analysis were included in multivariable regression model to assess for confounders. Variables with a p value of ≤0.05 in multivariate analysis were considered statistically significant at 95% CI.  Results: We interviewed 245 (240 analyzed) women from the five wards; the majority were 16-25 years age group (45.5%; 110/240).  Mean age was 27±6.6 years. Prevalence of health facility delivery was 50.4%. Distance from a health facility, number of children in a household, occupation of the respondent’s partner, number of antenatal clinic (ANC) visits and means of transport were significant factors for not delivering in a health facility. On multivariate analysis, women who lived >5km from health facility were less likely to deliver in a health facility (AOR =0.36; 95% CI 0.15- 0.86). Women who attended ≥ 4 ANC visits were 4 times more likely to deliver in a health facility (95% CI 2.01-8.79). Conclusions: More than half of the respondents delivered in a health facility. A long distance from the health facility is a hindrance to accessing ANC services. Inadequate ANC visits was associated with home delivery. Improving accessibility of health care services and health education on family planning would increase delivery at a health facility. We recommend Kitui County introduce five satellite clinics/ambulatory services for expectant women to access ANC and maternal services.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Single-cell multiomics analyses of spindle-transferred human embryos suggest a mostly normal embryonic development</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shuyue Qi, Wei Wang, Xiaohui Xue, Zhuo Lu, Jia Yan, Yunfei Li, Yu Zhang, Mingming Shu, Chunlan Song, Qihang Wang, Yunhai Chuai, Xinyu Zhai, Shujie Han, Fuchou Tang, Wei Shang</p>

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations are often associated with incurable diseases and lead to detectable pathogenic variants in 1 out of 200 babies. Uncoupling of the inheritance of mtDNA and the nuclear genome by spindle transfer (ST) can potentially prevent the transmission of mtDNA mutations from mother to offspring. However, no well-established studies have critically assessed the safety of this technique. Here, using single-cell triple omics sequencing method, we systematically analyzed the genome (copy number variation), DNA methylome, and transcriptome of ST and control blastocysts. The results showed that, compared to that in control embryos, the percentage of aneuploid cells in ST embryos did not significantly change. The epiblast, primitive endoderm, and trophectoderm (TE) of ST blastocysts presented RNA expression profiles that were comparable to those of control blastocysts. However, the DNA demethylation process in TE cells of ST blastocysts was slightly slower than that in the control blastocysts. Collectively, our results suggest that ST seems generally safe for embryonic development, with a relatively minor delay in the DNA demethylation process at the blastocyst stage.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The EICAT+ framework enables classification of positive impacts of alien taxa on native biodiversity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Giovanni Vimercati, Anna F. Probert, Lara Volery, Ruben Bernardo-Madrid, Sandro Bertolino, Vanessa Céspedes, Franz Essl, Thomas Evans, Belinda Gallardo, Laure Gallien, Pablo González-Moreno, Marie Charlotte Grange, Cang Hui, Jonathan M.

Wilson, Sven Bacher</p>

Species introduced through human-related activities beyond their native range, termed alien species, have various impacts worldwide. The IUCN Environmental Impact Classification for Alien Taxa (EICAT) is a global standard to assess negative impacts of alien species on native biodiversity. Alien species can also positively affect biodiversity (for instance, through food and habitat provisioning or dispersal facilitation) but there is currently no standardized and evidence-based system to classify positive impacts. We fill this gap by proposing EICAT+, which uses 5 semiquantitative scenarios to categorize the magnitude of positive impacts, and describes underlying mechanisms. EICAT+ can be applied to all alien taxa at different spatial and organizational scales. The application of EICAT+ expands our understanding of the consequences of biological invasions and can inform conservation decisions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Parents’ perceptions on policies of early childhood care and education programmes in selected states of Malaysia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The 2030 agenda for sustainable development proposed global equitable quality education and lifelong learning opportunities for all children. The quality of early childhood care and education (ECCE) programs helps shape children’s minds, attitudes and behaviors, and has short and long-term effects on a child, a family and a country. In Malaysia, the government has formulated some policies and laws to protect children’s rights. However, ECCE is facing some challenges. The purpose of this study is to investigate parents’ perceptions of the quality of ECCE programs implemented by Malaysian government. Methods: A mixed method was used to collect data on parents’ perceptions of ECCE policies in selected states in Malaysia. The questionnaires, (P1/POL) from the research project “Development of a Comprehensive and Integrated Model of Quality Malaysian ECCE”, were distributed among 629 respondents who have a child in a preschool, and 22 participants were randomly selected to take part in five focus group interviews Results: The key findings of the study revealed 68% parents were not familiar with ECCE Malaysian government policy, however 84.3% stressed it is important for the government to educate them about ECCE. Thus findings indicated that the majority of parents lack awareness of the ECCE policies and quality of early childhood care and education programs related to the policies remain the issue. While interviewing the focus group ,most of them were not aware of ECCE and pointed out parents are stressing children’s academic learning in particular preschools. Conclusions: It is concluded that parents’ awareness regarding the ECCE program must be part of the policies and needs to improve. It is recommended that the government of Malaysia should supply more information on ECCE policies to parents and focus on policy implementation. Moreover, the quality of ECCE programs should be improved based on the parents’ perceptions.

                Background: Construction development in Indonesia is growing rapidly, especially in Central Aceh District. Construction projects have distinctive characteristics and are very complex, so that risk events can have a serious impact on the viability of the project. Project delays can result in cost overruns and project losses. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the factors causing project delays.The purpose of this study was to (1) identify the risk factors that cause delays in construction projects and (2) determine those particular risk factors that have a greater influence on construction projects. The location of this research was Central Aceh District. Methods: The data in this study were primary data in the form of a questionnaire and secondary data obtained from the literature related to this particular type of research. Questionnaires were distributed to respondents, namely contractor companies located in the Central Aceh District. The questionnaires were distributed to determine respondents' opinions about the level of influence of risk factors causing project delays. We used a validity test, reliability test, and descriptive analysis for data processing. Results: Based on the results of the study from 47 respondents, the “very high influence” category (Mode=5) for the tool malfunction factor, cost estimation inaccuracy, increased work costs, implementation of new technologies, details, accuracy and conformity to specifications that are not appropriate, worker quarrels, poor project planning and management, poor condition at locations and accessibility difficulty. Conclusions: Of the 80 risk factors that caused project delays, eight risk factors were found to have a very high influence on the implementation of construction projects in Central Aceh District. Practical implications: The results of this study provide knowledge to contractor companies about the delay factors that have the most influence on project implementation so that they are expected to be able to manage risks to avoid losses.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Hobotnica: exploring molecular signature quality [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                A Molecular Features Set (MFS), is a result of a vast diversity of bioinformatics pipelines. The lack of a “gold standard” for most experimental data modalities makes it difficult to provide valid estimation for a particular MFS's quality. Yet, this goal can partially be achieved by analyzing inner-sample Distance Matrices (DM) and their power to distinguish between phenotypes. The quality of a DM can be assessed by summarizing its power to quantify the differences of inner-phenotype and outer-phenotype distances. This estimation of the DM quality can be construed as a measure of the MFS's quality.  Here we propose Hobotnica, an approach to estimate MFSs quality by their ability to stratify data, and assign them significance scores, that allow for collating various signatures and comparing their quality for contrasting groups.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Overdose symptoms and positive affect in never-established smokers are moderated by nicotine patch type: A between-subjects experimental investigation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A growing number of studies have assessed the effects of acute nicotine on affect, cognition, and brain activity in never-established smokers in attempts to identify mechanisms by which nicotine promotes progression to dependence. However, these acute administration studies have not adequately addressed the problem of potential adverse side effects due to lack of tolerance, such as nausea, feelings of sickness, lightheadedness, and general negative affect and malaise – a term referred to as nicotine overdose events (NODEs). Thus, we report the first study to carefully characterize the prevalence, intensity, and effects of NODEs in never-established-smokers after acute nicotine administration. Methods: We compared the subjective effects of two different 7 mg nicotine patches that have different pharmacokinetics on never-established smokers (n = 67). One patch produces gradual increases in blood nicotine and the other produces more rapid increases in blood nicotine. Results: The findings suggest that in never-smokers, the lowest dose (7 mg) of rapid blood nicotine-rise patches are associated with a high prevalence of NODEs (45.83%) and decreased positive affect (PA) (54.17%) compared to a placebo patch (8.34% for NODEs and 33.34% for PA). The slow-rise patch did not significantly affect nicotine overdose symptoms or PA. Conclusions: Fast blood-rise nicotine patches may not be an ecologically valid method of nicotine delivery to never-smokers, while slow-rise nicotine patches, lower dose, and self-paced dosing may be more appropriate in this population. Findings also highlight the importance of the careful assessment of NODES in this population.

                It is indisputable that every day it is demonstrated that natural products present diverse therapeutic benefits, which has boosted their incorporation within various products for clinical use. However, this must be accompanied by knowledge of their effect on cell lines to ensure their use is safe. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of two ethanolic extracts based on Peruvian natural products, on three human cell lines. Cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa), human gingival fibroblasts (HGF-1 - ATCC CRL-2014) (HGF-1) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were cultured and subsequently treated with preparations of ethanolic extracts of propolis (EEP) and Psidium guajava (EEG) from a concentration of 50 mg/mL to 0.024 mg/mL, by the 3-(4,5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazole bromide reduction assay. At a concentration of 0.24 mg/mL EEG, viability of 99.7±1.24%, 99.8±2.2% and 99.7±2.7% was observed in HeLa, HGF-1 and PBMCs, respectively; >90% cell viability values were observed with EPP at 0.024 mg/mL, with HGF-1 showing the highest viability (96.9±1.15%). A dose-dependent effect was observed for both extracts with a decrease in cell viability as concentrations increased (up to 50 mg/mL). EEP and EEG extracts at low concentrations do not show cytotoxicity in human cell lines, these findings are an advance in the preclinical evaluation on their safety and open a continuity to further studies for their potential applications in dentistry and medicine.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Cocaine increases quantal norepinephrine secretion through NET-dependent PKC activation in locus coeruleus neurons</a></h4>

              
                Zhu et al. report that the addictive drug cocaine directly increases norepinephrine (NE) release from locus coeruleus neurons, which requires the activity of the NE transporter and PKC. In addition to cocaine’s role in the blockade of NE reuptake, this study provides an alternative mechanism for cocaine affecting the brain and behaviors.

                Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) mutations drive succinate accumulation in tumor microenvironments. Gudgeon et al. observe that succinate suppresses T cell degranulation and cytokine secretion, particularly IFN-γ. This is associated with succinate uptake, inhibited succinyl-CoA synthetase activity, and impaired tricarboxylic acid cycle flux. Consistently, IFN-γ-induced genes are suppressed in SDH-deficient neuroendocrine tumors.

Impaired NMDAR trafficking causes deficits in consolidation of fear memory. These results suggest that NMDA trafficking is essential for synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Lateralization of short-term memory in the frontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The left and right brain do not contribute equally to cognition. Yin et al. find that the frontal cortex shows left- or right-brain dominance during short-term memory in a sensory-motor association dependent way. The dominant hemisphere influences coding activity in the non-dominant hemisphere, but not vice versa.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Neuronal paxillin and drebrin mediate BDNF-induced force transduction and growth cone turning in a soft-tissue-like environment</a></h4>

              
                Chen et al. report that growth cones of 0.1 kPa neurons exhibit a highly coordinated T-zone activity. Neurotrophic-factor-directed growth cone movement on soft substrates depends on drebrin phosphorylation and paxillin-drebrin association, but not on Src activity, a mechanism distinct from the one observed on conventional glass coverslips.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Striatonigrostriatal circuit architecture for disinhibition of dopamine signaling</a></h4>

              
                Ambrosi and Lerner investigate a basal ganglia circuit—the ascending spiral—long hypothesized to underlie habit formation by allowing disinhibition of dopamine signaling in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS). They find that synaptic connectivity in the ascending spiral is present, but the circuit cannot support straightforward disinhibition of DLS dopamine signaling.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">A central alarm system that gates multi-sensory innate threat cues to the amygdala</a></h4>

              
                Kang et al. report that two CGRP-expressing neuronal populations in the thalamus and brainstem are activated by innate threat cues from various sensory modalities and are required for their perception. These CGRP neurons relay multi-sensory threat cues to the lateral and central amygdala, forming two parallel pathways for aversive memory formation.
