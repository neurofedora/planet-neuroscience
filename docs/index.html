                arXiv:2409.12990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANN) were inspired by the architecture and functions of the human brain and have revolutionised the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Inspired by studies on the latent geometry of the brain we posit that an increase in the research and application of hyperbolic geometry in machine learning will lead to increased accuracy, improved feature space representations and more efficient models across a range of tasks. We look at the structure and functions of the human brain, highlighting the alignment between the brain's hierarchical nature and hyperbolic geometry. By examining the brain's complex network of neuron connections and its cognitive processes, we illustrate how hyperbolic geometry plays a pivotal role in human intelligence. Empirical evidence indicates that hyperbolic neural networks outperform Euclidean models for tasks including natural language processing, computer vision and complex network analysis, requiring fewer parameters and exhibiting better generalisation. Despite its nascent adoption, hyperbolic geometry holds promise for improving machine learning models and advancing the field toward AGI.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13597">Fluctuation-learning relationship in neural networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.13597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning in neural systems occurs through change in synaptic connectivity that is driven by neural activity. Learning performance is influenced by both neural activity and the task to be learned. Experimental studies suggest a link between learning speed and variability in neural activity before learning. However, the theoretical basis of this relationship has remained unclear. In this work, using principles from the fluctuation-response relation in statistical physics, we derive two formulae that connect neural activity with learning speed. The first formula shows that learning speed is proportional to the variance of spontaneous neural activity and the neural response to input. The second formula, for small input, indicates that speed is proportional to the variances of spontaneous activity in both target and input directions. These formulae apply to various learning tasks governed by Hebbian or generalized learning rules. Numerical simulations confirm that these formulae are valid beyond their theoretical assumptions, even in cases where synaptic connectivity undergoes large changes. Our theory predicts that learning speed increases with the gain of neuronal activation functions and the number of pre-embedded memories, as both enhance the variance of spontaneous neural fluctuations. Additionally, the formulae reveal which input/output relationships are easier to learn, aligning with experimental data. Thus, our results provide a theoretical foundation for the quantitative relationship between pre-learning neural activity fluctuations and learning speed, offering insights into a range of empirical observations.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13471">Stimulus-to-Stimulus Learning in RNNs with Cortical Inductive Biases</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.13471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Animals learn to predict external contingencies from experience through a process of conditioning. A natural mechanism for conditioning is stimulus substitution, whereby the neuronal response to a stimulus with no prior behavioral significance becomes increasingly identical to that generated by a behaviorally significant stimulus it reliably predicts. We propose a recurrent neural network model of stimulus substitution which leverages two forms of inductive bias pervasive in the cortex: representational inductive bias in the form of mixed stimulus representations, and architectural inductive bias in the form of two-compartment pyramidal neurons that have been shown to serve as a fundamental unit of cortical associative learning. The properties of these neurons allow for a biologically plausible learning rule that implements stimulus substitution, utilizing only information available locally at the synapses. We show that the model generates a wide array of conditioning phenomena, and can learn large numbers of associations with an amount of training commensurate with animal experiments, without relying on parameter fine-tuning for each individual experimental task. In contrast, we show that commonly used Hebbian rules fail to learn generic stimulus-stimulus associations with mixed selectivity, and require task-specific parameter fine-tuning. Our framework highlights the importance of multi-compartment neuronal processing in the cortex, and showcases how it might confer cortical animals the evolutionary edge.

                arXiv:2409.13669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is now substantial evidence for traveling waves and other structured spatiotemporal recurrent neural dynamics in cortical structures; but these observations have typically been difficult to reconcile with notions of topographically organized selectivity and feedforward receptive fields. We introduce a new 'spacetime' perspective on neural computation in which structured selectivity and dynamics are not contradictory but instead are complimentary. We show that spatiotemporal dynamics may be a mechanism by which natural neural systems encode approximate visual, temporal, and abstract symmetries of the world as conserved quantities, thereby enabling improved generalization and long-term working memory.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12966">An Efficient General-Purpose Optical Accelerator for Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.12966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General-purpose optical accelerators (GOAs) have emerged as a promising platform to accelerate deep neural networks (DNNs) due to their low latency and energy consumption. Such an accelerator is usually composed of a given number of interleaving Mach-Zehnder- Interferometers (MZIs). This interleaving architecture, however, has a low efficiency when accelerating neural networks of various sizes due to the mismatch between weight matrices and the GOA architecture. In this work, a hybrid GOA architecture is proposed to enhance the mapping efficiency of neural networks onto the GOA. In this architecture, independent MZI modules are connected with microring resonators (MRRs), so that they can be combined to process large neural networks efficiently. Each of these modules implements a unitary matrix with inputs adjusted by tunable coefficients. The parameters of the proposed architecture are searched using genetic algorithm. To enhance the accuracy of neural networks, selected weight matrices are expanded to multiple unitary matrices applying singular value decomposition (SVD). The kernels in neural networks are also adjusted to use up the on-chip computational resources. Experimental results show that with a given number of MZIs, the mapping efficiency of neural networks on the proposed architecture can be enhanced by 21.87%, 21.20%, 24.69%, and 25.52% for VGG16 and Resnet18 on datasets Cifar10 and Cifar100, respectively. The energy consumption and computation latency can also be reduced by over 67% and 21%, respectively.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13315">Exploring the Performance-Reproducibility Trade-off in Quality-Diversity</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.13315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms have exhibited promising results across many domains and applications. However, uncertainty in fitness and behaviour estimations of solutions remains a major challenge when QD is used in complex real-world applications. While several approaches have been proposed to improve the performance in uncertain applications, many fail to address a key challenge: determining how to prioritise solutions that perform consistently under uncertainty, in other words, solutions that are reproducible. Most prior methods improve fitness and reproducibility jointly, ignoring the possibility that they could be contradictory objectives. For example, in robotics, solutions may reliably walk at 90% of the maximum velocity in uncertain environments, while solutions that walk faster are also more prone to falling over. As this is a trade-off, neither one of these two solutions is "better" than the other. Thus, algorithms cannot intrinsically select one solution over the other, but can only enforce given preferences over these two contradictory objectives. In this paper, we formalise this problem as the performance-reproducibility trade-off for uncertain QD. We propose four new a-priori QD algorithms that find optimal solutions for given preferences over the trade-offs. We also propose an a-posteriori QD algorithm for when these preferences cannot be defined in advance. Our results show that our approaches successfully find solutions that satisfy given preferences. Importantly, by simply accounting for this trade-off, our approaches perform better than existing uncertain QD methods. This suggests that considering the performance-reproducibility trade-off unlocks important stepping stones that are usually missed when only performance is optimised.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13388">Scalable Multi-Objective Optimization for Robust Traffic Signal Control in Uncertain Environments</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.13388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent traffic signal control is essential to modern urban management, with important impacts on economic efficiency, environmental sustainability, and quality of daily life. However, in current decades, it continues to pose significant challenges in managing large-scale traffic networks, coordinating intersections, and ensuring robustness under uncertain traffic conditions. This paper presents a scalable multi-objective optimization approach for robust traffic signal control in dynamic and uncertain urban environments. A multi-objective optimization model is proposed in this paper, which incorporates stochastic variables and probabilistic traffic patterns to capture traffic flow dynamics and uncertainty. We propose an algorithm named Adaptive Hybrid Multi-Objective Optimization Algorithm (AHMOA), which addresses the uncertainties of city traffic, including network-wide signal coordination, fluctuating patterns, and environmental impacts. AHMOA simultaneously optimizes multiple objectives, such as average delay, network stability, and system robustness, while adapting to unpredictable changes in traffic. The algorithm combines evolutionary strategies with an adaptive mechanism to balance exploration and exploitation, and incorporates a memory-based evaluation mechanism to leverage historical traffic data. Simulations are conducted in different cities including Manhattan, Paris, Sao Paulo, and Istanbul. The experimental results demonstrate that AHMOA consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms and the algorithm is competent to provide scalable, robust Pareto optimal solutions for managing complex traffic systems under uncertain environments.

                arXiv:2409.13163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel mathematical framework for analyzing neural networks using tools from quiver representation theory. This framework enables us to quantify the similarity between a new data sample and the training data, as perceived by the neural network. By leveraging the induced quiver representation of a data sample, we capture more information than traditional hidden layer outputs. This quiver representation abstracts away the complexity of the computations of the forward pass into a single matrix, allowing us to employ simple geometric and statistical arguments in a matrix space to study neural network predictions. Our mathematical results are architecture-agnostic and task-agnostic, making them broadly applicable. As proof of concept experiments, we apply our results for the MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets on the problem of detecting adversarial examples on different MLP architectures and several adversarial attack methods. Our experiments can be reproduced with our \href{https://github.com/MarcoArmenta/Hidden-Activations-are-not-Enough}{publicly available repository}.

                arXiv:2409.13254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study facilitates the understanding of evolutionary transitions in individuality (ETIs) through a novel artificial life framework, named VitaNova, that intricately merges self-organization and natural selection to simulate the emergence of complex, reproductive groups. By dynamically modelling individual agents within an environment that challenges them with predators and spatial constraints, VitaNova elucidates the mechanisms by which simple agents evolve into cohesive units exhibiting collective reproduction. The findings underscore the synergy between self-organized behaviours and adaptive evolutionary strategies as fundamental drivers of ETIs. This approach not only contributes to a deeper understanding of higher-order biological individuality but also sets a new precedent in the empirical investigation of ETIs, challenging and extending current theoretical frameworks.

Despite their advantages, the dense structure of deep SNNs can still result in extra energy consumption. The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) posits that within dense neural networks, there exist winning Lottery Tickets (LTs), namely sub-networks, that can be obtained without compromising performance. Inspired by this, this paper delves into the spiking-based LTs (SLTs), examining their unique properties and potential for extreme efficiency. Then, two significant sparse \textbf{\textit{Rewards}} are gained through comprehensive explorations and meticulous experiments on SLTs across various dense structures. Moreover, a sparse algorithm tailored for spiking transformer structure, which incorporates convolution operations into the Patch Embedding Projection (ConvPEP) module, has been proposed to achieve Multi-level Sparsity (MultiSp). MultiSp refers to (1) Patch number sparsity; (2) ConvPEP weights sparsity and binarization; and (3) ConvPEP activation layer binarization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves extreme sparsity with only a slight performance decrease, paving the way for deploying energy-efficient neural networks in robotics and beyond.

	<p>Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, mainly affecting elderly individuals. AD is characterized by &amp;amp;beta;-amyloid plaques, abnormal tau tangles, neuronal loss, and metabolic disruptions. Recent studies have revealed the involvement of the kynurenine (KP) pathway and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in AD development. The KP pathway metabolizes tryptophan to produce neuroactive substances like kynurenine, kynurenic acid, and quinolinic acid. In AD, high levels of kynurenine and the neurotoxic quinolinic acid are associated with increased neuroinflammation and excitotoxicity; conversely, reduced levels of kynurenic acid, which acts as a glutamate receptor antagonist, compromise neuroprotection. Research has indicated elevated KP metabolites and enzymes in the hippocampus of AD patients and other tissues such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine. However, the finding that KP metabolites are AD biomarkers in blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine has been controversial. This controversy, stemming from the lack of consideration of the specific stage of AD, details of the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s treatment, cognitive deficits, and psychiatric comorbidities, underscores the need for more comprehensive research. AhR, a ligand-activated transcription factor, regulates immune response, oxidative stress, and xenobiotic metabolism. Various ligands, including tryptophan metabolites, can activate it. Some studies suggest that AhR activation contributes to AD, while others propose that it provides neuroprotection. This discrepancy may be explained by the specific ligands that activate AhR, highlighting the complex relationship between the KP pathway, AhR activation, and AD, where the same pathway can produce both neuroprotective and harmful effects.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: In the past two decades, significant advancements in neuromodulation techniques have occurred, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). According to the assumption that repeated stimulation within a condensed timeframe can yield sustained efficacy, an accelerated protocol may be more effective in reducing time to response. With those premises, this study aimed to evaluate a sample of TRD patients treated with standard repetitive TMS (rTMS) and accelerated rTMS (arTMS). Methods: Nine subjects were treated with standard rTMS and 19 with arTMS. Psychometric assessment was made at the baseline and one week, one month, and three months after the treatment. A linear mixed-effect regression was performed along with other appropriate statistical analyses. Results: A significant improvement over time was observed for both depressive and cognitive symptoms. Moreover, considering the reduction in the Montgomery&amp;amp;ndash;Asberg Depression Rating Scale scores, a better treatment response was observed in subjects treated with arTMS (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Conclusions: Our findings showed a significant difference between the two protocols in terms of clinical response. Although further studies are needed to confirm the superiority of arTMS, the better cost-effectiveness of this technique should be considered.</p>

	<p>Abstract: Background: The advent of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway has transformed the management of migraine, offering newfound optimism for clinicians and individuals with episodic migraine (EM) and chronic migraine (CM). While randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have provided crucial insights into the effectiveness and safety profiles of these treatments, their translation into real-world clinical practice remains a challenge. Objective: This review aims to conduct a comprehensive assessment of real-world studies, offering valuable insights tailored for practical application in clinical settings. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive literature search in PubMed, SCOPUS, and MEDLINE for real-life studies on erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab. Abstracts underwent rigorous screening by two reviewers for relevance. Data extraction from selected articles was performed using a standardized form, with verification by a second reviewer. Data synthesis was narrative, following PRISMA guidelines. Results: Our search included 61 pertinent studies conducted between 2019 and 1 March 2024. Real-world study designs demonstrated notable variability in the selection and inclusion of migraine patients, influenced by factors such as attack frequency, data collection criteria, and primary/secondary objectives. Key findings commonly reported considerable improvements in efficacy outcomes (migraine frequency, analgesic use, pain severity, and disability), high responder rates, and optimal safety and tolerability profiles. Conclusions: Real-world evidence underscores the role of anti-CGRP mAbs as targeted therapies for both CM and EM patients. The overall results indicate that the effectiveness and tolerability of anti-CGRP mAbs in real-world applications may exceed those observed in RCTs, an extraordinary finding in clinical neurology.</p>

	<p>Background: Musculoskeletal pain is a leading cause of medical visits, posing significant challenges both socially and economically, encouraging the scientific community to continue researching and exploring the most effective methods to address the problem. An alternative way to deal with chronic pain is pain neuroscience education (PNE), a lesson plan that addresses the neurobiology, neurophysiology, and nervous system processing of pain. This method takes the place of the conventional one, which connected pain to tissue damage or nociception. Results: As a result, patients are taught that pain is often not a reliable measure of the health of the tissues but rather the outcome of the nervous system interpreting the injury in conjunction with additional psychosocial variables. In addition to finding research that examine, using neuroimaging, whether the administration of PNE has detectable effects at the level of the central nervous system, this narrative review seeks to clarify what PNE is, how it is administered, and if it is an effective treatment for musculoskeletal pain. Conclusions: Based on the findings, it appears that PNE is more therapeutically beneficial when combined with therapeutic exercise, when done one-on-one, and during lengthy, frequent sessions. Lastly, even though PNE has no effect on the morphological properties of the gray matter, it appears to cause decreased activation of the regions linked to pain.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In the entorhinal cortex (EC), attempts have been made to identify the human homologue regions of the medial (MEC) and lateral (LEC) subregions using either functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). However, there are still discrepancies between entorhinal subdivisions depending on the choice of connectivity seed regions and the imaging modality used. While DTI can be used to follow the white matter tracts of the brain, fMRI can identify functionally connected brain regions. In this study, we used both DTI and resting-state fMRI in 103 healthy adults to investigate both structural and functional connectivity between the EC and associated cortical brain regions. Differential connectivity with these regions was then used to predict the locations of the human homologues of MEC and LEC. Our results from combining DTI and fMRI support a subdivision into posteromedial (pmEC) and anterolateral (alEC) EC and reveal a confined border between the pmEC and alEC. Furthermore, the EC subregions obtained by either imaging modality showed similar distinct whole-brain connectivity profiles. Optimizing the delineation of the human homologues of MEC and LEC with a combined, cross-validated DTI-fMRI approach allows to define a likely border between the two subdivisions and has implications for both cognitive and translational neuroscience research.</p>

<p>

PTZ-induced seizures caused short-term changes in glial gene expression, with more significant alterations observed in astroglial genes compared to microglial genes.

The changes were directed toward the neuroprotective profile of A2 cell activation.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Astrocytes and microglia can adopt two distinct phenotypes in various pathological processes: neurotoxic A1/M1 and neuroprotective A2/M2. Recent evidence suggests that these cells play a significant role in epileptogenesis. The objective of this study was to characterize the phenotype of astrocytes and microglial cells in the hippocampus and temporal cortex of young male Wistar rats at 3 h, 1, 3, and 7 days after pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures. RT-qPCR was employed to examine the expression of glial genes (<i>Gfap</i>, <i>Aif1</i>, <i>Slc1a1</i>, <i>Slc1a2</i>, <i>Slc1a3</i>, <i>Itpr2</i>, <i>Gdnf</i>, <i>Bdnf</i>, <i>Fgf2</i>, <i>Tgfb</i>, <i>Il1b</i>, <i>Tnf</i>, <i>Il1rn</i>, <i>Lcn2</i>, <i>S100a10</i>, <i>Nlrp3</i>, <i>Arg1</i>). The most notable alterations in the expression of glial genes were observed on the first day following seizures in the temporal cortex. An increase in the expression of the <i>Gfap</i>, <i>Slc1a2</i>, <i>Slc1a1</i>, <i>Il1b</i>, <i>Tnfa</i>, <i>Bdnf</i>, and <i>Fgf2</i> genes, and the A2 astrocyte condition marker <i>S100a10</i>, was observed. An increase in the expression of the <i>Gfap</i> and <i>Slc1a2</i> genes was observed in the hippocampus on the first day after seizures. However, in contrast to the changes observed in the cortex, the changes in the hippocampus were opposite for the <i>Il1rn</i>, <i>Bdnf</i>, <i>Tgfb</i>, and <i>Arg1</i> genes. Nevertheless, the alterations in GFAP and EAAT2 protein levels were not corroborated by Western blot analysis. Conversely, a more comprehensive immunohistochemical analysis confirmed an augmentation in the number of GFAP-positive cells in the hippocampus 1 day after seizures. Based on the presented evidence, we can conclude that a single convulsive seizure episode in 3-week-old rats results in transient astroglial activation and polarization to a neuroprotective phenotype (A2).</p>

                Chronic stress and the accompanying long-term elevation of glucocorticoids (GCs), the stress hormones of the body, increase the risk and accelerate the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Signatures of AD include intracellular tau (MAPT) tangles, extracellular amyloid β (Aβ) plaques, and neuroinflammation. A growing body of work indicates that stress and GCs initiate cellular processes underlying these pathologies through dysregulation of protein homeostasis and trafficking, mitochondrial bioenergetics, and response to damage-associated stimuli. In this review, we integrate findings from mechanistic studies in rodent and cellular models, wherein defined chronic stress protocols or GC administration have been shown to elicit AD-related pathology. We specifically discuss the effects of chronic stress and GCs on tau pathogenesis, including hyperphosphorylation, aggregation, and spreading, amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and trafficking culminating in Aβ production, immune priming by proinflammatory cytokines and disease-associated molecular patterns, and alterations to glial cell and blood–brain barrier (BBB) function.

                Although zebrafish (Danio rerio) neuroscience research is rapidly expanding, the fundamental question of how these fish should be maintained in research laboratories remains largely unstudied. This may explain the diverse practices and broad range of environmental parameters used in zebrafish facilities. Here, we provide examples of these parameters and practices, including housing density, tank size, and water chemistry. We discuss the principles of stochastic resonance versus homeostasis and provide hypothetical examples to explain why keeping zebrafish outside of their tolerated range of environmental parameters may increase phenotypical variance and reduce replicability. We call for systematic studies to establish the optimal maintenance conditions for zebrafish. Furthermore, we discuss why knowing more about the natural behavior and ecology of this species could be a guiding principle for these studies.

                Bhat et al. show that the E3-ligase SCFFBXO10 is prenylated at C953 in its C-terminal CaaX motif. Prenylated FBXO10 is specifically delivered to the outer mitochondrial membrane via combined actions of cytosolic PDE6δ and HSP90.

                Sensory stimuli, such as the taste of sugar, can evoke diverse behavioral responses. Jacobs et al. show that circuits for different innate responses to sugar in Drosophila partially overlap and diverge at the second and third layers. Modulatory factors act at different sites in the sugar circuit to influence behavior.

">Microglia determine an immune-challenged environment and facilitate ibuprofen action in human retinal organoids.</a></h4>

              
                Prenatal immune challenges pose significant risks to human embryonic brain and eye development. However, we still lack knowledge about the safe usage of anti-inflammatory drugs during pregnancy. While human induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSC)-derived brain organoid models have started to explore functional consequences upon viral stimulation, these models commonly lack microglia. Yet, microglia are susceptible to and promote inflammation and will influence the effects. Here, we generate hIPSC-derived microglia precursor cells and assemble them into retinal organoids to dissect their interplay with the developing nervous system and expose them to the immunostimulant poly(I:C). We first identified successful hIPSC-derived microglia (iMG) integration into the retinal organoid at the time when the outer plexiform layer forms. To improve ganglion cell surveillance, we adapted the retinal organoid model and found that the ganglion cell number significantly decreased only with iMG presence. While poly(I:C) exposure alters the iMG phenotype, it does not hinder their interaction with ganglion cells. Furthermore, iMG significantly enhances the supernatant's inflammatory secretome and increases retinal cell proliferation. Simultaneous exposure with the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ibuprofen dampens the poly(I:C)-mediated changes of the iMG phenotype and ameliorates cell proliferation. Remarkably, while poly(I:C) disrupts neuronal calcium dynamics independent of iMG, ibuprofen rescues this effect only if iMG are present. This effect depends on cyclooxygenase 1 in microglia and cyclooxygenase 2, common NSAID targets. These findings underscore the importance of microglia in the context of prenatal immune challenges and provide insight into the mechanisms by which ibuprofen exerts its protective effects during embryonic development.

">Stimulation of otolith irregular fibers produces a rostro-caudal gradient in activity in the vestibular nuclear complex (VNC), but not the vestibulocerebellum (VeCb)</a></h4>

              
                The vestibular system is important for posture, balance, motor control, and spatial orientation. Each of the vestibular end organs have specialized neuroepithelia with both regular and irregular afferents. In otolith organs, the utricle and saccule, afferents most responsive to linear jerk (jerk - derivative of acceleration) are located in the striola and project centrally to the vestibular nuclear complex (VNC) as well as the uvula and nodulus of the vestibulocerebellum (VeCb). The pattern of central neuronal activation attributed to otolith irregular afferents is relatively unknown. To address this gap, c-Fos was used as a marker of neuronal activity to map the distribution of active neurons throughout the rostro-caudal extent of the VNC and VeCb. Immunohistochemistry for c-Fos was performed to assess activation of VNC and VeCb neurons in response to a linear jerk stimulus delivered in the naso-occipital plane. Activated neurons were distributed throughout the VNC, including the lateral vestibular nucleus (LVe), magnocellular medial vestibular nucleus (MVeMC), parvocellular medial vestibular nucleus (MVePC), spinal vestibular nucleus (SpVe), and superior vestibular nucleus (SuVe). Notably, after stimulation, the MVePC exhibited the greatest number of c-Fos labeled nuclei. Significant increases in c-Fos labeling were found in mid-rostrocaudal and caudal regions of the VNC in the LVe, MVe, and SpVe. Additionally, c-Fos labeling was observed across all regions of the VeCb after jerk stimulation. Significant increases in the number of labeled nuclei were found throughout the rostro-caudal extent of the nodulus and uvula. However, jerk stimulated increases in activity for the paraflocculus were restricted to the caudal VeCb. The distribution of neuronal activity suggests that regions receiving the greatest direct otolith input exhibit the most substantial changes in response to otolith derived, irregular fiber stimulation.

">Abstinence from cocaine self-administration promotes microglia pruning of astrocytes which drives cocaine-seeking behavior</a></h4>

              
                Rodent drug self-administration leads to compromised ability of astrocytes to maintain glutamate homeostasis within the brains reward circuitry, as well as reductions in surface area, volume, and synaptic colocalization of astrocyte membranes. However, the mechanisms driving astrocyte responses to cocaine are unknown. Here, we report that long-access cocaine self-administration followed by prolonged home cage abstinence results in decreased branching complexity of nucleus accumbens astrocytes, characterized by the loss of peripheral processes. Using a combination of confocal fluorescence microcopy and immuno-gold electron microscopy, we show that alterations in astrocyte structural features are driven by microglia phagocytosis, as labeled astrocyte membranes are found within microglia phagolysosomes. Inhibition of complement C3-mediated phagocytosis using the neutrophil inhibitory peptide (NIF) rescued astrocyte structure and decreased cocaine seeking behavior following cocaine self-administration and abstinence. Collectively, these results provide evidence for microglia pruning of accumbens astrocytes across cocaine abstinence which mediates cocaine craving.

                Both thalami can be connected by an Interthalamic Adhesion (IA). The extent of its presence varies among individuals and remains poorly understood. This study examines the IA's prevalence, anatomical variations, genetic determinants, and cognitive associations. Data from 591 healthy subjects (25-35 years) from the Human Connectome Project were analyzed and grouped as monozygotic (MZ) twins, dizygotic (DZ) twins, non-twin siblings, and unrelated individuals. MRI was used to characterize the IA, while neuropsychological assessments and Freesurfer parcellations were used to assess cognition and anatomical differences between subjects with or without an IA. The IA was absent in 12.7% of subjects, more commonly in males (20.0%) than females (6.3%), with no significant differences in age, education, or cognition between those with and without an IA. IA absence was associated with increased cerebrospinal fluid volumes, enlarged third ventricles, and thinning in several cortical areas. Genetic analysis revealed a higher concordance of IA presence among MZ twins (96%) than in other groups, indicating a strong genetic influence. The remaining 4% discrepancy was observed in male pairs only. This study underscores the genetic basis of IA, highlighting sexual dimorphism and neuroanatomical differences associated with its absence, though it does not affect cognition in healthy individuals.

">A role for acetylcholine in reinforcement learning and decision making under uncertainty</a></h4>

              
                The neuromodulator acetylcholine has been suggested to govern learning under uncertainty. Here, we investigated the role of muscarinic receptors in reward-guided learning and decision making under different degrees of uncertainty. We administered the muscarinic M1 antagonist biperiden (4 mg) to healthy male participants (n = 43) in a within-subjects, placebo-controlled design. Participants performed two tasks that both involved choices between options characterized by two attributes, reward probability and magnitude. In the gambling task, both attributes were explicitly provided, whereas in the learning task, reward probabilities had to be inferred from past experience. In addition, uncertainty was manipulated within the learning task by inclusion of a stable phase with fixed reward contingencies, and a volatile phase with frequent contingency reversals. We show that biperiden did not affect decision making in the gambling task, where no learning was required. However, in the learning task, biperiden reduced the sensitivity to the learnt reward probabilities. Notably, this was primarily driven by choices under higher uncertainty in the volatile phase. Using reinforcement learning models, we reveal that the change in behaviour was caused by noisier estimates of probabilities resulting from maladaptively increased learning rates under biperiden. Together, these findings suggest that muscarinic acetylcholine transmission is involved in controlling learning in highly uncertain contexts, when the demand for carefully calibrated adjustments is highest.

">Histone deacetylase 5 in prelimbic prefrontal cortex limits context-associated cocaine seeking</a></h4>

              
                Background Repeated cocaine use produces neuroadaptations that support drug craving and relapse in substance use disorders (SUDs). Powerful associations formed with drug-use environments can promote a return to active drug use in SUD patients, but the molecular mechanisms that control the formation of these prepotent drug-context associations remain unclear. Methods In the rat intravenous cocaine self-administration (SA) model, we examined the role and regulation of histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) in the prelimbic (PrL) and infralimbic (IL) cortices in context-associated drug seeking. To this end, we employed viral molecular tools, chemogenetics, RNA-sequencing, electrophysiology, and immunohistochemistry. Results In the PrL, reduction of endogenous HDAC5 augmented context-associated, but not cue- or drug prime-reinstated cocaine seeking, whereas overexpression of HDAC5 in PrL, but not IL, reduced context-associated cocaine seeking, but it had no effects on sucrose seeking. In contrast, PrL HDAC5 overexpression following acquisition of cocaine SA had no effects on future cocaine seeking. We found that HDAC5 and cocaine SA altered the expression of numerous PrL genes, including many synapse-associated genes. HDAC5 significantly increased inhibitory synaptic transmission onto PrL deep-layer pyramidal neurons, and it reduced the induction of FOS-positive neurons in the cocaine SA environment. Conclusions Our findings reveal an essential and selective role for PrL HDAC5 to limit associations formed in cocaine, but not sucrose, SA environments, and that it alters the PrL excitatory/inhibitory balance, possibly through epigenetic regulation of synaptic genes. These results further position HDAC5 as a key factor regulating reward-circuit neuroadaptations that underlie common relapse triggers in SUD.

">Differential representations for affective and informative components of reward in the striatum and hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Receipt of a reward is composed of affective and informative components, which are often intertwined in most reward-processing and decision-making tasks. Our previous work allowed us to identify regions that were more strongly engaged for the affective and informative components of reward upon receipt (Smith et al., 2016) and showed that the ventral striatum responds to both affective and informative components of reward processing. However, the limited spatial resolution and coarse analytical approaches made it hard to understand how these different components of reward were represented in the brain, wherein similar engagement may not necessitate similar representations. In our current study, we used high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (voxel size: 1.75 mm3) and representational similarity analysis to investigate the representation of affective and informative components of reward receipt in the striatum and the hippocampus, another region that is sensitive to reward information. We found a differential representation of affective and informative components of reward receipt in the striatum and the hippocampus, with no difference in representation between the two structures. However, in the dorsal striatum, we found that representations were stronger for affective rather than the informative components of reward receipt. Finally, we observed that the ventral striatum was sensitive to the predictiveness of information, such that across-run pattern similarity in the ventral striatum increased with the predictiveness of information. In sum, our results provide evidence of how affective and informative components of rewards are represented in the striatum and the hippocampus, potentially indicating a differential coding schema for the dorsal and the ventral striatum.

                The sounds we experience in our everyday communication can vary greatly in terms of level and background noise depending on the environment. Paradoxically, increasing the sound intensity may lead to worsened speech understanding, especially in noise. This is known as the "Rollover" phenomenon. There have been limited studies on rollover and how it is experienced differentially across aging groups, for those with and without hearing loss, as well as cochlear implant (CI) users. There is also mounting evidence that listening effort plays an important role in challenging listening conditions and can be directly quantified with objective measures such as pupil dilation. We found that listening effort was modulated by sound level and that rollover occurred primarily in the presence of background noise. The effect on listening effort was exacerbated by age and hearing loss in acoustic listeners, with greatest effect in older listeners with hearing loss, while there was no effect in CI users. The age- and hearing- dependent effects of rollover highlight the potential negative impact of amplification to high sound levels and therefore has implications for effective treatment of age-related hearing loss

">Human medial pulvinar is involved in face and tactile processing and dynamically adjusts its cortical connectivity based on ongoing stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Optimal processing of our surrounding environment relies on our ability to detect and integrate external information through multiple sensory modalities to build a coherent representation of the world. Interactions between cortical and subcortical structures contribute to this process. In this context, there is growing evidence that the pulvinar plays a crucial role in visual and face processing. In contrast, its role in auditory, voice and tactile processing has been poorly investigated. Here, we use fMRI localizer tasks to describe pulvinar functional organization and functional connectivity with the brain during face, voice and tactile processing. We reproduce the activation of the ventral part of the medial pulvinar in face perception and we describe an increased pulvinar connectivity with face processing areas and a decreased connectivity with low level visual areas during face processing. In addition, we describe activations of the medial pulvinar during air-puff face, hands and feet tactile stimulations and changes in pulvino-cortical connectivity as a function of which body part is being stimulated. No activations are observed during either voice or non-voice stimulations. Overall, this supports a role of medial pulvinar in multisensory processing and the modulation of cortical areas as a function of the sensory context.

">Concurrent large-scale brain dynamics during the emotional face matching task and their relation to behavior and mental health</a></h4>

              
                Prior investigations of emotion processing's neural underpinnings rely on a priori models of brain response, obscuring detection of task-relevant neurobiological processes with complex temporal dynamics. To overcome this limitation, we applied unsupervised machine learning to functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquired during the emotional face matching task (EFMT) in healthy young adults from the Human Connectome Project (n=413; n=416 replication). Tensorial independent component analysis showed that the EFMT engages 10 large-scale brain networks - each recruiting visual association cortex in distinct temporal fashions and in tandem with diverse non-visual regions - that collectively recruit 74% of cortex, posterior cerebellum, and amygdala. Despite prominent use of the EFMT to probe negative affect and related psychopathology, EFMT-recruited networks strongly reflected individual differences in cognition but not internalizing/negative affect. Overall, we characterize a richer-than-expected tapestry of concurrent EFMT-recruited brain processes, their diverse activation dynamics, and their relations to task performance and latent mental health phenotypes.

">Spinal neuron diversity scales exponentially with swim-to-limb transformation during frog metamorphosis</a></h4>

              
                Vertebrates exhibit a wide range of motor behaviors, ranging from swimming to complex limb-based movements. Here we take advantage of frog metamorphosis, which captures a swim-to-limb-based movement transformation during the development of a single organism, to explore changes in the underlying spinal circuits. We find that the tadpole spinal cord contains small and largely homogeneous populations of motor neurons (MNs) and V1 interneurons (V1s) at early escape swimming stages. These neuronal populations only modestly increase in number and subtype heterogeneity with the emergence of free swimming. In contrast, during frog metamorphosis and the emergence of limb movement, there is a dramatic expansion of MN and V1 interneuron number and transcriptional heterogeneity, culminating in cohorts of neurons that exhibit striking molecular similarity to mammalian motor circuits. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene disruption of the limb MN and V1 determinants FoxP1 and Engrailed-1, respectively, results in severe but selective deficits in tail and limb function. Our work thus demonstrates that neural diversity scales exponentially with increasing behavioral complexity and illustrates striking evolutionary conservation in the molecular organization and function of motor circuits across species.

">Lower limb pointing to assess intersegmental dynamics after incomplete spinal cord injury and the associated role of proprioceptive impairments.</a></h4>

              
                Background: Disorders in the recovery of gait strategies in individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) suggest difficulties in controlling lower limb intersegmental dynamics, which could relate to proprioceptive impairments. To probe discrete aspects of lower limb interjoint coordination, we present here a novel protocol to assess lower limb motor strategies and evaluate the influence of proprioceptive impairments following SCI. Methods: Twelve able-bodied controls and 16 participants with SCI performed lower limb pointing to three targets that involved combined hip and knee flexion, or hip or knee flexion only while standing, with either full or obstructed visual feedback. We quantified lower limb proprioceptive sense in individuals with SCI using a robotic gait device. We used motion analysis to determine lower limb joint angles and foot trajectory, computed inverse dynamics to quantify joint and intersegmental dynamics, and derived muscle torque as an indicator of the motor strategies produced to control the motion to each target. We used linear mixed-effects models to assess differences between the control and SCI groups on end-point performance and muscle torque, and to assess the relationship of muscle torque with end-point performance and proprioceptive sense. Results: Groups differed in motor strategies, but not end-point performance, when pointing to all three targets. Compared to controls, the SCI group had difficulty controlling knee muscle torque when performing the hip-flexion-only target (p = 0.008) or when flexing the hip and knee simultaneously (p = 0.0004). To complete the knee-flexion-only target, the SCI group had difficulties generating the required hip extensor muscle torque to maintain the thigh in neutral (p = 0.0001). These altered motor strategies in individuals with SCI were associated with proprioceptive impairments and end-point performance. Conclusion: This novel lower limb pointing task can identify disordered motor strategies in individuals with SCI, especially at the knee, and are associated with proprioceptive impairment. Variations of this paradigm can be employed to further understand differences in motor strategies between controls and individuals with SCI, and the impact of proprioceptive deficits.

">hiPSC-derived astrocytes from individuals with schizophrenia promote alterations in phagocytosis and chemotaxis of microglial-like cells</a></h4>

              
                Neuroinflammation, particularly astrocyte reactivity, are increasingly linked to schizophrenia (SCZ). Yet, the crosstalk between astrocytes and microglia in SCZ, especially under pro-inflammatory conditions, remains unclear. Here, we apply human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to compare the reactivity of astrocytes from individuals with SCZ and neurotypical controls, towards resolving how patient-derived astrocytes affect microglial biology. TNF-[a] stimulation of SCZ astrocytes, relative to control astrocytes, trigger an increase in expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and CX3CL1, a chemokine involved in chemotaxis and synapse pruning. Transcriptomic analyses reveal that TNF-[a]-stimulated SCZ astrocytes promote the downregulation of biological processes associated with phagocytosis and chemotaxis in induced microglial-like cells (iMGs). Interestingly, TNF-[a]-stimulated SCZ astrocytes lead to reduced synaptoneurosomes engulfment by iMGs. Alternatively, TNF-[a]-stimulated astrocytes (control and SCZ) induce microglial migration in a CX3CR1-dependent manner. Surprisingly, TNF-[a]-stimulated SCZ astrocytes do not promote a more pronounced microglial chemotaxis, despite secreting twice as much CX3CL1 compared to stimulated control astrocytes, possibly due to lower CX3CR1 plasma membrane content after exposure to ACM from individuals with SCZ. Altogether, these findings suggest that astrocytes contribute to SCZ pathology by altering normal microglial function.

">Vocal Call Locator Benchmark (VCL) for localizing rodent vocalizations from multi-channel audio</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the behavioral and neural dynamics of social interactions is a goal of contemporary neuroscience. Many machine learning methods have emerged in recent years to make sense of complex video and neurophysiological data that result from these experiments. Less focus has been placed on understanding how animals process acoustic information, including social vocalizations. A critical step to bridge this gap is determining the senders and receivers of acoustic information in social interactions. While sound source localization (SSL) is a classic problem in signal processing, existing approaches are limited in their ability to localize animal-generated sounds in standard laboratory environments. Advances in deep learning methods for SSL are likely to help address these limitations, however there are currently no publicly available models, datasets, or benchmarks to systematically evaluate SSL algorithms in the domain of bioacoustics. Here, we present the VCL Benchmark: the first large-scale dataset for benchmarking SSL algorithms in rodents. We acquired synchronized video and multi-channel audio recordings of 767,295 sounds with annotated ground truth sources across 9 conditions. The dataset provides benchmarks which evaluate SSL performance on real data, simulated acoustic data, and a mixture of real and simulated data. We intend for this benchmark to facilitate knowledge transfer between the neuroscience and acoustic machine learning communities, which have had limited overlap.

">Comparing alpha-synuclein-interactomes between multiple systems atrophy and Parkinsons disease reveals unique and shared pathological features.</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Primary synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy (MSA), are neurodegenerative disorders with some shared clinical and pathological features. Aggregates of alpha-synuclein (syn) phosphorylated at serine 129 (PSER129) are the hallmark of synucleinopathies, which for PD/DLB are found predominantly in neurons (Neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions NCIs), but for MSA, aggregates are primarily found in oligodendroglia (Glial cytoplasmic inclusions GCIs). It remains unclear if the distinct pathological presentation of PD/DLB and MSA are manifestations of distinct or shared pathological processes. We hypothesize that the distinct synucleinopathies MSA and PD/DLB share common molecular features. Methods: Using the in-situ proximity labeling technique biotinylation by antibody recognition (BAR), we compare aggregated syn-interactomes (BAR-PSER129) and total syn-interactomes (BAR-MJFR1) between MSA (n=5) and PD/DLB (n=10) in forebrain and midbrain structures. Results: For BAR-PSER129 and BAR-MJFR1 captures, syn was the most significantly enriched protein in PD/DLB and MSA. In PD/DLB, BAR-PSER129 identified 194 syn-aggregate-interacting proteins, while BAR-MJFR1 identified 245 syn interacting proteins. In contrast, in the MSA brain, only 38 and 175 proteins were identified for each capture, respectively. When comparing MSA and PD/DLB, a high overlap (59.5%) was observed between BAR-MJFR1 captured proteins, whereas less overlap (14.4%) was observed for BAR-PSER129. Direct comparison between MSA and PD/DLB revealed 79 PD/DLB-associated proteins and only three MSA-associated proteins (CBR1, CRYAB, and GFAP). Pathway enrichment analysis revealed PD/DLB interactions were dominated by vesicle/SNARE-associated pathways, in contrast to MSA, which strongly enriched for metabolic/catabolic, iron, and cellular oxidant detoxification pathways. A subnetwork of cytosolic antioxidant enzymes called peroxiredoxins drove cellular detoxification pathways in MSA. A common network of 25 proteins, including neuronal-specific proteins (e.g., SNYGR3) with HSPA8 at the core, was shared between MSA and DLB/PD. Extracellular exosome pathways were universally enriched regardless of disease or BAR target protein. Conclusion: Synucleinopathies show divergent and convergent syn-aggregate interactions, indicating unique and shared pathogenic mechanisms. MSA uniquely involves oxidant detoxification processes in glial cells, while vesicular processes in neurons dominate PD/DLB. Shared interactions, specifically SNYGR3 (i.e., a neuronal protein), between MSA and PD/DLB suggest neuronal axons origin for both diseases. In conclusion, we provide syn aggregates protein interaction maps for two distinct synucleinopathies.

">Qualitative EEG abnormalities signal a shift towards inhibition-dominated brain networks. Results from the EU-AIMS LEAP studies</a></h4>

              
                Qualitative EEG abnormalities are common in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and hypothesized to reflect disrupted excitation/inhibition balance. To test this, we recently introduced a functional measure of network-level E/I ratio (fE/I). Here, we applied fE/I and other quantitative EEG measures to alpha oscillations from source-reconstructed data in the EU-AIMS compilation of 267 EEG recordings from children-adolescents and adults with ASD and 209 controls. We analyzed these quantitative measures alongside evaluating for qualitative EEG abnormalities ranging from slowing of activity to epileptiform patterns aiming to replicate the findings from the SPACE-BAMBI study (Bruining et al., 2020). EEG abnormalities were only identified in a few adults and could not be statistically assessed. ASD children-adolescents with EEG abnormalities exhibited lower relative alpha power and lower fE/I compared to children-adolescents without abnormalities; however, the EEG-abnormality scoring did not stratify the behavioral heterogeneity of ASD using clinical measures. Surprisingly, several controls presented with qualitative EEG abnormalities and showed a strikingly similar anatomical distribution of lower fE/I to the one observed in the ASD group, suggesting a shift towards inhibition-dominated network dynamics, in regions associated with altered sensory processing. The robustness of this association between EEG abnormalities and reduced fE/I was further supported by re-analysis of the SPACE-BAMBI study in source space. Stratification by the presence of EEG abnormalities and their associated effects on network activity may help understand neurodevelopmental physiological heterogeneity and the difficulties in implementing E/I targeting treatments in unselected cohorts.

	<p>Objective: This study investigated the degrees of lenition, or consonantal weakening, in the production of Spanish stop consonants by native English speakers during a study abroad (SA) program. Lenition is a key phonological process in Spanish, where voiced stops (/b/, /d/, /&amp;amp;#609;/) typically weaken to fricatives or approximants in specific phonetic environments. For L2 learners, mastering this subtle process is essential for achieving native-like pronunciation. Methods: To assess the learners&amp;amp;rsquo; progress in acquiring lenition, we employed Phonet, a deep learning model. Unlike traditional quantitative acoustic methods that focus on measuring the physical properties of speech sounds, Phonet utilizes recurrent neural networks to predict the posterior probabilities of phonological features, particularly sonorant and continuant characteristics, which are central to the lenition process. Results: The results indicated that while learners showed progress in producing the fricative-like variants of lenition during the SA program and understood how to produce lenition in appropriate contexts, the retention of these phonological gains was not sustained after their return. Additionally, unlike native speakers, the learners never fully achieved the approximant-like realization of lenition. Conclusion: These findings underscore the need for sustained exposure and practice beyond the SA experience to ensure the long-term retention of L2 phonological patterns. While SA programs offer valuable opportunities for enhancing L2 pronunciation, they should be supplemented with ongoing support to consolidate and extend the gains achieved during the immersive experience.

	<p>Background: Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) is effective in regulating mood and high-level cognition in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of taVNS treatment in patients with MDD and an altered brain topological organization of functional networks. Methods: Nineteen patients with MDD were enrolled in this study. Patients with MDD underwent 4 weeks of taVNS treatments; resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data of the patients were collected before and after taVNS treatment. The graph theory method and network-based statistics (NBS) analysis were used to detect abnormal topological organizations of functional networks in patients with MDD before and after taVNS treatment. A correlation analysis was performed to characterize the relationship between altered network properties and neuropsychological scores. Results: After 4 weeks of taVNS treatment, patients with MDD had increased global efficiency and decreased characteristic path length (Lp). Additionally, patients with MDD exhibited increased nodal efficiency (NE) and degree centrality (DC) in the left angular gyrus. NBS results showed that patients with MDD exhibited reduced connectivity between default mode network (DMN)&amp;amp;ndash;frontoparietal network (FPN), DMN&amp;amp;ndash;cingulo-opercular network (CON), and FPN&amp;amp;ndash;CON. Furthermore, changes in Lp and DC were correlated with changes in Hamilton depression scores. Conclusions: These findings demonstrated that taVNS may be an effective method for reducing the severity of depressive symptoms in patients with MDD, mainly through modulating the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s topological organization. Our study may offer insights into the underlying neural mechanism of taVNS treatment in patients with MDD.</p>

	<p>The aim of this study was to verify whether the level of mental resilience would differentiate reading comprehension performance when using different information carriers. More than 150 people filled out a test regarding the level of resilience. They then participated in a survey using fNIRS. Their task was to read a one-page informational text and answer several questions. The results showed no differences in correct answers between groups of people with different levels of resilience. In the groups of people with high and low levels of resilience, the number of correct answers was not differentiated by the type of carrier. Among those with moderate levels of resilience, better results were obtained by those who read text printed on paper. Analyses of neuronal mechanisms showed that the type of carrier differentiated brain activity in each group. Obtaining the same number of correct answers in the test was the result of different neuronal mechanisms activated in those who used a computer and those who read a printed text.</p>

	<p>Objectives: The main purpose of the current study was to examine the effects of social information processing, self-regulation, and metacognition variables on ToM using path analysis. Methods: For this purpose, path analysis was conducted for the model established according to the relationships between the variables. Theory of mind task battery (ToMTB), Metacognitive Knowledge Interview (McKI), Schultz Test of Emotion Processing&amp;amp;mdash;Preliminary Version (STEP-P), and self-regulation scale were administered to 310 children aged 3&amp;amp;ndash;5 years. Results: The results show that social information processing (except STEP-P.P.B, one of the sub-dimensions of the STEP-P scale) has a significant effect on ToM through metacognition and self-regulation. Conclusions: In this context, it can be said that social information processing, metacognition, and self-regulation are effective in the development of ToM.</p>

	<p>Human biostasis, the preservation of a human when all other contemporary options for extension of quality life are exhausted, offers the speculative potential for survival via continuation of life in the future. While provably reversible preservation, also known as suspended animation, is not yet possible for humans, the primary justification for contemporary biostasis is the preservation of the brain, which is broadly considered the seat of memories, personality, and identity. By preserving the information contained within the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s structures, it may be possible to resuscitate a healthy whole individual using advanced future technologies. There are numerous challenges in biostasis, including inadequacies in current preservation techniques, methods to evaluate the quality of preservation, and potential future revival technologies. In this report, we describe a roadmap that attempts to delineate research directions that could improve the field of biostasis, focusing on optimizing preservation protocols and establishing metrics for querying preservation quality, as well as pre- and post-cardiac arrest factors, stabilization strategies, and methods for long-term preservation. We acknowledge the highly theoretical nature of future revival technologies and the importance of achieving high-fidelity brain preservation to maximize the potential of future repair technologies. We plan to update the research roadmap biennially. Our goal is to encourage multidisciplinary communication and collaboration in this field.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Finding innovative digital solutions is fundamental to ensure prompt and continuous care for patients with chronic neurological disorders, whose demand for rehabilitation also in home-based settings is steadily increasing. The aim is to verify the safety and the effectiveness of two telerehabilitation (TR) models in improving recovery from subacute upper limb (UL) disability after stroke, with and without a robotic device. Methods: One hundred nineteen subjects with subacute post-stroke UL disability were assessed for eligibility. Of them, 30 patients were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to either the Robotic Group (RG), undergoing a 20-session TR program, using a robotic device, or the Non-Robotic Group (NRG), undergoing a 20-session TR program without robotics. Clinical evaluations were measured at baseline (T0) and post-intervention (T1, 5 weeks after baseline), and included assessments of quality of life, motor skills, and clinical/functional status. The primary outcome measure was the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0, evaluating the change in perceived disability. Results: Statistical analysis shows that patients of both groups improved significantly over time in all domains analyzed (mean decrease from baseline in the WHODAS 2.0 of 6.09 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.62% for the NRG, and of 0.76 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.21% for the RG), with a greater improvement of patients in the NRG in motor (Fugl-Meyer Assessment Upper Extremity&amp;amp;mdash;motor function, Box and Block Test) and cognitive skills (Trail Making Test-A). Conclusions: This study highlights the potential of TR programs to transform stroke rehabilitation by enhancing accessibility and patient-centered care, promoting autonomy, improving adherence, and leading to better outcomes and quality of life for stroke survivors.</p>

                <p>Some visual neurons in the dragonfly (<I>Hemicordulia tau</I>) optic lobe respond to small, moving targets, likely underlying their fast pursuit of prey and conspecifics. In response to repetitive targets presented at short intervals, the spiking activity of these "small target motion detector" (STMD) neurons diminishes over time. Previous experiments limited this adaptation by including intertrial rest periods of varying durations. However, the characteristics of this effect have never been quantified. Here, using extracellular recording techniques lasting for several hours, we quantified both the spatial and temporal properties of STMD adaptation. We found that the time course of adaptation was variable across STMD units. In any one STMD, a repeated series led to more rapid adaptation, a minor accumulative effect more akin to habituation. Following an adapting stimulus, responses recovered quickly, though the rate of recovery decreased nonlinearly over time. We found that the region of adaptation is highly localized, with targets displaced by ~2.5&deg; eliciting a naive response. Higher frequencies of target stimulation converged to lower levels of sustained response activity. We determined that adaptation itself is a target-tuned property, not elicited by moving bars or luminance flicker. As STMD adaptation is a localized phenomenon, dependent on recent history, it is likely to play an important role in closed-loop behavior where a target is foveated in a localized region for extended periods of the pursuit duration<b>.</b></p>

                <p>Chemotherapy-related cognitive impairments (CRCIs) encompass cognitive deficits in memory, attention, and executive function that arise during and following chemotherapy. CRCI symptoms are predominantly reported by female cancer patients but also occur in males. These impairments may involve reduced estradiol levels, which then increases vulnerability to the impact of tumors and chemotherapy on cognition. This study utilized the MMTV-PyVT mouse model of breast cancer to test the hypothesis that impaired ovarian function and associated estradiol levels play a critical role in CRCI susceptibility. Mice were either ovariectomized (OVX) or underwent sham surgery. The OVX group then received supplemental estradiol (E<sup>2</sup>) <I>ad libitum</I> in the drinking water to maintain physiological hormone levels. After tumor development, mice were trained in the Morris water maze to assess spatial memory, and subsequently, they received weekly injections of either saline or a combination of cyclophosphamide (CYP; 66.7&nbsp;mg/kg, i.v.) and doxorubicin (DOX; 6.7&nbsp;mg/kg, i.v.) for 4&nbsp;weeks. Spatial memory was reassessed 10&nbsp;d and then 35&nbsp;d, after the final injections. Results demonstrated a significant disruption of normal ovarian cycling in sham-operated mice treated with CYP + DOX, as well as significant spatial memory impairments when compared with OVX mice supplemented with E<sup>2</sup>. This study suggests that chemotherapy-induced ovarian damage and the consequent drop in circulating estrogens significantly contribute to vulnerability to CRCIs, underscoring the importance of estradiol in mitigating CRCI risks.</p>

                <p>Learning to solve a new problem involves identifying the operating rules, which can be accelerated if known rules generalize in the new context. We ask how prior experience affects learning a new rule that is distinct from known rules. We examined how rats learned a new spatial navigation task after having previously learned tasks with different navigation rules. The new task differed from the previous tasks in spatial layout and navigation rule. We found that experience history did not impact overall performance. However, by examining navigation choice sequences in the new task, we found experience-dependent differences in exploration patterns during early stages of learning, as well as differences in the types of errors made during stable performance. The differences were consistent with the animals adopting experience-dependent memory strategies to discover and implement the new rule. Our results indicate prior experience shapes the strategies for solving novel problems, and the impact of prior experience remains persistent.</p>

                <p>Previous physiological and psychophysical studies have explored whether feedback to the cochlea from the efferent system influences forward masking. The present work proposes that the limited growth-of-masking (GOM) observed in auditory nerve (AN) fibers may have been misunderstood; namely, that this limitation may be due to the influence of anesthesia on the efferent system. Building on the premise that the unanesthetized AN may exhibit GOM similar to more central nuclei, the present computational modeling study demonstrates that feedback from the medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferents may contribute to GOM observed physiologically in onset-type neurons in both the cochlear nucleus and inferior colliculus (IC). Additionally, the computational model of MOC efferents used here generates a decrease in masking with longer masker-signal delays similar to that observed in IC physiology and in psychophysical studies. An advantage of this explanation over alternative physiological explanations (e.g., that forward masking requires inhibition from the superior paraolivary nucleus) is that this theory can explain forward masking observed in the brainstem, early in the ascending pathway. For explaining psychoacoustic results, one strength of this model is that it can account for the lack of elevation in thresholds observed when masker level is randomly varied from interval-to-interval, a result that is difficult to explain using the conventional temporal window model of psychophysical forward masking. Future directions for evaluating the efferent mechanism as a contributing mechanism for psychoacoustic results are discussed.</p>

                Background The process of preparing a scientific manuscript is intricate, encompassing several critical stages, including pre-writing, research development, drafting, peer review, editing, publication, dissemination, and access. Among these, the peer review process (PRP) stands out as a pivotal component requiring seamless collaboration among editors, reviewers, and authors. Reviewers play a crucial role in assessing the manuscript’s quality and providing constructive feedback, which authors must adeptly navigate to enhance their work and meet journal standards. This process can often appear daunting and time-consuming, as authors are required to address numerous comments and requested changes. Authors are encouraged to perceive reviewers as consultants rather than adversaries, viewing their critiques as opportunities for improvement rather than personal attacks. Methods Opinion article. Aim To equip authors with practical strategies for engaging effectively in the PRP and improving their publication acceptance rates. Results Key guidelines include thoroughly understanding and prioritizing feedback, maintaining professionalism, and systematically addressing each comment. In cases of significant disagreement or misunderstanding, authors have the option to refer the issue to the editor. Crafting a well-organized and scientific “response to reviews” along with the revised manuscript can substantially increase the likelihood of acceptance. Best practices for writing an effective response to reviews include expressing gratitude, addressing major revisions first, seeking opinions from co-authors and colleagues, and adhering strictly to journal guidelines.

                <p>by Rekha Gopalan-Nair, Aurore Coissac, Ludovic Legrand, Céline Lopez-Roques, Yann Pécrix, Céline Vandecasteele, Olivier Bouchez, Xavier Barlet, Anne Lanois, Alain Givaudan, Julien Brillard, Stéphane Genin, Alice Guidot</p>

Adaptation is usually explained by beneficial genetic mutations that are transmitted from parents to offspring and become fixed in the adapted population. However, genetic mutation analysis alone is not sufficient to fully explain the adaptive processes, and several studies report the existence of nongenetic (or epigenetic) inheritance that can enable adaptation to new environments. In the present work, we tested the hypothesis of the role of DNA methylation, a form of epigenetic modification, in adaptation of the plant pathogen <i>Ralstonia pseudosolanacearum</i> to the host during experimental evolution. Using SMRT-seq technology, we analyzed the methylomes of 31 experimentally evolved clones obtained after serial passages on 5 different plant species during 300 generations. Comparison with the methylome of the ancestral clone revealed a list of 50 differential methylated sites (DMSs) at the GTWWAC motif. Gene expression analysis of the 39 genes targeted by these DMSs revealed limited correlation between differential methylation and differential expression of the corresponding genes. Only 1 gene showed a correlation, the RSp0338 gene encoding the EpsR regulator protein. The MSRE-qPCR technology, used as an alternative approach for DNA methylation analysis, also found the 2 DMSs upstream RSp0338. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrated the contribution of these 2 DMSs in host adaptation. As these DMSs appeared very early in the experimental evolution, we hypothesize that such fast epigenetic changes can allow rapid adaptation to the plant stem environment. In addition, we found that the change in DNA methylation upstream RSp0338 remains stable at least for 100 generations outside the host and thus can contribute to long-term adaptation to the host plant. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing a direct link between bacterial epigenetic variation and adaptation to a new environment.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1080/v1?src=rss">A systematic review of Streptococcus Mutans and Veillonellae species interactions in dental caries progression: Positive or Negative impact? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The interaction between Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) and Veillonella species (Veillonella spp.) is unclear. This study aims to investigate the interaction between S. mutans and Veillonella spp. on caries development using systematic review. Methods This systematic review was accorded to the guideline of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Three electronic databases, namely PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane library, were used to conduct a systematic search for eligible studies from their inception until July 18, 2023. PROSPERO registration number was No. CRD42023445968. Results We initially identified 4,774 articles. After eliminating duplicates and irrelevant articles, 11 studies met the inclusion criteria. The studies revealed important aspects of the relationship between S. mutans and Veillonellae spp. in dental caries. One significant finding is that Veillonellae spp. can affect the acid production capacity of S. mutans. Some studies indicate that Veillonellae spp. can inhibit the acid production by S. mutans, potentially reducing the cariogenic process. Another aspect is the competition for substrates. Veillonellae spp. utilize lactic acid, which is a by product of S. mutans metabolism, as a source of carbon. This metabolic interaction may decrease the availability of lactic acid for S. mutans, potentially influencing its cariogenic potential. Conclusions This systematic review highlights the emerging evidence on the interaction between S. mutans and Veillonellae spp. in dental caries. The findings suggest that Veillonellae spp. can modulate the acid production, and substrate competition of S. mutans, potentially influencing the cariogenic process.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-287/v3?src=rss">A Study about Perceptions of Kimono among College Students and Kimono Enthusiasts: Is It Difficult to Move in a Kimono? [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Kimono is being reevaluated for its sustainability aspects, such as having fewer offcuts in the production process due to its structural differences from Western-style clothes and its high reusability due to the adaptability to individuals’ body shapes. On the other hand, once a common attire for daily wear in Japan, kimono has transitioned to being worn only on special events and the kimono-related industry has also shrunk. To stimulate demand for kimono, it is essential to familiarize younger generations with its potential as daily wear. Methods A questionnaire survey on perceptions of kimono was conducted among two groups in Japan: 211 college students and 50 kimono enthusiasts. The questionnaire included demographic questions and psychometric scales, primarily focusing on their kimono experiences, challenges associated with wearing kimono, their perceptions of kimono and Western-style clothes, and their attitudes towards kimono. Results The results revealed that a majority of students had worn kimono before, though they found it difficult to move while wearing it. In contrast, kimono enthusiasts evaluated it as easier to move, hard to become disheveled, and casual. They also rated the ease of wearing Western-style clothes lower compared to students, and this tendency intensified with the length of enthusiast experience. Furthermore, the findings indicated that enthusiasts regarded the kimono more as daily wear compared to students, while still deriving enjoyment from it as formal attire in special events. Conclusions These results suggest that the cognition that Western-style clothes are easy to move and kimono is not may change with experiences. Therefore, providing opportunities for people in Japan to acquire how to wear kimono in comfortable ways possibly impacts their perceptions of kimono.

                Background Active venous leg ulcer (VLU) is the most severe manifestation of chronic venous disease which not only affects patients’ health, but also decreases the quality of life, and delivers economic burdens. Treatment of superficial venous reflux with early endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) has been associated with reducing ulcer recurrence levels and promoting faster VLU healing. We reported three cases of patients with active VLU undergoing EVLA with different approaches. Case illustration Three patients came with complaint of leg ulcer, diagnosed with C6sEpAsdPr, with venous clinical severity scores (VCSS) of 15, 23, and 22 respectively. Severe great saphenous veins (GSV) reflux was found in all patients by duplex ultrasound examination. The second patient had undergone above-the-knee EVLA. All patients underwent EVLA using 1470-nano meter wavelength laser device and ELVeS radial fiber (Biolitec, Bonn, Germany). The laser energy protocol used was 6 W linear endovenous energy density (LEED) 50 J/cm for proximal until media ATK GSV ablation, 5 W LEED 40 J/cm for media ATK until proximal below-the-knee (BTK) GSV, and 2 W LEED 20 J/cm for proximal until distal BTK GSV. The third patient was also treated with EVLA for small saphenous vein severe reflux. Follow-up until 6 months post-EVLA showed significant healing of the ulcer with 14, 16, and 17 VCSS reduction consecutively without any complication. Conclusion We’ve reported three cases of patients with active VLU undergoing EVLA until BTK with significant results. The EVLA of GSV until BTK where there is still significant reflux is safe and provides satisfactory results in patients with VLU.

                Understanding the nature of life and its propensity for reproduction has long been a question that humans aspire to answer. Reproduction, a defining characteristic of life, fundamentally involves the replication of genetic material, be it DNA or RNA. The driving force behind this replication process has always intrigued scientists. In recent years, theories involving selfish genes, the RNA world, and entropic forces have been proposed by some scholars. These theories seem to suggest that life, as we know it, exists solely in Earth’s environment and is based on a single type of genetic material, either DNA or RNA. However, if we broaden our definition of life to include any replicable molecules, we might be able to transcend traditional thought. This could potentially enhance our understanding of the impetus behind DNA replication and provide deeper insights into the essence of life.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>De novo variants in <i>cullin-3 ubiquitin ligase</i> (<i>CUL3</i>) have been strongly associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), but no large case series have been reported so far. Here, we aimed to collect sporadic cases carrying rare variants in <i>CUL3</i>, describe the genotype–phenotype correlation, and investigate the underlying pathogenic mechanism.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Genetic data and detailed clinical records were collected via multicenter collaboration. Dysmorphic facial features were analyzed using GestaltMatcher. Variant effects on CUL3 protein stability were assessed using patient-derived T-cells.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We assembled a cohort of 37 individuals with heterozygous <i>CUL3</i> variants presenting a syndromic NDD characterized by intellectual disability with or without autistic features. Of these, 35 have loss-of-function (LoF) and 2 have missense variants. <i>CUL3</i> LoF variants in patients may affect protein stability leading to perturbations in protein homeostasis, as evidenced by decreased ubiquitin-protein conjugates in vitro. Notably, we show that 4E-BP1 (EIF4EBP1), a prominent substrate of CUL3, fails to be targeted for proteasomal degradation in patient-derived cells.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study further refines the clinical and mutational spectrum of <i>CUL3</i>-associated NDDs, expands the spectrum of cullin RING E3 ligase-associated neuropsychiatric disorders, and suggests haploinsufficiency via LoF variants is the predominant pathogenic mechanism.

                Background Better affordability of data plans and an increase in “budget” smartphones have resulted in an exponential rise in internet and smartphone users. The ease of access to sexually explicit material (SEM) coupled with adolescents’ impulsivity makes them prone to excessive SEM exposure and may affect the development of sexuality via the perceived realism of such content. This study was done to study the influence between problematic smartphone usage (PSU) and sexuality development among late adolescent boys. Methods One hundred and thirty-four adolescents aged 18-19 years, studying in a medical university, participated in this cross-sectional study. Smartphone Addiction Scale – short version (SAS-SV) to evaluate PSU and a content validated semi-structured proforma to evaluate gender identity, sexual orientation, sources of information on pubertal changes, and exposure to pornographic content was used. We expressed results as proportion and summary measures (Mean±SD), Chi-square test to find influence between PSU and adolescent sexuality development. Results We found a 45.5% prevalence of PSU. Among study participants, 88% were attracted to the opposite sex, 6% were attracted to the same-sex, and 6% were attracted to both sexes. Three per cent of participants liked wearing clothes of the opposite sex, 7.5% wanted to be members of the opposite sex, whereas 10.4% were not comfortable with their genitalia. They obtained information regarding pubertal changes from friends (85) and media (78). Many had exposure to pornographic content (90%), with the youngest being nine years old. Conclusion Nearly half of the late adolescents have PSU. Pornographic contents are accessed through Smartphones.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97916">Tumor-infiltrating nerves functionally alter brain circuits and modulate behavior in a mouse model of head-and-neck cancer</a></h4>

              
                Cancer patients often experience changes in mental health, prompting an exploration into whether nerves infiltrating tumors contribute to these alterations by impacting brain functions. Using a mouse model for head and neck cancer and neuronal tracing, we show that tumor-infiltrating nerves connect to distinct brain areas. The activation of this neuronal circuitry altered behaviors (decreased nest-building, increased latency to eat a cookie, and reduced wheel running). Tumor-infiltrating nociceptor neurons exhibited heightened calcium activity and brain regions receiving these neural projections showed elevated Fos as well as increased calcium responses compared to non-tumor-bearing counterparts. The genetic elimination of nociceptor neurons decreased brain Fos expression and mitigated the behavioral alterations induced by the presence of the tumor. While analgesic treatment restored nesting and cookie test behaviors, it did not fully restore voluntary wheel running indicating that pain is not the exclusive driver of such behavioral shifts. Unraveling the interaction between the tumor, infiltrating nerves, and the brain is pivotal to developing targeted interventions to alleviate the mental health burdens associated with cancer.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88256">PITAR, a DNA damage-inducible cancer/testis long noncoding RNA, inactivates p53 by binding and stabilizing TRIM28 mRNA</a></h4>

              
                In tumors with WT p53, alternate mechanisms of p53 inactivation are reported. Here, we have identified a long noncoding RNA, <i>PITAR</i> (<i>p</i>53 <i>I</i>nactivating <i>T</i>RIM28 <i>A</i>ssociated <i>R</i>NA), as an inhibitor of p53. <i>PITAR</i> is an oncogenic Cancer/testis lncRNA and is highly expressed in glioblastoma (GBM) and glioma stem-like cells (GSC). We establish that <i>TRIM28</i> mRNA, which encodes a p53-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase, is a direct target of <i>PITAR. PITAR</i> interaction with <i>TRIM28</i> RNA stabilized <i>TRIM28</i> mRNA, which resulted in increased TRIM28 protein levels and reduced p53 steady-state levels due to enhanced p53 ubiquitination. DNA damage activated <i>PITAR</i>, in addition to p53, in a p53-independent manner, thus creating an incoherent feedforward loop to inhibit the DNA damage response by p53. While <i>PITAR</i> silencing inhibited the growth of WT p53 containing GSCs in vitro and reduced glioma tumor growth in vivo, its overexpression enhanced the tumor growth in a <i>TRIM28</i>-dependent manner and promoted resistance to Temozolomide. Thus, we establish an alternate way of p53 inactivation by <i>PITAR</i>, which maintains low p53 levels in normal cells and attenuates the DNA damage response by p53. Finally, we propose <i>PITAR</i> as a potential GBM therapeutic target.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95393">Sensitivity to vocal emotions emerges in newborns at 37 weeks gestational age</a></h4>

              
                Emotional responsiveness in neonates, particularly their ability to discern vocal emotions, plays an evolutionarily adaptive role in human communication and adaptive behaviors. The developmental trajectory of emotional sensitivity in neonates is crucial for understanding the foundations of early social-emotional functioning. However, the precise onset of this sensitivity and its relationship with gestational age (GA) remain subjects of investigation. In a study involving 120 healthy neonates categorized into six groups based on their GA (ranging from 35 and 40 weeks), we explored their emotional responses to vocal stimuli. These stimuli encompassed disyllables with happy and neutral prosodies, alongside acoustically matched nonvocal control sounds. The assessments occurred during natural sleep states using the odd-ball paradigm and event-related potentials. The results reveal a distinct developmental change at 37 weeks GA, marking the point at which neonates exhibit heightened perceptual acuity for emotional vocal expressions. This newfound ability is substantiated by the presence of the mismatch response, akin to an initial form of adult mismatch negativity, elicited in response to positive emotional vocal prosody. Notably, this perceptual shift’s specificity becomes evident when no such discrimination is observed in acoustically matched control sounds. Neonates born before 37 weeks GA do not display this level of discrimination ability. This developmental change has important implications for our understanding of early social-emotional development, highlighting the role of gestational age in shaping early perceptual abilities. Moreover, while these findings introduce the potential for a valuable screening tool for conditions like autism, characterized by atypical social-emotional functions, it is important to note that the current data are not yet robust enough to fully support this application. This study makes a substantial contribution to the broader field of developmental neuroscience and holds promise for future research on early intervention in neurodevelopmental disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96852">Dynamic chromatin architecture identifies new autoimmune-associated enhancers for IL2 and novel genes regulating CD4+ T cell activation</a></h4>

              
                Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of genetic signals associated with autoimmune disease. The majority of these signals are located in non-coding regions and likely impact <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements (cRE). Because cRE function is dynamic across cell types and states, profiling the epigenetic status of cRE across physiological processes is necessary to characterize the molecular mechanisms by which autoimmune variants contribute to disease risk. We localized risk variants from 15 autoimmune GWAS to cRE active during TCR-CD28 co-stimulation of naïve human CD4+ T cells. To characterize how dynamic changes in gene expression correlate with cRE activity, we measured transcript levels, chromatin accessibility, and promoter–cRE contacts across three phases of naive CD4+ T cell activation using RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and HiC. We identified ~1200 protein-coding genes physically connected to accessible disease-associated variants at 423 GWAS signals, at least one-third of which are dynamically regulated by activation. From these maps, we functionally validated a novel stretch of evolutionarily conserved intergenic enhancers whose activity is required for activation-induced <i>IL2</i> gene expression in human and mouse, and is influenced by autoimmune-associated genetic variation. The set of genes implicated by this approach are enriched for genes controlling CD4+ T cell function and genes involved in human inborn errors of immunity, and we pharmacologically validated eight implicated genes as novel regulators of T cell activation. These studies directly show how autoimmune variants and the genes they regulate influence processes involved in CD4+ T cell proliferation and activation.

">Working memory predicts long-term recognition of auditory sequences: Dissociation between confirmed predictions and prediction errors</a></h4>

              
                Memory is a crucial cognitive process involving several subsystems: sensory memory (SM), short-term memory (STM), working memory (WM), and long-term memory (LTM). While each has been extensively studied, the interaction between WM and LTM, particularly in relation to predicting temporal sequences, remains largely unexplored. This study investigates the relationship between WM and LTM, and how these relate to aging and musical training. Using three datasets with a total of 244 healthy volunteers across various age groups, we examined the impact of WM on LTM recognition of novel and previously memorized musical sequences. Our results show that WM abilities are significantly related to recognition of novel sequences, with a more pronounced effect in older compared to younger adults. In contrast, WM did not similarly impact the recognition of memorized sequences, which implies that different cognitive processes are involved in handling prediction errors compared to confirmatory predictions, and that WM contributes to these processes differently. Additionally, our findings confirm that musical training enhances memory performance. Future research should extend our investigation to populations with cognitive impairments and explore the underlying neural substrates.

">EFFECTS OF SPINAL TRANSECTION AND LOCOMOTOR SPEED ON MUSCLE SYNERGIES OF THE CAT HINDLIMB</a></h4>

              
                It was suggested that during locomotion, the nervous system controls movement by activating groups of muscles, or muscle synergies. Analysis of muscle synergies can reveal the organization of spinal locomotor networks and how it depends on the state of the nervous system, such as before and after spinal cord injury, and on different locomotor conditions, including a change in speed. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of spinal transection and locomotor speed on hindlimb muscle synergies and their time-dependent activity patterns in adult cats. EMG activities of 15 hindlimb muscles were recorded in 9 adult cats of either sex during tied-belt treadmill locomotion at speeds of 0.4, 0.7, and 1.0 m/s before and after recovery from a low thoracic spinal transection. We determined EMG burst groups using cluster analysis of EMG burst onset and offset times and muscle synergies using non-negative matrix factorization. We found five major EMG burst groups and five muscle synergies in each of six experimental conditions (2 states x 3 speeds). In each case, the synergies accounted for at least 90% of muscle EMG variance. Both spinal transection and locomotion speed modified subgroups of EMG burst groups and the composition and activation patterns of selected synergies. However, these changes did not modify the general organization of muscle synergies. Based on the obtained results, we propose an organization for a pattern formation network of a two-level central pattern generator that can be tested in neuromechanical simulations of spinal circuits controlling cat locomotion.

">Increased protein kinase Mζ expression by Minocycline and N-acetylcysteine restoreslate-phase long-term potentiation and spatial learning after closed head injury in mice</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive deficits frequently arise after traumatic brain injury. The murine closed head injury (CHI) models these deficits since injured mice cannot acquire Barnes maze. Dosing of minocycline plus N-acetylcysteine beginning 12 hours post-CHI (MN12) restores Barnes maze acquisition by an unknown mechanism. Increased hippocampal synaptic efficacy is needed to acquire Barnes maze, synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) models this increased synaptic efficacy in vitro. LTP has an early phase (E-LTP) lasting up to one hour that is mediated by second messengers that is followed by a late phase (L-LTP) that needs new synthesis of protein kinase M zeta (PKM{zeta}). PKM{zeta} has constitutive kinase activity because it lacks the autoinhibitory regulatory domain found in other PKCs. Due to its constitutive activity, the amount of PKM{zeta} kinase activity is determined by PKMz protein levels. We report that CHI bilaterally decreases PKM{zeta} levels in the CA3 and CA1 hippocampus. MN12 increases CA1 PKM{zeta} expression. CHI inhibits E-LTP in slices from the ipsilesional hippocampus and inhibits L-LTP in slices from both hippocamppi. MN12 treatment reestablishes both E-LTP and L-LTP in slices from the injured MN12-treated hippocampus. The restoration of L-LTP from injured MN12-treated hippocampus is mediated by PKM{zeta} because L-LTP is blocked by the specific PKM{zeta} inhibitor, {zeta}-stat. Hippocampal {zeta}-stat infusions also prevent Barnes maze acquisition in injured, MN12-treated mice. These data suggest that post-injury minocycline plus N-acetylcysteine targets PKM{zeta} to improve synaptic plasticity and cognition in mice with closed-head injury.

">IGF-1 and insulin receptors in LepRb neurons jointly regulate body growth, bone mass, reproduction, and metabolism</a></h4>

              
                Leptin receptor (LepRb)-expressing neurons are known to link body growth and reproduction, but whether these functions are mediated via insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) signaling is unknown. IGF-1 and insulin can bind to each other's receptors, permitting IGF-1 signaling in the absence of IGF1R. Therefore, we created mice lacking IGF1R exclusively in LepRb neurons (IGF1RLepRb mice) and simultaneously lacking IGF1R and insulin receptor (IR) in LepRb neurons (IGF1R/IRLepRb mice) and then characterized their body growth, bone morphology, reproductive and metabolic functions. We found that IGF1R and IR in LepRb neurons were required for normal timing of pubertal onset, while IGF1R in LepRb neurons played a predominant role in regulating adult fertility and exerted protective effects against reproductive aging. Accompanying these reproductive deficits, IGF1RLepRb mice and IGF1R/IRLepRb mice had transient growth retardation. Notably, IGF1R in LepRb neurons was indispensable for normal trabecular and cortical bone mass accrual in both sexes. These findings suggest that IGF1R in LepRb neurons is involved in the interaction among body growth, bone development, and reproduction. Though only mild changes in body weight were detected, simultaneous deletion of IGF1R and IR in LepRb neurons caused dramatically increased fat mass composition, decreased lean mass composition, lower energy expenditure, and locomotor activity in both sexes. Male IGF1R/IRLepRb mice exhibited impaired insulin sensitivity. These findings suggest that IGF1R and IR in LepRb neurons jointly regulated body composition, energy balance, and glucose homeostasis. Taken together, our studies identified the sex-dependent complex roles of IGF1R and IR in LepRb neurons in regulating body growth, reproduction, and metabolism.

">Hippocampal γCaMKII dopaminylation promotes synaptic-to-nuclear signaling and memory formation</a></h4>

              
                Protein monoaminylation is a class of posttranslational modification (PTM) that contributes to transcription, physiology and behavior. While recent analyses have focused on histones as critical substrates of monoaminylation, the broader repertoire of monoaminylated proteins in brain remains unclear. Here, we report the development/implementation of a chemical probe for the biorthogonal labeling, enrichment and proteomics-based detection of dopaminylated proteins in brain. We identified 1,557 dopaminylated proteins - many synaptic - including {gamma}CaMKII, which mediates Ca2+-dependent cellular signaling and hippocampal-dependent memory. We found that {gamma}CaMKII dopaminylation is largely synaptic and mediates synaptic-to-nuclear signaling, neuronal gene expression and intrinsic excitability, and contextual memory. These results indicate a critical role for synaptic dopaminylation in adaptive brain plasticity, and may suggest roles for these phenomena in pathologies associated with altered monoaminergic signaling.

                The dorsal vagal complex (DVC) is a region in the brainstem comprised of an intricate network of specialized cells responsible for sensing and propagating many appetite-related cues. Understanding the dynamics controlling appetite requires deeply exploring the cell types and transitory states harbored in this brain site. We generated a multi-species DVC cell atlas using single nuclei RNAseq (sn-RNAseq), thorough curation and harmonization of mouse and rat data which includes >180,000 cells and 123 cell identities at 5 granularities of cellular resolution. We report unique DVC features such as Kcnj3 expression in Ca-permeable astrocytes as well as new cell populations like neurons co-expressing Th and Cck, and a leptin receptor-expressing neuron population in the rat area postrema which is marked by expression of the progenitor marker, Pdgfra. In summary, our findings suggest there are distinct cellular populations specific to the DVC compared to other brain sites and our comprehensive atlas is a valuable tool for the study of this metabolic center.

                Persistent DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are enigmatically implicated in neurodegenerative diseases including Huntingtons disease (HD), the inherited late-onset disorder caused by CAG repeat elongations in Huntingtin (HTT). Here we combine biochemistry, computation and molecular cell biology to unveil a mechanism whereby HTT coordinates a Transcription-Coupled Non-Homologous End-Joining (TC-NHEJ) complex. HTT joins TC-NHEJ proteins PNKP, Ku70/80, and XRCC4 with chromatin remodeler Brahma-related Gene 1 (BRG1) to resolve transcription-associated DSBs in brain. HTT recruitment to DSBs in transcriptionally active gene-rich regions is BRG1-dependent while efficient TC-NHEJ protein recruitment is HTT-dependent. Notably, mHTT compromises TC-NHEJ interactions and repair activity, promoting DSB accumulation in HD tissues. Importantly, HTT or PNKP overexpression restores TC-NHEJ in a Drosophila HD model dramatically improving genome integrity, motor defects, and lifespan. Collective results uncover HTT stimulation of DSB repair by organizing a TC-NHEJ complex that is impaired by mHTT thereby implicating dysregulation of transcription-coupled DSB repair in mHTT pathophysiology.

                The fundus of the superior temporal sulcus (FST) in macaques is implicated in the processing of complex motion signals, yet a human homolog remains elusive. Here we considered potential localizers and evaluated their effectiveness in delineating putative FST (pFST), from hMT and MST, two nearby motion-sensitive areas in humans. Nine healthy participants underwent scanning sessions with 2D and 3D motion localizers, as well as population receptive field (pRF) mapping. We observed consistent anterior and inferior activation relative to hMT and MST in response to stimuli that contained coherent 3D, but not 2D, motion. Motion opponency and myelination measures further validated the functional and structural distinction between pFST and hMT/MST. At the same time, standard pRF mapping techniques that reveal the visual field organization of hMT/MST proved suboptimal for delineating pFST. Our findings provide a robust framework for localizing pFST in humans, and underscore its distinct functional role in motion processing.

                Exercise has been extensively studied in Parkinson's Disease, with a particular focus on the potential for neuroprotection that has been demonstrated in animal models. While this preclinical work has provided insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms, it has not addressed the neurophysiological changes during exercise. Here, first, we tested for neuroprotective effects of adaptive wheel exercise in the 6-hydroxydopamine mouse model of Parkinson's disease. Finding none, we probed the neurophysiology of exercise as a state of high motor function amidst an unameliorated Parkinsonian lesion. Exercise was associated with characteristic, excitatory changes in the dopamine-depleted substantia nigra, which could be suppressed along with exercise itself by dopamine receptor blockade. Going forward, the functional state evoked by exercise merits further study, as it may represent an optimal target for neuromodulation, even if the underlying pathology cannot be averted.

">Biases in population codes with a few active neurons</a></h4>

              
                Throughout the brain information is coded in the activity of multiple neurons at once, so called population codes. Population codes are a robust and accurate way of coding information. One can evaluate the quality of population coding by trying to read out the code with a decoder, and estimate the encoded stimulus. Coding quality has traditionally been evaluated in terms of the trial-to-trial variation in the estimate. However, codes can also display biases. While most decoders yield unbiased estimators in the limit of many active neurons, we find that when only few neurons are active, biases readily emerge for many decoders. We show that the biases turn out to have a non-trivial dependence on noise and tuning curve properties. We also introduce a technique to estimate the bias and variance of Bayesian decoders. Overall, the work expands our understanding of population coding.

">A neural mechanism for compositional generalization of structure in humans</a></h4>

              
                An exceptional human ability to adapt to the dynamics of novel environments relies on abstracting and generalizing past experiences. While previous research has examined how humans generalize isolated sequential processes, we know little concerning the neural mechanisms that enable adaptation to the more complex dynamics that govern everyday experience. Here, we deployed a novel sequence learning task based on graph factorization, coupled with simultaneous magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings, to ask whether reuse of experiential 'building blocks' provides an abstract structural scaffolding that enables inference and generalization. We provide behavioral evidence that participants decomposed task experience into subprocesses, abstracted dynamical subprocess structures away from sensory specifics, and transferred these to a new task environment. Neurally we show this transfer is underpinned by a representational alignment of abstract subprocesses across task phases, where this included enhanced neural similarity among stimuli that adhered to the same subprocess, a temporally evolving mapping between predictive representations of subprocesses and a generalization of the precise dynamical roles that stimuli occupy within graph structures. Crucially, decoding strength for dynamical role representations predicted behavioral success in transfer of subprocess knowledge, consistent with a role in supporting behavioral adaptation in new environments. We propose a structural scaffolding mechanism enables compositional generalization of dynamical subprocesses that facilitate efficient adaptation within new contexts.

">Novel insights into Emx2 and Dmrta2 cooperation during cortex development and evidence for Dmrta2 function in choroid plexus</a></h4>

              
                Early dorsal telencephalon development is coordinated by an interplay of transcription factors that exhibit a graded expression pattern in neural progenitors. How they function together to orchestrate cortical development remains largely unknown. The Emx2 and Dmrta2 genes encode TFs that are expressed in a similar caudomedial-high/ rostrolateral-low gradient in the ventricular zone of the developing dorsal telencephalon with, in the medial pallium, Dmrta2 but not Emx2 expressed in the developing choroid plexus. Their constitutive loss has been shown to impart similar cortical abnormalities, and their combined deletion exacerbates the phenotypes, suggesting possible cooperation during cortex development. In this study, we utilized molecular and genetic approaches to dissect how Emx2 functions with Dmrta2 during cortical development. Our results show that while they regulate a similar set of genes, their common direct targets are limited but include key regulators of cortical development. Identification of the interaction partners of Emx2 suggests that it coordinates with the LIM-domain binding protein Ldb1 to execute the activation and repression of some of its downstream targets. Finally, while Emx2 is known to suppress choroid plexus development, we also provide evidence that Dmrta2 is in contrast required for choroid plexus since in its absence in medial telencephalic progenitors, mice develop hydrocephalous postnatally, a phenotype that appears to be due to a compromised cytoarchitecture. Together, these data indicate that Emx2 and Dmrta2 have similar but also distinct functions in telencephalon development and provide the first insights into Emx2 mechanism of action.

">Morphological profiling in human dopaminergic neurons identifies mitochondrial uncoupling as a neuroprotective effect</a></h4>

              
                Multiple pathological cell biological processes in midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons contribute to Parkinson's disease (PD). Described disease mechanisms converge upon defects in protein degradation, disruption of vesicular trafficking, endolysosomal function, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Current cellular PD models for in vitro drug discovery are often of non-neuronal origin and do not take complex pathological interactions into account and focus on a single readout or phenotype. Here, we used patient-derived SNCA triplication (SNCA-4x) and isogenic control (SNCA-corr) mDA neurons and applied high-content imaging-based morphological profiling with the goal to determine and rescue multiple phenotypes simultaneously. We performed compound screening using a total of 1,020 compounds with biological activity annotations relevant to PD pathobiology including some FDA-approved drugs. We scored compounds based on their ability to revert the SNCA-4x mDA neuron morphological profile towards a healthy-like isogenic control neuronal profile. Top-scoring compounds led to a morphological rescue in SNCA-4x mDA neurons including increased Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) level and decreased total -synuclein (Syn) protein levels. Multiple hit compounds were also linked to mitochondrial biology and we further evaluated them by determining their effect on neuronal mitochondrial membrane potential and cytoplasmic ROS levels. Additional biochemical analysis of the protonophore and mitochondrial uncoupler Tyrphostin A9 showed decreased total ROS levels and normalized mitochondrial membrane potential, and an increase in mitochondrial respiration. We confirmed this effect in mDA neurons by using five structurally related molecules and measuring mitochondrial activity and membrane potential. Additionally, Western blotting indicated that mitochondrial uncouplers, such as Tyrphostin A9, can decrease both low and high molecular weight forms of Syn. Based on target agnostic morphological profiling in human mDA neurons, we therefore identified a connection between the compound-induced rescue of multiple morphological features, mild mitochondrial uncoupling, and a Syn protein level decrease.

">The Cellular and Extra-Cellular Proteomic Signature of Human Dopaminergic Neurons Carrying the LRRK2 G2019S Mutation</a></h4>

              
                Extracellular vesicles are easily accessible in various biofluids and allow the assessment of disease-related changes of the proteome. This has made them a promising target for biomarker studies, especially in the field of neurodegeneration where access to diseased tissue is very limited. Genetic variants in the LRRK2 gene have been linked to both familial and sporadic forms of Parkinson's disease. With LRRK2 inhibitors entering clinical trials, there is an unmet need for biomarkers that reflect LRRK2-specific pathology and target engagement. In this study, we used induced pluripotent stem cells derived from a patient with Parkinson's disease carrying the LRRK2 G2019S mutation and an isogenic gene corrected control to generate human dopaminergic neurons. We isolated extracellular vesicles and neuronal cell lysates and characterized their proteomic signature using data-independent acquisition proteomics. We performed differential expression analysis and identified 595 significantly differentially regulated proteins in extracellular vesicles and 3205 in cell lysates. Next, we performed gene ontology enrichment analyses on the dysregulated proteins and found close association to biological processes relevant in neurodegeneration and Parkinson's disease. Finally, we focused on proteins that were dysregulated in both the extracellular and cellular proteomes and provide a list of ten promising biomarker candidates that are functionally relevant in neurodegeneration and linked to LRRK2 associated pathology. Among those was the sonic hedgehog signaling molecule, a protein that has tightly been linked to LRRK2-related disruption of cilia function. In conclusion, we characterized the cellular and extracellular proteome of dopaminergic neurons carrying the LRRK2 G2019S mutation and propose an experimentally based list of promising biomarker candidates for future studies.

	<p>Background/Objectives: With the rapid expansion of the global sports market, the significance of sports sponsorship has attracted growing attention. However, during the golden age of the sports industry&amp;amp;rsquo;s development in China, international sports brand giants such as Nike, Adidas, and Under Armour have rapidly captured a substantial share of the Chinese sports consumer market through their distinctive product designs and varied marketing strategies. This has resulted in a highly competitive environment for China&amp;amp;rsquo;s sports goods industry. Therefore, fostering the improved development of domestic sports brands has become a crucial issue deserving of thorough scholarly investigation. This study examines how consumers&amp;amp;rsquo; differing levels of sports involvement and the degree of fit between the sponsoring brand and the sponsored event affect their cognitive and emotional responses to sports sponsorships. Methods: By employing Predictive Coding Theory and ERP (event-related potential) brainwave technology, this study delves into the psychological and neurobiological levels to analyze the impact of consumer sports involvement on the processing of sponsorship information. Results: The results indicate significant differences in cognitive and emotional responses between high-involvement and low-involvement consumers. Additionally, the fit between the sponsoring brand and the sponsored event also significantly affects consumers&amp;amp;rsquo; cognitive and emotional responses. These differences stem from consumers&amp;amp;rsquo; complex and sophisticated predictive coding models. Conclusions: This study not only provides scientific evidence for sports brands in selecting and executing sponsorship activities, but also offers new perspectives for evaluating and optimizing sponsorship effectiveness.</p>

	<p>The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a cornerstone tool for the diagnosis, management, and prognosis of selected patient populations. EEGs offer significant advantages such as high temporal resolution, real-time cortical function assessment, and bedside usability. The quantitative EEG (qEEG) added the possibility of long recordings being processed in a compressive manner, making EEG revision more efficient for experienced users, and more friendly for new ones. Recent advancements in commercially available software, such as Persyst, have significantly expanded and facilitated the use of qEEGs, marking the beginning of a new era in its application. As a result, there has been a notable increase in the practical, real-world utilization of qEEGs in recent years. This paper aims to provide an overview of the current applications of qEEGs in daily neurological emergencies and ICU practice, and some elementary principles of qEEGs using Persyst software in clinical settings. This article illustrates basic qEEG patterns encountered in critical care and adopts the new terminology proposed for spectrogram reporting.</p>

                Background The use of chemical pesticides without proper health literacy (HL) and necessary pesticide protective behaviors (PPB) can result in adverse effects on human health. Methods This study aims to determine if there is a correlation between HL and PPB among farmers in the Nakhon Ratchasima province, using a random sample of 464 farmers. Structured interviews consisted of three parts: 1. General information, 2. Health literacy (including knowledge, understanding, and other sub-aspects), and 3. Protective behaviors against chemical exposure. Each part of the questionnaire had a reliability index of 0.60 or higher. The reliability of the 2nd and 3rd parts of the questionnaire were as follows: sub-sections of part 2 had a Kuder-Richardson (KR-20) coefficient of 0.79 and Cronbach’s alpha (α) coefficient of 0.85-0.86, while part 3 had an α of 0.88. Risk of chemical exposure was assessed using a Cholinesterase Reactive Paper test administered by a finger-prick blood test. Data was analyzed using the Spearman correlation and binary logistic regression. The study was reviewed by the Human Research Ethics Committee with the approval date: August 9, 2021, and expiry date: August 9, 2022. Results Most participants had moderate levels of overall HL (48.8%) and PPB (44.6%). There was a statistically significant positive correlation between HL and PPB (rs(478) = 0.70, p<.005). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that HL had a statistically significant positive association with PPB (p<.001, OR = 6.57, 95% CI 3.95, 10.94) and was associated with blood cholinesterase levels. Conclusions These findings highlight the need for increased health literacy among farmers in Thailand to ensure correct protective behaviors against chemical exposure and reduce the adverse effects of pesticide exposure on human health.

                Shade selection is one of the most important factors that determines the satisfaction of the patient with the dental prosthesis and thus the overall success of the treatment. Conventional methods of shade selection require the presence of existing teeth or past dental/photographic records. In the absence of these, shade selection becomes challenging and must be done subjectively and arbitrarily based on the patient’s age and sex. This study aims to assess the prevalence, satisfaction, and preference of tooth shades, investigating their correlation with age, sex, and skin shade in a diverse sample of 120 participants. Methods A total of 120 participants, evenly distributed among 60 males and 60 females, were surveyed. Participants were categorized into age groups (n=15) and asked about their satisfaction with existing tooth shades and their preferences. Results The most common existing tooth shade was Value 2 (52.5%). Statistical analysis using Chi-square tests revealed that Value 2 was the most desired shade among males and females alike, particularly in the age group of 41 to 50 years (p < 0.001). Shade 2L1.5 was the most prevalent (n=26), with Value 2 (59.16%) being the most sought-after shade, followed by Shade 2L1.5 (n=21), Shade 2M1 (n=18), Shade 1M1 (n=15), and Shade 2R1.5 (n=14). Existing tooth shades of Value 0 were the least common. The highest satisfaction with existing shades was observed in males aged 41 to 50 (n=15), followed by males aged 51 to 60 (n=14) and females aged 31 to 40 (n=12) and 41 to 50 (n=12). Significant differences in satisfaction were noted among males (p < 0.001). Conclusions This study reveals a consistent and strong preference among both males and females for tooth shades classified as Value 2, following the VITA Tooth-Guide 3D Master shade guide. This universal preference suggests the relevance and acceptance of this shade category across diverse patient groups.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-98/v5?src=rss">Metabolomic characterization of human glioblastomas and patient plasma: a pilot study [version 5; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Glioblastoma (GBM) is a clinically challenging primary brain tumor with poor survival outcome despite surgical resection and intensive chemoradiation. The metabolic heterogeneity of GBM can become biomarkers for treatment response, resistance, and outcome prediction. The aim of the study is to investigate metabolic distinctions between primary and recurrent GBM tissue and patient plasma to establish feasibility for metabolic profiling. Methods A single-center cohort study analyzed tissue and blood samples from 15 patients with GBM using untargeted metabolomic/lipidomic assays. Metabolomic, lipidomic, and biogenic amine analyses were conducted on GBM tissue and patient plasma at diagnosis and recurrence using untargeted mass spectrometry. The study utilized a small but longitudinally collected cohort to evaluate alteration in metabolites, lipids, and biogenic amines between specimens at diagnosis and recurrence. Results Exploratory analysis revealed significant alteration in metabolites, lipids, and biogenic amines between diagnostic and recurrent states in both tumor and plasma specimens. Notable metabolites differed at recurrence, including N-alpha-methylhistamine, glycerol-3-phosphate, phosphocholine, and succinic acid in tissue, and indole-3-acetate, and urea in plasma. Principal component analysis revealed distinct metabolomic profiles between tumor tissue and patient plasma. Distinct metabolic profiles were observed in GBM tissue and patient plasma at recurrence, demonstrating the feasibility of using metabolomic methodologies for longitudinal studies. One patient exhibited a unique tumor resistance signature at diagnosis, possibly indicating a high-risk metabolomic phenotype. Conclusions In this small cohort, the findings suggest the potential of metabolomic signatures of GBM tissue and patient plasma for risk stratification, outcome prediction, and the development of novel adjuvant metabolic-targeting therapies. The findings suggest metabolic discrepancies at diagnosis and recurrence in tissue and plasma, highlighting potential implications for evaluation of clinical response. The identification of significant changes in metabolite abundance emphasizes the need for larger studies using targeted metabolomics to validate and further explore these profiles.

                Background Primary cam morphology, an acquired bony prominence at the head-neck junction of the femur, is highly prevalent in athlete populations, and causally associated with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome and early hip osteoarthritis. Experts agreed on key elements for primary cam morphology and a prioritised research agenda for the field. This research agenda will require higher-quality research to achieve meaningful progress on the aetiology, prognosis and treatment of primary cam morphology in athletes. Aim To explore stakeholders’ perspectives of high-quality research in the research field of primary cam morphology and its natural history. Methods Grounded in interpretive description, we used semi-structured interviews to explore stakeholders’ perspectives of high-quality research in the primary cam morphology research field. The framework for INcreasing QUality In patient-orientated academic clinical REsearch (INQUIRE) informed the interview guide. Audio-recorded interviews were transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. We recruited a heterogenous and purposive maximum variation sample, drawing from a network of research contacts. Results Fifteen individuals, several with multiple perspectives on research quality in the field, participated. Exploring stakeholders’ perspectives on research quality through an established research quality framework (INQUIRE) illuminated areas for immediate action for research communities in the field of primary cam morphology and its natural history. We crafted five action inviting themes: research communities should: partner with athletes/patients; champion equity, diversity and inclusion; collaborate with one another; pursue open science; and nurture young scholars. Conclusion The findings of this study could inform concrete actions by research communities to pursue higher quality research—more research value and less waste—in the field of primary cam morphology and its natural history. Although the five action-inviting themes reflect contemporary trends in research, and could therefore be transferable to other areas of research, their practical application remains context- and field-specific.

                Background Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) is commonly fatal, with an overall mortality rate of nearly 90%, and the risk of subsequent rupture remains high, especially in large aneurysm diameters or progressive disease. Unfavorable neck anatomy in EVAR is linked to early graft failure and long-term complications. Recently, a novel multiple stiff wire (MSW) technique has been developed to overcome the challenges of hostile neck anatomy without introducing additional devices and procedural complexity. It has also been feasible in a series of elective cases. In this case, we report the first-ever utilization of the MSW technique in an emergency case of an acute contained rAAA with a conical-shaped, severely angulated neck who underwent Endovascular Aortic Repair (EVAR). Case presentation A 61-year-old man came with intermittent sharp stomach pain radiating to his back since three weeks ago. Physical examination showed elevated blood pressure and anemic conjunctiva. Laboratory examinations showed anemia, leukocytosis, elevated D-dimer level, high creatinine level, and low eGFR. CT-Scan Angiography (CTA) revealed severely hostile anatomy, a conical-shaped abdominal aorta aneurysm with a length of 13.2 cm and a maximum diameter of 9.3 cm with angulation of 90.1°. The patient was diagnosed with Ruptured AAA with a conical-shaped, severely angulated neck. Endovascular Aortic Repair (EVAR) management with MSW technique was planned for him. After four days, The patient was discharged in a clinically stable condition with optimal medical treatment and education. Conclusion The endovascular approach could be performed in emergency settings and has been proven to reduce length of stay, mortality, and morbidity rates. In this case, the endovascular approach with the MSW technique showed promising results for the patient.

                Background Traditional optimization methods often struggle to balance global exploration and local refinement, particularly in complex real-world problems. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel hybrid optimization strategy that integrates the Nelder-Mead (NM) technique and the Genetic Algorithm (GA), named the Genetic and Nelder-Mead Algorithm (GANMA). This hybrid approach aims to enhance performance across various benchmark functions and parameter estimation tasks. Methods GANMA combines the global search capabilities of GA with the local refinement strength of NM. It is first tested on 15 benchmark functions commonly used to evaluate optimization strategies. The effectiveness of GANMA is also demonstrated through its application to parameter estimation problems, showcasing its practical utility in real-world scenarios. Results GANMA outperforms traditional optimization methods in terms of robustness, convergence speed, and solution quality. The hybrid algorithm excels across different function landscapes, including those with high dimensionality and multimodality, which are often encountered in real-world optimization issues. Additionally, GANMA improves model accuracy and interpretability in parameter estimation tasks, enhancing both model fitting and prediction. Conclusions GANMA proves to be a flexible and powerful optimization method suitable for both benchmark optimization and real-world parameter estimation challenges. Its capability to efficiently explore parameter spaces and refine solutions makes it a promising tool for scientific, engineering, and economic applications. GANMA offers a valuable solution for improving model performance and effectively handling complex optimization problems.

                <p>by Chonprakun Thagun, Masaki Odahara, Yutaka Kodama, Keiji Numata</p>

Plastids are pivotal target organelles for comprehensively enhancing photosynthetic and metabolic traits in plants via plastid engineering. Plastidial proteins predominantly originate in the nucleus and must traverse membrane-bound multiprotein translocons to access these organelles. This import process is meticulously regulated by chloroplast-targeting peptides (cTPs). Whereas many cTPs have been employed to guide recombinantly expressed functional proteins to chloroplasts, there is a critical need for more efficient cTPs. Here, we performed a comprehensive exploration and comparative assessment of an advanced suite of cTPs exhibiting superior targeting capabilities. We employed a multifaceted approach encompassing computational prediction, in planta expression, fluorescence tracking, and in vitro chloroplast import studies to identify and analyze 88 cTPs associated with <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> mutants with phenotypes linked to chloroplast function. These polypeptides exhibited distinct abilities to transport green fluorescent protein (GFP) to various compartments within leaf cells, particularly chloroplasts. A highly efficient cTP derived from <i>Arabidopsis</i> plastid ribosomal protein L35 (At2g24090) displayed remarkable effectiveness in chloroplast localization. This cTP facilitated the activities of chloroplast-targeted RNA-processing proteins and metabolic enzymes within plastids. This cTP could serve as an ideal transit peptide for precisely targeting biomolecules to plastids, leading to advancements in plastid engineering.

<p>High nicotine dose induces anxiety-like behavior in mice in the Open Field Test, alongside oxidative stress, proinflammatory cytokine secretion, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) reduction in brain regions. Cannabidiol acts as an anxiolytic, exhibiting antioxidant activities, reducing cytokines, and normalizing BDNF levels.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>High doses of nicotine administered to rodents serve as a model for studying anxiety and test compounds' potential anxiolytic effects. At these doses, anxiety in rodents is accompanied by disruption of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The endocannabinoids and nicotine modulate several central nervous system processes via their specific receptors, impacting locomotion, anxiety, memory, nociception, and reward. Cannabidiol (CBD), an active ingredient of <i>Cannabis sativa</i> L., is devoid of psychoactive actions and has gained attention for its anxiolytic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties, among others. This work aims to examine the potential anxiety-reducing properties of CBD in a well-established experimental mouse model of anxiety-like behavior induced by high doses of nicotine on male C57BL/6 mice. In this context, the open-field behavioral test was specially conducted to assess CBD's effects on anxiety-like behavior and locomotion. Brain neuronal plasticity, modulated by BDNF, along with a diverse array of blood's metabolic markers, was examined as a means of evaluating systemic toxicity under various treatments. Finally, oxidative stress was evaluated through the measurement of glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and malondialdehyde (MDA), while pro-inflammatory cytokine assessments were conducted to evaluate redox status and immune system function. Our research suggests that CBD shows potential in reducing anxiety-like behaviors induced by high doses of nicotine, by mitigating changes in BDNF protein levels in cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum. At the same time, CBD targets specific liver enzymes, maintains tissue's systemic toxicity (i.e., renal, kidney, and pancreatic), balances redox status (SOD, GSH, and MDA), and regulates the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-6).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27059?af=R">Laser Ablation of Periventricular Nodular Heterotopia for Medically Refractory Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Periventricular nodular heterotopia (PVNH) is the most common neuronal heterotopia, frequently resulting in pharmaco-resistant epilepsy. Here, we characterize variables that predict good epilepsy outcomes following surgical intervention using stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) -informed magnetic resonance-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (MRgLITT).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A retrospective review of consecutive cases from a single high-volume epilepsy referral center identified patients who underwent SEEG evaluation for PVNH to characterize the intervention and outcomes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Thirty-nine patients underwent SEEG-guided MRgLITT of the seizure onset zone (SoZ) in PVNH and associated epileptic tissue. PVNH and polymicrogyria (PMG) were densely sampled with a mean of 16.5 (SD = 2)/209.4 (SD = 36.9) SEEG probes/recording contacts per patient. Ablation principally targeted just the PVNH and cortex that was abnormal on imaging was ablated (5 patients) only if implicated in the SoZ. Volumetric analyses revealed a high percentage of PVNH SoZ ablation (96.6%, SD = 5.3%) in unilateral and bilateral (92.9%, SD = 7.2%) cases. Mean follow-up duration was 31.4 months (SD = 20.9). Seizure freedom (ILAE 1) was excellent: unilateral PVNH without other imaging abnormalities, 80%; PVNH with mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) or PMG, 63%; bilateral PVNH, 50%. SoZ ablation percentage significantly impacted surgical outcomes (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>PVNH plays a central role in seizure genesis as revealed by dense recordings and selective targeting by LITT. MRgLITT represents a transformative technological advance in PVNH-associated epilepsy with seizure control outcomes consistent with those seen in focal lesional epilepsies. In localized unilateral cases and otherwise normal imaging, PVNH ablation without invasive recordings may be considered, and this approach deserves to be explored further.

                Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) and schizophrenia are linked to accelerated aging leading to reduced lifespan, health span and cognitive decline. Cellular senescence, in which cells lose proliferative capacity and develop a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), plays a role in this process. Emerging research suggests that the senolytic regimen of dasatinib+quercetin (D+Q) reduces senescent cells, potentially mitigating age-related health and cognitive decline. This pilot study aims to assess the feasibility and safety of D+Q in older adults with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Methods This single-center study will recruit 30 participants total aged 50 years or older with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder or 60 years or older with TRD; the difference in age limits is because individuals with schizophrenia are biologically about 10 years older than general population owing to metabolic burden. Each participant will receive two consecutive days of 100 mg oral dasatinib plus 1250 mg oral quercetin at baseline and weeks one through three, (i.e., two days on, five days off) along with lifestyle risk management education. Questionnaires and assessments will measure health and cognitive function as well as psychiatric function at baseline, week 10, and one year. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) will measure structural and functional brain health at baseline and 10 weeks. Blood sampling for SASP testing will occur at seven time points: baseline, weeks one through four, week 10, and one year. Conclusion This pilot aims to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the senolytic regimen and D+Q’s potential to counteract accelerated aging in adults with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder and TRD. Trial registration Dasatinib Plus Quercetin for Accelerated Aging in Mental Disorders is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05838560; posted May 1, 2023.

                Biopesticides are pest control products derived from natural sources such as microbes, macro-organisms (insects and pathogens), plant extracts, and certain minerals. Many biopesticides are considered environmentally safe and can complement or substitute conventional chemical pesticides. They can also be highly specific or broad spectrum with a unique mode of action controlling a wide range of pest species. Due to their target-specificity and low to no environmental residuality, biopesticides conform to the 3 pillars of Climate-Smart Agriculture, the Sustainable Development Goals, and ultimately, the Paris Agreement. This review focuses largely on microbial biopesticides derived from fungi, bacteria, viruses, and nematodes. It discusses (i) the various microbial biopesticide formulations, (ii) the mode of microbial biopesticide action, (iii) the factors that affect the potential efficacy of biopesticides, (iv) challenges to the adoption of microbial biopesticides, and (v) the role of microbial biopesticides in Integrated Pest Management programs. Finally, advancements in application techniques, as well as future research directions and gaps are highlighted.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23629?af=R">Don't ignore the middle: Distinct mnemonic functions of intermediate hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The dorsal region of the hippocampus (dHC) mediates many of the mnemonic functions traditionally associated with the hippocampus proper, such as spatial and episodic memory, whereas ventral hippocampus (vHC) has been extensively implicated in emotional memory and motivational processes. By contrast, the functions of the intermediate hippocampus (iHC) are far less understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the mnemonic functions of iHC by reversibly inactivating iHC prior to testing memory in behavioral tasks dependent on the integrity of dHC, iHC, or vHC, namely, rapid place water maze, inhibitory avoidance, spontaneous alternation, and temporal ordering of odors. Given our previous findings showing that dHC and vHC are involved in mnemonic control of ingestive behavior, we also assessed the effects of iHC inactivation on sucrose intake. The results showed that pharmacological inhibition of iHC impairs rapid place water maze memory, which has been previously shown to be dependent on iHC but not dHC or vHC. iHC inactivation does not impact memory dependent on dHC (spontaneous alternation), vHC (temporal odor memory), or either dHC or vHC (inhibitory avoidance), and only modestly affects sucrose intake. These findings provide support for the involvement of iHC in mnemonic functions that are distinct from dHC and vHC and highlight the need to further advance our understanding of the functions of this hippocampal region that has been relatively understudied.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23623?af=R">Anatomical and electrophysiological analysis of the fasciola cinerea of the mouse hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus is considered essential for several forms of declarative memory, including spatial and social memory. Despite the extensive research of the classic subfields of the hippocampus, the fasciola cinerea (FC)—a medially located structure within the hippocampal formation—has remained largely unexplored. In the present study, we performed a morpho-functional characterization of principal neurons in the mouse FC. Using in vivo juxtacellular recording of single neurons, we found that FC neurons are distinct from neighboring CA1 pyramidal cells, both morphologically and electrophysiologically. Specifically, FC neurons displayed non-pyramidal morphology and granule cell-like apical dendrites. Compared to neighboring CA1 pyramidal neurons, FC neurons exhibited more regular in vivo firing patterns and a lower tendency to fire spikes at short interspike intervals. Furthermore, tracing experiments revealed that the FC receives inputs from the lateral but not the medial entorhinal cortex and CA3, and it provides a major intra-hippocampal projection to the septal CA2 and sparser inputs to the distal CA1. Overall, our results indicate that the FC is a morphologically and electrophysiologically distinct subfield of the hippocampal formation; given the established role of CA2 in social memory and seizure initiation, the unique efferent intra-hippocampal connectivity of the FC points to possible roles in social cognition and temporal lobe epilepsy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23624?af=R">Scene construction processes in the anterior hippocampus during temporal episodic memory retrieval</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Although the hippocampus has been implicated in both the temporal organization of memories and association of scene elements, some theoretical accounts posit that the role of the hippocampus in episodic memory is largely atemporal. In this study, we set out to explore this discrepancy by identifying hippocampal activity patterns related to scene construction while participants performed a temporal order memory task. Participants in the fMRI scanner were shown a sequence of photographs, each consisting of a central object and a contextual background scene. On each retrieval trial, participants were shown a pair of the original photographs (FULL), objects from the scenes without the background (OBJ), or background contexts without the main foreground object (BACK). In the temporal order judgment (TOJ) task, participants judged the temporal order of the pair of scenes; in the Viewing trials, two identical scenes were shown without any task. First, we found that the anterior hippocampus—particularly the CA1 and subiculum—showed similar patterns of activation between the BACK and OBJ conditions, suggesting that scene construction occurred spontaneously during both TOJ and Viewing. Furthermore, neural markers of scene construction in the anterior hippocampus did not apply to incorrect trials, showing that successful temporal memory retrieval was functionally linked to scene construction. In the cortex, time-processing areas, such as the supplementary motor area and the precuneus, and scene-processing areas, such as the parahippocampal cortex, were activated and functionally connected with the hippocampus. Together, these results support the view that the hippocampus is concurrently involved in scene construction and temporal organization of memory and propose a model of hippocampal episodic memory that takes both processes into account.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23628?af=R">Postsynaptic GABAB‐receptor mediated currents in diverse dentate gyrus interneuron types</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The processing of rich synaptic information in the dentate gyrus (DG) relies on a diverse population of inhibitory GABAergic interneurons to regulate cellular and circuit activity, in a layer-specific manner. Metabotropic GABA<sub>B</sub>-receptors (GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs) provide powerful inhibition to the DG circuit, on timescales consistent with behavior and learning, but their role in controlling the activity of interneurons is poorly understood with respect to identified cell types. We hypothesize that GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs display cell type-specific heterogeneity in signaling strength, which will have direct ramifications for signal processing in DG networks. To test this, we perform <i>in vitro</i> whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from identified DG principal cells and interneurons, followed by GABA<sub>B</sub>R pharmacology, photolysis of caged GABA, and extracellular stimulation of endogenous GABA release to classify the cell type-specific inhibitory potential. Based on our previous classification of DG interneurons, we show that postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub>R-mediated currents are present on all interneuron types albeit at different amplitudes, dependent largely on soma location and synaptic targets. GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs were coupled to inwardly-rectifying K+ channels that strongly reduced the excitability of those interneurons where large currents were observed. These data provide a systematic characterization of GABA<sub>B</sub>R signaling in the rat DG to provide greater insight into circuit dynamics.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) reside in the brain and participate in the mechanism of neurogenesis that permits the brain to generate the building blocks for enhancement of cognitive abilities and acquisition of new skills. The existence of NPCs in brain has opened a novel dimension of research to explore their potential for treatment of various neurodegenerative disorders. The present study provides novel insights into the intracellular mechanisms in neuronal cells proliferation, maturation and differentiation regulated by Quinic acid (QA). Furthermore, this study might help in discovery and development of lead molecule that can overcome the challenges in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. The growth supporting effect of QA was studied using MTT assay. For that purpose, hippocampal cell cultures of neonatal rats were treated with different concentrations of QA and incubated for 24, 48 and 72 h. Gene and protein expressions of the selected molecular markers nestin, neuron-specific class III beta-tubulin (Tuj-1), neuronal nuclear protein (NeuN), neuronal differentiation 1 (NeuroD1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neuroligin (NLGN) and vimentin were analyzed. QA-induced cell proliferation and differentiation of hippocampal progenitor cells was also accompanied by significantly increased expression of progenitor and immature neuronal marker, mature neuronal marker and differentiating factor, that is, nestin, Tuj-1, NeuN and NeuroD1, respectively. On the other hand, vimentin downregulation and constant GFAP expression were observed following QA treatment. Additionally, the effects of QA on the recovery of stressed cells was studied using in vitro model of oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD). It was observed that hippocampal cells were able to recover from OGD following the treatment with QA. These findings suggest that QA treatment promotes hippocampal neurogenesis by proliferating and differentiating of NPCs and recovers neurons from stress caused by OGD. Thus, the neurogenic potential of QA can be explored for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

                Migraine is a highly prevalent and disabling pain disorder that affects >1 billion people worldwide. One central hypothesis points to the cranial meninges as a key site underlying migraine headache genesis through complex interplay between meningeal sensory nerves, blood vessels, and adjacent immune cells. How these interactions might generate migraine headaches remains incompletely understood and a subject of much debate. In this review we discuss clinical and preclinical evidence supporting the concept that meningeal sterile inflammation, involving neurovascular and neuroimmune interactions, underlies migraine headache genesis. We examine downstream signaling pathways implicated in the development of migraine pain in response to exogenous events such as infusing migraine-triggering chemical substances. We further discuss cortex-to-meninges signaling pathways that could underlie migraine pain in response to endogenous events, such as cortical spreading depolarization (CSD), and explore future directions for the field.

                Antidepressant drugs promote neuronal plasticity, and activation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling through its receptor neuronal receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (NTRK2 or TRKB) is among the critical steps in this process. These mechanisms are shared by typical slow-acting antidepressants, fast-acting ketamine, and psychedelic compounds, although the cellular targets of each drug differ. In this opinion article, we propose that some of these antidepressants may directly bind to TRKB and allosterically potentiate BDNF signaling, among other possible effects. TRKB activation in parvalbumin-containing interneurons disinhibits cortical networks and reactivates a juvenile-like plasticity window. Subsequent rewiring of aberrant networks, coupled with environmental stimuli, may underlie its clinical antidepressant effects. The end-to-end hypothesis proposed may stimulate the search for new treatment strategies.

                In the mammalian neocortex, inhibition is important for dynamically balancing excitation and shaping the response properties of cells and circuits. The various computational functions of inhibition are thought to be mediated by different inhibitory neuron types, of which a large diversity exists in several species. Current understanding of the function and connectivity of distinct inhibitory neuron types has mainly derived from studies in transgenic mice. However, it is unknown whether knowledge gained from mouse studies applies to the non-human primate, the model system closest to humans. The lack of viral tools to selectively access inhibitory neuron types has been a major impediment to studying their function in the primate. Here, we have thoroughly validated and characterized several recently developed viral vectors designed to restrict transgene expression to GABAergic cells or their parvalbumin (PV) subtype, and identified two types that show high specificity and efficiency in marmoset V1. We show that in marmoset V1, AAV-h56D induces transgene expression in GABAergic cells with up to 91–94% specificity and 79% efficiency, but this depends on viral serotype and cortical layer. AAV-PHP.eB-S5E2 induces transgene expression in PV cells across all cortical layers with up to 98% specificity and 86–90% efficiency, depending on layer. Thus, these viral vectors are promising tools for studying GABA and PV cell function and connectivity in the primate cortex.

                Hydrostatic pressure is a dominant environmental cue for vertically migrating marine organisms but the physiological mechanisms of responding to pressure changes remain unclear. Here, we uncovered the cellular and circuit bases of a barokinetic response in the planktonic larva of the marine annelid <i>Platynereis dumerilii</i>. Increased pressure induced a rapid, graded, and adapting upward swimming response due to the faster beating of cilia in the head multiciliary band. By calcium imaging, we found that brain ciliary photoreceptors showed a graded response to pressure changes. The photoreceptors in animals mutant for <i>ciliary opsin-1</i> had a smaller sensory compartment and mutant larvae showed diminished pressure responses. The ciliary photoreceptors synaptically connect to the head multiciliary band via serotonergic motoneurons. Genetic inhibition of the serotonergic cells blocked pressure-dependent increases in ciliary beating. We conclude that ciliary photoreceptors function as pressure sensors and activate ciliary beating through serotonergic signalling during barokinesis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92719">Exploring the role of macromolecular crowding and TNFR1 in cell volume control</a></h4>

              
                The excessive cosolute densities in the intracellular fluid create a physicochemical condition called macromolecular crowding (MMC). Intracellular MMC entropically maintains the biochemical thermodynamic equilibria by favouring associative reactions while hindering transport processes. Rapid cell volume shrinkage during extracellular hypertonicity elevates the MMC and disrupts the equilibria, potentially ushering cell death. Consequently, cells actively counter the hypertonic stress through regulatory volume increase (RVI) and restore the MMC homeostasis. Here, we establish fluorescence anisotropy of EGFP as a reliable tool for studying cellular MMC and explore the spatiotemporal dynamics of MMC during cell volume instabilities under multiple conditions. Our studies reveal that the actin cytoskeleton enforces spatially varying MMC levels inside adhered cells. Within cell populations, MMC is uncorrelated with nuclear DNA content but anti-correlated with the cell spread area. Although different cell lines have statistically similar MMC distributions, their responses to extracellular hypertonicity vary. The intensity of the extracellular hypertonicity determines a cell's ability for RVI, which correlates with Nuclear Factor Kappa Beta (NFkB) activation. Pharmacological inhibition and knockdown experiments reveal that Tumour Necrosis Factor Receptor 1 (TNFR1) initiates the hypertonicity induced NFkB signalling and RVI. At severe hypertonicities, the elevated MMC amplifies cytoplasmic microviscosity and hinders Receptor Interacting Protein Kinase 1 (RIPK1) recruitment at the TNFR1 complex, incapacitating the TNFR1-NFkB signalling and consequently, RVI. Together, our studies unveil the involvement of TNFR1-NFkB signalling in modulating RVI and demonstrate the pivotal role of MMC in determining cellular osmoadaptability.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/86920">Two-way Dispatched function in Sonic hedgehog shedding and transfer to high-density lipoproteins</a></h4>

              
                The Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway controls embryonic development and tissue homeostasis after birth. This requires regulated solubilization of dual-lipidated, firmly plasma membrane-associated Shh precursors from producing cells. Although it is firmly established that the resistance-nodulation-division transporter Dispatched (Disp) drives this process, it is less clear how lipidated Shh solubilization from the plasma membrane is achieved. We have previously shown that Disp promotes proteolytic solubilization of Shh from its lipidated terminal peptide anchors. This process, termed shedding, converts tightly membrane-associated hydrophobic Shh precursors into delipidated soluble proteins. We show here that Disp-mediated Shh shedding is modulated by a serum factor that we identify as high-density lipoprotein (HDL). In addition to serving as a soluble sink for free membrane cholesterol, HDLs also accept the cholesterol-modified Shh peptide from Disp. The cholesteroylated Shh peptide is necessary and sufficient for Disp-mediated transfer because artificially cholesteroylated mCherry associates with HDL in a Disp-dependent manner, whereas an N-palmitoylated Shh variant lacking C-cholesterol does not. Disp-mediated Shh transfer to HDL is completed by proteolytic processing of the palmitoylated N-terminal membrane anchor. In contrast to dual-processed soluble Shh with moderate bioactivity, HDL-associated N-processed Shh is highly bioactive. We propose that the purpose of generating different soluble forms of Shh from the dual-lipidated precursor is to tune cellular responses in a tissue-type and time-specific manner.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92774">Mutant mice lacking alternatively spliced p53 isoforms unveil Ackr4 as a male-specific prognostic factor in Myc-driven B-cell lymphomas</a></h4>

              
                The <i>Trp53</i> gene encodes several isoforms of elusive biological significance. Here, we show that mice lacking the <i>Trp53</i> alternatively spliced (AS) exon, thereby expressing the canonical p53 protein but not isoforms with the AS C-terminus, have unexpectedly lost a male-specific protection against Myc-induced B-cell lymphomas. Lymphomagenesis was delayed in <i>Trp53<sup>+/+</sup>Eμ-Myc</i> males compared to <i>Trp53<sup>ΔAS/ΔAS</sup> Eμ-Myc</i> males, but also compared to <i>Trp53<sup>+/+</sup>Eμ-Myc</i> and <i>Trp53<sup>ΔAS/ΔAS</sup> Eμ-Myc</i> females. Pre-tumoral splenic cells from <i>Trp53<sup>+/+</sup>Eμ-Myc</i> males exhibited a higher expression of <i>Ackr4,</i> encoding an atypical chemokine receptor with tumor suppressive effects. We identified <i>Ackr4</i> as a p53 target gene whose p53-mediated transactivation is inhibited by estrogens, and as a male-specific factor of good prognosis relevant for murine <i>Eμ-Myc</i>-induced and human Burkitt lymphomas. Furthermore, the knockout of <i>ACKR4</i> increased the chemokine-guided migration of Burkitt lymphoma cells. These data demonstrate the functional relevance of alternatively spliced p53 isoforms and reveal sex disparities in Myc-driven lymphomagenesis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90692">Arpin deficiency increases actomyosin contractility and vascular permeability</a></h4>

              
                Arpin was discovered as an inhibitor of the Arp2/3 complex localized at the lamellipodial tip of fibroblasts, where it regulated migration steering. Recently, we showed that arpin stabilizes the epithelial barrier in an Arp2/3-dependent manner. However, the expression and functions of arpin in endothelial cells (EC) have not yet been described. Arpin mRNA and protein are expressed in EC and downregulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines. Arpin depletion in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells causes the formation of actomyosin stress fibers leading to increased permeability in an Arp2/3-independent manner. Instead, inhibitors of ROCK1 and ZIPK, kinases involved in the generation of stress fibers, normalize the loss-of-arpin effects on actin filaments and permeability. Arpin-deficient mice are viable but show a characteristic vascular phenotype in the lung including edema, microhemorrhage, and vascular congestion, increased F-actin levels, and vascular permeability. Our data show that, apart from being an Arp2/3 inhibitor, arpin is also a regulator of actomyosin contractility and endothelial barrier integrity.

	<p>Background: Medication overuse headache (MOH) is a prevalent and potentially preventable secondary headache disorder linked to the excessive use of medications intended for primary headache management, particularly migraine. Aim: The aim of our study was to assess the prevalence of MOH among undergraduate students and explore their awareness. Methodology: This observational cross-sectional study included 401 active undergraduate students from the University of Belgrade. Data were collected through an anonymous online questionnaire which was distributed among student groups and via social media. The questionnaire specially designed for this study was developed in accordance with established guidelines for headache epidemiological research. Results: Among the surveyed students, 10 of them (2.5%) met the criteria for the diagnosis of MOH. Awareness of MOH was noted in 149 (37.2%) students, with higher awareness among medical students and those aged 22&amp;amp;ndash;25 years. Despite this awareness, there was no significant difference in MOH occurrence between those aware and unaware of the condition (aware 2.7% vs. unaware 2.4%, p = 1.000). Additionally, significant gaps in education and communication about MOH were evident. Limitations: Participants were recruited through convenience sampling from a single university at one time point. The questionnaire was not specifically validated in the student population, and the data relied on self-reporting. Conclusions: Our study highlighted a notable prevalence of MOH among undergraduate students, with a substantial portion exhibiting awareness of its risks. Despite this awareness, our findings suggest ongoing gaps in education and communication regarding MOH, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions.</p>

	<p>Background: This scoping review had as a primary goal a review of the literature and the an analysis of the possible effectiveness of the LSVT LOUD approach in children with voice and speech deficits. Methods: A search was conducted in the Scopus and PubMed databases in May of 2024. Eleven articles were obtained from the search. The standards of PRISMA recommendations were used for scoping reviews and the PCC framework was used for the eligibility criteria. Furthermore, the study used the instructions in the Cochrane Handbook for a quality assessment. The Mendeley Reference Manager software collected the studies and removed duplicates. Results: The reviewed studies employed formal and informal measures to assess voice and speech abilities in the children. Regarding the sample&amp;amp;rsquo;s characteristics, the studies mostly included children with Cerebral Palsy (CP) and also those with Down Syndrome (DS). All the studies reported that children with CP and DS undertook a total dose of the LSVT LOUD treatment. Significant post-treatment findings indicated increased speech function and sound pressure level, regarding the auditory&amp;amp;ndash;perceptual ratings of voice and speech improvement. In many studies, parents&amp;amp;rsquo; and expert listeners&amp;amp;rsquo; ratings of voice, perception of vocal loudness, speech, and communication indicated improvement. Conclusions: The majority of the included studies provide positive evidence for the LSVT as an approach. However, the small sample size that featured in the studies, as well as their limitations, made these conclusions uncertain. Moreover, the study&amp;amp;rsquo;s findings provided recommendations that speech language therapists and other clinicians need to follow when setting a treatment plan with children with CP and DS.</p>

	<p>Exposure to physical and psychological stress modulates pain transmission in a dual manner. Stress-induced analgesia (SIA) refers to the reduction in pain sensitivity that can occur in response to acute stress. On the contrary, chronic stress exposure may lead to a phenomenon named stress-induced hyperalgesia (SIH). SIH is a clinically relevant phenomenon since it has been well documented that physical and psychological stress exacerbates pain in patients with several chronic pain syndromes, including migraine. The availability of animal models of SIA and SIH is of high importance for understanding the biological mechanisms leading to these phenomena and for the identification of pharmacological targets useful to alleviate the burden of stress-exacerbated chronic pain. Among these targets, the nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ)&amp;amp;ndash;N/OFQ peptide (NOP) receptor system has been identified as a key modulator of both pain transmission and stress susceptibility. This review describes first the experimental approaches to induce SIA and SIH in rodents. The second part of the manuscript summarizes the scientific evidence that suggests the N/OFQ&amp;amp;ndash;NOP receptor system as a player in the stress&amp;amp;ndash;pain interaction and candidates NOP antagonists as useful drugs to mitigate the detrimental effects of stress exposure on pain perception.</p>

	<p>Background: Multilayer networks have been used to identify abnormal dynamic reconfiguration in bipolar disorder (BD). However, these studies ignore the differences in information interactions between adjacent layers when constructing multilayer networks, and the analysis of dynamic reconfiguration is not comprehensive enough; Methods: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected from 46 BD patients and 54 normal controls. A multilayer temporal network was constructed for each subject, and inter-layer coupling of different nodes was considered using network similarity. The promiscuity, recruitment, and integration coefficients were calculated to quantify the different dynamic reconfigurations between the two groups; Results: The global inter-layer coupling, recruitment, and integration coefficients were significantly lower in BD patients. These results were further observed in the attention network and the limbic/paralimbic and subcortical network, reflecting reduced temporal stability, intra- and inter-subnetwork communication abilities in BD patients. The whole-brain promiscuity was increased in BD patients. The same results were observed in the somatosensory/motor and auditory network, reflecting more functional interactions; Conclusions: This study discovered abnormal dynamic interactions of BD from the perspective of dynamic reconfiguration, which can help to understand the pathological mechanisms of BD.</p>

	<p>Introduction: Posterior cerebral artery (PCA) aneurysms represent up to 1% of all cerebral aneurysms. P1-P2 perforator aneurysms are thought to be even less prevalent and often require complex treatment strategies due to their anatomical and morphological characteristics, with risk of a perforator infarct. We studied the treatment of P1-P2 perforator aneurysms in a single-center cohort from a high-volume tertiary center, reporting clinical and anatomical characteristics, treatment strategies, and outcomes. Methods: A retrospective analysis of adult patients with a P1-P2 perforator aneurysm who presented at our institution between January 2000 and January 2023 was performed. The patients were analyzed for demographics, clinical presentation, imaging findings, treatment techniques, outcomes, and complications. Subgroup analyses between ruptured versus non-ruptured cases were included. Results: Out of 2733 patients with a cerebral aneurysm, 14 patients (0.5%) presented with a P1-P2 perforator aneurysm. All six patients with a ruptured aneurysm were treated by endovascular coiling, of whom one patient (16.7%) required surgical clipping of a recurrence. One out of eight (12.5%) patients with unruptured aneurysms was treated by surgical clipping. P1-P2 perforator aneurysms predominantly affected middle-aged individuals (median 59.5 years), with 10/14 (71.4%) being female. Endovascular coiling was the primary treatment modality overall, yielding favorable technical outcomes, however, it was complicated by a perforator infarct in two patients (33.3%) without new permanent morbidity or mortality secondary to treatment. Conclusions: P1-P2 perforator aneurysms are a rare subtype of intracranial aneurysm.

Larger studies are required to provide more insights.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/38/e0036242024?rss=1">Disentangling Temporal and Rate Codes in the Primate Somatosensory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Millisecond-scale temporal spiking patterns encode sensory information in the periphery, but their role in the neocortex remains controversial. The sense of touch provides a window into temporal coding because tactile neurons often exhibit precise, repeatable, and informative temporal spiking patterns. In the somatosensory cortex (S1), responses to skin vibrations exhibit phase locking that faithfully carries information about vibratory frequency. However, the respective roles of spike timing and rate in frequency coding are confounded because vibratory frequency shapes both the timing and rates of responses. To disentangle the contributions of these two neural features, we measured S1 responses as rhesus macaques performed frequency discrimination tasks in which differences in frequency were accompanied by orthogonal variations in amplitude. We assessed the degree to which the strength and timing of responses could account for animal performance. First, we showed that animals can discriminate frequency, but their performance is biased by amplitude variations. Second, rate-based representations of frequency are susceptible to changes in amplitude but in ways that are inconsistent with the animals&rsquo; behavioral biases, calling into question a rate-based neural code for frequency. In contrast, timing-based representations are highly informative about frequency but impervious to changes in amplitude, which is also inconsistent with the animals&rsquo; behavior. We account for the animals&rsquo; behavior with a model wherein frequency coding relies on a temporal code, but frequency judgments are biased by perceived magnitude. We conclude that information about vibratory frequency is not encoded in S1 firing rates but primarily in temporal patterning on millisecond timescales.</p>

                <p>Navigation requires integrating sensory information with a stable schema to create a dynamic map of an animal&rsquo;s position using egocentric and allocentric coordinate systems. In the hippocampus, place cells encode allocentric space, but their firing rates may also exhibit directional tuning within egocentric or allocentric reference frames. We compared experimental and simulated data to assess the prevalence of tuning to egocentric bearing (EB) among hippocampal cells in rats foraging in an open field. Using established procedures, we confirmed egocentric modulation of place cell activity in recorded data; however, simulated data revealed a high false-positive rate (FPR). When we accounted for false positives by comparing with shuffled data that retain correlations between the animal&rsquo;s direction and position, only a very low number of hippocampal neurons appeared modulated by EB. Our study highlights biases affecting FPRs and provides insights into the challenges of identifying egocentric modulation in hippocampal neurons.</p>

                <p>Attention and decision-making processes are fundamental to cognition. However, they are usually experimentally confounded, making it difficult to link neural observations to specific processes. Here we separated the effects of selective attention from the effects of decision-making on brain activity obtained from human participants (both sexes), using a two-stage task where the attended stimulus and decision were orthogonal and separated in time. Multivariate pattern analyses of multimodal neuroimaging data revealed the dynamics of perceptual and decision-related information coding through time with magnetoencephalography (MEG), through space with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and their combination (MEG-fMRI fusion). Our MEG results showed an effect of attention before decision-making could begin, and fMRI results showed an attention effect in early visual and frontoparietal regions. Model-based MEG-fMRI fusion suggested that attention boosted stimulus information in the frontoparietal and early visual regions before decision-making was possible. Together, our results suggest that attention affects neural stimulus representations in the frontoparietal regions independent of decision-making.</p>

                <p>Making choices about whether and when to engage cognitive effort are a common feature of everyday experience, with important consequences for academic, career, and health outcomes. Yet, despite their hypothesized importance, very little is understood about the underlying mechanisms that support this form of human cost&ndash;benefit decision-making. To investigate these mechanisms, we used the Cognitive Effort Discounting Paradigm (Cog-ED) during fMRI scanning to precisely quantify the neural encoding of varying cognitive effort demands relative to reward outcomes, within two distinct cognitive domains (working memory, speech comprehension). The findings provide strong evidence that the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) plays a central and selective role in this decision-making process. Trial-by-trial modulations in dACC activation tracked the relative subjective value of the low-effort, low-reward option, with the strongest activity occurring when this was of greater value than the high-effort, high-reward option. In contrast, dACC activity was not modulated by decision difficulty, though such effects were found in other frontoparietal regions. Critically, dACC activity was also strongly correlated across the two decision-making task domains and further predicted subsequent choice behavior in both. Together, the results suggest that dACC activity modulation reflects a domain-general valuation comparison mechanism, which acts to bias participants away from decisions to engage in cognitive effort, when the perceived subjective costs of such engagement outweigh the reward-related benefits. These findings complement work in other cost domains and species by pointing to a clear role of the dACC in representing subjective value differences between choice options during cost&ndash;benefit decision-making.</p>

                <p>Neuroscience research has evolved to generate increasingly large and complex experimental data sets, and advanced data science tools are taking on central roles in neuroscience research. Neurodata Without Borders (NWB), a standard language for neurophysiology data, has recently emerged as a powerful solution for data management, analysis, and sharing. We here discuss our labs&rsquo; efforts to implement NWB data science pipelines. We describe general principles and specific use cases that illustrate successes, challenges, and non-trivial decisions in software engineering. We hope that our experience can provide guidance for the neuroscience community and help bridge the gap between experimental neuroscience and data science. Key takeaways from this article are that (1) standardization with NWB requires non-trivial design choices; (2) the general practice of standardization in the lab promotes data awareness and literacy, and improves transparency, rigor, and reproducibility in our science; (3) we offer several feature suggestions to ease the extensibility, publishing/sharing, and usability for NWB standard and users of NWB data.</p>

                <p>The frontal eye field (FEF) plays a well-established role in the control of visual attention. The strength of an FEF neuron's response to a visual stimulus presented in its receptive field is enhanced if the stimulus captures spatial attention by virtue of its salience. A stimulus can be rendered salient by cognitive factors as well as by physical attributes. These include surprise. The aim of the present experiment was to determine whether surprise-induced salience would result in enhanced visual-response strength in the FEF. Toward this end, we monitored neuronal activity in two male monkeys while presenting first a visual cue predicting with high probability that the reward delivered at the end of the trial would be good or bad (large or small) and then a visual cue announcing the size of the impending reward with certainty. The second cue usually confirmed but occasionally violated the expectation set up by the first cue. Neurons responded more strongly to the second cue when it violated than when it confirmed expectation. The increase in the firing rate was accompanied by a decrease in spike-count correlation as expected from capture of attention. Although both good surprise and bad surprise induced enhanced firing, the effects appeared to arise from distinct mechanisms as indicated by the fact that the bad-surprise signal appeared at a longer latency than the good-surprise signal and by the fact that the strength of the two signals varied independently across neurons.</p>

                <p>Circadian, infradian, and seasonal changes in steroid hormone secretion have been tied to changes in brain volume in several mammalian species. However, the relationship between circadian changes in steroid hormone production and rhythmic changes in brain morphology in humans is largely unknown. Here, we examined the relationship between diurnal fluctuations in steroid hormones and multiscale brain morphology in a precision imaging study of a male who completed 40 MRI and serological assessments at 7&nbsp;A.M. and 8&nbsp;P.M. over the course of a month, targeting hormone concentrations at their peak and nadir. Diurnal fluctuations in steroid hormones were tied to pronounced changes in global and regional brain morphology. From morning to evening, total brain volume, gray matter volume, and cortical thickness decreased, coincident with decreases in steroid hormone concentrations (testosterone, estradiol, and cortisol). In parallel, cerebrospinal fluid and ventricle size increased from A.M. to P.M. Global changes were driven by decreases within the occipital and parietal cortices. These findings highlight natural rhythms in brain morphology that keep time with the diurnal ebb and flow of steroid hormones.</p>

                <p>The presence of valence coding neurons in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) that form distinct projections to other brain regions implies functional opposition between aversion and reward during learning. However, evidence for opponent interactions in fear learning is sparse and may only be apparent under certain conditions. Here we test this possibility by studying the roles of the BLA-&gt;central amygdala (CeA) and BLA-&gt;nucleus accumbens (Acb) pathways in fear learning in male rats. First, we assessed the organization of these pathways in the rat brain. BLA-&gt;CeA and BLA-&gt;Acb pathways were largely segregated in the BLA but shared overlapping molecular profiles. Then we assessed activity of the BLA-&gt;CeA and BLA-&gt;Acb pathways during two different forms of fear learning&mdash;fear learning in a neutral context and fear learning in a reward context. BLA-&gt;CeA neurons were robustly recruited by footshock regardless of where fear learning occurred, whereas recruitment of BLA-&gt;Acb neurons was state-dependent because footshock only recruited this pathway in a reward context. Finally, we assessed the causal roles of activity in these pathways in fear learning. Photoinhibition of the BLA-&gt;CeA pathway during the footshock US impaired fear learning, regardless of where fear learning occurred. In contrast, photoinhibition of the BLA-&gt;Acb pathway augmented fear learning, but only in the reward context. Taken together, our findings show circuit- and state-dependent opponent processing of fear. Footshock activity in the BLA-&gt;Acb pathway limits how much fear is learned.</p>

                <p>Ribbon synapses of inner hair cells (IHCs) are uniquely designed for ultrafast and indefatigable neurotransmission of the sound. The molecular machinery ensuring the efficient, compensatory recycling of the synaptic vesicles (SVs), however, remains elusive. This study showed that hair cell knock-out of murine <I>Dmxl2</I>, whose human homolog is responsible for nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss DFNA71, resulted in auditory synaptopathy by impairing synaptic endocytosis and recycling. The mutant mice in the C57BL/6J background of either sex had mild hearing loss with severely diminished wave I amplitude of the auditory brainstem response. Membrane capacitance measurements of the IHCs revealed deficiency in sustained synaptic exocytosis and endocytic membrane retrieval. Consistent with the electrophysiological findings, 3D electron microscopy reconstruction showed reduced reserve pool of SVs and endocytic compartments, while the membrane-proximal and ribbon-associated vesicles remain intact. Our results propose an important role of DMXL2 in hair cell endocytosis and recycling of the SVs.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/38/e2011222024?rss=1">Experience Dependence of Alpha Rhythms and Neural Dynamics in the Mouse Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>The role of experience in the development and maintenance of emergent network properties such as cortical oscillations and states is poorly understood. To define how early-life experience affects cortical dynamics in the visual cortex of adult, head-fixed mice, we examined the effects of two forms of blindness initiated before eye opening and continuing through recording: (1) bilateral loss of retinal input (enucleation) and (2) degradation of visual input (eyelid suture). Neither form of deprivation fundamentally altered the state-dependent regulation of firing rates or local field potentials. However, each deprivation caused unique changes in network behavior. Laminar analysis revealed two different generative mechanisms for low-frequency synchronization: one prevalent during movement and the other during quiet wakefulness. The former was absent in enucleated mice, suggesting a mouse homolog of human alpha oscillations. In addition, neurons in enucleated animals were less correlated and fired more regularly, but no change in mean firing rate. Eyelid suture decreased firing rates during quiet wakefulness, but not during movement, with no effect on neural correlations or regularity. Sutured animals showed a broadband increase in depth EEG power and an increased occurrence, but reduced central frequency, of narrowband gamma oscillations. The complementary&mdash;rather than additive&mdash;effects of lid suture and enucleation suggest that the development of emergent network properties does not require vision but is plastic to modified input. Our results suggest a complex interaction of internal set points and experience determines mature cortical activity, with low-frequency synchronization being particularly susceptible to early deprivation.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/38/e2246232024?rss=1">Neural Activity Differentiates Novel and Learned Event Boundaries</a></h4>

              
                <p>People parse continuous experiences at natural breakpoints called event boundaries, which is important for understanding an environment's causal structure and for responding to uncertainty within it. However, it remains unclear how different forms of uncertainty affect the parsing of continuous experiences and how such uncertainty influences the brain's processing of ongoing events. We exposed human participants of both sexes (<I>N</I> = 34) to a continuous sequence of semantically meaningless images. We generated sequences from random walks through a graph that grouped images into temporal communities. After learning, we asked participants to segment another sequence at natural breakpoints (event boundaries). Participants segmented the sequence at learned transitions between communities, as well as at novel transitions, suggesting that people can segment temporally extended experiences into events based on learned structure as well as prediction error. Greater segmentation at novel boundaries was associated with enhanced parietal scalp electroencephalography (EEG) activity between 250 and 450&nbsp;ms after the stimulus onset. Multivariate classification of EEG activity showed that novel and learned boundaries evoked distinct patterns of neural activity, particularly theta band power in posterior electrodes. Learning also led to distinct neural representations for stimuli within the temporal communities, while neural activity at learned boundary nodes showed predictive evidence for the adjacent community. The data show that people segment experiences at both learned and novel boundaries and suggest that learned event boundaries trigger retrieval of information about the upcoming community that could underlie anticipation of the next event in a sequence.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/9/ENEURO.0058-24.2024?rss=1">Temporal and Potential Predictive Relationships between Sleep Spindle Density and Spike-and-Wave Discharges</a></h4>

              
                <p>Spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs) and sleep spindles are characteristic electroencephalographic (EEG) hallmarks of absence seizures and nonrapid eye movement sleep, respectively. They are commonly generated by the cortico&ndash;thalamo&ndash;cortical network including the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). It has been reported that SWD development is accompanied by a decrease in sleep spindle density in absence seizure patients and animal models. However, whether the decrease in sleep spindle density precedes, coincides with, or follows, the SWD development remains unknown. To clarify this, we exploited <I>Pvalb</I>-tetracycline transactivator (tTA)::tetO-ArchT (PV-ArchT) double-transgenic mouse, which can induce an absence seizure phenotype in a time-controllable manner by expressing ArchT in PV neurons of the TRN. In these mice, EEG recordings demonstrated that a decrease in sleep spindle density occurred 1&nbsp;week before the onset of typical SWDs, with the expression of ArchT. To confirm such temporal relationship observed in these genetic model mice, we used a gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) pharmacological model of SWDs. Prior to GBL administration, we administered caffeine to wild-type mice for 3 consecutive days to induce a decrease in sleep spindle density. We then administered low-dose GBL, which cannot induce SWDs in normally conditioned mice but led to the occurrence of SWDs in caffeine-conditioned mice. These findings indicate a temporal relationship in which the decrease in sleep spindle density consistently precedes SWD development. Furthermore, the decrease in sleep spindle activity may have a role in facilitating the development of SWDs. Our findings suggest that sleep spindle reductions could serve as early indicators of seizure susceptibility.</p>
