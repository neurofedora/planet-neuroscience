During neuronal differentiation, spatially and temporally regulated transcription allows neuronal migration, the growth of dendrites and axons, and at later stages, synaptic formation and the establishment of neuronal circuitry. Genome topology and relocation of gene loci within the nucleus are now regarded as key factors that contribute to transcriptional regulation. Here, we review recent work supporting the hypothesis that the dynamic organization of chromatin within the nucleus impacts gene activation in response to extrinsic signalling and during neuronal differentiation. The consequences of disruption of the genome architecture on neuronal health will be also discussed.</p></div>

However, the relationship between epigenetic regulation and neuropathology is largely correlational due to the presence of mixed cell populations within brain regions and the genome-wide effects of classical approaches to manipulate the epigenome. Locus-specific epigenetic editing allows direct epigenetic regulation of specific genes to elucidate the direct causal relationship between epigenetic modifications and transcription. This review discusses some of the latest innovations in the efficacy and flexibility in this approach that hold promise for neurobiological application.</p></div>

<p>Publication date: August 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 57</p><p>Author(s): Kristina Sakers, Cagla Eroglu</p><div><p>Neuroligins are a family of cell adhesion molecules, which are best known for their functions as postsynaptic components of the trans-synaptic neurexin–neuroligin complexes. Neuroligins are highly conserved across evolution with important roles in the formation, maturation and function of synaptic structures. Mutations in the genes that encode for neuroligins have been linked to a number of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, which stem from synaptic pathologies. Owing to their essential functions in regulating synaptic connectivity and their link to synaptic dysfunction in disease, previous studies on neuroligins have focused on neurons. Yet a recent work reveals that neuroligins are also expressed in the central nervous system by glial cells, such as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, and perform important roles in controlling synaptic connectivity in a non-cell autonomous manner. In this review, we will highlight these recent findings demonstrating the important roles of glial neuroligins in regulating the development and connectivity of healthy and diseased brains.</p></div>

<p>Publication date: December 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 59</p><p>Author(s): Stephanie N Kravitz, Christopher Gregg</p><div><p>Typically, it is assumed that the maternal and paternal alleles for most genes are equally expressed. Known exceptions include canonical imprinted genes, random X-chromosome inactivation, olfactory receptors and clustered protocadherins. Here, we highlight recent studies showing that allele-specific expression is frequent in the genome and involves subtypes of epigenetic allelic effects that differ in terms of heritability, clonality and stability over time. Different forms of epigenetic allele regulation could have different roles in brain development, function, and disease. An emerging area involves understanding allelic effects in a cell-type and developmental stage-specific manner and determining how these effects influence the impact of genetic variants and mutations on the brain. A deeper understanding of epigenetics at the allele and cellular level in the brain could help clarify the mechanisms underlying phenotypic variance.</p></div>

While much effort has been devoted to understanding the capacity and role for local protein synthesis in dendrites and spines, local mRNA translation in mature axons, projecting over distances up to a meter, has received much less attention. Also, little is known about the spatio-temporal dynamics of axonal and dendritic gene expression as function of mRNA abundance, protein synthesis and degradation.

This region is densely packed with thousands of proteins that are involved in extensive interactions. During synaptic plasticity, the PSD undergoes changes in size and composition along with changes in synaptic strength that lead to long term potentiation (LTP) or depression (LTD). It is therefore essential to understand the organization principles underlying PSD assembly and rearrangement. Here, we review exciting new findings from recent <em>in vitro</em> reconstitution studies and propose a hypothesis that liquid–liquid phase separation mediates PSD formation and regulation. We also discuss how the properties of PSD formed via phase separation might contribute to the biological functions observed from decades of researches. Finally, we highlight unanswered questions regarding PSD organization and how <em>in vitro</em> reconstitution systems may help to answer these questions in the coming years.</p></div>

Efforts to uncover functional roles for mRNA modifications have begun to reveal important roles for some marks within the nervous system, and animal models have emerged which demonstrate severe neurodevelopmental and neurocognitive abnormalities resulting from the loss of mRNA modification machinery. Here, we review the recent advances in the field of neuroepitranscriptomics, with a particular emphasis on how modifications to mRNAs within the brain contribute to synaptic activity.</p></div>

Here, we discuss a possible origin of dissimilarities in activity-regulated transcription between species. We highlight that while synapse-to-nucleus signalling pathways are evolutionarily conserved, <em>cis</em>-regulatory plasticity has been driving species-specific remodelling of the activity-controlled enhancer landscape, thereby affecting gene regulation. In particular, evolutionary rearrangements of transcription factor binding site placements together with potential species-dependent developmental stage- and/or cell type-specific epigenetic and other <em>trans</em>-acting mechanisms are most likely at least in part accountable for between-species diversity in activity-regulated transcription.

The BBB regulates molecular flux to maintain an optimal environment for neuronal function and protects the brain from toxins and pathogens. Endothelial cells forming the walls of CNS blood vessels constitute the BBB. CNS endothelial cells exhibit two features that underlie the restrictive properties of the BBB: specialized tight junctions that prevent paracellular passage between the blood and the brain, and unusually low levels of vesicle trafficking that limit transcellular transport or transcytosis. While the prevailing view in the field was that specialized tight junctions contributed to CNS barrier properties, recent findings have revealed the importance of maintaining low rates of transcytosis at the BBB. It is now clear that suppression of transcytosis at the BBB is an active process and CNS-specific genetic programs inhibit this pathway to maintain a functional barrier.</p></div>

However, the axon is one of the longest processes found in cellular biology and hosts a multitude of critical signaling functions in the brain. Not only does the axon initiate and rapidly propagate action potentials (APs) across the brain but it also forms the presynaptic terminals that convert these electrical inputs into chemical outputs.

Recent analyses of MDGA–neuroligin complexes revealed the structural basis of this activity and indicate that MDGAs interact with all neuroligins with differential affinities. Surprisingly, analyses of mouse mutants revealed a functional divergence, with targeted mutation of <em>Mdga1</em> and <em>Mdga2</em> elevating inhibitory and excitatory synapses, respectively, on hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Further research is needed to determine the synapse-specific organizing properties of MDGAs in neural circuits, which may depend on relative levels and subcellular distributions of each MDGA, neuroligin and neurexin.

In fact, mutations in genes encoding synaptic proteins are enriched and overlap among different conditions highlighting the complex and pleiotropic nature of these disorders. In this review, we discuss recently described candidate genes that affect excitatory synapse function and result in changes in spine number and morphology. Spine pathology has been observed in several animal models of disease and in human brain post-mortem samples from ID, ASD, and schizophrenia patients. Recent data point to convergent mechanisms, such as dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton and dysfunction of microglia synaptic remodeling, underlying dendritic spine dysgenesis. Interestingly, the reversion of important pathologic features, including spine abnormalities, has been observed in adult animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders, suggesting that therapies may not be restricted to a specific developmental window. Shedding light on the specific mechanisms impacted in neuropsychiatric disorders will undeniably contribute to the development of more directed and personalized therapies.</p></div>

Here, we summarize recent findings demonstrating that cell-surface proteins derived from both neurons and glia interact and cooperate to control the connectivity, architecture and function of specific synapses.</p></div>

<p>Background: The roles of neuromodulation in a neural network, such as in a
cortical microcolumn, are still incompletely understood. Neuromodulation
influences neural processing by presynaptic and postsynaptic regulation of
synaptic efficacy. Neuromodulation also affects ion channels and intrinsic
excitability. Methods: Synaptic efficacy modulation is an effective way to
rapidly alter network density and topology. We alter network topology and
density to measure the effect on spike synchronization. We also operate with
differently parameterized neuron models which alter the neurons intrinsic
excitability, i.e., activation function. Results: We find that (a) fast
synaptic efficacy modulation influences the amount of correlated spiking in a
network. Also, (b) synchronization in a network influences the read-out of
intrinsic properties. Highly synchronous input drives neurons, such that
differences in intrinsic properties disappear, while asynchronous input lets
intrinsic properties determine output behavior. Thus, altering network topology
can alter the balance between intrinsically vs. synaptically driven network
activity. Conclusion: We conclude that neuromodulation may allow a network to
shift between a more synchronized transmission mode and a more asynchronous
intrinsic read-out mode. This has significant implications for our
understanding of the flexibility of cortical computations.

<p>This survey presents the most relevant neural network models of autism
spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, from the first connectionist models to
recent deep network architectures. We analyzed and compared the most
representative symptoms with its neural model counterpart, detailing the
alteration introduced in the network that generates each of the symptoms, and
identifying their strengths and weaknesses. For completeness we additionally
cross-compared Bayesian and free-energy approaches. Models of schizophrenia
mainly focused on hallucinations and delusional thoughts using neural
disconnections or inhibitory imbalance as the predominating alteration. Models
of autism rather focused on perceptual difficulties, mainly excessive attention
to environment details, implemented as excessive inhibitory connections or
increased sensory precision. We found an excessive tight view of the
psychopathologies around one specific and simplified effect, usually
constrained to the technical idiosyncrasy of the network used. Recent theories
and evidence on sensorimotor integration and body perception combined with
modern neural network architectures offer a broader and novel spectrum to
approach these psychopathologies, outlining the future research on neural
networks computational psychiatry, a powerful asset for understanding the inner
processes of the human brain.

<p>Data sharing is a key factor for ensuring reproducibility and transparency of
scientific experiments, and neuroimaging is no exception. The vast
heterogeneity of data formats and imaging modalities utilised in the field
makes it a very challenging problem. In this context, the Brain Imaging Data
Structure (BIDS) appears as a solution for organising and describing
neuroimaging datasets. Since its publication in 2015, BIDS has gained
widespread attention in the field, as it provides a common way to arrange and
share multimodal brain images. Although the evident benefits it presents, BIDS
has not been widely adopted in the field of MRI yet and we believe that this is
due to the lack of a go-to tool to create and managed BIDS datasets. Motivated
by this, we present the BIDS Toolbox, a web service to manage brain imaging
datasets in BIDS format. Different from other tools, the BIDS Toolbox allows
the creation and modification of BIDS-compliant datasets based on MRI data. It
provides both a web interface and REST endpoints for its use. In this paper we
describe its design and early prototype, and provide a link to the public
source code repository.

<p>Brain functional network has become an increasingly used approach in
understanding brain functions and diseases. Many network construction methods
have been developed, whereas the majority of the studies still used static
pairwise Pearson's correlation-based functional connectivity. The goal of this
work is to introduce a toolbox namely "Brain Network Construction and
Classification" (BrainNetClass) to the field to promote more advanced brain
network construction methods. It comprises various brain network construction
methods, including some state-of-the-art methods that were recently developed
to capture more complex interactions among brain regions along with connectome
feature extraction, reduction, parameter optimization towards network-based
individualized classification. BrainNetClass is a MATLAB-based, open-source,
cross-platform toolbox with graphical user-friendly interfaces for cognitive
and clinical neuroscientists to perform rigorous computer-aided diagnosis with
interpretable result presentations even though they do not possess neuroimage
computing and machine learning knowledge. We demonstrate the implementations of
this toolbox on real resting-state functional MRI datasets. BrainNetClass

<p>Neuromorphic engineers aim to develop event-based spiking neural networks
(SNNs) in hardware. These SNNs closer resemble dynamics of biological neurons
than todays' artificial neural networks and achieve higher efficiency thanks to
the event-based, asynchronous nature of processing. Learning in SNNs is more
challenging, however. Since conventional supervised learning methods cannot be
ported on SNNs due to the non-differentiable event-based nature of their
activation, learning in SNNs is currently an active research topic.
Reinforcement learning (RL) is particularly promising method for neuromorphic
implementation, especially in the field of autonomous agents' control, and is
in focus of this work. In particular, in this paper we propose a new digital
multiplier-less hardware implementation of an SNN. We show how this network can
learn stimulus-response associations in a context-dependent task through a RL
mechanism. The task is inspired by biological experiments used to study RL in
animals. The architecture is described using the standard digital design flow
and uses power- and space-efficient cores. We implement the behavioral
experiments using a robot, to show that learning in hardware also works in a
closed sensorimotor loop.

<p>With the increasing acquisition of large-scale neural recordings comes the
challenge of inferring the computations they perform and understanding how
these give rise to behavior. Here, we review emerging conceptual and
technological advances that begin to address this challenge, garnering insights
from both biological and artificial neural networks. We argue that neural data
should be recorded during rich behavioral tasks, to model cognitive processes
and estimate latent behavioral variables. Careful quantification of animal
movements can also provide a more complete picture of how movements shape
neural dynamics and reflect changes in brain state, such as arousal or stress.
Artificial neural networks (ANNs) could serve as an important tool to connect
neural dynamics and rich behavioral data. ANNs have already begun to reveal how
particular behaviors can be optimally solved, generating hypotheses about how
observed neural activity might drive behavior and explaining diversity in
behavioral strategies.

<p>Motivational salience is a mechanism that determines an organism's current
level of attraction to or repulsion from a particular object, event, or
outcome. Motivational salience is described by modulating the reward by an
externally controlled parameter that remains constant within a single
behavioral episode. The vector of perceived values of various outcomes
determines motivation of an organism toward different goals. Organism's
behavior should be able to adapt to the varying-in-time motivation vector.
Here, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that relies on neural
networks to learn optimal behavior for different dynamically changing
motivation vectors. First, we show that Q-learning neural networks can learn to
navigate towards variable goals whose relative salience is determined by a
multidimensional motivational vector. Second, we show that a Q-learning network
with motivation can learn complex behaviors towards several goals distributed
in an environment. Finally, we show that firing patterns displayed by neurons
in the ventral pallidum, a basal ganglia structure playing a crucial role in
motivated behaviors, are similar to the responses of neurons in recurrent
neural networks trained in similar conditions. Similarly to the pallidum
neurons, artificial neural nets contain two different classes of neurons, tuned
to reward and punishment. We conclude that reinforcement learning networks can
efficiently learn optimal behavior in conditions when reward values are
modulated by external motivational processes with arbitrary dynamics.
Motivational salience can be viewed as a general-purpose model-free method
identifying and capturing changes in subjective or objective values of multiple
rewards. Networks with motivation may also be parts of a larger hierarchical
reinforcement learning system in the brain.

<p>Animals need to devise strategies to maximize returns while interacting with
their environment based on incoming noisy sensory observations. Task-relevant
states, such as the agent's location within an environment or the presence of a
predator, are often not directly observable but must be inferred using
available sensory information. Successor representations (SR) have been
proposed as a middle-ground between model-based and model-free reinforcement
learning strategies, allowing for fast value computation and rapid adaptation
to changes in the reward function or goal locations. Indeed, recent studies
suggest that features of neural responses are consistent with the SR framework.
However, it is not clear how such representations might be learned and computed
in partially observed, noisy environments. Here, we introduce a neurally
plausible model using distributional successor features, which builds on the
distributed distributional code for the representation and computation of
uncertainty, and which allows for efficient value function computation in
partially observed environments via the successor representation. We show that
distributional successor features can support reinforcement learning in noisy
environments in which direct learning of successful policies is infeasible.

<p>Dynamical brain state transitions are critical for flexible working memory

working memory entails brainwide switching between activity states. The
stability of states relates to dopamine D1 receptor gene expression while state
transitions are influenced by D2 receptor expression and pharmacological

including a more diverse energy landscape and decreased stability of working

<p>Representational similarity analysis (RSA) has been shown to be an effective
framework to characterize brain-activity profiles and deep neural network
activations as representational geometry by computing the pairwise distances of
the response patterns as a representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM).
However, how to properly analyze and visualize the representational geometry as
dynamics over the time course from stimulus onset to offset is not well
understood. In this work, we formulated the pipeline to understand
representational dynamics with RDM movies and Procrustes-aligned
Multidimensional Scaling (pMDS), and applied it to neural recording of monkey
IT cortex. Our results suggest that the the multidimensional scaling alignment
can genuinely capture the dynamics of the category-specific representation
spaces with multiple visualization possibilities, and that object
categorization may be hierarchical, multi-staged, and oscillatory (or
recurrent).

We previously reported that embryonic motor cortical neurons transplanted one-week after lesions in the adult mouse motor cortex significantly enhances graft vascularization, survival, and proliferation of grafted cells, the density of projections developed by grafted neurons and improves functional repair and recovery. The purpose of the present study is to understand the extent to which post-traumatic inflammation following cortical lesion could influence the survival of grafted neurons and the development of their projections to target brain regions and conversely how transplanted cells can modulate host inflammation. For this, embryonic motor cortical tissue was grafted either immediately or with a one-week delay into the lesioned motor cortex of adult mice. Immunohistochemistry analysis was performed to determine the density and cell morphology of resident and peripheral infiltrating immune cells. Then, in-situ hybridization was performed to analyze the distribution and temporal mRNA expression pattern of pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines following cortical lesion. In parallel, we analyzed the protein expression of both M1- and M2-associated markers to study the M1/M2 balance switch. We have shown that one-week after the lesion, the number of astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and CD45+ cells was significantly increased along with characteristics of M2 microglia phenotype. Interestingly, the majority of microglia co-expressed TGF-β1, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, supporting the hypothesis that microglial activation is also neuroprotective. Our results suggest that the modulation of post-traumatic inflammation one-week after cortical lesion might be implicated in the improvement of graft vascularization, survival, and density of projections developed by grafted neurons.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00152">Posttranscriptional Gene Regulation of the GABA Receptor to Control Neuronal Inhibition</a></h4>

Behavior and higher cognition rely on the transfer of information between neurons through specialized contact sites termed synapses. Plasticity of neuronal circuits, a prerequisite to respond to environmental changes, is inseparably coupled with the nerve cell’s ability to form, structurally modulate or remove synapses. Consequently, the synaptic proteome undergoes dynamic alteration on demand in a spatiotemporally restricted manner. Therefore, proper protein localization at synapses is essential for synaptic function. This process is regulated by (i) protein transport and recruitment, (ii) local protein synthesis and (iii) synaptic protein degradation. These processes shape the transmission efficiency of excitatory synapses. Whether and how these processes influence synaptic inhibition is, however, widely unknown. Here, we summarize findings on fundamental regulatory processes that can be extrapolated to inhibitory synapses. We therefore focus on known aspects of posttranscriptional regulation and protein dynamics of the GABA receptor. We propose that local (co)-translational control mechanism might control transmission of inhibitory synapses.

Micro Electrode Arrays were used to simultaneously record spontaneous extracellular action potentials from 10-30 dopamine neurons in acute brain slices from the lateral Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) of the rat. The spike train of an individual neuron was used to characterize the firing pattern: firing rate, firing irregularity and oscillation frequency. Functional connectivity between a pair of neurons was quantified by the Paired Phase Consistency (PPC), taking the oscillation frequency as reference. Under baseline conditions the PPC was significantly different from zero and 42 of the 386 pairs of VTA neurons showed significant coupling. 50%of the recorded dopamine neurons were part of the coupled VTA network. Raising extracellular potassium from 3.5 mM to 5 mM increased the mean firing rate of the dopamine neurons by 45%. The same increase could be induced by bath application of 300 uM glutamate. High potassium reduced the PPC, but it did not change during the glutamate application. Our findings imply that manipulating excitability has distinct and specific consequences for functional connectivity in the VTA network that cannot be directly predicted from the changes in neuronal firing rates. Functional connectivity reflects the spatial organization and synchronization of the VTA output and thus represents a unique element of the message that is sent to the mesolimbic projection area. It adds a dimension to pharmacological manipulation of the VTA micro circuit that might help to understand the pharmacological (side) effects of e.g. anti-psychotic drugs.

Previous studies have reported that long non-coding RNA SNHG12 (lncRNA SNHG12) plays critical role in regulating biofunction of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), but the effect of lncRNA SNHG12 in MSCs in brain injury is still rarely reported. Hence, the protective effect and mechanism of a lncRNA SNHG12 modified mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) was explored in treating brain injury under an ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) condition in this study. I/R rat brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) were cocultured with MSCs or I/R pretreated MSCs. Then, proliferation of BMECs was detected using CCK-8 and EdU assays and apoptosis of cells was determined using flow cytometry and Hoechst. Autophagy of BMECs was determined using immunofluorescence and associated pathway was measured using western blotting. Moreover, proliferation, apoptosis, and autophagy of BMECs was also determined after co-culturing with shSNHG12-MSCs. In addition, a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model rat model treated with MSCs injection was also used to confirm the findings in cells. I/R treatment significantly decreased the proliferation, but increase SNHG12 expression as well as the apoptosis and autophagy of BMECs. However, co-culturing with MSCs markedly alleviated the reduction of proliferation and increase of apoptosis and autophagy, as well as the phosphorylation of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR, in BMECs induced by I/R and shSNHG12 remarkably enhanced the effect of MSCs. In addition, MSCs injection also alleviated the infarct area and apoptosis of MACO rats, as well as the phosphorylation of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR. Moreover, shSNHG12 enhanced the ameliorative effect of MSCs in treating brain injury in MACO model.In conclusions, silencing SNHG12 enhanced the effect of MSCs in ameliorating apoptosis and autophagy of BMECs induced by PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.

Multi-electrode arrays, both active or passive, emerged as ideal technologies to unveil intricated electrophysiological dynamics of cells and tissues. Active MEAs, designed using complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology (CMOS), stand over passive devices thanks to the possibility of achieving single-cell resolution, the reduced electrode size, the reduced crosstalk and the higher functionality and portability. Nevertheless, most of the reported CMOS MEA systems mainly rely on a single operational modality, which strongly hampers the applicability range of a single device. This can be a limiting factor considering that most biological and electrophysiological dynamics are often based on the synergy of multiple and complex mechanisms acting from different angles on the same phenomena. Here, we designed a CMOS MEA chip with 16,384 titanium nitride electrodes, 6 independent operational modalities and 1,024 parallel recording channels for neuro-electrophysiological studies. Sixteen independent active areas are patterned on the chip surface forming a 4x4 matrix, each one including 1,024 electrodes. Electrodes of four different sizes are present on the chip surface, ranging from 2.5x3.5 µm^2 up to 10.5x11.0 µm^2, with 15 µm pitch. In this paper, we exploited the impedance monitoring and voltage recording modalities not only to monitor the growth and development of primary rat hippocampal neurons, but also to assess their electrophysiological activity over time showing a mean spike amplitude of 144.8 ± 84.6 µV. Fixed frequency (1 kHz) and high sampling rate (30 kHz) impedance measurements were used to evaluate the cellular adhesion and growth on the chip surface. Thanks to the high-density configuration of the electrodes, as well as their dimension and pitch, the chip can appreciate the evolutions of the cell culture morphology starting from the moment of the seeding up to mature culture conditions. The measurements were confirmed by fluorescent staining. The effect of the different electrode sizes on the spike amplitudes and noise were also discussed. The multi-modality of the presented CMOS MEA allows for the simultaneous assessment of different physiological properties of the cultured neurons. Therefore, it can pave the way both to answer complex fundamental neuroscience questions as well as to aid the current drug -development paradigm.

ABSTRACT
Although amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has been considered as a disorder of the motor neuron cell body, recent evidences show the non-cell-autonomous pathogenic nature of the disease. Axonal degeneration, loss of peripheral axons and destruction of nerve terminals are early events in the disease pathogenic cascade, anticipating motor neuron degeneration and the onset of clinical symptoms. Therefore, although Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and peripheral axonal neuropathies should be differentiated in clinical practice, they also share damage to common molecular pathways, including axonal transport, RNA metabolism and proteostasis. Thus, an extensive evaluation of the molecular events occurring in the peripheral nervous system could be fundamental to understand the pathogenic mechanisms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, favouring the discovery of potential disease biomarkers and new therapeutic targets.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00046">Systematic Differences Between Perceptually Relevant Image Statistics of Brain MRI and Natural Images</a></h4>

It is well-known that the human visual system is adapted to the statistical structure of natural scenes. Yet there are important classes of images – for example, medical images -- that are not natural scenes, and therefore, that are expected to have statistical properties that deviate from the class of images that shaped the evolution and development of human vision. Here, focusing on structural brain MRI images, we quantify and characterize these deviations in terms of a set of local image statistics to which human visual sensitivity has been well-characterized, and that has previously been used for natural image analysis. We analyzed MRI images in multiple databases including T1-weighted and FLAIR sequence types, and simulated MRI images based on a published image simulation procedure for T1 images, which we also modified to generate FLAIR images. We first computed the power spectra of MRI images; spectral slopes were in the range -2.6 to -3.1 for T1 sequences, and -2.2 to -2.7 for FLAIR sequences. Analysis of local image statistics was then carried out on whitened images. For all of the databases as well as for the simulated images, we found that the three-point correlations contributed substantially to the differences between the “texture” of randomly-selected ROIs. The informative nature of three-point correlations for brain MRI was greater than for natural images, and also disproportionate to human visual sensitivity. As this finding was consistent across databases, it is likely to result from brain geometry at the scale of brain MRI resolution, rather than characteristics of specific imaging and reconstruction methods.

Radiologists rely principally on visual inspection to detect, describe, and classify findings in medical images. As most interpretive errors in radiology are perceptual in nature, understanding the path to radiologic expertise during image analysis is essential to educate future generations of radiologists. We review the perceptual tasks and challenges in radiologic diagnosis, discuss models of radiologic image perception, consider the application of perceptual learning methods in medical training, and suggest a new approach to understanding perceptional expertise. Specific principled enhancements to educational practices in radiology promise to deepen perceptual expertise among radiologists with the goal of improving training and reducing medical error.

In our previous study, we reported that peptidyl-prolyl isomerase 1 (Pin1)-modulated regulated necrosis (RN) occurred in cultured retinal neurons after glutamate injury. In the current study, we investigated the role of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in Pin1-modulated RN in cultured rat retinal neurons, and in an animal in vivo model. We first demonstrated that glutamate might lead to calcium overloading mainly through ionotropic glutamate receptors activation. Furthermore, CaMKII activation induced by overloaded calcium leads to Pin1 activation and subsequent RN. Inactivation of CaMKII by KN-93 (KN, i.e., a specific CaMKII inhibitor) application can decrease the glutamate-induced retinal neuronal RN. Finally, by using an animal in vivo model, we also demonstrated the important role of CaMKII in glutamate-induced RN in rat retina. In addition, flash electroretinogram results provided evidence that the impaired visual function induced by glutamate can recover after CaMKII inhibition. In conclusion, CaMKII is an up-regulator of Pin1 and responsible for the RN induced by glutamate. This study provides further understanding of the regulatory pathway of RN and is a complementary mechanism for Pin1 activation mediated necrosis. This finding will provide a potential target to protect neurons from necrosis in neurodegenerative diseases, such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and even central nervous system diseases.

Hypothermia attenuates cerebral ischemia-induced neuronal cell death associated with neuroinflammation. The calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) has been shown to be neuroprotective by minimizing activation of inflammatory pathways. Therefore, we investigated whether the combination of hypothermia and treatment with CsA has neuroprotective effects in an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) injury model in neuronal and BV 2 microglia monocultures, as well as in an organotypic hippocampal slice culture (OHSC).

Murine primary neurons, BV 2 microglia, and OHSC were pretreated with CsA and exposed to 1 h OGD (0.2 % O2) followed by reperfusion at normothermia (37 °C) or hypothermia (33.5 °C). Cytotoxicity was measured by lactate dehydrogenase and glutamate releases. Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), and cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRBP) were detected in cultured supernatant by western blot analysis. Interleukin-6 (IL 6), Interleukin-1α and -1β (IL 1α/ IL1 β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF α), monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), glia activation factors ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1), and transforming growth factor β1 (TGF β1) gene expressions were analyzed by RT-qPCR.

Exposure to OGD plus 10 µM CsA was sufficient to induce necrotic cell death and subsequent release of DAMPs in neurons but not BV 2 microglia. Moreover, OGD/R-induced secondary injury was also observed only in the neurons, which was not attenuated by cooling and no increased toxicity by CsA was observed. BV-2 microglia were not sensitive to OGD/R-induced injury but were susceptible to CsA-induced toxicity in a dose dependent manner, which was minimized by hypothermia. CsA attenuated IL 1β and Iba1 expressions in BV 2 microglia exposed to OGD/R. Hypothermia reduced IL 1β and iNOS expressions but induced TNF α and Iba1 expressions in the microglia. However, these observations did not translate to the ex vivo OHCS model, as general high expressions of most cytokines investigated were observed.

Treatment with CsA has neurotoxic effects on primary neurons exposed to OGD but could inhibit BV 2 microglia activation. However, CsA and hypothermia treatment after ischemia/reperfusion injury results in cytotoxic neuroinflammation in the complex ex vivo OHSC

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00268">Middle Ear Administration of a Particulate Chitosan Gel in an in vivo Model of Cisplatin Ototoxicity</a></h4>

Background
Middle ear (intratympanic; IT) administration is a promising therapeutic method as it offers the possibility of achieving high inner ear drug concentrations while maintaining low levels in the systemic compartment, thus minimizing the risk of systemic side-effects and drug-drug interactions. The issue of premature elimination through the Eustachian tube may be reduced by stabilizing drug solutions with a hydrogel. However, this raises the secondary issue of conductive hearing loss.
Aim
This study aimed to investigate the properties of a chitosan-based particulate hydrogel formulation when used as a drug carrier for IT administration in an in vivo model of ototoxicity.
Material and methods
Two particulate chitosan-based IT delivery systems, Thio-25 and Thio-40, were investigated in albino guinea pigs (n=94). Both contained the hearing protecting drug candidate sodium thiosulfate but differed in terms of the concentration of chitosan gel particles (25% versus 40%). The safety of the two systems was explored in vivo. The most promising system was thereafter investigated in guinea pigs subjected to a single intravenous injection of the anticancer drug cisplatin (8 mg/kg b.w.), which has ototoxic side-effects. Hearing status was evaluated with acoustically-evoked frequency-specific auditory brainstem response (ABR) and hair cell counting. Finally, in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to study the distribution and elimination of the chitosan-based system from the middle ear cavity; this was analyzed and compared to a hyaluronan-based system.
Results
Both chitosan-based IT delivery systems caused ABR threshold elevations (p&lt;0.05) that remained after 10 days (p&lt;0.05) without evidence of hair cell loss, although the elevations induced by Thio-25 were significantly lower than Thio-40 (p&lt;0.05). Thio-25 significantly reduced cisplatin-induced ABR threshold elevations (p&lt;0.05) and the loss of outer hair cells (p&lt;0.05). IT injection of the chitosan- and hyaluronan-based systems filled up most of the middle ear space. There were no significant differences in terms of the distribution and elimination of the two systems. 
Conclusion
Particulate chitosan is a promising drug carrier for IT administration. Future studies should attempt to demonstrate whether the physical properties of this technique allow for a reduced injection volume and thereby a less pronounced loss of conductive hearing.

Background: Abnormalities of cognitive and movement functions are widely reported in Parkinson’s disease (PD). The mechanisms therein are complicated and assumed to a coordination of various brain regions. This study explored the alterations of global synchronizations of brain activities and investigated the neural correlations of cognitive and movement function in PD patients. 

Methods: Age-match of 35 patients with PD and 35 normal controls (NC) were enrolled in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. Degree centrality (DC) were calculated to measure the global synchronizations of brain activity for two groups. Neural correlations between DC and cognitive function (Frontal Assessment Battery, FAB) as well as movement function (Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale, UPDRS-III) were examined across the whole brain within Anatomical Automatic Labeling (AAL) templates. 

Results: In PD group, increased DC was observed in left fusiform gyrus extending to inferior temporal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus and angular gyrus, while it was decreased in right inferior opercular-frontal gyrus extending to superior temporal gyrus. The DC in significant region of fusiform gyrus was positively correlated with UPDRS-III scores in PD (r = 0.41, p = 0.0145). Higher FAB scores were shown in NC than PD (p &lt; 0.0001). Correlative analysis of PD between DC and FAB showed negative results (p &lt; 0.05) in frontal cortex, whereas positive in insula and cerebellum. As for the correlations between DC and UPDRS-III, negative correlation (p &lt; 0.05) was observed in bilateral inferior parietal lobule and right cerebellum, whereas positive correlation (p &lt; 0.05) in bilateral hippocampus and para-hippocampus gyrus (p &lt; 0.01). 

Conclusion: The altered global synchronizations revealed altered cognitive and movement functions in PD. The findings suggested that the global functional connectivity in fusiform gyrus, cerebellum and hippocampus gyrus are critical regions in the identification of cognitive and movement functions in PD. This study provides new insights on the interactions among global coordination of brain activity, cognitive and movement functions in PD.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44455">Elastic instability during branchial ectoderm development causes folding of the <i>Chlamydosaurus</i> erectile frill</a></h4>

We study the morphogenesis and evolutionary origin of the spectacular erectile ruff of the frilled dragon (<i>Chlamydosaurus kingii</i>). Our comparative developmental analyses of multiple species suggest that the ancestor of Episquamata reptiles developed a neck fold from the hyoid branchial arch by preventing it to fully fuse with posterior arches. We also show that the <i>Chlamydosaurus</i> embryonic neck fold dramatically enlarges and its anterior surface wrinkles, establishing three convex ridges on each lobe of the frill. We suggest that this robust folding pattern is not due to localised increased growth at the positions of the ridges, but emerges from an elastic instability during homogeneous growth of the frill skin frustrated by its attachment to adjacent tissues. Our physical analog experiments and 3D computational simulations, using realistic embryonic tissue growth, thickness and stiffness values, recapitulate the transition from two to three ridges observed during embryonic development of the dragon’s frill.

<p>by Kalinga Pavan T. Silva, James Q. Boedicker</p>

Signal crosstalk within biological communication networks is common, and such crosstalk can have unexpected consequences for decision making in heterogeneous communities of cells. Here we examined crosstalk within a bacterial community composed of five strains of <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, with each strain producing a variant of the quorum sensing peptide ComX. In isolation, each strain produced one variant of the ComX signal to induce expression of genes associated with bacterial competence. When strains were combined, a mixture of ComX variants was produced resulting in variable levels of gene expression. To examine gene regulation in mixed communities, we implemented a neural network model. Experimental quantification of asymmetric crosstalk between pairs of strains parametrized the model, enabling the accurate prediction of activity within the full five-strain network. Unlike the single strain system in which quorum sensing activated upon exceeding a threshold concentration of the signal, crosstalk within the five-strain community resulted in multiple community-level quorum sensing states, each with a unique combination of quorum sensing activation among the five strains. Quorum sensing activity of the strains within the community was influenced by the combination and ratio of strains as well as community dynamics. The community-level signaling state was altered through an external signal perturbation, and the output state depended on the timing of the perturbation. Given the ubiquity of signal crosstalk in diverse microbial communities, the application of such neural network models will increase accuracy of predicting activity within microbial consortia and enable new strategies for control and design of bacterial signaling networks.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0Yr3KJuonAw" width="1" />

Open, collaborative research is a powerful paradigm that can immensely strengthen the scientific process by integrating broad and diverse expertise. However, traditional research and multi-author writing processes break down at scale. We present new software named Manubot, available at https://manubot.org, to address the challenges of open scholarly writing. Manubot adopts the contribution workflow used by many large-scale open source software projects to enable collaborative authoring of scholarly manuscripts. With Manubot, manuscripts are written in Markdown and stored in a Git repository to precisely track changes over time. By hosting manuscript repositories publicly, such as on GitHub, multiple authors can simultaneously propose and review changes. A cloud service automatically evaluates proposed changes to catch errors. Publication with Manubot is continuous: When a manuscript’s source changes, the rendered outputs are rebuilt and republished to a web page. Manubot automates bibliographic tasks by implementing citation by identifier, where users cite persistent identifiers (e.g. DOIs, PubMed IDs, ISBNs, URLs), whose metadata is then retrieved and converted to a user-specified style. Manubot modernizes publishing to align with the ideals of open science by making it transparent, reproducible, immediate, versioned, collaborative, and free of charge.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Dn3MXW5I6qo" width="1" />

Humans and other animals are able to discover underlying statistical structure in their environments and exploit it to achieve efficient and effective performance. However, such structure is often difficult to learn and use because it is obscure, involving long-range temporal dependencies. Here, we analysed behavioural data from an extended experiment with rats, showing that the subjects learned the underlying statistical structure, albeit suffering at times from immediate inferential imperfections as to their current state within it. We accounted for their behaviour using a Hidden Markov Model, in which recent observations are integrated with evidence from the past. We found that over the course of training, subjects came to track their progress through the task more accurately, a change that our model largely attributed to improved integration of past evidence. This learning reflected the structure of the task, decreasing reliance on recent observations, which were potentially misleading.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mXjaocoQ3Z8" width="1" />

<p>by Anthony Hauser, Katharina Kusejko, Leigh F. Johnson, Gilles Wandeler, Julien Riou, Fardo Goldstein, Matthias Egger, Roger D. Kouyos</p>

The scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in South Africa substantially reduced AIDS-related deaths and new HIV infections. However, its success is threatened by the emergence of resistance to non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI). The MARISA (Modelling Antiretroviral drug Resistance In South Africa) model presented here aims at investigating the time trends and factors driving NNRTI resistance in South Africa. MARISA is a compartmental model that includes the key aspects of the local HIV epidemic: continuum of care, disease progression, and gender. The dynamics of NNRTI resistance emergence and transmission are then added to this framework. Model parameters are informed using data from HIV cohorts participating in the International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) and literature estimates, or fitted to UNAIDS estimates. Using this novel approach of triangulating clinical and resistance data from various sources, MARISA reproduces the time trends of HIV in South Africa in 2005–2016, with a decrease in new infections, undiagnosed individuals, and AIDS-related deaths. MARISA captures the dynamics of the spread of NNRTI resistance: high levels of acquired drug resistance (ADR, in 83% of first-line treatment failures in 2016), and increasing transmitted drug resistance (TDR, in 8.1% of ART initiators in 2016). Simulation of counter-factual scenarios reflecting alternative public health policies shows that increasing treatment coverage would have resulted in fewer new infections and deaths, at the cost of higher TDR (11.6% in 2016 for doubling the treatment rate). Conversely, improving switching to second-line treatment would have led to lower TDR (6.5% in 2016 for doubling the switching rate) and fewer new infections and deaths. Implementing drug resistance testing would have had little impact. The rapid ART scale-up and inadequate switching to second-line treatment were the key drivers of the spread of NNRTI resistance in South Africa. However, even though some interventions could have substantially reduced the level of NNRTI resistance, no policy including NNRTI-based first line regimens could have prevented this spread. Thus, by combining epidemiological data on HIV in South Africa with biological data on resistance evolution, our modelling approach identified key factors driving NNRTI resistance, highlighting the need of alternative first-line regimens.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CQId03-Iagw" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Visual search, looking for a target embedded among distractors, has long been used to study attention. Current theories postulate a two-stage process in which early visual areas perform feature extraction, whereas higher-order regions perform attentional selection. Such a model implies iterative communication between low- and high-level regions to sequentially select candidate targets in the array, focus attention on these elements, and eventually permit target recognition. This leads to two independent predictions: (1) high-level, attentional regions and (2) early visual regions should both be involved periodically during the search. Here, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied over the frontal eye field (FEF) in humans, known to be involved in attentional selection, at various delays while observers performed a difficult, attentional search task. We observed a periodic pattern of interference at ~6 Hz (theta) suggesting that the FEF is periodically involved during this difficult search task. We further compared this result with two previous studies (Dugué et al., 2011, 2015a) in which a similar TMS procedure was applied over the early visual cortex (V1) while observers performed the same task. This analysis revealed the same pattern of interference, i.e., V1 is periodically involved during this difficult search task, at the theta frequency. Past V1 evidence reappraised for this paper, together with our current FEF results, confirm both of our independent predictions, and suggest that difficult search is supported by low- and high-level regions, each involved periodically at the theta frequency.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0160-19.2019v1?rss=1">Rodent Activity Detector (RAD) - an open source device for measuring activity in rodent home cages</a></h4>

Abstract<p>Physical activity is a critical behavioral variable in many research studies, and is therefore important to quantify. However, existing methods for measuring physical activity have limitations which include high expense, specialized caging or equipment, and high computational overhead. To address these limitations, we present an open-source, cost-effective, device for measuring rodent activity. Our device is battery powered and designed to be placed in vivarium home cages to enable high-throughput, long-term operation with minimal investigator intervention. The primary aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of using passive infrared (PIR) sensors and microcontroller-based dataloggers in a rodent home cages to collect physical activity records. To this end, we developed an open-source PIR based data-logging device called the Rodent Activity Detector (RAD). We publish the design files and code so others can readily build the RAD in their own labs. To demonstrate its utility, we used the RAD to collect physical activity data from 40 individually housed mice for up to 10 weeks. This dataset demonstrates the ability of the RAD to 1) operate in a high-throughput installation, 2) detect high-fat diet induced changes in physical activity, and 3) quantify circadian rhythms in individual animals. We further validated the data output of the RAD with simultaneous video-tracking of mice in multiple caging configurations, to determine the features of physical activity that it detects. The RAD is easy to build, economical, and fits in vivarium caging. The scalability of such devices will enable high-throughput studies of physical activity in research studies.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Physical activity is an important determinant of human health, which reduces the risk of cardiovascular, metabolic and neurological disorders. Better methods for tracking physical activity in research studies may lead to insights that improve physical activity levels in people. To this end, we designed and built an inexpensive device to continuously track home cage activity levels in rodents. Our device, RAD, allows for high-throughput activity monitoring with minimal investigator intervention, presenting an economical and efficient option for investigating physical activity levels in research studies.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0110-19.2019v1?rss=1">Differential changes in the lateralized activity of identified projection neurons of motor cortex in hemiparkinsonian rats</a></h4>

Abstract<p>In the parkinsonian state, the motor cortex and basal ganglia undergo dynamic remodeling of movement representation. One such change is the loss of the normal contralateral lateralized activity pattern. The increase in the number of movement-related neurons responding to ipsilateral or bilateral limb movements may cause motor problems, including impaired balance, reduced bimanual coordination, and abnormal mirror movements. However, it remains unknown how individual types of motor cortical neurons organize this reconstruction. To explore the effect of dopamine depletion on lateralized activity in the parkinsonian state, we used a partial hemiparkinsonian model (6-hydroxydopamine lesion) in Long-Evans rats performing unilateral movements in a right–left pedal task, while recording from primary (M1) and secondary motor cortex (M2). The lesion decreased contralateral preferred activity in both M1 and M2. In addition, this change differed among identified intratelencephalic (IT) and pyramidal tract (PT) cortical projection neurons, depending on the cortical area. We detected a decrease in lateralized activity only in PT neurons in M1, whereas in M2, this change was observed in IT neurons, with no change in the PT population. Our results suggest a differential effect of dopamine depletion in the lateralized activity of the motor cortex, and suggest possible compensatory changes in the contralateral hemisphere.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> The motor cortex normally exhibits preferred activation during contralateral, but not ipsilateral, movements. In the parkinsonian state, this contralateral preference may be affected, resulting in impaired bimanual coordination or abnormal mirror movements. However, it remains unknown how individual types of motor cortical neurons are reorganized in the parkinsonian state. Using multiunit recording in hemiparkinsonian rats during unilateral forelimb movements, we observed a reduction in contralateral preference in both primary and secondary motor cortices in the lesioned hemisphere. Moreover, using a light-induced spike collision test, we demonstrated that these decreases in lateralized activity were present in PT neurons exclusively in the primary motor cortex, but only in IT neurons in the secondary motor cortex.</p>

Abstract<p>Conditioned taste aversion (CTA) is an essential behavior for animal survival. Conditioned animals show avoidance and decreased palatability to a conditioned stimulus (CS) on CTA retrieval. In this study, we aimed to determine whether the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) is involved in CTA retrieval and whether avoidance and palatability in CTA retrieval are processed in the BLA. We developed an experimental chamber for time-course analysis of the behavior to approach a spout and lick a CS. In this experimental chamber, we analyzed the behavior of male rats following microinjections of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptor agonist muscimol or saline into the BLA. The rats showed two types of approach behavior: they either (1) approached and licked the spout or (2) approached but did not lick the spout. Muscimol injection into the BLA decreased the frequency of the latter type of approach behavior, indicating that BLA inactivation reduced avoidance to the CS. The muscimol injection into the BLA also significantly increased the consumption of the CS. Lick microstructure analysis demonstrated that intra-BLA muscimol significantly increased licking burst number and size, indicating that BLA inactivation attenuated aversion to the CS as large burst licking is an indicator of high palatability. These results suggest that the increase in CS consumption with intra-BLA muscimol injection was due to alterations in approach and aversive responses to the CS. Therefore, we conclude that the BLA plays an essential role in CTA retrieval by parallel processing of avoidance and palatability.</p><p><b>Significant statements</b> To understand the role of the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) in the retrieval of conditioned taste aversion (CTA), we developed a new behavioral paradigm that overcomes the limitations of traditional behavioral procedures in CTA studies. In male rats, we measured time stamps of the approach behavior to a conditioned stimulus (CS) and licking of a spout. BLA inactivation not only increased CS consumption but also decreased avoidance and aversion to the CS. These results reveal that the BLA is essential for CTA retrieval by processing two distinct behavioral responses in parallel: avoidance and palatability. We further demonstrate that multi-dimensional analysis of animal behavior is an important factor for elucidating brain function.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To provide evidence that early electroencephalography (EEG) allows for reliable prediction of poor or good outcome after cardiac arrest.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a 5‐center prospective cohort study, we included consecutive, comatose survivors of cardiac arrest. Continuous EEG recordings were started as soon as possible and continued up to 5 days. Five‐minute EEG epochs were assessed by 2 reviewers, independently, at 8 predefined time points from 6 hours to 5 days after cardiac arrest, blinded for patients’ actual condition, treatment, and outcome. EEG patterns were categorized as generalized suppression (&lt;10 μV), synchronous patterns with ≥50% suppression, continuous, or other. Outcome at 6 months was categorized as good (Cerebral Performance Category [CPC] = 1–2) or poor (CPC = 3–5).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 850 patients, of whom 46% had a good outcome. Generalized suppression and synchronous patterns with ≥50% suppression predicted poor outcome without false positives at ≥6 hours after cardiac arrest. Their summed sensitivity was 0.47 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.42–0.51) at 12 hours and 0.30 (95% CI = 0.26–0.33) at 24 hours after cardiac arrest, with specificity of 1.00 (95% CI = 0.99–1.00) at both time points. At 36 hours or later, sensitivity for poor outcome was ≤0.22. Continuous EEG patterns at 12 hours predicted good outcome, with sensitivity of 0.50 (95% CI = 0.46–0.55) and specificity of 0.91 (95% CI = 0.88–0.93); at 24 hours or later, specificity for the prediction of good outcome was &lt;0.90.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>EEG allows for reliable prediction of poor outcome after cardiac arrest, with maximum sensitivity in the first 24 hours. Continuous EEG patterns at 12 hours after cardiac arrest are associated with good recovery. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

Since first described in the early 1900s, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has risen exponentially in prevalence and concern. Research still drives to understand the etiology and pathogenesis of this disease and what risk factors can attribute to AD. With a majority of AD cases being of sporadic origin, the increasing exponential growth of an aged population and a lack of treatment, it is imperative to discover an easy accessible preventative method for AD. Some risk factors can increase the propensity of AD such as aging, sex, and genetics. Moreover, there are also modifiable risk factors - in terms of treatable medical conditions and lifestyle choices - that play a role in developing AD. These risk factors have their own biological mechanisms that may contribute to AD etiology and pathological consequences. In this review, we will discuss modifiable risk factors and discuss the current literature of how each of these factors interplay into AD development and progression and if strategically analyzed and treated, could aid in protection against this neurodegenerative disease.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/48165">Rhodoquinone biosynthesis in <i>C.elegans</i> requires precursors generated by the kynurenine pathway</a></h4>

Parasitic helminths infect over a billion humans. To survive in the low oxygen environment of their hosts, these parasites use unusual anaerobic metabolism - this requires rhodoquinone (RQ), an electron carrier that is made by very few animal species. Crucially RQ is not made or used by any parasitic hosts and RQ synthesis is thus an ideal target for anthelmintics. However, little is known about how RQ is made and no drugs are known to block RQ synthesis. <i>C.elegans</i> makes RQ and can use RQ-dependent metabolic pathways - here, we use <i>C.elegans</i> genetics to show that tryptophan degradation via the kynurenine pathway is required to generate the key amine-containing precursors for RQ synthesis. We show that <i>C.elegans</i> requires RQ for survival in hypoxic conditions and, finally, we establish a high throughput assay for drugs that block RQ-dependent metabolism. This may drive the development of a new class of anthelmintic drugs. This study is a key first step in understanding how RQ is made in parasitic helminths.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/48054">An elusive electron shuttle from a facultative anaerobe</a></h4>

Some anaerobic bacteria use insoluble minerals as terminal electron acceptors and discovering the ways in which electrons move through the membrane barrier to the exterior acceptor forms an active field of research with implications for both bacterial physiology and bioenergy. A previous study suggested that <i>Shewanella oneidensis</i> MR-1 utilizes a small, polar, redox active molecule that serves as an electron shuttle between the bacteria and insoluble acceptors, but the shuttle itself has never been identified. Through isolation and synthesis, we identify it as ACNQ (2-amino-3-carboxy-1,4-naphthoquinone), a soluble analog of menaquinone. ACNQ is derived from DHNA (1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid) in a non-enzymatic process that frustrated genetic approaches to identify the shuttle. Both ACNQ and DHNA restore reduction of AQDS under anaerobic growth in menaquinone-deficient mutants. Bioelectrochemistry analyses reveal that ACNQ (-0.32 V<sub>Ag/AgCl</sub>) contributes to the extracellular electron transfer (EET) as an electron shuttle, without altering menaquinone generation or EET related cytochrome c expression.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/47732">Light-dependent single-cell heterogeneity in the chloroplast redox state regulates cell fate in a marine diatom</a></h4>

Diatoms are photosynthetic microorganisms of great ecological and biogeochemical importance, forming vast blooms in aquatic ecosystems. However, we are still lacking fundamental understanding of how individual cells sense and respond to diverse stress conditions, and what acclimation strategies are employed during bloom dynamics. We investigated cellular responses to environmental stress at the single-cell level using the roGFP sensor targeted to various organelles in the diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i>. We detected cell-to-cell variability using flow cytometry cell sorting and a microfluidics system for live imaging of roGFP oxidation dynamics. Chloroplast-targeted roGFP exhibited a light-dependent, bi-stable oxidation pattern in response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and high light, revealing distinct subpopulations of sensitive oxidized cells and resilient reduced cells. Early oxidation in the chloroplast preceded commitment to cell death, and can be used for sensing stress cues and regulating cell fate. We propose that light-dependent metabolic heterogeneity regulates diatoms' sensitivity to environmental stressors in the ocean.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/47060">Molecular mechanisms of human P2X3 receptor channel activation and modulation by divalent cation bound ATP</a></h4>

P2X3 receptor channels expressed in sensory neurons are activated by extracellular ATP and serve important roles in nociception and sensory hypersensitization, making them attractive therapeutic targets. Although several P2X3 structures are known, it is unclear how physiologically abundant Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATP and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP activate the receptor, or how divalent cations regulate channel function. We used structural, computational and functional approaches to show that a crucial acidic chamber near the nucleotide-binding pocket in human P2X3 receptors accommodates divalent ions in two distinct modes in the absence and presence of nucleotide. The unusual engagement between the receptor, divalent ion and the γ-phosphate of ATP enables channel activation by ATP-divalent complex, cooperatively stabilizes the nucleotide on the receptor to slow ATP unbinding and recovery from desensitization, a key mechanism for limiting channel activity. These findings reveal how P2X3 receptors recognize and are activated by divalent-bound ATP, aiding future physiological investigations and drug development.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/46349">Single-cell sequencing of neonatal uterus reveals an endometrial progenitor indispensable for fertility</a></h4>

The Mullerian ducts are the anlagen of the female reproductive tract, which regress in the male fetus in response to MIS. This process is driven by subluminal mesenchymal cells expressing Misr2, which trigger the regression of the adjacent Mullerian ductal epithelium. In females these Misr2+ cells are retained, yet their contribution to the development of the uterus remains unknown. Here, we report that subluminal Misr2+ cells persist postnatally in the uterus of rodents, but recede by week 37 of gestation in humans. Using single-cell RNA sequencing we demonstrate that ectopic postnatal MIS administration inhibits these cells and prevents the formation of endometrial stroma in rodents, suggesting a progenitor function. Exposure to MIS during the first six days of life, by inhibiting specification of the stroma, dysregulates paracrine signals necessary for uterine development, eventually resulting in apoptosis of the Misr2+ cells, uterine hypoplasia, and complete infertility in the adult female.

Previously we described a novel alternative to Chromatin Immunoprecipitation, CUT&amp;RUN, in which unfixed permeabilized cells are incubated with antibody, followed by binding of a Protein A-Micrococcal Nuclease (pA/MNase) fusion protein (Skene and Henikoff, 2017). Here we introduce three enhancements to CUT&amp;RUN: A hybrid Protein A-Protein G-MNase construct that expands antibody compatibility and simplifies purification, a modified digestion protocol that inhibits premature release of the nuclease-bound complex, and a calibration strategy based on carry-over of <i>E. coli</i> DNA introduced with the fusion protein. These new features, coupled with the previously described low-cost, high efficiency, high reproducibility and high-throughput capability of CUT&amp;RUN make it the method of choice for routine epigenomic profiling.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/45968">Impact of precisely-timed inhibition of gustatory cortex on taste behavior depends on single-trial ensemble dynamics</a></h4>

Sensation and action are necessarily coupled during stimulus perception - while tasting, for instance, perception happens while an animal decides to expel or swallow the substance in the mouth (the former via a behavior known as 'gaping'). Taste responses in the rodent gustatory cortex (GC) span this sensorimotor divide, progressing through firing-rate epochs that culminate in the emergence of action-related firing. Population analyses reveal this emergence to be a sudden, coherent and variably-timed ensemble transition that reliably precedes gaping onset by 0.2-0.3s. Here, we tested whether this transition drives gaping, by delivering 0.5s GC perturbations in tasting trials. Perturbations significantly delayed gaping, but only when they preceded the action-related transition - thus, the same perturbation impacted behavior or not, depending on the transition latency in that particular trial. Our results suggest a distributed attractor network model of taste processing, and a dynamical role for cortex in driving motor behavior.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/45920">Exercise-induced enhancement of synaptic function triggered by the inverse BAR protein, Mtss1L</a></h4>

Exercise is a potent enhancer of learning and memory, yet we know little of the underlying mechanisms that likely include alterations in synaptic efficacy in the hippocampus. To address this issue, we exposed mice to a single episode of voluntary exercise, and permanently marked activated mature hippocampal dentate granule cells using conditional Fos-TRAP mice. Exercise-activated neurons (Fos-TRAPed) showed an input-selective increase in dendritic spines and excitatory postsynaptic currents at 3 days post-exercise, indicative of exercise-induced structural plasticity. Laser-capture microdissection and RNASeq of activated neurons revealed that the most highly induced transcript was <i>Mtss1L</i>, a little-studied I-BAR domain-containing gene, which we hypothesized could be involved in membrane curvature and dendritic spine formation. shRNA-mediated <i>Mtss1L</i> knockdown in vivo prevented the exercise-induced increases in spines and excitatory postsynaptic currents. Our results link short-term effects of exercise to activity-dependent expression of Mtss1L, which we propose as a novel effector of activity-dependent rearrangement of synapses.

The glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor attaches nearly 150 proteins to the cell membrane. Patients with pathogenic variants in GPI biosynthesis genes develop diverse phenotypes including seizures, dysmorphic facial features and cleft palate through an unknown mechanism. We identified a novel mouse mutant (<i>cleft lip/palate, edema and exencephaly; Clpex)</i> with a hypo-morphic mutation in <i>Post-Glycophosphatidylinositol Attachment to Proteins-2 (Pgap2)</i>, a component of the GPI biosynthesis pathway. The <i>Clpex</i> mutation decreases surface GPI expression. Surprisingly, <i>Pgap2</i> showed tissue specific expression with enrichment in the brain and face. We found the <i>Clpex</i> phenotype is due to apoptosis of neural crest cells (NCCs) and the cranial neuroepithelium. We showed folinic acid supplementation <i>in utero</i> can partially rescue the cleft lip phenotype. Finally, we generated a novel mouse model of NCC-specific total GPI deficiency. These mutants developed median cleft lip and palate demonstrating a previously undocumented cell autonomous role for GPI biosynthesis in NCC development.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44698">Monitoring site-specific conformational changes in real-time reveals a misfolding mechanism of the prion protein</a></h4>

During pathological aggregation, proteins undergo remarkable conformational re-arrangements to anomalously assemble into a heterogeneous collection of misfolded multimers, ranging from soluble oligomers to insoluble amyloid fibrils. Inspired by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements of protein folding, an experimental strategy to study site-specific misfolding kinetics during aggregation, by effectively suppressing contributions from inter-molecular FRET, is described. Specifically, the kinetics of conformational changes across different secondary and tertiary structural segments of the mouse prion protein (moPrP) were monitored independently, after the monomeric units transformed into large oligomers O<sub>L</sub>, which subsequently disaggregated reversibly into small oligomers O<sub>S</sub> at pH 4. The sequence segments spanning helices α2 and α3 underwent a compaction during the formation of O<sub>L</sub> and elongation into β-sheets during the formation of O<sub>S</sub>. The β1-α1-β2 and α2-α3 subdomains were separated, and the helix α1 was unfolded to varying extents in both O<sub>L</sub> and O<sub>S</sub>.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43191">Active information maintenance in working memory by a sensory cortex</a></h4>

Working memory is a critical brain function for maintaining and manipulating information over delay periods of seconds. It is debated whether delay-period neural activity in sensory regions is important for the active maintenance of information during the delay period. Here, we tackle this question by examining the anterior piriform cortex (APC), an olfactory sensory cortex, in head-fixed mice performing several olfactory working memory tasks. Active information maintenance is necessary in these tasks, especially in a dual-task paradigm in which mice are required to perform another distracting task while actively maintaining information during the delay period. Optogenetic suppression of neuronal activity in APC during the delay period impaired performance in all the tasks. Furthermore, electrophysiological recordings revealed that APC neuronal populations encoded odor information in the delay period even with an intervening distracting task. Thus, delay activity in APC is important for active information maintenance in olfactory working memory.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Creativity is the ability to generate original and useful products, and it is considered central to the progression of human civilization. As a noninherited emerging process, creativity may stem from temporally dynamic brain activity, which, however, has not been well studied. The purpose of this study was to measure brain dynamics using entropy and to examine the associations between brain entropy (BEN) and divergent thinking in a large healthy sample. The results showed that divergent thinking was consistently positively correlated with regional BEN in the left dorsal anterior cingulate cortex/pre-supplementary motor area and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, suggesting that creativity is closely related to the functional dynamics of the control networks involved in cognitive flexibility and inhibitory control. Importantly, our main results were cross-validated in two independent cohorts from two different cultures. Additionally, three dimensions of divergent thinking (fluency, flexibility, and originality) were positively correlated with regional BEN in the left inferior frontal gyrus and left middle temporal gyrus, suggesting that more highly creative individuals possess more flexible semantic associative networks. Taken together, our findings provide the first evidence of the associations of regional BEN with individual variations in divergent thinking and show that BEN is sensitive to detecting variations in important cognitive abilities in healthy subjects.</span>

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/682112v1?rss=1">Computer-assisted EEG diagnostic review for idiopathic generalized epilepsy</a></h4>

Epilepsy diagnosis can be costly, time-consuming and not uncommonly inaccurate. The reference standard diagnostic monitoring is continuous video-EEG monitoring, ideally capturing all events or concordant interictal discharges. Automating EEG data review would save time and resources, thus enabling more people to receive reference standard monitoring and also potentially herald a more quantitative approach to therapeutic outcomes. There is substantial research into automated detection of seizures and epileptic activity from EEG. However, automated detection software is not widely used in the clinic; and, despite numerous published algorithms, few methods have regulatory approval for detecting epileptic activity from EEG. This study reports on a deep learning algorithm for computer-assisted EEG review. Deep, convolutional neural networks were trained to detect epileptic discharges using a pre-existing dataset of over 6000 labelled events in a cohort of 103 patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE). Patients underwent 24-hour ambulatory outpatient EEG, and all data was curated and confirmed independently by two epilepsy specialists (Seneviratne et al, 2016). The resulting automated detection algorithm was then used to review diagnostic scalp-EEG for seven patients (four with IGE and three with events mimicking seizures) to validate performance in a clinical setting. The automated detection algorithm showed state-of-the-art performance for detecting epileptic activity from clinical EEG, with mean sensitivity of &gt;95% and corresponding mean false positive rate of 1 detection per minute. Importantly, diagnostic case studies showed that the automated detection algorithm reduced human review time by 80%-99%, without compromising event detection or diagnostic accuracy. The presented results demonstrate that computer-assisted review can increase the speed and accuracy of EEG assessment and has the potential to greatly improve therapeutic outcomes.

Sound sources in the world are experienced as stable even when intermittently obscured, implying perceptual completion mechanisms that "fill in" missing sensory information. We demonstrate a filling-in phenomenon in which the brain extrapolates the statistics of background sounds (textures) over periods of several seconds when they are interrupted by another sound, producing vivid percepts of illusory texture. The effect differs from previously described completion effects in that 1) the extrapolated sound must be defined statistically given the stochastic nature of texture, and 2) in lasting much longer, enabling introspection and facilitating assessment of the underlying representation. Illusory texture appeared to be integrated into texture statistic estimates indistinguishably from actual texture, suggesting that it is represented similarly to actual texture. The illusion appears to represent an inference about whether the background is likely to continue during concurrent sounds, providing a stable representation of the environment despite unstable sensory evidence.

Faces attract the observer's attention towards objects and locations of interest for the other, thereby allowing the two agents to establish joint attention. Previous work has delineated a network of cortical "patches" in the macaque cortex, processing faces, eventually also extracting information on the other's gaze direction. Yet, the neural mechanism that links information on gaze direction, guiding the observer's attention to the relevant object has remained elusive. Here we present electrophysiological evidence for the existence of a distinct "gaze-following patch (GFP)" with neurons that establish this linkage in a highly flexible manner. The other's gaze and the object, singled out by the gaze, are linked only if this linkage is pertinent within the prevailing social context. The properties of these neurons establish the GFP as a key switch in controlling social interactions based on the other's gaze.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/681783v1?rss=1">Decoding and perturbing decision states in real time</a></h4>

In dynamic environments, subjects often integrate multiple samples of a signal and combine them to reach a categorical judgment. The process of deliberation on the evidence can be described by a time-varying decision variable (DV), decoded from neural activity, that predicts a subject's decision at the end of a trial. However, within trials, large moment-to-moment fluctuations of the DV are observed. The behavioral significance of these fluctuations and their role in the decision process remain unclear. Here we show that within-trial DV fluctuations decoded in real time from motor cortex are tightly linked to choice behavior, and that robust changes in DV sign have the statistical regularities expected from behavioral studies of changes-of-mind. Furthermore, we find single-trial evidence for absorbing decision bounds. As the DV builds up, heavily favoring one or the other choice, moment-to-moment variability in the DV is reduced, and both neural DV and behavioral decisions become resistant to additional pulses of sensory evidence as predicted by diffusion-to-bound and attractor models of the decision process.

Identifying brain biomarkers of disease risk and treatment response is a growing priority in neuroscience. The ability to identify meaningful biomarkers is fundamentally limited by measurement reliability; measures that do not yield reliable values are unsuitable as biomarkers to predict clinical outcomes. Measuring brain activity using task-fMRI is a major focus of biomarker development; however, the reliability of task-fMRI has not been systematically evaluated. We present converging evidence demonstrating poor reliability of task-fMRI measures. First, a meta-analysis of 90 experiments with 1,088 participants reporting 1,146 ICCs for task-fMRI revealed poor overall reliability (mean ICC = .397). Second, the test-retest reliabilities of activity in a priori regions of interest across 11 commonly used fMRI tasks collected in the Human Connectome Project and the Dunedin Longitudinal Study were poor (ICCs = .067 - .485). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that commonly used task-fMRI measures are not currently suitable for brain biomarker discovery or individual differences research in cognitive neuroscience (i.e., brain-behavior mapping). We review how this state of affairs came to be and consider several avenues for improving the reliability of task-fMRI.

Astroglial cells are emerging as key players in the development and homeostatic maintenance of neurons and neuronal networks. Astroglial cell functions are critical to neuronal migration and maturation, myelination, and synapse dynamics, however little is known about astroglial phenotypic changes over development. Furthermore, astroglial cells express steroid hormone receptors and show rapid responses to hormonal manipulations, however, despite important sex differences in telencephalic regions such as the cortex and hippocampus few studies have examined sex differences in astroglial cells in development and outside of the hypothalamus and amygdala. To phenotype cortical astroglial cells across postnatal development while considering potential sex differences, we used translating ribosome affinity purification together with RNAsequencing (TRAPseq) and immunohistochemistry to phenotype the entire astroglial translatome in males and females at key developmental time points: P1, P4, P7, P14, P35 and in adulthood. We found that although astroglia show few sex differences in adulthood, they show significant sex differences in developmental gene expression patterns between p7 and P35, that suggest sex differences in developmental functions. We also found two distinctive, non-overlapping, astroglial phenotypes between early (P1-P7) and late development (P14-Adult). Together these data clearly delineate and phenotype astroglia across development and identify sex differences in astroglial developmental programs that could have an important impact on the construction and maintenance of neuronal networks and related behavioural phenotypes.

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a fatal, late-onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized by selective neuropathology in the brainstem, cerebellum, spinal cord, and substantia nigra. Here, we characterize the first NIH-approved human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line derived from an embryo harboring the SCA3 mutation. Referred here as SCA3-hESC, this line is heterozygous for the mutant polyglutamine-encoding CAG repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene within the pathogenic repeat range for SCA3. We observed relevant molecular hallmarks of the human disease at all differentiation stages from stem cells to cortical neurons, including robust ATXN3 aggregation and altered expression of key components of the protein quality control machinery. Finally, antisense oligonucleotide-mediated reduction of ATXN3 prevented the formation of p62-positive aggresomes in SCA3-hESCs. The SCA3-hESC line offers a unique and highly relevant human disease model that holds strong potential to advance understanding of SCA3 disease mechanisms and facilitate the evaluation of possible SCA3 therapies.

Sleep is a nearly universal behavior that is regulated by diverse environmental and physiological stimuli. A defining feature of sleep is a homeostatic rebound following deprivation, where animals compensate for lost sleep by increasing sleep duration and/or sleep depth. Fruit flies exhibit robust recovery sleep following deprivation and represent a powerful model to study neural circuits regulating sleep homeostasis. Numerous neuronal populations have been identified in modulating sleep homeostasis as well as depth, raising the possibility that recovery sleep is differentially regulated by environmental or physiological processes that induce sleep deprivation. Here, we find that unlike most pharmacological and environmental manipulations commonly used to restrict sleep, starvation potently induces sleep loss without a subsequent rebound in sleep duration or depth. We find that both starvation and a sucrose-only diet result in reduced metabolic rate and increased sleep depth, suggesting that dietary yeast protein is essential for normal sleep depth and homeostasis. Finally, we find that Drosophila insulin like peptide 2 (Dilp2) is required for starvation-induced changes in sleep depth without regulating the duration of sleep. Remarkably, Dilp2 mutant flies require rebound sleep following sleep deprivation, suggesting Dilp2 underlies resilience to sleep loss. Together, these findings reveal innate resilience to starvation-induced sleep loss and identify distinct mechanisms that underlie starvation-induced changes in sleep duration and depth.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/681544v1?rss=1">Decoding task-specific cognitive states with slow, directed functional networks in the human brain</a></h4>

Flexible functional interactions among brain regions mediate critical cognitive functions. Such interactions can be measured from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data with either instantaneous (zero-lag) or lag-based (time-lagged) functional connectivity; only the latter approach permits inferring directed functional interactions. Yet, the fMRI hemodynamic response is slow, and sampled at a timescale (seconds) several orders of magnitude slower than the underlying neural dynamics (milliseconds). It is, therefore, widely held that lag-based fMRI functional connectivity, measured with approaches like as Granger-Geweke causality (GC), provides spurious and unreliable estimates of underlying neural interactions. Experimental verification of this claim has proven challenging because neural ground truth connectivity is often unavailable concurrently with fMRI recordings. We address this challenge by combining machine learning with GC functional connectivity estimation. We estimated instantaneous and lag-based GC functional connectivity networks using fMRI data from 1000 participants, drawn from the Human Connectome Project database. A linear classifier, trained on either instantaneous or lag-based GC, reliably discriminated among seven different task and resting brain states, with over 80% cross-validation accuracy. With network simulations, we demonstrate that instantaneous and lag-based GC exploited interactions at fast and slow timescales, respectively, to achieve robust classification. With human fMRI data, instantaneous and lag-based GC identified distinct, cognitive core networks. Finally, variations in GC connectivity explained inter-individual variations in a variety of cognitive scores. Our findings show that instantaneous and lag-based methods reveal complementary aspects of functional connectivity in the brain, and suggest that slow, directed functional interactions, estimated with fMRI, provide robust markers of behaviorally relevant cognitive states.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/681536v1?rss=1">A tripartite flip-flop sleep circuit switches sleep states</a></h4>

Inhibitory sleep-active neurons depolarize at sleep onset to shut down the activity of wakefulness circuits. Wake-active arousal neurons in turn suppress inhibitory sleep-active neurons, thus forming a bipartite flip-flop switch. However, how sleep states are switched is unclear because neural circuits that directly depolarize inhibitory sleep-active neurons are not understood. Using optogenetics, we solved the presynaptic circuit for depolarization of the sleep-active RIS neuron in C. elegans. Surprisingly, we found that the PVC forward command interneuron, which is known to control wake behavior, is a major activator of RIS. PVC is inhibited by reverse command interneurons, which are stimulated by arousing cues. This suggests a model for sleep switch operation in which declining arousal increases activation of PVC, thus triggering activation of RIS. Depolarization of RIS in turn promotes the activation of PVC, thus forming a positive feedback loop for all-or-none sleep induction. The flip-flop sleep switch in C. elegans thus is tripartite and requires excitatory sleep-promoting neurons activated by wakefulness that act as an amplifier that translates reduced arousal into the depolarization of an inhibitory sleep-active neuron. A tripartite flip-flop switch likely also underlies sleep state switching in other animals including in mammals.

In the cerebellum of juvenile Oncorhynchus masou, proliferating BrdU+ and HuCD+ cells and constitutive neurogenic niches were detected in different zones; the largest number of labeled cells were found in the dorsal part of the molecular layer and the dorsal matrix zone (DMZ). Cells labeled with glutamine synthetase (GS) and radial glia were also present in the intact O. masou cerebellum. The most intensive proliferation was detected in the rostral part of cerebellum. This part is assumed to contain active zones of constitutive neurogenesis. After an injury inflicted to the cerebellum, the number of BrdU+ and HuCD+ cells increased significantly. The number of BrdU+ cells after this type of injury was much greater than after a telencephalon trauma. A quantitative analysis revealed that after the cerebellum injury the proliferative activity in the caudal part of CCb is increased compared to that in the control. A reactivation of neurogenic and neuroepithelial niches and their transformation into reactive neurogenic domains, with an increased distribution density of intensely labeled HuCD+ cells of different types, were observed. The increase in the number of HuCD+ differentiated cells in the basal area suggests that the processes of neuronal differentiation are intensified in the cerebellum of juvenile O. masou after injury. The number of GS positive cells (GS+) and fibers increased in all the zones of cerebellum. The most intensive astrocytic response was noted in the dorsal part of cerebellum. The data of the enzyme immunoassay confirm the multiple variations in the level of GS after a traumatic injury to cerebellum in O. masou.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/681437v1?rss=1">Gaze and Movement Assessment (GaMA): Inter-site validation of a visuomotor upper limb functional protocol</a></h4>

Background: Successful hand-object interactions require precise hand-eye coordination with continual movement adjustments. Quantitative measurement of this visuomotor behaviour could provide valuable insight into upper limb impairments. The Gaze and Movement Assessment (GaMA) was developed to provide protocols for simultaneous motion capture and eye tracking during the administration of two functional tasks, along with data analysis methods to generate standard measures of visuomotor behaviour. The objective of this study was to investigate the reproducibility of the GaMA protocol across two independent groups of non-disabled participants, with different raters using different motion capture and eye tracking technology. Methods: Twenty non-disabled adults performed the Pasta Box Task and the Cup Transfer Task. Upper body and eye movements were recorded using motion capture and eye tracking, respectively. Measures of hand movement, angular joint kinematics, and eye gaze were compared to those from a different sample of twenty non-disabled adults who had previously performed the same protocol with different technology, rater and site. Results: Participants took longer to perform the tasks versus those from the earlier study, although the relative time of each movement phase was similar. Measures that were dissimilar between the groups included hand distances travelled, hand trajectories, number of movement units, eye latencies, and peak angular velocities. Similarities included all hand velocity and grip aperture measures, eye fixations, and most peak joint angle and range of motion measures. Discussion: The reproducibility of GaMA was confirmed by this study, despite a few differences introduced by learning effects, task demonstration variation, and limitations of the kinematic model. The findings from this study provide confidence in the reliability of normative results obtained by GaMA, indicating it accurately quantifies the typical behaviours of a non-disabled population. This work advances the consideration for use of GaMA in populations with upper limb sensorimotor impairment.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/681361v1?rss=1">Topographic specificity of alpha power during auditory spatial attention</a></h4>

Visual and somatosensory spatial attention both induce parietal alpha (7-14 Hz) oscillations whose topographical distribution depends on the direction of spatial attentional focus. In the auditory domain, contrasts of parietal alpha power for leftward and rightward attention reveal a qualitatively similar lateralization; however, it is not clear whether alpha lateralization changes monotonically with the direction of auditory attention as it does for visual spatial attention. In addition, most previous studies of alpha oscillation did not consider subject-specific differences in alpha frequency, but simply analyzed power in a fixed spectral band. Here, we recorded electroencephalography in human subjects when they directed attention to one of five azimuthal locations. After a cue indicating the direction of an upcoming target sequence of spoken syllables (yet before the target began), alpha power changed in a task specific manner. Subject-specific peak alpha frequencies differed consistently between frontocentral electrodes and parieto-occipital electrodes, suggesting multiple neural generators of task-related alpha. Parieto-occipital alpha increased over the hemisphere ipsilateral to attentional focus compared to the contralateral hemisphere, and changed systematically as the direction of attention shifted from far left to far right. These results showing that parietal alpha lateralization changes smoothly with the direction of auditory attention as in visual spatial attention provide further support to the growing evidence that the frontoparietal attention network is supramodal.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/681353v1?rss=1">Connecting gene regulatory relationships to neurobiological mechanisms of brain disorders</a></h4>

Despite being clinically distinguishable, many neuropsychiatric disorders display a remarked level of genetic correlation and overlapping symptoms. Deciphering neurobiological mechanisms underlying potential shared genetic etiology is challenging because (1) most common risk variants reside in the non-coding region of the genome, and (2) a genome-wide framework is required to compare genome-wide association studies (GWAS) having different power. To address these challenges, we developed a platform, Hi-C coupled MAGMA (H-MAGMA), that converts SNP- level summary statistics into gene-level association statistics by assigning non-coding SNPs to their cognate genes based on chromatin interactions. We applied H-MAGMA to five psychiatric disorders and four neurodegenerative disorders to interrogate biological pathways, developmental windows, and cell types implicated for each disorder. We found that neuropsychiatric disorder-associated genes coalesce at the level of developmental windows (mid- gestation) and cell-type specificity (excitatory neurons). On the contrary, neurodegenerative disorder-associated genes show more diverse cell type specific, and increasing expression over time, consistent with the age-associated elevated risk of developing neurodegenerative disorders. Genes associated with Alzheimer's disease were not only highly expressed in microglia, but also subject to microglia and oligodendrocyte-specific dysregulation, highlighting the importance of understanding the cellular context in which risk variants exert their effects. We also obtained a set of pleiotropic genes that are shared across multiple psychiatric disorders and may form the basis for common neurobiological susceptibility. Pleiotropic genes are associated with neural activity and gene regulation, with selective expression in corticothalamic projection neurons. These results show how H-MAGMA adds to existing frameworks to help identify the neurobiological basis of shared and distinct genetic architecture of brain disorders.

Emotional awareness (EA) is recognized as clinically relevant to the vulnerability to, and maintenance of, psychiatric disorders. However, the neurocomputational processes that underwrite individual variations remain unclear. In this paper, we describe a deep (active) inference model that reproduces the cognitive-emotional processes and self-report behaviors associated with EA. We then present simulations to illustrate (seven) distinct mechanisms that (either alone or in combination) can produce phenomena - such as somatic misattribution, coarse-grained emotion conceptualization, and constrained reflective capacity - characteristic of low EA. Our simulations suggest that the clinical phenotype of impoverished EA can be reproduced by dissociable computational processes. The possibility that different processes are at work in different individuals suggests that they may benefit from distinct clinical interventions. As active inference makes particular predictions about the underlying neurobiology of such aberrant inference, we also discuss how this type of modelling could be used to design neuroimaging tasks to test predictions and identify which processes operate in different individuals - and provide a principled basis for personalized precision medicine.

The restructuring and optimization of the cerebral cortex from early childhood and through adolescence is an essential feature of human brain development, underlying immense cognitive improvements. Beyond established morphometric cortical assessments, the T1w/T2w ratio quantifies partly separate biological processes, and might inform models of typical neurocognitive development and developmental psychopathology. In the present study, we computed vertex-wise T1w/T2w ratio across the cortical surface in 621 youths (3-21 years) sampled from the Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics (PING) study and tested for associations with individual differences in age, sex, and both general and specific cognitive abilities. The results showed a near global linear age-related increase in T1w/T2w ratio across the brain surface, with a general posterior to anterior gradient in association strength. Moreover, results indicated that boys in late adolescence had regionally higher T1w/T2w ratio as compared to girls. Across individuals, T1w/T2w ratio was negatively associated with general- , and several specific cognitive abilities mainly within anterior cortical regions. Our study indicates age-related differences in T1w/T2w ratio throughout childhood, adolescence and young adulthood, in line with the known protracted myelination of the cortex. Moreover, the study supports the relevance of the T1w/T2w ratio as a neuroimaging marker for cognitive development.

Hippocampal pyramidal neurons sustain propagation of fast electrical signals and are electrotonically non-compact structures exhibiting cell-to-cell variability in their complex dendritic arborization. In this study, we demonstrate that sharp place-field tuning and several somato-dendritic functional maps concomitantly emerge despite the presence of geometrical heterogeneities in these neurons. We establish this employing an unbiased stochastic search strategy involving thousands of models that spanned several morphologies and distinct profiles of dispersed synaptic localization and channel expression. Mechanistically, employing virtual knockout models, we explored the impact of bidirectional modulation in dendritic spike prevalence on place-field tuning sharpness. Consistent with prior literature, we found that across all morphologies, virtual knockout of either dendritic fast sodium channels or N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors led to a reduction in dendritic spike prevalence, whereas A-type potassium channel knockouts resulted in a nonspecific increase in dendritic spike prevalence. However, place-field tuning sharpness was critically impaired in all three sets of virtual knockout models, demonstrating that sharpness in feature tuning is maintained by an intricate balance between mechanisms that promote and those that prevent dendritic spike initiation. From the functional standpoint of the emergence of sharp feature tuning and intrinsic functional maps, within this framework, geometric variability was compensated by a combination of synaptic democracy, the ability of randomly dispersed synapses to yield sharp tuning through dendritic spike initiation, and ion-channel degeneracy. Our results suggest electrotonically non-compact neurons to be endowed with several degrees of freedom, encompassing channel expression, synaptic localization and morphological micro-structure, in achieving sharp feature encoding and excitability homeostasis.

Here we describe the use of an organotypic hippocampal slice model for studying -synuclein aggregation and inter-neuronal spreading initiated by injection of preformed -synuclein filaments (PFFs). PFF injection at dentate gyrus templates the endogenous -synuclein to form aggregates in axons and cell bodies that spread to CA3 and CA1 regions. Aggregates were insoluble and phosphorylated at serine 129, recapitulating Lewy pathology features found in Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies. The spreading of the aggregates were favoring the anterograde direction in the slice model. The model allowed development of slices expressing only serine-129 phosphorylation-deficient human -synuclein (S129G) using adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector in -synuclein knockout slices. Processes of aggregation and spreading of -synuclein were thereby shown to be independent of phosphorylation at serine 129. We provide methods and highlight crucial steps for PFF microinjection and characterization of aggregate formation and spreading. Slices derived from genetically engineered mice or manipulated by using viral vectors allow testing of hypotheses on mechanisms involved in formation of -synuclein aggregates and their prion-like spreading.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/681031v1?rss=1">Excitatory and inhibitory attentional mechanisms involved in the control of distractor interference in working memory: A neural oscillations perspective</a></h4>

Retroactive cuing of information after encoding improves working memory performance. It has recently been shown that this benefit is related to excitatory and inhibitory attentional sub-processes. We investigated the electrophysiological correlates of these mechanisms in a retroactive cuing task by means of oscillatory EEG parameters. In order to disentangle the processes related to distractor inhibition and target enhancement, the to-be-memorized information was presented in a way that posterior hemispheric asymmetries in oscillatory power could be unambiguously linked to target or distractor processing. Alpha power (8-13 Hz) following the retroactive cues increased contralateral to an irrelevant and decreased contralateral to the position of a relevant working memory representation. These effects were insensitive to the number of cued or non-cued items, supporting their role in spatial shifts of attention. Frontal theta power was increased for selective retro-cues compared to a neutral condition, but was also not modulated by the number of cued or non-cued items. It thus reflected the general need for higher-level attentional control in working memory. Non-lateralized posterior alpha and beta power prior to memory probe presentation was decreased for one compared to two cued items and for two compared to one non-cued item. Furthermore, alpha/beta power suppression in this time window was positively correlated to the interfering effect of irrelevant working memory contents on behavioral performance. Non-lateralized alpha and beta power decreases after retroactive cues might thus be a viable marker for the re-engagement of released working memory resources to support the control of distractor interference in working memory.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/680678v1?rss=1">Mathematical relations between measures of brain connectivity estimated from electrophysiological recordings for Gaussian distributed data</a></h4>

A large variety of methods exist to estimate brain coupling in the frequency domain from electrophysiological data measured e.g. by EEG and MEG. Those data are to reasonable approximation, though certainly not perfectly, Gaussian distributed. This work is based on the well-known fact that for Gaussian distributed data, the cross-spectrum completely determines all statistical properties. In particular, for an infinite number of data, all normalized coupling measures at a given frequency are a function of complex coherency. However, it is largely unknown what the functional relations are. We here present those functional relations for six different measures: the weighted phase lag index, the phase lag index, the absolute value and imaginary part of the phase locking value (PLV), power envelope correlation, and power envelope correlation with correction for artifacts of volume conduction. With the exception of PLV, the final results are simple closed form formulas. We tested for empirical resting state EEG on sensor level to what extent a model, namely the respective function of coherency, can explain the observed couplings. We found that for measures of phase-phase coupling deviations from the model are in general minor, while power envelope correlations systematically deviate from the model for all frequencies. For power envelope correlation with correction for artifacts of volume conduction the model cannot explain the observed couplings at all. We also analyzed power envelope correlation as a function of time and frequency in an event related experiment using a stroop reaction task and found significant event related deviations mostly in the alpha range.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Oligomeric forms of amyloid β protein (oAβ) are believed to be principally responsible for neurotoxicity in Alzheimer disease (AD), but it is not known whether anti‐Aβ antibodies are capable of lowering oAβ levels in humans.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We developed an ultrasensitive immunoassay and used it to measure oAβ in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 104 AD subjects participating in the ABBY and BLAZE phase 2 trials of the anti‐Aβ antibody crenezumab. Patients received subcutaneous (SC) crenezumab (300mg) or placebo every 2 weeks, or intravenous (IV) crenezumab (15mg/kg) or placebo every 4 weeks for 68 weeks. Ninety‐eight of the 104 patients had measurable baseline oAβ levels, and these were compared to levels at week 69 in placebo (n = 28), SC (n = 35), and IV (n = 35) treated patients.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among those receiving crenezumab, 89% of SC and 86% of IV patients had lower levels of oAβ at week 69 versus baseline. The difference in the proportion of patients with decreasing levels was significant for both treatment arms: <i>p</i> = 0.0035 for SC and p = 0.01 for IV crenezumab versus placebo. The median percentage change was −48% in the SC arm and −43% in the IV arm. No systematic change was observed in the placebo group, with a median change of −13% and equivalent portions with negative and positive change.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Crenezumab lowered CSF oAβ levels in the large majority of treated patients tested. These results support engagement of the principal pathobiological target in AD and identify CSF oAβ as a novel pharmacodynamic biomarker for use in trials of anti‐Aβ agents. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The aim of the study was to report 12‐month changes after treatment with Nusinersen in a cohort of 85 type I Spinal Muscular Atrophy patients of age ranging from 2 months to 15 years and 11 months.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>All patients were assessed using the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP INTEND) and the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination‐Section 2 (HINE‐2).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Two of the 85 had 1 <i>SMN2</i> copy, 61 had 2 copies, 18 had 3 copies. In 4 patients the <i>SMN2</i> copy number was not available. At baseline the mean CHOP INTEND scores ranged between 0 and 52 (mean: 15.66, SD: <span>+</span>13.48), and the mean HINE‐2 score between 0 and 5 (mean: 0.69, SD:<span>+</span>1.23).</p>
<p>There was a difference between baseline and the 12‐month scores on both the CHOP INTEND and the HINE‐2 for the whole group (p&lt;0.001) as well as for the subgroups with 2 <i>SMN2</i> copies (p&lt;0.001), and for those with 3 <i>SMN2</i> copies (p&lt;0.001). The difference was found not only in patients younger than 210 days at baseline (p&lt;0.001) but also in those younger than 5 years on the CHOP INTEND and younger than 2 years on the HINE‐2.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results, expanding the age range and the severity of type I patients treated with Nusinersen over one year, provide additional data on the range of efficacy of the drug that will be helpful to make an informed decision on whether to start treatment in patients of different age and severity.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43924">optoPAD, a closed-loop optogenetics system to study the circuit basis of feeding behaviors</a></h4>

The regulation of feeding plays a key role in determining the fitness of animals through its impact on nutrition. Elucidating the circuit basis of feeding and related behaviors is an important goal in neuroscience. We recently used a system for closed-loop optogenetic manipulation of neurons contingent on the feeding behavior of <i>Drosophila</i> to dissect the impact of a specific subset of taste neurons on yeast feeding. Here, we describe the development and validation of this system, which we term the optoPAD. We use the optoPAD to induce appetitive and aversive effects on feeding by activating or inhibiting gustatory neurons in closed-loop – effectively creating virtual taste realities. The use of optogenetics allowed us to vary the dynamics and probability of stimulation in single flies and assess the impact on feeding behavior quantitatively and with high throughput. These data demonstrate that the optoPAD is a powerful tool to dissect the circuit basis of feeding behavior, allowing the efficient implementation of sophisticated behavioral paradigms to study the mechanistic basis of animals’ adaptation to dynamic environments.

Neurons utilize bursts of action potentials as an efficient and reliable way to encode information. It is likely that the intrinsic membrane properties of neurons involved in burst generation may also participate in preserving its temporal features. Here we examined the contribution of the persistent and resurgent components of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> currents in modulating the burst discharge in sensory neurons. Using mathematical modeling, theory and dynamic-clamp electrophysiology, we show that, distinct from the persistent Na<sup>+</sup> component which is important for membrane resonance and burst generation, the resurgent Na<sup>+</sup> can help stabilize burst timing features including the duration and intervals. Moreover, such a physiological role for the resurgent Na<sup>+</sup> offered noise tolerance and preserved the regularity of burst patterns. Model analysis further predicted a negative feedback loop between the persistent and resurgent gating variables which mediate such gain in burst stability. These results highlight a novel role for the voltage-gated resurgent Na<sup>+</sup> component in moderating the entropy of burst-encoded neural information.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Mb-Tj7XKem0" width="1" />

Cancers exhibit spatially heterogeneous, unique vascular architectures across individual samples, cell-lines and patients. This inherently disorganised collection of leaky blood vessels contribute significantly to suboptimal treatment efficacy. Preclinical tools are urgently required which incorporate the inherent variability and heterogeneity of tumours to optimise and engineer anti-cancer therapies. In this study, we present a novel computational framework which incorporates whole, realistic tumours extracted <i>ex vivo</i> to efficiently simulate vascular blood flow and interstitial fluid transport <i>in silico</i> for validation against <i>in vivo</i> biomedical imaging. Our model couples Poiseuille and Darcy descriptions of vascular and interstitial flow, respectively, and incorporates spatially heterogeneous blood vessel lumen and interstitial permeabilities to generate accurate predictions of tumour fluid dynamics. Our platform enables highly-controlled experiments to be performed which provide insight into how tumour vascular heterogeneity contributes to tumour fluid transport. We detail the application of our framework to an orthotopic murine glioma (GL261) and a human colorectal carcinoma (LS147T), and perform sensitivity analysis to gain an understanding of the key biological mechanisms which determine tumour fluid transport. Finally we mimic vascular normalization by modifying parameters, such as vascular and interstitial permeabilities, and show that incorporating realistic vasculatures is key to modelling the contrasting fluid dynamic response between tumour samples. Contrary to literature, we show that reducing tumour interstitial fluid pressure is not essential to increase interstitial perfusion and that therapies should seek to develop an interstitial fluid pressure gradient. We also hypothesise that stabilising vessel diameters and permeabilities are not key responses following vascular normalization and that therapy may alter interstitial hydraulic conductivity. Consequently, we suggest that normalizing the interstitial microenvironment may provide a more effective means to increase interstitial perfusion within tumours.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-nueKFP6Z9E" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine whether maternal Epstein‐Barr virus (EBV) IgG antibody levels are associated with risk of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the offspring.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a prospective nested case‐control study in the Finnish Maternity Cohort (FMC) with serum samples from over 800,000 women collected during pregnancy since 1983. Cases of MS among offspring born between 1983 and 1991 were identified via hospital and prescription registries; 176 cases were matched to up to 3 controls (n=326) on region and dates of birth, sample collection, and mother's birth. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate relative risks (RR) and adjusted models for sex of the child, gestational age at sample collection, and maternal serum 25‐hydroxyvitamin D and cotinine levels. Similar analyses were conducted among 1,049 women with MS and 1,867 matched controls in the FMC.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Maternal viral capsid antigen IgG levels during pregnancy were associated with an increased MS risk among offspring (RR<sub>top vs. bottom quintile</sub>=2.44, 95%CI: 1.20‐5.00, p trend=0.004); no associations were found between maternal EBNA‐1, EA‐D, or cytomegalovirus IgG levels and offspring MS risk. Among women in the FMC, those in the highest versus lowest quintile of EBNA‐1 IgG levels had a 3‐fold higher risk of MS (RR=3.21, 95%CI: 2.37‐4.35, p trend &lt;1.11e‐16). These associations were not confounded or modified by 25‐hydroxyvitamin D.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Offspring of mothers with high VCA IgG during pregnancy appear to have an increased risk of MS. The increase in MS risk among women with elevated pre‐diagnostic EBNA‐1 IgG levels is consistent with previous results.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Heightened somatic symptoms are reported by a wide range of patients with chronic pain and have been associated with emotional distress and physical dysfunction. Despite their clinical significance, molecular mechanisms leading to their manifestation are not understood.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used an association study design based on a curated list of 3,295 single nucleotide polymorphisms mapped to 358 genes to test somatic symptoms reporting using the Pennebaker Inventory of Limbic Languidness questionnaire from a case–control cohort of orofacial pain (n = 1,607). A replication meta‐analysis of 3 independent cohorts (n = 3,189) was followed by functional validation, including in silico molecular dynamics, in vitro enzyme assays, and measures of serotonin (5‐HT) plasma concentration.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>An association with the T allele of rs11575542 coding for an arginine to glutamine substitution in the L‐aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) enzyme was replicated in a meta‐analysis of 3 independent cohorts. In a combined meta‐analysis of all cohorts, this association reached <i>p</i> = 6.43 × 10<sup>−8</sup>. In silico studies demonstrated that this substitution dramatically reduces the conformational dynamics of AADC, potentially lowering its binding capacity to a cofactor. in vitro enzymatic assays showed that this substitution reduces the maximum kinetic velocity of AADC, hence lowering 5‐HT levels. Finally, plasma samples from 90 subjects showed correlation between low 5‐HT levels and heightened somatic symptoms.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Using functional genomics approaches, we identified a polymorphism in the AADC enzyme that contributes to somatic symptoms through reduced levels of 5‐HT. Our findings suggest a molecular mechanism underlying the pathophysiology of somatic symptoms and opens up new treatment options targeting the serotonergic system. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

Abstract: Neural crest cells arise in the embryo from the neural plate border and migrate throughout the body, giving rise to many different tissue types such as bones and cartilage of the face, smooth muscles, neurons and melanocytes. While studied extensively in animal models, neural crest development and disease have been poorly described in human due to the challenges in accessing embryonic tissues. In recent years, patient-derived human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have become easier to generate, and several streamlined protocols have enabled robust differentiation of hiPSCs to the neural crest lineage. Thus, a unique opportunity is offered for modelling neurocristopathies using patient specific stem cell lines. In this work, we make use of hiPSCs derived from patients affected by the Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS) ciliopathy. BBS patients often exhibit subclinical craniofacial dysmorphisms that are likely to be associated with the neural crest-derived facial skeleton. We focus on hiPSCs carrying variants in the BBS10 gene, which encodes a protein forming part of a chaperonin-like complex associated with the cilium. Here, we establish a pipeline for profiling hiPSCs during differentiation toward the neural crest stem cell fate. This can be used to characterise the differentiation properties of the neural crest-like cells. Two different BBS10 mutant lines showed a reduction in expression of the characteristic neural crest gene expression profile. Further analysis of both BBS10 mutant lines highlighted the inability of these mutant lines to differentiate towards a neural crest fate, which was also characterised by a decreased WNT and BMP response. Altogether, our study suggests a requirement for wild-type BBS10 in human neural crest development. In the long term, approaches such as the one we describe will allow direct comparison of disease-specific cell lines. This will provide valuable insights into the relationships between genetic background and heterogeneity in cellular models. The possibility of integrating laboratory data with clinical phenotypes will move us towards precision medicine approaches.

Alzheimer disease (AD) represents an oncoming epidemic that without an effective treatment promises to exact extraordinary human and financial burdens. Studies of pathogenesis are essential for defining targets for discovering disease-modifying treatments. Past studies of AD neuropathology provided valuable, albeit limited, insights. Nevertheless, building on these findings, recent studies have provided an increasingly rich harvest of genetic, molecular and cellular data that are creating unprecedented opportunities to both understand and treat AD. Among the most significant are those documenting the presence within the AD brain of toxic oligomeric species of Aβ and tau. Existing data support the view that such species can propagate and spread within neural circuits. To place these findings in context we first review the genetics and neuropathology of AD, including AD in Down syndrome. We detail studies that support the existence of toxic oligomeric species while noting the significant unanswered questions concerning their precise structures, the means by which they spread and undergo amplification and how they induce neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. We conclude by offering a speculative synthesis for how oligomers of Aβ and tau initiate and drive pathogenesis. While 100 years after Alzheimer’s first report there is much still to learn about pathogenesis and the discovery of disease-modifying treatments, the application of new concepts and sophisticated new tools are poised to deliver important advances for combatting AD.

Despite the current diagnostic criteria, early diagnostics of behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) has remained challenging. Patients with bvFTD often present with misleading psychiatric phenotype, and, on the other hand, impairment in memory functions have increasingly been reported. However, impaired episodic memory is currently considered as an exclusion criterion for bvFTD. Single biofluid-based or imaging biomarkers do not currently provide sufficient sensitivity or specificity for early bvFTD diagnosis at single-subject level, although studies have suggested improved accuracy with different biomarker combinations. In this mini-review, we evaluate the core clinical features of early bvFTD and summarize the most potential imaging and fluid biomarkers for bvFTD diagnostics.

Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) estimates time-dependent associations between pairs of brain region time series as typically acquired during functional MRI.  dFC changes are most commonly quantified by pairwise correlation coefficients between the time series within a sliding window.  Here, we applied a recently developed bootstrap-based technique (Kudela et al. 2017) to robustly estimate subject-level dFC and its confidence intervals in a task-based fMRI study (24 subjects who tasted their most frequently consumed beer and Gatorade as an appetitive control).  We then combined information across subjects and scans utilizing semiparametric mixed models to obtain a group-level dFC estimate for each pair of brain regions, flavor, and the difference between flavors.  The proposed approach relies on the estimated group-level dFC accounting for complex correlation structures of the fMRI data, multiple repeated observations per subject, experimental design, and subject-specific variability.  It also provides condition-specific dFC and confidence intervals for the whole brain at the group level. As a summary dFC metric, we used the proportion of time when the estimated associations were either significantly positive or negative.  For both flavors, our fully-data driven approach yielded regional associations that reflected known, biologically meaningful brain organization as shown in prior work, as well as closely resembled resting state networks (RSNs).  Specifically, beer flavor-potentiated associations were detected between several reward-related regions, including the right ventral striatum (VST), lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and ventral anterior insular cortex (vAIC).  The enhancement of right VST-vAIC association by a taste of beer independently validated the main activation-based finding (Oberlin et al. 2016).  Most notably, our novel dFC methodology uncovered numerous associations undetected by the traditional static FC analysis. The data-driven, novel dFC methodology presented here can be used for a wide range of task-based fMRI designs to estimate the dFC at multiple levels – group-, individual- and task-specific, utilizing a combination of well-established statistical methods.

The complex development of the human nervous system has been traditionally studied using a combination of animal models, human post-mortem brain tissue, and human genetics studies.  However, there has been a lack of experimental human cellular models that would allow for a more precise elucidation of the intricate dynamics of early human brain development. The development of stem cell technologies, both embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells, has given neuroscientists access to the previously inaccessible early stages of human brain development.  In particular, the recent development of three-dimensional culturing methodologies provides a platform to study the differentiation of stem cells in both normal development and disease states in a more in-vivo like context.  Three-dimensional neural models or cerebral organoids possess an innate advantage over two-dimensional neural cultures as they can recapitulate tissue organization and cell type diversity that resemble the developing brain.  Brain organoids also provide the exciting opportunity to model the integration of different brain regions in vitro.  Furthermore, recent advances in the differentiation of non-neuronal tissue from stem cells provides the opportunity to study the interaction between the developing nervous system and other non-neuronal systems that impact neuronal function.  In this review, we discuss the potential and limitations of the organoid system to study in vitro neurological diseases that arise in the neuroendocrine and the enteric nervous system or from interactions with the immune system.

Awe is an emotional response to perceptually vast stimuli that transcend current frames of reference. Narrative and experimental work has characterized two distinct variants of awe: positive and negative; however, little is known about the structural neural basis associated with the differences of these two variants of awe. In this study, we investigated the structural neural basis of positive and negative awe underlying individual differences among 62 young healthy adults. Specifically, we assessed the association between regional gray matter volume (rGMV) and the two different variants of awe using the voxel-based morphometry (VBM). A partial correlation analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between rGMV and behavioral positive and negative awe, while controlling for sex, age and total GMV. VBM indicated that positive awe was positively correlated with GMV in the precuneus, and negatively correlated with GMV in the left fusiform and the right calcarine. Negative awe was negatively correlated with GMV in the left and right insula, and the left superior temporal gyrus. These results provide a neural explanation for the differences of these two variants of awe.

Based on stimulation with plaid patterns, neurons in the Middle Temporal (MT) area of primate visual cortex are divided into two types: pattern and component cells. The prevailing theory suggests that pattern selectivity results from the summation of the outputs of component cells as part of a hierarchical visual pathway. We present a computational model of the visual pathway from primary visual cortex (V1) to MT that suggests an alternate model where the progression from component to pattern selectivity is not required. Using standard orientation-selective V1 cells, end-stopped V1 cells, and V1 cells with extra-classical receptive fields (RFs) as inputs to MT, the model shows that the degree of pattern or component preference in MT could arise from the relative strengths of the three V1 input types. Dominance of end-stopped V1 neurons in the model leads to pattern selectivity in MT, while dominance of V1 cells with extra-classical RFs result in component selectivity. This model may assist in designing experiments to further understand motion processing mechanisms in primate MT.

Gamma frequency oscillations (γ, 30–100 Hz) have been suggested to underlie various cognitive and motor functions. Methamphetamine (MA), a commonly used recreational drug, enhances brain γ oscillations associated with changes in psychomotor state. Little is known about the cellular mechanism of MA modulation on γ oscillations. We explored the effects of multiple intracellular kinases on MA modulation of γ oscillations in rat hippocampal CA3 area induced by kainate. We found that dopamine receptor 2 (DR2) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists prevented the enhancing effect of MA on γ oscillation, whereas none of them affected baseline γ oscillation strength. Dopamine receptor 1 (DR1) antagonist and the serine/threonine kinase PKB/Akt inhibitor alone increased γ oscillations but prevented MA enhancement of γ. Protein kinase A, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK) inhibitors had no effect on MA. We propose that the DR1/DR2-Akt-NMDAR pathway play a critical role for the MA enhancement of γ oscillations. Our study provides an insight into the mechanism of acute MA on brain function and a clue for the intervention of MA addiction.

Electroacupuncture (EA) pretreatment is a clinically useful therapy for several brain disorders. However, whether and via which exact molecular mechanisms it ameliorates posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) remains unclear. In the present study, rats received EA stimulation for 7 consecutive days before exposure to enhanced single prolonged stress (ESPS). Anxiety-like and fear learning behaviors; hippocampal neurogenesis; the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (keap1), and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1); and the activity of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) were evaluated at 14 days after ESPS. EA pretreatment improved hippocampal neurogenesis and ameliorated anxiety-like behaviors in ESPS-treated rats. EA pretreatment also increased the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 and the activity of AMPK. Furthermore, Nrf2 knockdown by a short hairpin RNA affected anxiety-like behaviors and expression of neuroprotective markers (BDNF, DCX) in a manner similar to ESPS alone and dampened the neuroprotective effects of EA pretreatment. In contrast, Keap1 knockdown increased the expression of HO-1, improved hippocampal neurogenesis, and alleviated PTSD-like behaviors. Altogether, our results suggest that EA pretreatment ameliorates ESPS-induced anxiety-like behaviors and prevents hippocampal neurogenesis disruption in a rat model of PTSD possibly through regulation of the keap1/Nrf2 antioxidant defense pathway.

Following action potential invasion in presynaptic terminals, synaptic vesicles are released in a stochastic manner at release sites (docking sites). Since neurotransmission occurs at frequencies up to 1 kHz, the mechanisms underlying consecutive vesicle releases at a docking site during high frequency bursts is a key factor for understanding the role and strength of the synapse. Particularly new vesicle recruitment at the docking site during neuronal activity is thought to be crucial for short-term plasticity. However current studies have not reached a unified docking site model for central synapses. Here I review newly developed analyses that can provide insight into docking site models. Quantal analysis using counts of vesicular release events provide a wealth of information not only to monitor the number of docking sites, but also to distinguish among docking site models. The stochastic properties of cumulative release number during bursts allow us to estimate the total number of releasable vesicles and to deduce the features of vesicle recruitment at docking sites and the change of release probability during bursts. This analytical method may contribute to a comprehensive understanding of release/replenishment mechanisms at a docking site.

Mapping the neural circuit facilitates understanding the brain’s working mechanism. Pseudorabies virus (Bartha stain) as a tracer can infect neurons and retrogradely transport in neural circuits. To illuminate the network, tracers express reporter genes at high level are needed. In this study, we optimized the expression level of reporter gene, and constructed two new retrograde trans-multisynaptic tracers PRV531 and PRV724，which separately expresses more robust green and red fluorescent proteins than the existing retrograde tracers PRV152 and PRV614. The PRV531 and PRV724 can be used for mapping the neural circuit of central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. Overall, our work adds two valuable tracers into the toolbox for mapping neural circuit.

The discouraging results with therapies for Alzheimer´s disease (AD) in clinical trials, highlights the urgent need to adopt new approaches. Like other complex diseases, it is becoming clear that AD therapies should focus on the simultaneous modulation of several targets implicated in the disease. Recently, using reference compounds and the first-in class CM-414, we demonstrated that the simultaneous inhibition of histone deacetylases (class I HDACs and HDAC6) and phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) has a synergistic therapeutic effect in AD models. To identify the best inhibitory balance of HDAC isoforms and PDEs that provides a safe and efficient therapy to combat AD, we tested the compound CM-695 in the Tg2576 mouse model of this disease. CM-695 selectively inhibits HDAC6 over class I HDAC isoforms, which largely overcomes the toxicity associated with HDAC class 1 inhibition. Furthermore, CM-695 inhibits PDE9, which is expressed strongly in the brain and has been proposed as a therapeutic target for AD. Chronic treatment of aged Tg2576 mice with CM-695 ameliorates memory impairment and diminishes brain Aβ, although its therapeutic effect was no longer apparent 4 weeks after the treatment was interrupted. An increase in the presence of GRP78 and Hsp70 chaperones may underlie the therapeutic effect of CM-695. In summary, chronic treatment with CM-695 appears to reverse the AD phenotype in a safe and effective manner. Taking into account that AD is a multifactorial disorder, the multimodal action of these compounds and the different events they affect may open new avenues to combat AD.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/48594">Functional divergence of Plexin B structural motifs in distinct steps of <i>Drosophila</i> olfactory circuit assembly</a></h4>

Plexins exhibit multitudinous, evolutionarily conserved functions in neural development. How Plexins employ their diverse structural motifs <i>in vivo</i> to perform distinct roles is unclear. We previously reported that Plexin B (PlexB) controls multiple steps during the assembly of the <i>Drosophila</i> olfactory circuit (Li et al., 2018). Here, we systematically mutagenized structural motifs of PlexB and examined the function of these variants in these multiple steps: axon fasciculation, trajectory choice, and synaptic partner selection. We found that the extracellular Sema domain is essential for all three steps, the catalytic site of the intracellular RapGAP is engaged in none, and the intracellular GTPase-binding motifs are essential for trajectory choice and synaptic partner selection, but are dispensable for fasciculation. Moreover, extracellular PlexB cleavage serves as a regulatory mechanism of PlexB signaling. Thus, the divergent roles of PlexB motifs in distinct steps of neural development contribute to its functional versatility in neural circuit assembly.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/47300">Molecular determinants in Frizzled, Reck, and Wnt7a for ligand-specific signaling in neurovascular development</a></h4>

The molecular basis of Wnt-Frizzled specificity is a central question in developmental biology. Reck, a multi-domain and multi-functional glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein, specifically enhances beta-catenin signaling by Wnt7a and Wnt7b in cooperation with the 7-transmembrane protein Gpr124. Among amino acids that distinguish Wnt7a and Wnt7b from other Wnts, two clusters are essential for signaling in a Reck- and Gpr124-dependent manner. Both clusters are far from the site of Frizzled binding: one resides at the amino terminus and the second resides in a protruding loop. Within Reck, the fourth of five tandem repeats of an unusual domain with six-cysteines (the CC domain) is essential for Wnt7a stimulation: substitutions P256A and W261A in CC4 eliminate this activity without changing protein abundance or surface localization. Mouse embryos carrying <i>Reck<sup>P256A,W261A</sup></i> have severe defects in forebrain angiogenesis, providing the strongest evidence to date that Reck promotes CNS angiogenesis by specifically stimulating Wnt7a and Wnt7b signaling.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/46359">Voluntary and involuntary contributions to perceptually guided saccadic choices resolved with millisecond precision</a></h4>

In the antisaccade task, which is considered a sensitive assay of cognitive 1 function, a salient visual cue appears and the participant must look away from it. This requires sensory, motor-planning, and cognitive neural mechanisms, but what are their unique contributions to performance, and when exactly are they engaged? Here, by manipulating task urgency, we generate a psychophysical curve that tracks the evolution of the saccadic choice process with millisec ond precision, and resolve the distinct contributions of reflexive (exogenous) and voluntary (endogenous) perceptual mechanisms to antisaccade performance over time. Both progress extremely rapidly, the former driving the eyes toward the cue early on (∼100 ms after cue onset) and the latter directing them away from the cue ∼40 ms later. The behavioral and modeling results provide a detailed, dynamical characterization of attentional and oculomotor capture that is not only qualitatively consistent across participants, but also indicative of their individual perceptual capacities.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/46313">A dedicated diribonucleotidase resolves a key bottleneck as the terminal step of RNA degradation</a></h4>

Degradation of RNA polymers, an ubiquitous process in all cells, is catalyzed by specific subsets of endo- and exoribonucleases that together recycle RNA fragments into nucleotide monophosphate. In γ-proteobacteria, 3-'5' exoribonucleases comprise up to eight distinct enzymes. Among them, Oligoribonuclease (Orn) is unique as its activity is required for clearing short RNA fragments, which is important for cellular fitness. However, the molecular basis of Orn's unique cellular function remained unclear. Here we show that Orn exhibits exquisite substrate preference for diribonucleotides. Crystal structures of substrate-bound Orn reveal an active site optimized for diribonucleotides. While other cellular RNases process oligoribonucleotides down to diribonucleotide entities, Orn is the one and only diribonucleotidase that completes the terminal step of RNA degradation. Together, our studies indicate RNA degradation as a step-wise process with a dedicated enzyme for the clearance of a specific intermediate pool, diribonucleotides, that affects cellular physiology and viability.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44736">Scc2 counteracts a Wapl-independent mechanism that releases cohesin from chromosomes during G1</a></h4>

Cohesin’s association with chromosomes is determined by loading dependent on the Scc2/4 complex and release due to Wapl. We show here that Scc2 also actively maintains cohesin on chromosomes during G1 in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> cells. It does so by blocking a Wapl-independent release reaction that requires opening the cohesin ring at its Smc3/Scc1 interface as well as the D loop of Smc1’s ATPase. The Wapl-independent release mechanism is switched off as cells activate Cdk1 and enter G2/M and cannot be turned back on without cohesin’s dissociation from chromosomes. The latter phenomenon enabled us to show that in the absence of release mechanisms, cohesin rings that have already captured DNA in a Scc2-dependent manner before replication no longer require Scc2 to capture sister DNAs during S phase.

<p>by Ibrahim Cheddadi, Michel Génard, Nadia Bertin, Christophe Godin</p>

The growth of plant organs is a complex process powered by osmosis that attracts water inside the cells; this influx induces simultaneously an elastic extension of the walls and pressure in the cells, called turgor pressure; above a threshold, the walls yield and the cells grow. Based on Lockhart’s seminal work, various models of plant morphogenesis have been proposed, either for single cells, or focusing on the wall mechanical properties. However, the synergistic coupling of fluxes and wall mechanics has not yet been fully addressed in a multicellular model. This work lays the foundations of such a model, by simplifying as much as possible each process and putting emphasis on the coupling itself. Its emergent properties are rich and can help to understand plant morphogenesis. In particular, we show that the model can display a new type of lateral inhibitory mechanism that amplifies growth heterogeneities due <i>e.g</i> to cell wall loosening.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hpu-hF3vo6U" width="1" />

<p>by Ruth Nussinov, Chung-Jung Tsai, Hyunbum Jang</p>

Classically, phenotype is what is observed, and genotype is the genetic makeup. Statistical studies aim to project phenotypic likelihoods of genotypic patterns. The traditional genotype-to-phenotype theory embraces the view that the encoded protein shape together with gene expression level largely determines the resulting phenotypic trait. Here, we point out that the molecular biology revolution at the turn of the century explained that the gene encodes not one but ensembles of conformations, which in turn spell all possible gene-associated phenotypes. The significance of a dynamic ensemble view is in understanding the linkage between genetic change and the gained observable physical or biochemical characteristics. Thus, despite the transformative shift in our understanding of the basis of protein structure and function, the literature still commonly relates to the classical genotype–phenotype paradigm. This is important because an ensemble view clarifies how even seemingly small genetic alterations can lead to pleiotropic traits in adaptive evolution and in disease, why cellular pathways can be modified in monogenic and polygenic traits, and how the environment may tweak protein function.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lMqu8pt7LN8" width="1" />

ABSTRACT<p>In mammalian olfaction, inhalation drives the temporal patterning of neural activity that underlies early olfactory processing. It remains poorly understood how the neural circuits that process incoming olfactory information are engaged in the context of inhalation-linked dynamics. Here, we used artificial inhalation and two-photon calcium imaging to compare the dynamics of activity evoked by odorant inhalation across major cell types of the mouse olfactory bulb (OB). We expressed GCaMP6f or jRGECO1a in mitral and tufted cell subpopulations, olfactory sensory neurons, and two major juxtaglomerular interneuron classes, and imaged responses to a single inhalation of odorant. Activity in all cell types was strongly linked to inhalation, and all cell types showed some variance in the latency, rise-times, and durations of their inhalation-linked response. Juxtaglomerular interneuron dynamics closely matched that of sensory inputs, while mitral and tufted cells showed the highest diversity in responses, with a range of latencies and durations that could not be accounted for by heterogeneity in sensory input dynamics. Diversity was apparent even among 'sister' tufted cells innervating the same glomerulus. Surprisingly, inhalation-linked responses of mitral and tufted cells were highly overlapping and could not be distinguished on the basis of their inhalation-linked dynamics, with the exception of a subpopulation of superficial tufted cells expressing cholecystokinin. Our results are consistent with a model in which diversity in inhalation-linked patterning of OB output arises first at the level of sensory input and is enhanced by feedforward inhibition from juxtaglomerular interneurons which differentially impact different subpopulations of OB output neurons.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Inhalation drives the temporal patterning of neural activity that underlies olfactory processing and rapid odor perception, yet the dynamics of the neural circuit elements mediating this processing are poorly understood. By comparing inhalation-linked dynamics of major olfactory bulb subpopulations, we find that diversity in the timing of neural activation arises at the level of sensory input, which is then mirrored by inhibitory interneurons in the glomerular layer. Temporal diversity is higher among olfactory bulb output neurons, with different subpopulations showing distinct but nonetheless highly overlapping ranges of inhalation-linked dynamics. These results implicate feedforward inhibition by glomerular-layer interneurons in diversifying temporal responses among output neurons, which may be important for generating and shaping timing-based odor representations during natural odor sampling.</p>

Abstract<p>The future of medicine lies in disease modification and prevention. The science of preclinical detection is young, but moving rapidly. Preclinical interventions offer the hope to decrease the severity of a disease or delay the development of a disorder substantially. With such promise, the research and practice of detecting brain disorders at a preclinical stage present unique ethical challenges, challenges that must be addressed to ensure the benefit of these technologies. Direct brain interventions have potential to impact not just what a patient has but who they are and who they could become. Further receiving an assessment for a preclinical or prodromal state has potential to impact perceptions about capacity, autonomy and personhood and could become entangled with stigma and discrimination. Discussion of the risks and benefits of the emerging technology will focus on how to ensure beneficence by presenting the limitations of preclinical detection and by contextualizing the risk associated with preclinical status. Exploring ethical issues alongside and integrated into the experimental design and research of these technologies is critical. This review will highlight ethical issues attendant to the current and near future states of preclinical detection across the life span, specifically as it relates to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, and Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Preclinical interventions in developing brain disorders offer the strongest promise of delaying, modifying, or preventing the development of clinical disorders. Although promising, intervening at early stages in disorders inherently linked to identity and personhood presents unique ethical challenges. These challenges must be addressed before the practices are implemented. Both the treatment and the diagnosis itself have the potential to profoundly impact patients. We contextualize the risk of diagnosing preclinical states and present the limitations of preclinical interventions to guide research and policy as the field of preclinical detection rapidly expands.</p>

Abstract<p>Learning results in various forms of neuronal plasticity that provide a lasting representation of past events, and understanding the mechanisms supporting lasting memories has been a primary pursuit of the neurobiological study of memory. However, learning also alters the capacity for future learning, an observation that likely reflects its adaptive significance. In the laboratory we can study this essential property of memory by assessing how prior experience alters the capacity for subsequent learning. Previous studies have indicated that while a single weak fear conditioning trial is insufficient to support long-term memory, it can facilitate future learning such that another trial delivered within a protracted time window results in a robust memory. Here, we sought to determine whether or not manipulating neural activity in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) using designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) during or after the initial learning trial would affect the ability of the initial trial to facilitate subsequent learning. Our results show that inhibiting the BLA in rats prior to the first trial prevented the ability of that trial to facilitate learning when a second trial was presented the next day. Inhibition of the BLA immediately after the first trial using DREADDs was not effective, nor was pharmacological inhibition of protein kinase A or the mitogen activated protein kinase. These findings indicate that the neural mechanisms that permit an initial subthreshold fear conditioning trial to alter later learning develop rapidly and do not appear to require a typical post-learning consolidation period.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Laboratory studies of memory are typically designed to identify mechanisms that allow the brain to represent past experience. The purpose of this ability is likely so that prior learning can direct future behavior, however studies are most often focused on the storage aspects of memory and less on how later experience is altered. We used a fear conditioning paradigm in which a single trial, subthreshold for producing long-term behavioral change, primes future learning when a second trial is later encountered. Neural activity in the amygdala was required for long-term memory priming, however post-training disruption of neural activity or cell signaling events had no effect. These results provide insight into the mechanisms that allow prior aversive experience to modify new learning.</p>

<p>Reflex epilepsies have been demonstrated to exploit specific networks that subserve normal physiological function. It is unclear whether more common forms of epilepsy share this particular feature. By measuring interictal spikes in patients with a range of epilepsies, we show that 2 tasks known to specifically engage the hippocampus and temporal neocortex promoted increased interictal spiking within these regions, whereas a nonhippocampal dependent task did not. This indicates that interictal spike frequency may reflect the processing demands being placed on specific functional–anatomical networks in epilepsy. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

We have recently demonstrated that sciatic nerve injury increases the expression of spinal cytochrome P450c17, a key neurosteroidogenic enzyme, which plays a critical role in the development of peripheral neuropathic pain. However, the modulatory mechanisms responsible for the expression of spinal P450c17 have yet to be examined. Here we investigated the possible involvement of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in altering P450c17 expression during the induction phase of neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain was produced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the right sciatic nerve in mice and mechanical allodynia was evaluated in the hind paws using a von-Frey filament (0.16 g). Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were performed to assess the expression of spinal IL-1β, interleukin-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1), P450c17, and GFAP. Spinal IL-1β was significantly increased on day 1 post-surgery and its receptor, IL-1R1 was expressed in GFAP-positive astrocytes. Intrathecal administration of the recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra, 20 ng) on days 0 and 1 post-surgery enhanced GFAP expression on day 1 post-surgery and induced an early increase in P450c17 expression in astrocytes, but not in neurons. Administration of IL-1β (10 ng) on days 0 and 1 post-surgery blocked the enhancement of both spinal P450c17 and GFAP expression induced by IL-1ra (20 ng) administration. Intrathecal administration of IL-1ra (20 ng) on days 0 to 3 post-surgery also facilitated the CCI-induced development of mechanical allodynia, and this early developed pain was dose-dependently attenuated by the administration of the P450c17 inhibitor, ketoconazole (1, 3 or 10 nmol) or the astrocyte metabolic inhibitor, fluorocitrate (0.01, 0.03 or 0.1 nmol). These results demonstrate that early increases in spinal IL-1β temporally inhibit astrocyte P450c17 expression and astrocyte activation ultimately controlling the development of mechanical allodynia induced by peripheral nerve injury. These findings imply that spinal IL-1β plays an important role as an early, but transient, control mechanism in the development of peripheral neuropathic pain via the inhibition of astrocyte P450c17 expression and astrocyte activation.

In the last few decades, brain functional connectivity (FC) has been extensively assessed using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI), which is able to identify temporally correlated brain regions known as RS functional networks. Fundamental insights into the pathophysiology of several neurodegenerative conditions have been provided by studies in this field. However, most of these studies are based on the assumption of temporal stationarity of RS functional networks, despite recent evidence suggests that the spatial patterns of RS networks may change periodically over the time of an fMRI scan acquisition. For this reason, dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analysis has been recently implemented and proposed in order to consider the temporal fluctuations of FC. These approaches hold promise to provide fundamental information for the identification of pathophysiological and diagnostic markers in the vast field of neurodegenerative diseases. This review summarizes the main currently available approaches for dFC analysis and reports their recent applications for the assessment of the most common neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and frontotemporal dementia. Critical state-of-the-art findings, limitations, and future perspectives regarding the analysis of dFC in these diseases are provided from both a clinical and a technical point of view.

Increasing evidence links proteins of the S100 family to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). S100 proteins are EF-hand calcium-binding proteins with intra- and extracellular functions related to regulation of proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and trace metal homeostasis, and are important modulators of inflammatory responses. For example, S100A6, S100A8 and S100B expression levels were found increased in inflammatory diseases, but also neurodegenerative disorders, and S100A8/A9 complexes may provide a mechanistic link between amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaque formation and neuroinflammation. On the other hand, S100B, a proinflammatory protein that is chronically up-regulated in AD and whose elevation precedes plaque formation, was recently shown to suppress Aβ aggregation. Here, we report expression of S100A6 and S100B in astrocytes and less so in neurons, and low level of expression of S100A8 in both neurons and glial cells in vitro. In vivo, S100A8 expression is almost absent in the brain of aged wildtype mice, while S100A6 and S100B are expressed in all brain regions and most prominently in the cortex and cerebellum. S100B seems to be enriched in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. In contrast, in the brain of APP23 mice, a mouse model for Alzheimer’s disease, S100B, S100A6 and S100A8 show co-localization with Aβ plaques, compatible with astrocyte activation, and the expression level of S100A8 is increased in neural cells. While S100A6 and S100B are enriched in the periphery of plaques where less fibrillar Aβ is found, S100A8 is more intense within the center of the inclusion. In vitro assays show that, similarly to S100B, S100A6 and S100A8 also delay Aβ aggregation suggesting a regulatory action over protein aggregation. We posit that elevated expression levels and overlapping spatial distribution of brain S100 proteins and plaques translates functional relationships between these inflammatory mediators and AD pathophysiology processes that uncover important molecular mechanisms linking the aggregation and neuroinflammation cascades.

Cultural attachment (CA) refers to processes that allow culture and its symbols to provide psychological security when facing threat. Epistemologically, although we currently have an adequate predictivist model of CA, it is necessary to prepare for a mechanistic approach that will not only predict, but also explain CA phenomena. Towards that direction, we first examine the concepts and mechanisms that are the building blocks of both prototypical maternal attachment and CA. Based on existing robust neuroscience models we associate these concepts and mechanisms with bona fide neurobiological functions to advance an integrative neurobiological model of CA. We end by discussing the unresolved relationship of CA to other similar socio-cognitive concepts. The aim of the paper is to highlight the importance of integrating CA theory into computational approaches to culture and evolution (such as predictive processing computations explaining niche construction) as this will allow a dynamic interpretation of cultural processes.

Age-related changes in visual function and retina structure are very common in aged animals, but the underlying mechanisms of these changes remain unclear. Here we report that the expression of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), a critical immune regulatory factor, is dramatically down-regulated in mouse retinas during aging. To address the role of IRF3 in the retina, we examined the structure and function of retinas in young (3-4 months) and old (22-24 months) Irf3-/- mice in comparison to age-matched wildtype (WT) mice. We found that IRF3 deletion resulted in impaired electroretinogram (ERG) responses and decreased retinal thickness in both young and old mice. In addition, numerous synapses of the outer plexiform layer (OPL) were found obviously extending into outer nuclear layer (ONL) in Irf3-/- mice, along with a reduction of the average synapse density in the OPL. These changes suggest that IRF3 deletion may accelerate retinal senescence. In support of this hypothesis, a number of classic senescence-associated markers were found in remarkably elevated level in Irf3-/- retina, including p53, p16INK4a, inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IREα), p-H2A.X and promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML). Overall, our results indicate that maintenance normal IRF3 levels is necessary for retinal structure and function and suggest that IRF3 is an important regulator of retinal senescence.

Despite subjective cognitive decline (SCD), a preclinical stage of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), being widely studied in recent years, studies on centrality frequency in individuals with SCD are lacking. This study aimed to investigate the differences in centrality frequency between individuals with SCD and normal controls (NCs). Forty individuals with SCD and fifty-three well-matched NCs underwent a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. We assessed individual dynamic functional connectivity using sliding window correlations. In each time window, brain regions with a high degree centrality were defined as hubs. Across the entire time window, the proportion of time that the hub appeared was characterized as centrality frequency. The centrality frequency correlated with cognitive performance differently in individuals with SCD and NCs. Our results revealed that in individuals with SCD, compared with NCs, correlations between centrality frequency of the anterior cortical regions and cognitive performance decreased (79.2% for NCs and 43.5% for individuals with SCD). In contrast, correlations between centrality frequency of the posterior cortical regions and cognitive performance increased in SCD individuals compared with NCs (20.8% for NCs and 56.5% for individuals with SCD). Moreover, the changes mainly focused on the anterior (93.3% for NCs and45.5% for individuals with SCD) and posterior (6.7% for NCs and 54.5% for individuals with SCD) regions associated with the default mode network (DMN). In addition, we used absolute thresholds (correlation efficient r = 0.2, 0.25) and proportional thresholds (sparsity = 0.2, 0.25) to verify the results. Dynamic results are relative stable at absolute thresholds while static results are relative stable at proportional thresholds. Converging findings provide a new framework for the detection of the changes occurring in individuals with SCD via centrality frequency of the DMN.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has indicated disruptions in functional connectivity in older adults (OA) relative to young adults (YA). While age differences in cortical networks are well studied, differences in subcortical networks are poorly understood. Both the cerebellum and the basal ganglia are of particular interest given their role in cognitive and motor functions, and work in nonhuman primates has demonstrated direct reciprocal connections between these regions. Here, our goal was twofold. First, we were interested in delineating connectivity patterns between distinct regions of the cerebellum and basal ganglia, known to have topologically distinct connectivity patterns with cortex. Our second goal was to quantify age differences in these cerebellar–striatal circuits. We performed a targeted rs-fMRI analysis of the cerebellum and basal ganglia in 33 YA and 31 OA individuals. In the YA, we found significant connectivity both within and between the cerebellum and basal ganglia, in patterns supporting semi-discrete circuits that may differentially subserve motor and cognitive performance. We found a shift in connectivity, from one of synchrony in YA, to asynchrony in OA, resulting in substantial age differences. Connectivity was also associated with behavior. These findings significantly advance our understanding of cerebellar–basal ganglia interactions in the human brain.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Auditory attention operates through top-down (TD) and bottom-up (BU) mechanisms that are supported by dorsal and ventral brain networks, respectively, with the main overlap in the lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC). A good TD/BU balance is essential to be both task-efficient and aware of our environment, yet it is rarely investigated. Oscillatory activity is a novel method to probe the attentional dynamics with evidence that gamma activity (&gt;30 Hz) could signal BU processing and thus would be a good candidate to support the activation of the ventral BU attention network. Magnetoencephalography data were collected from 21 young adults performing the competitive attention task, which enables simultaneous investigation of BU and TD attentional mechanisms. Distracting sounds elicited an increase in gamma activity in regions of the BU ventral network. TD attention modulated these gamma responses in regions of the inhibitory cognitive control system: the medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices. Finally, distracting-sound-induced gamma activity was synchronous between the auditory cortices and several distant brain regions, notably the lPFC. We provide novel insight into the role of gamma activity 1) in supporting the activation of the ventral BU attention network and 2) in subtending the TD/BU attention balance in the PFC.</span>

fear-learning models posit that amygdala–infralimbic connections facilitate extinction while amygdala–prelimbic prefrontal connections mediate fear expression. Analogous amygdala–prefrontal circuitry between rodents and primates is not established. Using paired small volumes of neural tracers injected into the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC; areas 24b and 32; a potential homologue to rodent prelimbic cortex) and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC, areas 25 and 14c; a potential homologue to rodent infralimbic cortex) in a single hemisphere, we mapped amygdala projections to the pgACC and sgACC within single subjects. All injections resulted in dense retrograde labeling specifically within the intermediate division of the basal nucleus (Bi) and the magnocellular division of the accessory basal nucleus (ABmc). Areal analysis revealed a bias for connectivity with the sgACC, with the ABmc showing a greater bias than the Bi. Double fluorescence analysis revealed that sgACC and pgACC projections were intermingled within the Bi and ABmc, where a proportion were double labeled. We conclude that amygdala inputs to the ACC largely originate from the Bi and ABmc, preferentially connect to the sgACC, and that a subset collaterally project to both sgACC and pgACC. These findings advance our understanding of fear extinction and fear expression circuitry across species. </span>

<p>by Benedict Borer, Meriç Ataman, Vassily Hatzimanikatis, Dani Or</p>

Natural soil is characterized as a complex habitat with patchy hydrated islands and spatially variable nutrients that is in a constant state of change due to wetting-drying dynamics. Soil microbial activity is often concentrated in sparsely distributed hotspots that contribute disproportionally to macroscopic biogeochemical nutrient cycling and greenhouse gas emissions. The mechanistic representation of such dynamic hotspots requires new modeling approaches capable of representing the interplay between dynamic local conditions and the versatile microbial metabolic adaptations. We have developed IndiMeSH (Individual-based Metabolic network model for Soil Habitats) as a spatially explicit model for the physical and chemical microenvironments of soil, combined with an individual-based representation of bacterial motility and growth using adaptive metabolic networks. The model uses angular pore networks and a physically based description of the aqueous phase as a backbone for nutrient diffusion and bacterial dispersal combined with dynamic flux balance analysis to calculate growth rates depending on local nutrient conditions. To maximize computational efficiency, reduced scale metabolic networks are used for the simulation scenarios and evaluated strategically to the genome scale model. IndiMeSH was compared to a well-established population-based spatiotemporal metabolic network model (COMETS) and to experimental data of bacterial spatial organization in pore networks mimicking soil aggregates. IndiMeSH was then used to strategically study dynamic response of a bacterial community to abrupt environmental perturbations and the influence of habitat geometry and hydration conditions. Results illustrate that IndiMeSH is capable of representing trophic interactions among bacterial species, predicting the spatial organization and segregation of bacterial populations due to oxygen and carbon gradients, and provides insights into dynamic community responses as a consequence of environmental changes. The modular design of IndiMeSH and its implementation are adaptable, allowing it to represent a wide variety of experimental and <i>in silico</i> microbial systems.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OfVu8--GqEQ" width="1" />

<p>Reelin (Reln) and Disabled-1 (Dab1) participate in the Reln-signaling pathway and when either is deleted, mutant mice have the same spinally mediated behavioral abnormalities, increased sensitivity to noxious heat and a profound loss in mechanical sensitivity. Both Reln and Dab1 are highly expressed in dorsal horn areas that receive and convey nociceptive information, Laminae I–II, lateral Lamina V, and the lateral spinal nucleus (LSN). Lamina I contains both projection neurons and interneurons that express Neurokinin-1 receptors (NK1Rs) and they transmit information about noxious heat both within the dorsal horn and to the brain. Here, we ask whether the increased heat nociception in <i>Reln</i> and <i>dab1</i> mutants is due to incorrectly positioned dorsal horn neurons that express NK1Rs. We found more NK1R-expressing neurons in <i>Reln<sup>-/-</sup></i> and <i>dab1<sup>-/-</sup></i> Laminae I–II than in their respective wild-type mice, and some NK1R neurons co-expressed Dab1 and the transcription factor Lmx1b, confirming their excitatory phenotype. Importantly, heat stimulation in <i>dab1<sup>-/-</sup> </i>mice induced Fos in incorrectly positioned NK1R neurons in Laminae I–II. Next, we asked whether these ectopically placed and noxious-heat responsive NK1R neurons participated in pain behavior. Ablation of the superficial NK1Rs with an intrathecal injection of a substance P analog conjugated to the toxin saporin (SSP-SAP) eliminated the thermal hypersensitivity of <i>dab1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice, without altering their mechanical insensitivity. These results suggest that ectopically positioned NK1R-expressing neurons underlie the heat hyperalgesia of Reelin-signaling pathway mutants, but do not contribute to their profound mechanical insensitivity.</p>

<p>Although 60% of the US population have tried smoking cigarettes, only 16% smoke regularly. Identifying this susceptible subset of the population before the onset of nicotine dependence may encourage targeted early interventions to prevent regular smoking and/or minimize severity. While prospective neuroimaging in human populations can be challenging, preclinical neuroimaging models before chronic nicotine administration can help to develop translational biomarkers of disease risk. Chronic, intermittent nicotine (0, 1.2, or 4.8 mg/kg/d; <i>N</i> = 10–11/group) was administered to male Sprague Dawley rats for 14 d; dependence severity was quantified using precipitated withdrawal behaviors collected before, during, and following forced nicotine abstinence. Resting-state fMRI functional connectivity (FC) before drug administration was subjected to a graph theory analytical framework to form a predictive model of subsequent individual differences in nicotine dependence. Whole-brain modularity analysis identified five modules in the rat brain. A metric of intermodule connectivity, participation coefficient, of an identified insular–frontal cortical module predicted subsequent dependence severity, independent of nicotine dose. To better spatially isolate this effect, this module was subjected to a secondary exploratory modularity analysis, which segregated it into three submodules (frontal-motor, insular, and sensory). Higher FC among these three submodules and three of the five originally identified modules (striatal, frontal-executive, and sensory association) also predicted dependence severity. These data suggest that predispositional, intrinsic differences in circuit strength between insular-frontal-based brain networks before drug exposure may identify those at highest risk for the development of nicotine dependence.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Developing biomarkers of individuals at high risk for addiction before the onset of this brain-based disease is essential for prevention, early intervention, and/or subsequent treatment decisions. Using a rodent model of nicotine dependence and a novel data-driven, network-based analysis of resting-state fMRI data collected before drug exposure, functional connections centered on an intrinsic insular-frontal module predicted the severity of nicotine dependence after drug exposure. The predictive capacity of baseline network measures was specific to inter-regional but not within-region connectivity. While insular and frontal regions have consistently been implicated in nicotine dependence, this is the first study to reveal that innate, individual differences in their circuit strength have the predictive capacity to identify those at greatest risk for and resilience to drug dependence.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/25/5018?rss=1">White Matter Microstructure Reflects Individual Differences in Music Reward Sensitivity</a></h4>

<p>People show considerable variability in the degree of pleasure they experience from music. These individual differences in music reward sensitivity are driven by variability in functional connectivity between the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), a key structure of the reward system, and the right superior temporal gyrus (STG). However, it is unknown whether a neuroanatomical basis exists for this variability. We used diffusion tensor imaging and probabilistic tractography to study the relationship between music reward sensitivity and white matter microstructure connecting these two regions via the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in 38 healthy human participants (24 females and 14 males). We found that right axial diffusivity (AD) in the STG–OFC connectivity inversely correlated with music reward sensitivity. Additionally, right mean diffusivity and left AD in the NAcc-OFC tract also showed an inverse correlation. Further, AD in this tract also correlated with previously acquired BOLD activity during music listening, but not for a control monetary reward task in the NAcc. Finally, we used mediation analysis to show that AD in the NAcc–OFC tract explains the influence of NAcc activation during a music task on music reward sensitivity. Overall, our results provide further support for the idea that the exchange of information among perceptual, integrative, and reward systems is important for musical pleasure, and that individual differences in the structure of the relevant anatomical connectivity influences the degree to which people are able to derive such pleasure.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Music is one of the most important sources of pleasure for many people, but at the same time there are important individual differences in the sensitivity to musical reward. Previous studies have revealed the critical involvement of the functional connectivity between perceptual and subcortical brain areas in the enjoyment of music. However, it is unknown whether individual differences in music sensitivity might arise from variability in the structural connectivity among these areas. Here we show that structural connectivity between supratemporal and orbitofrontal cortices, and between orbitofrontal and nucleus accumbens, predict individual differences in sensibility to music reward. These results provide evidence for the critical involvement of the interaction between the subcortical reward system and higher-order cortical areas in music-induced pleasure.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/25/5010?rss=1">Reward Prediction Error Modulates Saccade Vigor</a></h4>

<p>Movement vigor, defined as the reciprocal of the latency from availability of reward to its acquisition, changes with reward magnitude: movements exhibit shorter reaction time and increased velocity when they are directed toward more rewarding stimuli. This invigoration may be due to release of dopamine before movement onset, which has been shown to be modulated by events that signal reward prediction error (RPE). Here, we generated an RPE event in the milliseconds before movement onset and tested whether there was a relationship between RPE and vigor. Human subjects (both sexes) made saccades toward an image. During execution of the primary saccade, we probabilistically changed the position and content of that image, encouraging a secondary saccade. On some trials, the content of the secondary image was more valuable than the first image, resulting in a positive RPE (+RPE) event that preceded the secondary saccade. On other trials, this content was less valuable (–RPE event). We found that reaction time of the secondary saccade was affected in an orderly fashion by the magnitude and direction of the preceding RPE event: the most vigorous saccades followed the largest +RPE, whereas the least vigorous saccades followed the largest –RPE. Presence of the secondary saccade indicated that the primary saccade had experienced a movement error, inducing trial-to-trial adaptation. However, this learning from movement error was not modulated by the RPE event. The data suggest that RPE events, which are thought to transiently alter the release of dopamine, modulate the vigor of the ensuing movement.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Does dopamine release in response to a stimulus serve to invigorate the ensuing movement? To test this hypothesis, we relied on the fact that reward prediction error (RPE) is a strong modulator of dopamine. Our innovation was a task in which an RPE event occurred precisely before onset of a stimulus-driven movement. We probabilistically produced a combination of large or small, negative or positive RPE events and observed that saccade vigor carried a robust signature of the preceding RPE event: high vigor saccades followed +RPE events, whereas low vigor saccades followed –RPE events. This suggests that in humans, vigor is partly controlled through release of dopamine in the moments before onset of a movement.</p>

<p>Aging is accompanied by cognitive deficits, including impairments in long-term memory formation. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that support preserved cognitive function in aged animals is a critical step toward identifying novel therapeutic targets that could improve memory in aging individuals. One potential mechanism is the <i>Nr4a</i> family of genes, a group of CREB-dependent nuclear orphan receptors that have previously been shown to be important for hippocampal memory formation. Here, using a cross-species approach, we tested the role of <i>Nr4a1</i> and <i>Nr4a2</i> in age-related memory impairments. Using a rat model designed to identify individual differences in age-related memory impairments, we first identified <i>Nr4a2</i> as a key gene that fails to be induced by learning in cognitively impaired male aged rats. Next, using a mouse model that allows for genetic manipulations, we determined that histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) negatively regulates <i>Nr4a2</i> in the aged male and female hippocampus. Finally, we show that overexpression of <i>Nr4a1</i>, <i>Nr4a2</i>, or both transcripts in the male mouse dorsal hippocampus can ameliorate age-related impairments in object location memory. Together, our results suggest that <i>Nr4a2</i> may be a key mechanism that promotes preserved cognitive function in old age, with HDAC3-mediated repression of <i>Nr4a2</i> contributing to age-related cognitive decline. More broadly, these results indicate that therapeutic strategies to promote <i>Nr4a</i> gene expression or function may be an effective strategy to improve cognitive function in old age.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Aging is accompanied by memory impairments, although there is a great deal of variability in the severity of these impairments. Identifying molecular mechanisms that promote preserved memory or participate in cognitive reserve in old age is important to develop strategies that promote healthy cognitive aging. Here, we show that learning-induced expression of the CREB-regulated nuclear receptor gene <i>Nr4a2</i> is selectively impaired in aged rats with memory impairments. Further, we show that <i>Nr4a2</i> is regulated by histone deacetylase HDAC3 in the aged mouse hippocampus. Finally, we demonstrate that hippocampal overexpression of either <i>Nr4a2</i> or its family member, <i>Nr4a1</i>, can ameliorate age-related memory impairments. This suggests that promoting <i>Nr4a</i> expression may be a novel strategy to improve memory in aging individuals.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/25/4986?rss=1">Dynamic Network Activation of Hypothalamic MCH Neurons in REM Sleep and Exploratory Behavior</a></h4>

<p>Most brain neurons are active in waking, but hypothalamic neurons that synthesize the neuropeptide melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) are claimed to be active only during sleep, particularly rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Here we use deep-brain imaging to identify changes in fluorescence of the genetically encoded calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) indicator GCaMP6 in individual hypothalamic neurons that contain MCH. An <i>in vitro</i> electrophysiology study determined a strong relationship between depolarization and Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluorescence in MCH neurons. In 10 freely behaving MCH-cre mice (male and female), the highest fluorescence occurred in all recorded neurons (<i>n</i> = 106) in REM sleep relative to quiet waking or non-REM sleep. Unexpectedly, 70% of the MCH neurons had strong fluorescence activity when the mice explored novel objects. Spatial and temporal mapping of the change in fluorescence between pairs of MCH neurons revealed dynamic activation of MCH neurons during REM sleep and activation of a subset of the same neurons during exploratory behavior. Functional network activity maps will facilitate comparisons of not only single-neuron activity, but also network responses in different conditions and disease.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Functional activity maps identify brain circuits responding to specific behaviors, including rapid eye movement sleep (REM sleep), a sleep phase when the brain is as active as in waking. To provide the first activity map of individual neurons during REM sleep, we use deep-brain calcium imaging in unrestrained mice to map the activity of hypothalamic melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons. MCH neurons were found to be synchronously active during REM sleep, and also during the exploration of novel objects. Spatial mapping revealed dynamic network activation during REM sleep and activation of a subset of the neurons during exploratory behavior. Functional activity maps at the cellular level in specific behaviors, including sleep, are needed to establish a brain connectome.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/25/4976?rss=1">Multifaceted Integration: Memory for Faces Is Subserved by Widespread Connections between Visual, Memory, Auditory, and Social Networks</a></h4>

<p>Our ability to recognize others by their facial features is at the core of human social interaction, yet this ability varies widely within the general population, ranging from developmental prosopagnosia to "super-recognizers". Previous work has focused mainly on the contribution of neural activity within the well described face network to this variance. However, given the nature of face memory in everyday life, and the social context in which it takes place, we were interested in exploring how the collaboration between different networks outside the face network in humans (measured through resting state connectivity) affects face memory performance. Fifty participants (men and women) were scanned with fMRI. Our data revealed that although the nodes of the face-processing network were tightly coupled at rest, the strength of these connections did not predict face memory performance. Instead, face recognition memory was dependent on multiple connections between these face patches and regions of the medial temporal lobe memory system (including the hippocampus), and the social processing system. Moreover, this network was selective for memory for faces, and did not predict memory for other visual objects (cars). These findings suggest that in the general population, variability in face memory is dependent on how well the face processing system interacts with other processing networks, with interaction among the face patches themselves accounting for little of the variance in memory ability.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our ability to recognize and remember faces is one of the pillars of human social interaction. Face recognition however is a very complex skill, requiring specialized neural resources in visual cortex, as well as memory, identity, and social processing, all of which are inherent in our real-world experience of faces. Yet in the general population, people vary greatly in their face memory abilities. Here we show that in the neural domain this variability is underpinned by the integration of visual, memory and social circuits, with the strength of the connections between these circuits directly linked to face recognition ability.</p>

<p>Coiled-coil and C2 domain containing 1A (CC2D1A) is an evolutionarily conserved protein, originally identified as a nuclear factor-B activator through a large-scale screen of human genes. Mutations in the human <i>Cc2d1a</i> gene result in autosomal recessive nonsyndromic intellectual disability. It remains unclear, however, how <i>Cc2d1a</i> mutation leads to alterations in brain function. Here, we have taken advantage of Cre/loxP recombinase-based strategy to conditionally delete <i>Cc2d1a</i> exclusively from excitatory neurons of male mouse forebrain to examine its role in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and cognitive function. We confirmed the expression of CC2D1A protein and mRNA in the mouse hippocampus. Double immunofluorescence staining showed that CC2D1A is expressed in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons of the adult hippocampus. Conditional deletion of <i>Cc2d1a</i> (cKO) from excitatory neurons leads to impaired performance in object location memory test and altered anxiety-like behavior. Consistently, cKO mice displayed a deficit in the maintenance of LTP in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices. <i>Cc2d1a</i> deletion also resulted in decreased complexity of apical and basal dendritic arbors of CA1 pyramidal neurons. An enhanced basal Rac1 activity was observed following <i>Cc2d1a</i> deletion, and this enhancement was mediated by reduced SUMO-specific protease 1 (SENP1) and SENP3 expression, thus increasing the amount of Rac1 SUMOylation. Furthermore, partial blockade of Rac1 activity rescued impairments in LTP and object location memory performance in cKO mice. Together, our results implicate Rac1 hyperactivity in synaptic plasticity and cognitive deficits observed in <i>Cc2d1a</i> cKO mice and reveal a novel role for CC2D1A in regulating hippocampal synaptic function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> CC2D1A is abundantly expressed in the brain, but there is little known about its physiological function. Taking advantage of <i>Cc2d1a</i> cKO mice, the present study highlights the importance of CC2D1A in the maintenance of LTP at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses and the formation of hippocampus-dependent long-term object location memory. Our findings establish a critical link between elevated Rac1 activity, structural and synaptic plasticity alterations, and cognitive impairment caused by <i>Cc2d1a</i> deletion. Moreover, partial blockade of Rac1 activity rescues synaptic plasticity and memory deficits in <i>Cc2d1a</i> cKO mice. Such insights may have implications for the utility of Rac1 inhibitors in the treatment of intellectual disability caused by <i>Cc2d1a</i> mutations in human patients.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/25/4945?rss=1">Paraventricular Thalamus Controls Behavior during Motivational Conflict</a></h4>

<p>Decision-making often involves motivational conflict because of the competing demands of approach and avoidance for a common resource: behavior. This conflict must be resolved as a necessary precursor for adaptive behavior. Here we show a role for the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) in behavioral control during motivational conflict. We used Pavlovian counterconditioning in male rats to establish a conditioned stimulus (CS) as a signal for reward (or danger) and then transformed the same CS into a signal for danger (or reward). After such training, the CS controls conflicting appetitive and aversive behaviors. To assess PVT involvement in conflict, we injected an adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing the genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP and used fiber photometry to record population PVT Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. We show distinct profiles of responsivity across the anterior–posterior axis of PVT during conflict, including an ordinal relationship between posterior PVT CS responses and behavior strength. To study the causal role of PVT in behavioral control during conflict, we injected AAV expressing the inhibitory hM4Di DREADD and determined the effects of chemogenetic PVT inhibition on behavior. We show that chemogenetic inhibition across the anterior–posterior axis of the PVT, but not anterior or posterior PVT alone, disrupts arbitration between appetitive and aversive behaviors when they are in conflict but has no effect when these behaviors are assessed in isolation. Together, our findings identify PVT as central to behavioral control during motivational conflict.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Animals, including humans, approach attractive stimuli and avoid aversive ones. However, they frequently face conflict when the demands of approach and avoidance are incompatible. Resolution of this conflict is fundamental to adaptive behavior. Here we show a role for the paraventricular thalamus, a nucleus of the dorsal midline thalamus, in the arbitration of appetitive and aversive behavior during motivational conflict.</p>

<p>Neuronal circuits often display small-world network architecture characterized by neuronal cliques of dense local connectivity communicating with each other through a limited number of cells that participate in multiple cliques. The principles by which such cliques organize to encode information remain poorly understood. Similarly tuned pyramidal cells that preferentially target each other may form multicellular encoding units performing distinct computational tasks. The existence of such units can reflect upon both spontaneous and stimulus-driven population events.</p>
<p>We applied two-photon calcium imaging to study spontaneous population bursts in layer 2/3 of area V1 in male C57BL/6 mice. To identify potential small-world cliques, we searched for pyramidal cells whose calcium events had a consistent temporal relationship with the events of local inhibitory interneurons. This was guided by the intuition that groups of neurons whose synchronous firing represents a temporally coherent computational unit should be inhibited together. Pyramidal members of these interneuron-centered clusters on average displayed stronger functional connectivity between each other than with nonmember pyramidal neurons. The structure of the clusters evolved during postnatal development: cluster size and overlap between clusters decreased with developmental maturation. Pyramidal neurons in a cluster showed higher than chance tuning function similarity between each other and with the linked interneuron. Thus, spontaneous population events in V1 are shaped by small-world subnetworks of pyramidal neurons that share functional properties and work as a coherent unit with a local interneuron. These interneuron-pyramidal cell partnerships may represent a fundamental neocortical unit of computation at the population level.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neuronal circuit in layer 2/3 of mouse area V1 possesses small-world network architecture, where cliques of densely interconnected neurons ("small worlds") communicate via restricted number of hub cells. We show that: (1) in mouse V1 individual small-world cliques preferably incorporate pyramidal neurons with similar visual feature tuning, and (2) ongoing population activity of such pyramidal neuron clique is temporally linked to the activity of the local interneuron sharing its feature tuning with the clique members. Functional grouping of similarly tuned interneurons and pyramidal cells into cliques may ensure that ensembles of functionally alike pyramidal cells recruited during perceptual tasks and spontaneous activity are also turned off together as a unit, with interneurons serving as organizers of linked pyramidal ensemble activity.</p>

<p>Although NPY has potent anxiolytic actions within the BLA, selective activation of BLA NPY Y<sub>2</sub> receptors (Y<sub>2</sub>Rs) acutely increases anxiety by an unknown mechanism. Using <i>ex vivo</i> male rat brain slice electrophysiology, we show that the selective Y<sub>2</sub>R agonist, [ahx<sup>5–24</sup>]NPY, reduced the frequency of GABA<sub>A</sub>-mediated mIPSCs in BLA principal neurons (PNs). [ahx<sup>5–24</sup>]NPY also reduced tonic activation of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (GABA<sub>B</sub>R), which increased PN excitability through inhibition of a tonic, inwardly rectifying potassium current (<i>K<sub>IR</sub></i>). Surprisingly, Y<sub>2</sub>R-sensitive GABA<sub>B</sub>R currents were action potential-independent, persisting after treatment with TTX. Additionally, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, slow afterhyperpolarizing K<sup>+</sup> current (<i>I<sub>sAHP</sub></i>) was enhanced in approximately half of the Y<sub>2</sub>R-sensitive PNs, possibly from enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, permitted by reduced GABA<sub>B</sub>R tone. In male and female mice expressing tdTomato in Y<sub>2</sub>R-mRNA cells (tdT-Y<sub>2</sub>R mice), immunohistochemistry revealed that BLA somatostatin interneurons express Y<sub>2</sub>Rs, as do a significant subset of BLA PNs. In tdT-Y<sub>2</sub>R mice, [ahx<sup>5–24</sup>]NPY increased excitability and suppressed the <i>K<sub>IR</sub></i> in nearly all BLA PNs independent of tdT-Y<sub>2</sub>R fluorescence, consistent with presynaptic Y<sub>2</sub>Rs on somatostatin interneurons mediating the above effects. However, only tdT-Y<sub>2</sub>R-expressing PNs responded to [ahx<sup>5–24</sup>]NPY with an enhancement of the <i>I<sub>sAHP</sub></i>. Ultimately, increased PN excitability via acute Y<sub>2</sub>R activation likely correlates with enhanced BLA output, consistent with reported Y<sub>2</sub>R-mediated anxiogenesis. Furthermore, we demonstrate the following: (1) a novel mechanism whereby activity-independent GABA release can powerfully dampen BLA neuronal excitability via postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs; and (2) that this tonic inhibition can be interrupted by neuromodulation, here by NPY via Y<sub>2</sub>Rs.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Within the BLA, NPY is potently anxiolytic. However, selective activation of NPY<sub>2</sub> receptors (Y<sub>2</sub>Rs) increases anxiety by an unknown mechanism. We show that activation of BLA Y<sub>2</sub>Rs decreases tonic GABA release onto BLA principal neurons, probably from Y<sub>2</sub>R-expressing somatostatin interneurons, some of which coexpress NPY. This increases principal neuron excitability by reducing GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor (GABA<sub>B</sub>R)-mediated activation of G-protein-coupled, inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> currents. Tonic, Y<sub>2</sub>R-sensitive GABA<sub>B</sub>R currents unexpectedly persisted in the absence of action potential firing, revealing, to our knowledge, the first report of substantial, activity-independent GABA<sub>B</sub>R activation. Ultimately, we provide a plausible explanation for Y<sub>2</sub>R-mediated anxiogenesis <i>in vivo</i> and describe a novel and modulatable means of damping neuronal excitability.</p>

<p>Optical tools for simultaneous perturbation and measurement of neural activity open the possibility of mapping neural function over wide areas of brain tissue. However, spectral overlap of actuators and reporters presents a challenge for their simultaneous use, and optical scattering and out-of-focus fluorescence in tissue degrade resolution. To minimize optical crosstalk, we combined an optimized variant (eTsChR) of the most blue-shifted channelrhodopsin reported to-date with a nuclear-localized red-shifted Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, H2B-jRGECO1a. To perform wide-area optically sectioned imaging in tissue, we designed a structured illumination technique that uses Hadamard matrices to encode spatial information. By combining these molecular and optical approaches we made wide-area functional maps in acute brain slices from mice of both sexes. The maps spanned cortex and striatum and probed the effects of antiepileptic drugs on neural excitability and the effects of AMPA and NMDA receptor blockers on functional connectivity. Together, these tools provide a powerful capability for wide-area mapping of neuronal excitability and functional connectivity in acute brain slices.</p>

<p>Surgical ovariectomy has been shown to reduce spine density in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells of rodents, and this reduction is reversed by 17β-estradiol (E2) treatment in a model of human estrogen replacement therapy. Here, we report reduction of spine density in apical dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons of several neocortical regions that is reversed by subsequent E2 treatment in ovariectomized (OVX) female Thy1M-EGFP mice. We also found that OVX-associated reduction of spine density in somatosensory cortex was accompanied by a reduction in miniature EPSC (mEPSC) frequency (but not mIPSC frequency), indicating a change in functional synapses. OVX-associated spine loss in somatosensory cortex was also rescued by an agonist of the G-protein-linked estrogen receptor (GPER) but not by agonists of the classic estrogen receptors ERα/ERβ, whereas the opposite selectivity was found in area CA1. Acute treatment of neocortical slices with E2 also rescued the OVX-associated reduction in mEPSC frequency, which could be mimicked by a GPER agonist and abolished by a GPER antagonist. Time-lapse <i>in vivo</i> two-photon imaging showed that OVX-associated reduction in spine density is achieved by both an increase in spine loss rate and a decrease in spine gain rate and that subsequent rescue by E2 reversed both of these processes. Crucially, the spines added after E2 rescue were no more likely to reappear at or nearby the sites of pre-OVX spines than those in control mice treated with vehicle. Thus, a model of estrogen replacement therapy, although restoring spine density and dynamics, does not entirely restore functional connectivity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Estrogen replacement therapy following menopause or surgical removal of the ovaries is a widespread medical practice, yet little is known about the consequences of such treatment for cells in the brain. Here, we show that estrogen replacement reverses some of the effects of surgical removal of the ovaries on the structure and function of brain cells in the mouse. Yet, importantly, the fine wiring of the brain is not returned to the presurgery state by estrogen treatment, suggesting lasting functional consequences.</p>

<p>Selective cargo transport into axons and dendrites over the microtubule network is essential for neuron polarization. The axon initial segment (AIS) separates the axon from the somatodendritic compartment and controls the microtubule-dependent transport into the axon. Interestingly, the AIS has a characteristic microtubule organization; it contains bundles of closely spaced microtubules with electron dense cross-bridges, referred to as microtubule fascicles. The microtubule binding protein TRIM46 localizes to the AIS and when overexpressed in non-neuronal cells forms microtubule arrays that closely resemble AIS fascicles in neurons. However, the precise role of TRIM46 in microtubule fasciculation in neurons has not been studied. Here we developed a novel correlative light and electron microscopy approach to study AIS microtubule organization. We show that in cultured rat hippocampal neurons of both sexes, TRIM46 levels steadily increase at the AIS during early neuronal differentiation and at the same time closely spaced microtubules form, whereas the fasciculated microtubules appear at later developmental stages. Moreover, we localized TRIM46 to the electron dense cross-bridges and show that depletion of TRIM46 causes loss of cross-bridges and increased microtubule spacing. These data indicate that TRIM46 has an essential role in organizing microtubule fascicles in the AIS.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The axon initial segment (AIS) is a specialized region at the proximal axon where the action potential is initiated. In addition the AIS separates the axon from the somatodendritic compartment, where it controls protein transport to establish and maintain neuron polarity. Cargo vesicles destined for the axon recognize specialized microtubule tracks that enter the AIS. Interestingly the microtubules entering the AIS form crosslinked bundles, called microtubule fascicules. Recently we found that the microtubule-binding protein TRIM46 localizes to the AIS, where it may organize the AIS microtubules. In the present study we developed a novel correlative light and electron microscopy approach to study the AIS microtubules during neuron development and identified an essential role for TRIM46 in microtubule fasciculation.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/25/4847?rss=1">Deletion of Neuronal GLT-1 in Mice Reveals Its Role in Synaptic Glutamate Homeostasis and Mitochondrial Function</a></h4>

<p>The glutamate transporter GLT-1 is highly expressed in astrocytes but also in neurons, primarily in axon terminals. We generated a conditional neuronal GLT-1 KO using synapsin 1-Cre (synGLT-1 KO) to elucidate the metabolic functions of GLT-1 expressed in neurons, here focusing on the cerebral cortex. Both synaptosomal uptake studies and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry demonstrated knockdown of GLT-1 in the cerebral cortex in the synGLT-1 KO mice. Aspartate content was significantly reduced in cerebral cortical extracts as well as synaptosomes from cerebral cortex of synGLT-1 KO compared with control littermates. <sup>13</sup>C-Labeling of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates originating from metabolism of [U-<sup>13</sup>C]-glutamate was significantly reduced in synGLT-1 KO synaptosomes. The decreased aspartate content was due to diminished entry of glutamate into the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Pyruvate recycling, a pathway necessary for full glutamate oxidation, was also decreased. ATP production was significantly increased, despite unaltered oxygen consumption, in isolated mitochondria from the synGLT-1 KO. The density of mitochondria in axon terminals and perisynaptic astrocytes was increased in the synGLT-1 KO. Intramitochondrial cristae density of synGLT-1 KO mice was increased, suggesting increased mitochondrial efficiency, perhaps in compensation for reduced access to glutamate. SynGLT-1 KO synaptosomes exhibited an elevated oxygen consumption rate when stimulated with veratridine, despite a lower baseline oxygen consumption rate in the presence of glucose. GLT-1 expressed in neurons appears to be required to provide glutamate to synaptic mitochondria and is linked to neuronal energy metabolism and mitochondrial function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> All synaptic transmitters need to be cleared from the extracellular space after release, and transporters are used to clear glutamate released from excitatory synapses. GLT-1 is the major glutamate transporter, and most GLT-1 is expressed in astrocytes. Only 5%–10% is expressed in neurons, primarily in axon terminals. The function of GLT-1 in axon terminals remains unknown. Here, we used a conditional KO approach to investigate the significance of the expression of GLT-1 in neurons. We found multiple abnormalities of mitochondrial function, suggesting impairment of glutamate utilization by synaptic mitochondria in the neuronal GLT-1 KO. These data suggest that GLT-1 expressed in axon terminals may be important in maintaining energy metabolism and biosynthetic activities mediated by presynaptic mitochondria.</p>

Abstract<p>The intrinsic vasopressin system of the olfactory bulb is involved in social odor processing and consists of glutamatergic vasopressin cells (VPCs) located at the medial border of the glomerular layer. To characterize VPCs in detail, we combined various electrophysiological, neuroanatomical and two-photon Ca2+ imaging techniques in acute bulb slices from juvenile transgenic rats with eGFP-labelled VPCs.</p><p>VPCs showed regular non-bursting firing patterns, and displayed slower membrane time constants and higher input resistances versus other glutamatergic tufted cell types. VPC axons spread deeply into the external plexiform and superficial granule cell layer. Axonal projections fell into two subclasses, with either denser local columnar collaterals or longer-ranging single projections running laterally within the internal plexiform layer and deeper within the granule cell layer. VPCs always featured lateral dendrites and a tortuous apical dendrite that innervated a single glomerulus with a homogenously branching tuft. These tufts lacked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in response to single somatically-evoked action potentials and showed a moderate Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase upon prolonged action potential trains.</p><p>Notably, electrical olfactory nerve stimulation did not result in synaptic excitation of VPCs, but triggered substantial GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated IPSPs that masked excitatory barrages with yet longer latency. Exogenous vasopressin application reduced those IPSPs, as well as olfactory-nerve evoked EPSPs recorded from external tufted cells.</p><p>In summary, VPCs can be classified as non-bursting, vertical superficial tufted cells. Moreover, our findings imply that sensory input alone cannot trigger excitation of VPCs, arguing for specific additional pathways for excitation or disinhibition in social contexts.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Efficient sensing of conspecific odor signatures is essential for most rodent social behavior. Although olfactory bulb vasopressin was shown to be a potent facilitator of social odor processing, little is known on the cellular substrate of the intrinsic vasopressin system. Here we provide a detailed characterization of the anatomical and electrophysiological properties of the bulbar vasopressin cells. While we also identify several targets of vasopressin action, we find that stimulation of the sensory inputs to the bulb results primarily in vasopressin cell inhibition, implying that excitation of the bulbar vasopressin system requires additional still unknown excitatory or dis-inhibitory inputs which might confer social specificity. These insights may complement the knowledge on vasopressinergic modulation of social stimuli in limbic brain structures.</p>

Abstract<p>The transentorhinal cortex (TEC) is an obliquely oriented cortex located in the medial temporal lobe and, together with the entorhinal cortex, is one of the first affected areas in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). One of the most widely accepted hypothesis is that synaptopathy (synaptic alterations and loss) represents the major structural correlate of the cognitive decline observed in AD. However, very few electron microscope studies are available; the most common method to estimate synaptic density indirectly is by counting —at the light microscopic level— immunoreactive puncta using synaptic markers.</p><p>To investigate synaptic morphology and possible alterations related to AD, a detailed three-dimensional (3D) ultrastructural analysis using focused ion beam/scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM) was performed in the neuropil of layer II of the TEC in human brain samples from non-demented subjects and AD patients. Evaluation of the proportion and shape of asymmetric and symmetric synapses (AS and SS, respectively) targeting spines or dendritic shafts was performed using 3D reconstructions of every synapse. The 3D analysis of 4722 synapses revealed that the preferable targets were spine heads for AS and dendritic shafts for SS, both in control and AD cases. However, in AD patients, we observed a reduction in the percentage of synapses targeting spine heads. Regarding the shape of synapses, in both control cases and AD samples, the vast majority of synapses had a macular shape, followed by perforated or horseshoe-shaped synapses, with fragmented synapses being the least frequent type. Moreover, comparisons showed an increased number of fragmented AS in AD patients.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Determination of postsynaptic targets, shape and size of the synaptic junctions provide critical data on synaptic functionality. However, as far as we know, detailed 3D synaptic morphology and identification of postsynaptic targets in serial sections have not been performed before in the human brain. The present study represents the first attempt to unveil the synaptic organization of the neuropil of the human brain at the ultrastructural level using 3D electron microscopy. Our present results provide a new, large, quantitative ultrastructure dataset of the synaptic organization of the normal human cortex and of the synaptic alterations that occur in AD. Thus, these results may help to understand the relationship between alterations of the synaptic circuits and the cognitive deterioration in AD.</p>

Abstract<p>The aging of the human brain in the absence of diseases is accompanied by subtle changes of neuronal morphology, such as dendrite restructuring, neuronal sprouting, and synaptic deteriorations, rather than neurodegeneration or gross deterioration. Similarly, the nervous system of <i>C. elegans</i> does not show neurodegeneration or gross deterioration during normal aging, but displays subtle alterations in neuronal morphology. The occurrence of these age-dependent abnormalities is stochastic and dynamic, which poses a major challenge to fully capture them for quantitative comparison. Here, we developed a semi-automated pipeline for quantitative image analysis of these features during aging. We employed and evaluated this pipeline herein to reproduce findings from previous studies using visual inspection of neuronal morphology. Importantly, our approach can also quantify additional features, such as soma volume, the length of neurite outgrowths, and their location along the aged neuron. We found that, during aging, the soma of neurons decreases in volume, whereas the number and length of neurite outgrowths from the soma both increase. Long-lived animals showed less decrease in soma volume, fewer and shorter neurite outgrowths, and protection against abnormal sharp bends preferentially localized at the distal part of the dendrites during aging. We found a correlation of sharp bends with neurite outgrowth, suggesting the hypothesis that sharp bends might proceed neurite outgrowths. Thus, our semi-automated pipeline can help researchers to obtain and analyze quantitative datasets of this stochastic process for comparison across genotypes and to identify correlations to facilitate the generation of novel hypothesis.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> The etiology of age-dependent morphological changes in neurons remains elusive. The heterogeneity of these refinements requires an unbiased quantitative acquisition and analysis to pin-point the molecular underpinning of these structural changes. Here, we developed a work-flow and adopted algorithms to allow researchers to capture and analyse these age-dependent changes of <i>C. elegans</i> touch receptor neurons <i>in vivo</i>. Increasing the traceability and quantification of these stochastic changes will aid researchers to gain mechanistic insights into the underlying biology of these age-dependent morphological changes in aging neurons.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To examine the association between sleep‐disordered breathing and stroke outcomes, and determine the contribution of sleep‐disordered breathing to outcome disparities in Mexican Americans.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Ischemic stroke patients (n = 995), identified from the population‐based Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi Project (2010–2015), were offered participation in a sleep‐disordered breathing study including a home sleep apnea test (ApneaLink Plus). Sleep‐disordered breathing (respiratory event index ≥10) was determined soon after stroke. Neurologic, functional, cognitive, and quality of life outcomes were assessed at 90 days poststroke. Regression models were used to assess associations between sleep‐disordered breathing and outcomes, adjusted for sociodemographics, prestroke function and cognition, health‐risk behaviors, stroke severity, and vascular risk factors.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Median age was 67 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 59–78); 62.1% were Mexican American. Median respiratory event index was 14 (IQR = 6–25); 62.8% had sleep‐disordered breathing. Sleep‐disordered breathing was associated with worse functional outcome (mean difference in activities of daily living/instrumental activities of daily living score = 0.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.01–0.28) and cognitive outcome (mean difference in modified Mini‐Mental State Examination = −2.66, 95% CI = −4.85 to −0.47) but not neurologic or quality of life outcomes. Sleep‐disordered breathing accounted for 9 to 10% of ethnic differences in functional and cognitive outcome and was associated with cognitive outcome more strongly for Mexican Americans (β = −3.97, 95% CI = −6.63 to −1.31) than non‐Hispanic whites (β = −0.40, 95% CI = −4.18 to 3.39, <i>p</i>‐interaction = 0.15).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Sleep‐disordered breathing is associated with worse functional and cognitive function at 90 days poststroke. These outcomes are reasonable endpoints for future trials of sleep‐disordered breathing treatment in stroke. If effective, sleep‐disordered breathing treatment may somewhat lessen ethnic stroke outcome disparities. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Results from anti‐CD20 therapies demonstrate that B‐ and T‐cell interaction is a major driver of multiple sclerosis (MS). The local presence of B‐cell follicle‐like structures and oligoclonal bands in MS patients indicates that certain B cells infiltrate the central nervous system (CNS) to mediate pathology. Which peripheral triggers underlie the development of CNS‐infiltrating B cells is not fully understood.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Ex vivo flow cytometry was used to assess chemokine receptor profiles of B cells in blood, cerebrospinal fluid, meningeal, and brain tissues of MS patients (n = 10). Similar analyses were performed for distinct memory subsets in the blood of untreated and natalizumab‐treated MS patients (n = 38). To assess T‐bet(CXCR3)<sup>+</sup> B‐cell differentiation, we cultured B cells from MS patients (n = 21) and healthy individuals (n = 34) under  T helper 1‐ and TLR9‐inducing conditions. Their CNS transmigration capacity was confirmed using brain endothelial monolayers.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3)‐expressing B cells were enriched in different CNS compartments of MS patients. Treatment with the clinically effective drug natalizumab prevented the recruitment of CXCR3<sup>high</sup> IgG1<sup>+</sup> subsets, corresponding to their increased ability to cross CNS barriers in vitro. Blocking of interferon‐γ (IFNγ) reduced the transmigration potential and antigen‐presenting function of these cells. IFNγ‐induced B cells from MS patients showed increased T‐bet expression and plasmablast development. Additional TLR9 triggering further upregulated T‐bet and CXCR3, and was essential for IgG1 switching.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study demonstrates that T‐bet<sup>high</sup> IgG1<sup>+</sup> B cells are triggered by IFNγ and TLR9 signals, likely contributing to enhanced CXCR3‐mediated recruitment and local reactivity in the CNS of MS patients. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding molecules that regulate a large number of genes for post-transcriptional repression by recognizing semi-complementary target sequences that are usually located in the 3′ UTR sequence of the mRNA. Altered miRNA expression has been associated with several pathological processes, including polyglutamine (Poly Q) diseases. Specific expression patterns in the brain parenchyma and circulating fluids have been highlighted as potential biomarkers for Poly Q disease diagnosis and prognosis. Several miRNAs have been consistently identified in various diseases, including Huntington’s disease (HD) and spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). In this review, we describe the emerging role of miRNAs in Poly Q diseases and provide an overview on general miRNA biology, implications in pathophysiology, and their potential roles as future biomarkers and applications for therapy.

Cerebral ischemia is a complex pathology involving a cascade of cellular mechanisms, which deregulate proteostasis and lead to neuronal death. Proteostasis refers to the equilibrium between protein synthesis, folding and transport; and protein degradation. Within the brain proteostasis plays key roles in learning and memory by controlling protein synthesis and degradation. Two important pathways are implicated in proteostasis’ regulation: the unfolded protein response (UPR) and macroautophagy (called hereafter autophagy). Both are necessary for cell survival, however their overactivation in time or intensity often leads to cell death. Moreover, UPR and autophagy can activate and potentiate each other to worsen the issue of cerebral ischemia. Better comprehension of autophagy and ER stress will allow therapeutic strategies for stroke both at the acute phase and during recovery.
The interest of this review is to summarize the latest therapeutic advances implicating ER stress or autophagy in cerebral ischemia. In addition, we discuss the interest to study proteostasis as a single pathway rather than studying either ER stress or autophagy in stroke.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00628">An Integrative Way for Studying Neural Basis of Basic Emotions With fMRI</a></h4>

A central, unresolved problem in affective neuroscience is to understand how emotions are represented in activities of the nervous system. Many studies are striving to find the localization of basic emotions in the brain but failed. Thus many psychologists suspect the specific neural loci for basic emotions, instead, some proposed that there are specific neural structures for the core affects, such as arousal and hedonic value. The reason for this widespread difference might be that basic emotions used previously can be further divided into more “basic” emotions. Here we review brain imaging data and neuropsychological data, and try to address this question with an integrative model. In this model, we argue that basic emotions are not contrary to the dimensional studies of emotions (core affects). We propose that basic emotion should locate on the axis in the dimensions of emotion, and only represent one typical core affect (arousal or valence). Therefore, we propose four basic emotions: joy-on positive axis of hedonic dimension, sadness-on negative axis of hedonic dimension, fear and anger are twin emotions and locate on the top of vertical dimensions. This new model about basic emotions and construction model of emotions is promising  to improve and reformulate neurobiological models of basic emotions.

Deep learning has great potential for imaging classification by extracting low to high-level features. Our aim was to train a convolution neural network (CNN) with single T2-weighted FLAIR sequence to classify different cognitive performances in patients with subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD). 
Totally 217 patients with SIVD (including 52 vascular dementia (VaD), 82 vascular mild cognitive impairment (VaMCI), 83 non-cognitive impairment (NCI)) and 46 matched healthy controls (HCs) underwent MRI scans and neuropsychological assessment. 2D and 3D CNNs were trained to classify VaD, VaMCI, NCI and HCs based on FLAIR data.
For 3D-based model, loss curves of training set approached 0.017 after about 20 epochs, while the curves of testing set maintained at about 0.114. The accuracy of training set and testing set reached 99.7% and 96.9% after about 30 and 35 epochs, respectively. However, the accuracy of 2D-based model was only around 70%, which performed significantly worse than 3D-based model.
This experiment suggests us that deep learning, is a powerful and convenient method to classify different cognitive performances in SIVD by extracting the shift and scale invariant features of neuroimaging data with single FLAIR sequence. 3D-CNN is superior to 2D-CNN which proposes clinical evaluation with MRI multiplanar reformation or volume scanning.

Hundreds of millions of general anesthesia are performed each year on patients all over the world. Among these patients, 0.1-0.2 % are victims of Accidental Awareness during General Anesthesia (AAGA), i.e. an unexpected awakening during a surgical procedure under general anesthesia. Although anesthesiologists try to closely monitor patients using various techniques to prevent this terrifying phenomenon, there is currently no efficient solution to accurately detect its occurrence. We propose the conception of an innovative passive brain-computer interface (BCI) based on an intention of movement to prevent AAGA. Indeed, patients typically try to move to alert the medical  staff during an AAGA, only to discover that they are unable to. First, we examine the challenges of such a BCI, i.e. the lack of a trigger to facilitate when to look for an intention to move, as well as the necessity for a high classification accuracy. Then, we present a solution that incorporates Median Nerve Stimulation (MNS). We investigate the specific modulations that MNS causes in the motor cortex and confirm that they can be altered by an intention of movement. Finally, we perform experiments on 16 healthy participants to assess whether an MI-based BCI using MNS is able to generate high classification accuracies. Our results show that MNS may provide a foundation for an innovative BCI that would allow the detection of AAGA.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00602">Impaired Motor Skill Acquisition Using Mirror Visual Feedback Improved by Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) in Patients With Parkinson’s Disease</a></h4>

Recent non-invasive brain stimulation techniques in combination with motor training can enhance neuroplasticity and learning. It is reasonable to assume that such neuroplasticity-based interventions constitute a useful rehabilitative tool for patients with Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Regarding motor skill training, many kinds of tasks that do not involve real motor movements have been applied to PD patients. The purpose of this study is to elucidate whether motor skill training using mirror visual feedback (MVF) is useful to patients with PD in order to improve untrained hand performance dependent on the time course of training; and whether MVF combined with anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over primary motor cortex (M1) causes an additional effect based on increased motor cortical excitability. Eighteen right-handed patients with PD in the off-medication state and 10 age-matched healthy subjects (HS) performed four sessions of right-hand ball rotation using MVF (intervention) on two separate days, one week apart (Day1 and Day2). HS subjects received only sham stimulation. The intervention included four sessions of motor-skill training using MVF for 20 minutes comprised of four sets of training for 30 seconds each. PD patients were randomly divided into two intervention groups without or with anodal tDCS over the right M1 contralateral to the untrained hand. As the behavior evaluation, the number of ball rotations of the left hand was counted before (pre) and immediately after (post) intervention on both days (pre Day1, post Day1, pre Day2, and post Day2). Motor evoked potential (MEP), input-output function, and cortical silent period were recorded to evaluate the motor cortical excitatory and inhibitory system in M1 pre Day1 and post Day2. The number of ball rotations of the left hand and the facilitation of MEP by intervention were significantly impaired in patients with PD compared to HS. In contrast, if anodal tDCS was applied to right M1 of patients with PD, the number of ball rotations in accordance with I-O function at 150% intensity was significantly increased after Day1 and retained until Day2. This finding may help provide a new strategy for neurorehabilitation improving task-specific motor memory without real motor movements in PD.

Despite the high prevalence and devastating outcome, only a few treatment options for cerebral ischemic stroke exist. Based on the nitric oxide (NO)-stimulating capacity of Non-Pulsed Sinusoidal Electromagnetic Field (NP-SEMF) and the possible neuroprotective role of NO in ischemic stroke, we hypothesized that NP-SEMF is able to enhance survival and neurological outcome in a rat model of cerebral ischemia. The animals in which ischemic injury was induced by occlusion of both common carotid arteries, received daily 20 minutes NP-SEMF of either 10 or 60 Hz for 4 days. NP-SEMF dramatically increased survival, reduced the size of the infarcted brain area and significantly improved the neurological score of the surviving rats. Corresponding to previous reports, NP-SEMF was able to induce NO production in vitro. The importance of NO as a key signaling molecule was highlighted by inhibition of the NP-SEMF beneficial effects in the rat stroke model after blocking NO synthase (NOS). Our results indicate for the first time that NP-SEMF exposure (13.5mT at 60 Hz and 10 Hz) improves the survival and neurological outcome of rats subjected to cerebral ischemia and that this effect is mediated by NO, underlining the great therapeutic potential of NP-SEMF as therapy for ischemic stroke.

Rehabilitation for stroke patients with severe motor impairments is burdensome and demanding because most of the current rehabilitation options require some volitional movement to train the affected side. However, research has shown that survivors of severe stroke may receive modest benefits from action observation, virtual reality (VR), and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). These approaches have shown some success in strengthening key motor pathways thought to support motor recovery after stroke. The purpose of this study was to combine the principles of action observation, VR, and BCI in a platform called REINVENT and assess its effects on four chronic stroke patients across different levels of motor impairment. REINVENT acquires post-stroke EEG signals that indicate an attempt to move and drives the movement of a virtual avatar arm, allowing patient-driven action observation neurofeedback in VR. In addition, synchronous electromyography (EMG) data were also captured to monitor overt muscle activity. Our results show that this EEG-based BCI can be used by stroke survivors across a wide range of motor disabilities. Finally, individual results suggest that patients with more severe motor impairments benefit the most from EEG-based neurofeedback, while patients with more mild impairments may benefit more from EMG-based feedback, harnessing existing sensorimotor pathways. Future research is needed to confirm these findings in a larger and more diverse population.

GCaMP6f is among the most widely used genetically-encoded calcium indicators for monitoring neuronal activity. Applications are at both the cellular and population levels. Here we explore two important and under-explored issues. First, we have tested if GCaMP6f is sensitive enough for the detection of population activity with sparse firing, similar to the sensitivity of the local field potential (LFP). Second, we have tested if GCaMP6f is fast enough for the detection of fast network oscillations critical for the encoding and consolidation of memory. We have focused this study on the activity of the hippocampal network including sharp waves (SWs), carbachol-induced theta oscillations, and interictal-like spikes. We compare simultaneous LFP and optical GCaMP6f fluorescent recordings in Thy1-GCaMP6f mouse hippocampal slices. We observe that SWs produce a clear population GCaMP6f signal above noise with an average magnitude of 0.3% ΔF/F. This population signal is highly correlated with the LFP, albeit with a delay of 40.3 ms (SD 10.8 ms). The population GCaMP6f signal follows the LFP evoked by 20 Hz stimulation with high fidelity, while electrically evoked oscillations up to 40 Hz were detectable with reduced amplitude. GCaMP6f and LFP signals showed a large amplitude discrepancy. The amplitude of GCaMP6f fluorescence increased by a factor of 28.9 (SD 13.5) between spontaneous SWs and carbachol-induced theta bursts, while the LFP amplitude increased by a factor of 2.4 (SD 1.0). Our results suggest that GCaMP6f is a useful tool for applications commonly considered beyond the scope of genetically-encoded calcium indicators. In particular, population GCaMP6f signals are sensitive enough for detecting synchronous network events with sparse firing and sub-threshold activity, as well as asynchronous events with only a nominal LFP. In addition, population GCaMP6f signals are fast enough for monitoring theta and beta oscillations (&lt; 25 Hz). Faster calcium indicators (e.g., GCaMP7) will further improve the frequency response for the detection of gamma band oscillations. The advantage of population optical over LFP recordings are that they are non-contact and free from stimulation artifacts. These features may be particularly useful for high-throughput recordings and applications sensitive to stimulus artifact, such as monitoring responses during continuous stimulation.

Sensory neurons with cell bodies situated in dorsal root ganglia convey information from external or internal sites of the body such as actual or potential harm, temperature or muscle length to the central nervous system. In recent years, large investigative efforts have worked towards an understanding of different types of DRG neurons at transcriptional, translational and functional levels. Those studies most commonly rely on data obtained from laboratory animals. Human DRG however, have received far less investigative focus over the last 30 years. Nevertheless, knowledge about human sensory neurons is critical for a translational research approach and future therapeutic development. This review aims to summarize both historical and emerging information about the size and location of human DRG, highlighting advances in the understanding of the neurochemical characteristics of human DRG neurons, in particular nociceptive neurons.

The claustrum (CLA) is a subcortical structure, present only in mammals, whose function remains uncertain. Previously, using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) in awake head-fixed rats, we found evidence that the CLA is part of the rodent homolog of the default mode network (Smith et al., 2017). This network emerged as strong functional connections between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), mediodorsal (MD) thalamus, and CLA in the awake state, which were not present following administration of isoflurane anesthesia. In the present report, we review evidence indicating that the rodent CLA also has connections with structures identified in the rodent homolog of the salience network, a circuit that directs attention towards the most relevant stimuli among a multitude of sensory inputs (Seeley et al., 2007; Menon and Uddin, 2010). In humans, this circuit consists of functional connections between the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and a region that encompasses both the CLA and insular cortex. We further go on to review the similarities and differences between the functional and anatomical connections of the CLA and insula in rodents using both rs-fMRI and neuroanatomical tracing, respectively. We analyze in detail the connectivity of the CLA with the cingulate cortex, which is a major node in the salience network and has been shown to modulate attention. When considered with other recent behavior and physiology studies, the data reveal a role for the CLA in salience-guided orienting. More specifically, we hypothesize that limbic information from mPFC, MD thalamus, and the basolateral amygdala are integrated by the CLA to guide modality-related regions of motor and sensory cortex in directing attention towards relevant (i.e. salient) sensory events.

Golgi staining, though invented hundreds of years ago, is still a reliable method to study cytoarchitecture of the brain. Almost all published Golgi staining protocols and methods were for microtome, and it was rarely applied in cryosection, which restricted the application of this technique. Currently, several commercial Golgi-stain kits are available for both:  vibratome section and cryosection, but these kits are costly and it is still challenging for researchers to get fine results. In the present study, we described a protocol of Golgi-Cox Staining for Cryosection, with the modified cryosection protection solution based on the Golgi –Cox method, which makes cryosection easily applied  in the section of the Golgi-Cox impregnated tissue. Our methods provide a low-cost and simple option for Golgi staining, and it will facilitate researchers to get fine Golgi staining results for neuronal architecture studies.

The prosomeric brain model contemplates progressive regionalization of the central nervous system from a molecular and morphological ontogenetic perspective. It defines the forebrain axis relative to the notochord, and contemplates intersecting longitudinal (zonal, columnar) and transversal (neuromeric) patterning mechanisms. A checkboard pattern of histogenetic units of the neural wall results, where each unit is differentially fated by an unique profile of active genes. These natural neural units later expand their radial dimension during neurogenesis, histogenesis, and correlative differential morphogenesis. This fundamental topologic framework is shared by all vertebrates, as a Bauplan, each lineage varying in some subtle aspects. So far the prosomeric model has been applied only to neural structures, but we attempt here a prosomeric analysis of the hypothesis that major vessels invade the brain wall in patterns that are congruent with its intrinsic natural developmental units, as postulated in the prosomeric model. Anatomic and embryologic studies of brain blood vessels have classically recorded a conserved pattern of branches (thus the conventional terminology), and clinical experience has discovered a standard topography of many brain arterial terminal fields. Such results were described under assumptions of the columnar forebrain model, prevalent during the last century, but this is found insufficient in depth and explanatory power in the modern molecular scenario. We have thus explored the possibility that brain vascularization in rodents and humans may relate systematically to genoarchitectonic forebrain subdivisions contemplated in the prosomeric model. Specifically, we examined first whether early vascular invasion of some molecularly characterized prosomeric domains shows heterochrony. We indeed found a heterochronic pattern of vascular invasion that distinguishes between adjacent brain areas with differential molecular profiles. We next mapped topologically on the prosomeric model the major arterial branches serving the human brain. The results of this approach bear on the possibility of a developmentally-based modern arterial terminology.

This work describes the conception, synthesis and in vitro and in vivo biological evaluation of novel Multi-Target Directed Ligands (MTDL) able to both activate 5-HT4 receptors, block 5-HT6 receptors and inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE), in order to exert a synergistic antiamnesic effect, potentially useful in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Indeed, both activation of 5-HT4 and blockage of 5-HT6 receptors led to an enhanced acetylcholine release, whose depletion would be implied in AD. The preservation of the latter through the inhibition of AChE would complete this approach and lead to an efficiently restoring of the cholinergic neurotransmission. Furthermore, 5-HT4 receptor agonists, also, appear able to promote the non-amyloidogenic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein and to favor the production of the neurotrophic protein sAPP. This study succeeded in yielding such pleiotropic compounds whose one of them further displayed in vivo an anti-amnesiant effect in a model of scopolamine-induced deficit of working memory from the dose of 0.3 mg/kg.

<p>by Claire Bomkamp, Shreejoy J. Tripathy, Carolina Bengtsson Gonzales, Jens Hjerling-Leffler, Ann Marie Craig, Paul Pavlidis</p>

In order to further our understanding of how gene expression contributes to key functional properties of neurons, we combined publicly accessible gene expression, electrophysiology, and morphology measurements to identify cross-cell type correlations between these data modalities. Building on our previous work using a similar approach, we distinguished between correlations which were “class-driven,” meaning those that could be explained by differences between excitatory and inhibitory cell classes, and those that reflected graded phenotypic differences within classes. Taking cell class identity into account increased the degree to which our results replicated in an independent dataset as well as their correspondence with known modes of ion channel function based on the literature. We also found a smaller set of genes whose relationships to electrophysiological or morphological properties appear to be specific to either excitatory or inhibitory cell types. Next, using data from PatchSeq experiments, allowing simultaneous single-cell characterization of gene expression and electrophysiology, we found that some of the gene-property correlations observed across cell types were further predictive of within-cell type heterogeneity. In summary, we have identified a number of relationships between gene expression, electrophysiology, and morphology that provide testable hypotheses for future studies.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VJEbrzdYvvo" width="1" />

<p>by Payam Piray, Amir Dezfouli, Tom Heskes, Michael J. Frank, Nathaniel D. Daw</p>

Computational modeling plays an important role in modern neuroscience research. Much previous research has relied on statistical methods, separately, to address two problems that are actually interdependent. First, given a particular computational model, Bayesian hierarchical techniques have been used to estimate individual variation in parameters over a population of subjects, leveraging their population-level distributions. Second, candidate models are themselves compared, and individual variation in the expressed model estimated, according to the fits of the models to each subject. The interdependence between these two problems arises because the relevant population for estimating parameters of a model depends on which other subjects express the model. Here, we propose a hierarchical Bayesian inference (HBI) framework for concurrent model comparison, parameter estimation and inference at the population level, combining previous approaches. We show that this framework has important advantages for both parameter estimation and model comparison theoretically and experimentally. The parameters estimated by the HBI show smaller errors compared to other methods. Model comparison by HBI is robust against outliers and is not biased towards overly simplistic models. Furthermore, the fully Bayesian approach of our theory enables researchers to make inference on group-level parameters by performing HBI t-test.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/F0fnhkHvtD8" width="1" />

A detailed exploration of factors that can moderate tDCS effects on episodic long-term memory (LTM) is of high interest due to the clinical potential for patients with traumatic or pathological memory deficits and with cognitive impairments.

Abstract
<p>In neural circuits, action potentials (spikes) are conventionally caused by excitatory inputs whereas inhibitory inputs reduce or modulate neuronal excitability. We previously showed that neurons in the superior paraolivary nucleus (SPN) require solely synaptic inhibition to generate their hallmark offset response, a burst of spikes at the end of a sound stimulus, via a post-inhibitory rebound mechanism. In addition SPN neurons receive excitatory inputs, but their functional significance is not yet known. Here we used mice of both sexes to demonstrate that in SPN neurons, the classical roles for excitation and inhibition are switched, with inhibitory inputs driving spike firing and excitatory inputs modulating this response. Hodgkin–Huxley modeling suggests that a slow, NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated excitation would accelerate the offset response. We find corroborating evidence from <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> recordings that lack of excitation prolonged offset-response latencies and rendered them more variable to changing sound intensity levels. Our results reveal an unsuspected function for slow excitation in improving the timing of post-inhibitory rebound firing even when the firing itself does not depend on excitation. This shows the auditory system employs highly specialized mechanisms to encode timing-sensitive features of sound offsets which are crucial for sound-duration encoding and have profound biological importance for encoding the temporal structure of speech.</p>

Abstract
<p>The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) is a brain region implicated in anxiety, stress-related disorders and the reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF, <i>Crh)</i> acting at cognate type 1 receptors (CRF<sub>1</sub>, <i>Crhr1</i>) modulates inhibitory and excitatory synaptic transmission in the CeA. Here, we used CRF<sub>1</sub>:GFP reporter mice to characterize the morphological, neurochemical and electrophysiological properties of CRF<sub>1</sub>-expressing (CRF<sub>1</sub>+) and CRF<sub>1</sub>-non-expressing (CRF<sub>1</sub>–) neurons in the CeA. We assessed these two neuronal populations for distinctions in the expression of GABAergic subpopulation markers and neuropeptides, dendritic spine density and morphology, and excitatory transmission. We observed that CeA CRF<sub>1</sub>+ neurons are GABAergic but do not segregate with calbindin (CB), calretinin (CR), parvalbumin (PV), or protein kinase C- (PKC). Among the neuropeptides analyzed, <i>Penk</i> and <i>Sst</i> had the highest percentage of co-expression with <i>Crhr1</i> in both the medial and lateral CeA subdivisions. Additionally, CeA CRF<sub>1</sub>+ neurons had a lower density of dendritic spines, which was offset by a higher proportion of mature spines compared to neighboring CRF<sub>1</sub>– neurons. Accordingly, there was no difference in basal spontaneous glutamatergic transmission between the two populations. Application of CRF increased overall vesicular glutamate release onto both CRF<sub>1</sub>+ and CRF<sub>1</sub>– neurons and does not affect amplitude or kinetics of EPSCs in either population. These novel data highlight important differences in the neurochemical make-up and morphology of CRF<sub>1</sub>+ compared to CRF<sub>1</sub>– neurons, which may have important implications for the transduction of CRF signaling in the CeA.  </p>

Shank3, a postsynaptic scaffolding protein involved in regulating excitatory synapse assembly and function, has been implicated in several brain disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD), Phelan-McDermid syndrome, schizophrenia, intellectual disability, and mania. Here we generated and characterized a Shank3 knock-in mouse line carrying the Q321R mutation (Shank3Q321R mice) identified in a human individual with ASD that affects the ankyrin repeat region (ARR) domain of the Shank3 protein. Homozygous Shank3Q321R/Q321R mice show a selective decrease in the level of Shank3a, an ARR-containing protein variant, but not other variants. CA1 pyramidal neurons in the Shank3Q321R/Q321R hippocampus show decreased neuronal excitability but normal excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission. Behaviorally, Shank3Q321R/Q321R mice show moderately enhanced self-grooming and anxiolytic-like behavior, but normal locomotion, social interaction, and object recognition and contextual fear memory. In addition, these mice show abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns and decreased susceptibility to induced seizures. These results indicate that the Q321R mutation alters Shank3 protein stability, neuronal excitability, repetitive and anxiety-like behavior, EEG patterns, and seizure susceptibility in mice.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00635">A Critical Period for the Development of Schizophrenia-Like Pathology by Aberrant Postnatal Neurogenesis</a></h4>

Schizophrenia is a complex and serious mental disorder, and patients with schizophrenia are characterized by psychological hallucinations, deregulated emotionality, and cognitive impairment. Evidence indicated that postnatal neurogenesis in the hippocampus is profoundly impaired in schizophrenic individuals but the role of such dysregulated neurodevelopmental processing in the pathophysiological progress of schizophrenia has not been well investigated. Here in this study, by using the rodent model of schizophrenia through maternal immune activation of poly (I:C) injection, we aimed to examine whether the postnatal neurogenesis might be involved in the development of schizophrenia-like pathology. Through the comprehensive behavioral analyses of multiple core symptoms of schizophrenia at different developmental stages (six-, nine-, and twelve-weeks after birth) of the affected offspring, we found a delayed onset of schizophrenia-like behaviors in poly (I:C) animals through the development. Meanwhile, there is an age-dependent alteration of postnatal neurogenesis in the poly (I:C) animals along different development stages by which the aberrant dendritic elaboration functionally correlated with the schizophrenia-like symptoms in nine-week old of age for the animals. Interestingly, increase in the neurogenesis during a critical period of neurodevelopment exacerbates the schizophrenia-like pathology. Conversely, temporal suppression of aberrant postnatal neurogenesis during the same period of neurodevelopment ameliorates the occurrence of schizophrenia-like symptoms. Together, these findings strongly suggested the aberrant dendritic growth of postnatal neurogenesis during the critical time window of development is essential for controlling the pathophysiological progression of schizophrenia-like symptoms. And pharmacological treatments that adjust these abnormalities may provide potential therapeutic benefits toward patients with schizophrenia in clinic.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are both diseases with increasing prevalence in aging populations. T2D, characterized by insulin resistance and defective insulin signaling, is a common co-morbidity and a risk factor for AD, increasing the risk approximately two- to four-fold. Insulin exerts a wide variety of effects as a growth factor as well as by regulating glucose, fatty acid and protein metabolism. Certain lifestyle factors, physical inactivity and typical Western diet (TWD) containing high fat and high sugar are strongly associated with insulin resistance and T2D. The PI3K-Akt signaling pathway is a major mediator of effects of insulin and plays a crucial role in T2D pathogenesis. Decreased levels of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) subunits as well as blunted Akt kinase phosphorylation have been observed in the AD brain, characterized by amyloid-β and tau pathologies. Furthermore, AD mouse models fed with TWD have shown to display altered levels of PI3K subunits. How impaired insulin-PI3K-Akt signaling in peripheral tissues or in the central nervous system (CNS) affects the development or progression of AD is currently poorly understood. Interestingly, enhancement of PI3K-Akt signaling in the CNS by intranasal insulin (IN) treatment has been shown to improve memory in vivo in mice and in human trials. Insulin is known to augment neuronal growth and synapse formation through the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. However, PI3K-Akt pathway mediates signaling related to different functions also in other cell types, like microglia and astrocytes. In this review, we will discuss the most prominent molecular mechanisms related to the PI3K-Akt pathway in AD and how T2D and altered insulin signaling may affect the pathogenesis of AD.

Diffuse white matter abnormality (DWMA), or diffuse excessive high signal intensity is observed in 50-80% of very preterm infants at term-equivalent age. It is subjectively defined as higher than normal signal intensity in periventricular and subcortical white matter in comparison to normal unmyelinated white matter on T2-weighted MRI images. Despite the well-documented presence of DWMA, it remains debatable whether DWMA represents pathological tissue injury or a transient developmental phenomenon. Manual tracing of DWMA exhibits poor reliability and reproducibility and unduly increases image processing time. Thus, objective and ideally automatic assessment is critical to accurately elucidate the biologic nature of DWMA. We propose a deep learning approach to automatically identify DWMA regions on T2-weighted MRI images. Specifically, we formulated DWMA detection as an image voxel classification task; that is, the voxels on T2-weighted images are treated as samples and exclusively assigned as DWMA or normal white matter voxel classes. To utilize the spatial information of individual voxels, small image patches centered on the given voxels are retrieved. A deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) model was developed to differentiate DWMA and normal voxels. We tested our deep CNN in multiple validation experiments. First, we examined DWMA detection accuracy of our CNN model using computer simulations. This was followed by in vivo assessments in a cohort of very preterm infants (N=95) using cross-validation and holdout validation. Finally, we tested our approach on an independent preterm cohort (N=28) to externally validate our model. Our deep CNN model achieved Dice similarity index values ranging from 0.85 to 0.99 for DWMA detection in the aforementioned validation experiments. Our proposed deep CNN model exhibited significantly better performance than other popular machine learning models. We present an objective and automated approach for accurately identifying DWMA that may facilitate the clinical diagnosis of DWMA in very preterm infants.

The endogenous potential of adult neurogenesis is of particular interest for the development of new strategies for recovery after stroke and traumatic brain injury. These pathological conditions affect endogenous neurogenesis in two aspects. On the one hand, injury usually initiates the migration of neuronal precursors (NPCs) to the lesion area from the already existing, in physiological conditions, neurogenic niche – the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) near the lateral ventricles. On the other hand, recent studies have convincingly demonstrated the local generation of new neurons near lesion areas in different brain locations. The striatum, cortex, and hippocampal CA1 region are considered to be locations of such new neurogenic zones in the damaged brain. This review focuses on the relative contribution of two types of NPCs of different origin, resident population in new neurogenic zones and cells migrating from the lateral ventricles, to post-stroke or post-traumatic enhancement of neurogenesis. The migratory pathways of NPCs have also been considered. In addition, the review highlights the advantages and limitations of different methodological approaches to the definition of NPC location and tracking of new neurons. In general, we suggest that despite the considerable number of studies, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of neurogenesis in the damaged brain. We believe that the advancement of methods for in vivo visualization and longitudinal observation of neurogenesis in the brain could fundamentally change the current situation in this field.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00552">Prion-Like Mechanisms in Parkinson’s Disease</a></h4>

Formation and aggregation of misfolded proteins in the central nervous system (CNS) is a key hallmark of several age-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease (PD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). These diseases share key biophysical and biochemical characteristics with prion diseases. It is believed that PD is characterized by abnormal protein aggregation, mainly that of α-synuclein (α-syn). Of particular importance, there is growing evidence indicating that abnormal α-syn can spread to neighboring brain regions and cause aggregation of endogenous α-syn in these regions as seeds, in a “prion-like” manner. Abundant studies in vitro and in vivo have shown that α-syn goes through a templated conformational change, propagates from the original region to neighboring regions, and eventually cause neuron degeneration in the substantia nigra and striatum. The objective of this review is to summarize the mechanisms involved in the aggregation of abnormal intracellular α-syn and its subsequent cell-to-cell transmission. According to these findings, we look forward to effective therapeutic perspectives that can block the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00194">Interpreting Prefrontal Recruitment During Walking After Stroke: Influence of Individual Differences in Mobility and Cognitive Function</a></h4>

Background: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a valuable neuroimaging approach for studying cortical contributions to walking function. Recruitment of prefrontal cortex during walking has been a particular area of focus in the literature. The present study investigated whether task-related change in prefrontal recruitment measured by fNIRS is affected by individual differences in people post-stroke. The primary hypotheses were that poor mobility function would contribute to prefrontal over-recruitment during typical walking, and that poor cognitive function would contribute to a ceiling in prefrontal recruitment during dual-task walking (i.e., walking with a cognitive task).

Methods: Thirty-three adults with chronic post-stroke hemiparesis performed three tasks: typical walking at preferred speed (Walk), serial-7 subtraction (Serial7), and walking combined with serial-7 subtraction (Dual-Task). Prefrontal recruitment was measured with fNIRS and quantified as the change in oxygenated hemoglobin concentration (ΔO2Hb) between resting and active periods for each task. Spatiotemporal gait parameters were measured on an electronic walkway. Stepwise regression was used to assess how prefrontal recruitment was affected by individual differences including age, sex, stroke region, injured hemisphere, stroke chronicity, 10 meter walking speed, balance confidence measured by Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale, sensorimotor impairment measured by Fugl-Meyer Assessment, and cognitive function measured by Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE).

Results: For Walk, poor balance confidence (ABC Scale score) significantly predicted greater prefrontal recruitment (ΔO2Hb; R2 = 0.25, p = 0.003). For Dual-Task poor cognitive function (MMSE score) significantly predicted lower prefrontal recruitment (ΔO2Hb; R2 = 0.25, p = 0.002).  

Conclusions: Poor mobility function predicted higher prefrontal recruitment during typical walking, consistent with compensatory over-recruitment. Poor cognitive function predicted lower prefrontal recruitment during dual-task walking, consistent with a recruitment ceiling effect. These findings indicate that interpretation of prefrontal recruitment should carefully consider the characteristics of the person and demands of the task.

Leukoaraiosis (LA) is considered to be associated with cognitive impairment in the older people. This alteration can be reflected in functional connectivity (FC) based on resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI). In this study, we used the triple brain network model to investigate altered changes in FC for LA with different cognitive impairment loads determined by the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). Eighty-three subjects were divided into four groups based on their clinical diagnosis: the LA-normal cognition group (LA-NC) (n=14, 6 males), LA with mild cognitive impairment (LA-MCI) group (n=27, 13 males), LA with vascular dementia (LA-VD) group (n=12, 6 males) and matched healthy controls (HC) (n=30, 11 males). The triple brain network model includes the default-mode network (DMN), salience networks (SN) and the central executive network (CEN), which were extracted with independent components analysis (ICA) and region of interest (ROI)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    based analysis using the REST toolbox. LA group presented decreased FC for all these three brain networks, compared with matched healthy controls. For inter-brain network analysis, there were decreased negative FC between the SN and DMN in LA group. While there were enhanced inter-brain network FC between the SN and CEN as well as within the SN. The decrease of FC between SN and DMN may reflect the damage mechanism of cognitive impairment of LA, which can compensate with the enhanced inter-brain network between SN and CEN and intra-brain network FC within the SN.

Neuroimmune interactions are important in the pathophysiology of many chronic inflammatory diseases, particularly those associated with alterations in sensory processing and pain. Mast cells and sensory neuron nerve endings are found in areas of the body exposed to the external environment; both are specialized to sense potential damage by injury or pathogens and signal to the immune system and nervous system respectively, to elicit protective responses. Cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1), also known as SynCAM1, has previously been identified as an adhesion molecule which may couple mast cells to sensory neurons however, whether this molecule exerts a functional as well as structural role in neuroimmune cross-talk is unknown. Here we show, using a newly developed in vitro co-culture system consisting of murine bone marrow derived mast cells (BMMC) and adult sensory neurons isolated from dorsal root ganglions (DRG), that CADM1 is expressed in mast cells and adult sensory neurons and mediates strong adhesion between the two cell types. Non-neuronal cells in the DRG cultures did not express CADM1, and mast cells did not adhere to them. The interaction of BMMCs with sensory neurons was found to induce mast cell degranulation and IL-6 secretion and to enhance responses to antigen stimulation and activation of FcRI receptors. Secretion of TNF in contrast was not affected, nor was secretion evoked by compound 48/80. Co-cultures of BMMCs with HEK 293 cells, which also express CADM1, while also leading to adhesion did not replicate the effects of sensory neurons on mast cells, indicative of a neuron-specific interaction. Application of a CADM1 blocking peptide or knockdown of CADM1 in BMMCs significantly decreased BMMC attachment to sensory neurites and abolished the enhanced secretory responses of mast cells. In conclusion, CADM1 is necessary and sufficient to drive mast cell-sensory neuron adhesion and promote the development of a microenvironment in which neurons enhance mast cell responsiveness to antigen; this interaction could explain why the incidence of painful neuroinflammatory disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are increased in atopic patients.

Background: Studying structural brain aging is important to understand age-related pathologies, as well as to identify the early manifestations of the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) continuum. In this study, we investigated the long-term trajectory of physiological and pathological brain aging in a large number of participants ranging from the 50s to over 80 years of age. 
Objective: To explore the distinct brain regions that distinguish pathological brain aging from physiological brain aging using sophisticated measurements of cortical thickness.
Methods: A total of 2,823 cognitively normal (CN) individuals and 2,675 patients with AD continuum (874 with subjective memory impairments [SMI], 954 with amnestic mild cognitive impairments [aMCI], and 847 with AD dementia) who underwent a high-resolution 3.0-tesla MRI were included in this study. To investigate pathological brain aging, we further classified patients with aMCI and AD according to the severity of cognitive impairment. Cortical thickness was measured using a surface-based method. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate age, diagnostic groups, and cortical thickness.
Results: Aging extensively affected cortical thickness not only in CN individuals but also in AD continuum patients; however, the precuneus and inferior temporal regions were relatively preserved against age-related cortical thinning. Compared to CN individuals, AD continuum patients including those with SMI showed a decreased cortical thickness in the perisylvian region. However, widespread cortical thinning including the precuneus and inferior temporal regions were found from the late-stage aMCI to the moderate to severe AD. Unlike the other age groups, AD continuum patients aged over 80 years showed prominent cortical thinning in the medial temporal region with relative sparing of the precuneus.
Conclusion: Our findings suggested that the precuneus and inferior temporal regions are the key regions in distinguishing between physiological and pathological brain aging. Attempts to differentiate age-related pathology from physiological brain aging at a very early stage would be important in terms of establishing new strategies for preventing accelerated pathological brain aging.

Healthy aging limits the activities of daily living and personal independence. Furthermore, cognitive-motor interference in dual-task (e.g., walking while talking) appears to be more pronounced in the elderly. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a form of the non-invasive brain stimulation technique, is known to modify cortical excitability and has been investigated as a tool for enhancing learning in health and disease. The present study examined the effects of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), applied while dual-tasking (on-line), improves performance in healthy older humans. Anodal, cathodal, bilateral or sham tDCS targeting left DLPFC was applied while performing the grooved pegboard test (GPT) and serial seven subtraction test (SSST) alone or together (dual-tasking). The number of pegs and the number of correct subtractions were recorded before, during and 30 minutes after tDCS. The dual-task performance was measured as the percent change from single to the dual-task condition (dual-task cost DTC). Only bilateral, anode left tDCS, induced a significant increase in subtracted numbers while dual-tasking, i.e., it reduced the DTC of manual dexterity (GPT) to a cognitive task. Significant changes 30 minutes after the stimulation were only present after bilateral anode right tDCS on GPT dual-task costs. These findings suggest that anodal tDCS applied online interacts with a dual-task performance involving demanding cognitive and manual dexterity tasks. The results support the potential use of non-invasive brain stimulation for improvement of cognitive functioning in daily activities in older individuals.

Identifying appropriate animal models is critical in developing translatable in vitro and in vivo systems for therapeutic drug development and investigating disease pathophysiology. These animal models should have direct biological and translational relevance to the underlying disease they are supposed to mimic. Aging dogs not only naturally develop a cognitive decline in many aspects including learning and memory deficits, but they also exhibit human-like individual variability in the aging process. Neurodegenerative processes that can be observed in both human and canine brains include the progressive accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) found as diffuse plaques in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), including the gyrus proreus (i.e., medial orbital PFC), as well as the hippocampus and the cerebral vasculature. Tau pathology, a marker of neurodegeneration and dementia progression, was also found in canine hippocampal synapses. Various epidemiological data show that human patients with neurodegenerative diseases have concurrent intestinal lesions, and histopathological changes in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract occurs decades before neurodegenerative changes. Gut microbiome alterations have also been reported in many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, as well as inflammatory central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Interestingly, the dog gut microbiome more closely resembles human gut microbiome in composition and functional overlap compared to rodent models. This article reviews the physiology of the gut-brain axis (GBA), and its involvement with neurodegenerative diseases in humans. Additionally, we outline the advantages and weaknesses of current in vitro and in vivo models and discuss future research directions investigating major human neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases using dogs.

Zerbi et al. selectively activate the mouse locus coeruleus, which provides norepinephrine to the brain. This induces anxiety and rapidly shifts network connectivity toward salience and fear processing. This appears to be mediated by the spatial distribution of adrenergic receptors.

<p>by David Hasler, Pinelopi Anagnostopoulou, Sylvia Nyilas, Philipp Latzin, Johannes Schittny, Dominik Obrist</p>

The multiple-breath washout (MBW) is a lung function test that measures the degree of ventilation inhomogeneity (VI). The test is used to identify small airway impairment in patients with lung diseases like cystic fibrosis. However, the physical and physiological factors that influence the test outcomes and differentiate health from disease are not well understood. Computational models have been used to better understand the interaction between anatomical structure and physiological properties of the lung, but none of them has dealt in depth with the tracer gas washout test in a whole. Thus, our aim was to create a lung model that simulates the entire MBW and investigate the role of lung morphology and tissue mechanics on the tracer gas washout procedure. To this end, we developed a multi-scale lung model to simulate the inert gas transport in airways of all size. We then applied systematically different modifications to geometrical and mechanical properties of the lung model (compliance, residual airway volume and flow resistance) which have been associated with VI. The modifications were applied to distinct parts of the model, and their effects on the gas distribution within the lung and on the gas concentration profile were assessed. We found that variability in compliance and residual volume of the airways, as well as the spatial distribution of this variability in the lung had a direct influence on gas distribution among airways and on the MBW pattern (washout duration, characteristic concentration profile during each expiration), while the effects of variable flow resistance were negligible. Based on these findings, it is possible to classify different types of inhomogeneities in the lung and relate them to specific features of the MBW pattern, which builds the basis for a more detailed association of lung function and structure.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rWwQMLRNGq8" width="1" />

<p>by Hansaim Lim, Di He, Yue Qiu, Patrycja Krawczuk, Xiaoru Sun, Lei Xie</p>

Many complex diseases such as cancer are associated with multiple pathological manifestations. Moreover, the therapeutics for their treatments often lead to serious side effects. Thus, it is needed to develop multi-indication therapeutics that can simultaneously target multiple clinical indications of interest and mitigate the side effects. However, conventional one-drug-one-gene drug discovery paradigm and emerging polypharmacology approach rarely tackle the challenge of multi-indication drug design. For the first time, we propose a one-drug-multi-target-multi-indication strategy. We develop a novel structural systems pharmacology platform 3D-REMAP that uses ligand binding site comparison and protein-ligand docking to augment sparse chemical genomics data for the machine learning model of genome-scale chemical-protein interaction prediction. Experimentally validated predictions systematically show that 3D-REMAP outperforms state-of-the-art ligand-based, receptor-based, and machine learning methods alone. As a proof-of-concept, we utilize the concept of drug repurposing that is enabled by 3D-REMAP to design dual-indication anti-cancer therapy. The repurposed drug can demonstrate anti-cancer activity for cancers that do not have effective treatment as well as reduce the risk of heart failure that is associated with all types of existing anti-cancer therapies. We predict that levosimendan, a PDE inhibitor for heart failure, inhibits serine/threonine-protein kinase RIOK1 and other kinases. Subsequent experiments and systems biology analyses confirm this prediction, and suggest that levosimendan is active against multiple cancers, notably lymphoma, through the direct inhibition of RIOK1 and RNA processing pathway. We further develop machine learning models to predict cancer cell-line’s and a patient’s response to levosimendan. Our findings suggest that levosimendan can be a promising novel lead compound for the development of safe, effective, and precision multi-indication anti-cancer therapy. This study demonstrates the potential of structural systems pharmacology in designing polypharmacology for precision medicine. It may facilitate transforming the conventional one-drug-one-gene-one-disease drug discovery process and single-indication polypharmacology approach into a new one-drug-multi-target-multi-indication paradigm for complex diseases.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-IDblMFngLo" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Thymidine kinase 2, encoded by the nuclear gene <i>TK2</i>, is required for mitochondrial DNA maintenance. Autosomal recessive <i>TK2</i> mutations cause depletion and multiple deletions of mtDNA that manifest predominantly as a myopathy usually beginning in childhood and progressing relentlessly. We investigated the safety and efficacy of deoxynucleoside monophosphate and deoxynucleoside therapies.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We administered deoxynucleoside monophosphates and deoxynucleoside to 16 TK2‐deficient patients under a compassionate use program.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In 5 patients with early onset and severe disease, survival and motor functions were better than historically untreated patients. In 11 childhood and adult onset patients, clinical measures stabilized or improved. Three of 8 patients who were nonambulatory at baseline gained the ability to walk on therapy; 4 of 5 patients who required enteric nutrition were able to discontinue feeding tube use; and 1 of 9 patients who required mechanical ventilation became able to breathe independently. In motor functional scales, improvements were observed in the 6‐minute walk test performance in 7 of 8 subjects, Egen Klassifikation in 2 of 3, and North Star Ambulatory Assessment in all 5 tested. Baseline elevated serum growth differentiation factor 15 levels decreased with treatment in all 7 patients tested. A side effect observed in 8 of the 16 patients was dose‐dependent diarrhea, which did not require withdrawal of treatment. Among 12 other TK2 patients treated with deoxynucleoside, 2 adults developed elevated liver enzymes that normalized following discontinuation of therapy.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This open‐label study indicates favorable side effect profiles and clinical efficacy of deoxynucleoside monophosphate and deoxynucleoside therapies for TK2 deficiency. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

Abstract<p>Copy number variation at chromosomal region 15q11.2 is linked to increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders including autism and schizophrenia. A significant gene at this locus is cytoplasmic fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) interacting protein 1 (<i>CYFIP1</i>). CYFIP1 protein interacts with FMRP, whose monogenic absence causes Fragile X syndrome. FMRP knock-out has been shown to reduce tonic GABAergic inhibition by interacting with the -subunit of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor. Using <i>in situ</i> hybridization, qPCR, western blot techniques and patch clamp electrophysiology in brain slices from a <i>Cyfip1</i> haploinsufficient mouse, we examined -subunit mediated tonic inhibition in the dentate gyrus. In wild-type mice, dentate gyrus granule cells (DGGC) responded to the -subunit selective agonist THIP with significantly increased tonic currents. In heterozygous mice, no significant difference was observed in THIP evoked currents in DGGC. Phasic GABAergic inhibition in DGGC was also unaltered with no difference in properties of spontaneous inhibitory post synaptic currents (IPSCs). Additionally, we demonstrate that dentate gyrus granule cell layer PV<sup>+</sup>-interneurons (PV<sup>+</sup>-IN) have functional -subunit mediated tonic GABAergic currents which, unlike DGGC, are also modulated by the α<sub>1</sub> selective drug zolpidem. Similar to DGGC, both IPSCs and THIP-evoked currents in PV<sup>+</sup>-IN were not different between <i>Cyfip1</i> heterozygous and wild-type mice. Supporting our electrophysiological data, we found no significant change in hippocampal -subunit mRNA expression or protein level and no change in α<sub>1</sub>/α<sub>4</sub> subunit mRNA expression. Thus, <i>Cyfip1</i> haploinsufficiency, mimicking human 15q11.2 microdeletion syndrome, does not alter hippocampal phasic or tonic GABAergic inhibition, substantially differing from the FMRP knock-out mouse model.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b><i>CYFIP1</i> is a candidate risk gene for neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. CYFIP1 protein interacts with FMRP whose loss downregulates tonic GABAergic inhibition via interaction with the -subunit of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor. Here, however, we report that reduced <i>Cyfip1</i> dosage in mice does not alter tonic GABAergic inhibition in granule cells and PV<sup>+</sup>-interneurons of the dentate gyrus, a region rich in -subunit expression. Despite these negative findings, our data does demonstrate that PV<sup>+</sup>-interneurons of the DG granule cell layer are functionally regulated by tonic GABAergic inhibition, and in contrast to granule cells, this involves receptors incorporating both  and α<sub>1</sub>-subunits. Thus, granule cell layer excitatory neurons and PV<sup>+</sup>-interneurons may be differentially modulated by subunit selective GABA receptor targeting drugs.</p>

Hertz et al. identify the neuronally enriched protein RUFY3 as a key regulator downstream of (or in parallel to) caspase-3 in axon degeneration. RUFY3 is dephosphorylated and cleaved during degeneration. RUFY3 may provide a neuron-specific control point for neurons to locally control axon degeneration.

The nervous and immune systems are classically studied as two separate entities. However, their interactions are crucial for maintaining barrier functions at tissues constantly exposed to the external environment. We focus here on the role of neuronal signaling in regulating the immune system at two major barriers: the skin and respiratory tract. Barrier tissues are heavily innervated by sensory and autonomic nerves, and are densely populated by resident immune cells, allowing rapid, coordinated responses to noxious stimuli, as well as to bacterial and fungal pathogens.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) in the walls of cortical vessels and the accrual of microbleeds and microinfarcts over time. The relationship between CAA severity and microbleeds and microinfarcts as well as the sequence of events that lead to lesion formation remain poorly understood.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We scanned intact formalin‐fixed hemispheres of 12 CAA cases with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), followed by histopathological examination in predefined areas and serial sectioning in targeted areas with multiple lesions.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In total, 1,168 cortical microbleeds and 472 cortical microinfarcts were observed on ex vivo MRI. Increasing CAA severity at the whole‐brain or regional level was not associated with the number of microbleeds or microinfarcts. However, locally, the density of Aβ‐positive cortical vessels was lower surrounding a microbleed compared to a simulated control lesion, and higher surrounding microinfarcts. Serial sectioning revealed that for (n = 28) microbleeds, both Aβ (4%) and smooth muscle cells (4%) were almost never present in the vessel wall at the site of bleeding, but Aβ was frequently observed upstream or downstream (71%), as was extensive fibrin(ogen) buildup (87%). In contrast, for (n = 22) microinfarcts, vascular Aβ was almost always observed at the core of the lesion (91%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) as well as upstream or downstream (82%), but few vessels associated with microinfarcts had intact smooth muscle cells (9%).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These observations provide a model for how a single neuropathologic process such as CAA may result in hemorrhagic or ischemic brain lesions potentially through 2 different mechanistic pathways. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and is responsible for a huge and growing health care burden in the developed and developing world. The Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) approach has shown 75%‐84% prediction accuracy of identifying individuals with AD risk.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this study we tested the prediction accuracy of AD, MCI and amyloid deposition risks with PRS, including and excluding <i>APOE</i> genotypes in a large publicly available data set with extensive phenotypic data: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. Among MCI individuals with amyloid positive status we examined PRS prediction accuracy in those who converted to AD. In addition, we divided polygenic risk score by biological pathways and tested them independently for distinguishing between AD, MCI and amyloid deposition.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that AD and MCI are predicted by both <i>APOE</i> genotype and PRS (AUC=0.82% and 68%, respectively). Amyloid deposition is predicted by <i>APOE</i> only (AUC=79%). Further progression to AD of individuals with MCI and amyloid positive status is predicted by PRS over and above <i>APOE</i> (AUC=67%).</p>
<p>In pathway‐specific PRSs analyses the protein‐lipid complex has the strongest association with AD and amyloid deposition even when genes in <i>APOE</i> region were removed (p=0.0055 and p=0.0079, respectively).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The results showed different pattern of <i>APOE</i> contribution in PRS risk predictions of AD/MCI and amyloid deposition. Our study suggests that <i>APOE</i> mostly contributes to amyloid accumulation and the PRS affects risk of further conversion to AD.</p>

Abstract<p>Microglia play a pivotal role in maintaining homeostasis of the CNS. There is growing interest in understanding how microglia influence normal brain function and disease progression. Several microglia-specific Cx3cr1-Cre lines have been developed and have become indispensable tools in many investigations of microglial function. However, some recent studies have reported that these lines may have significant leakage into neurons. Other studies have reported that Cx3cr1 is expressed in non-microglial cells, including neurons and astrocytes, in vitro or in vivo either during brain development or upon neurological insult. All these reports raise serious concerns about the trustworthiness of these Cre-lines and whether the conclusions drawn from previous studies are valid. Here, we found that a floxed fluorescent reporter mouse line which has been frequently used to verify Cre lines displayed spontaneous expression of the GFP reporter, independent of Cre recombinase, thus revealing a potential caveat in assessing cre lines. We further confirmed that two Cx3cr1-Cre mouse lines can drive fluorescent reporter expression largely restrictively in microglia. Finally, we clarified that these two mouse lines maintain microglia-specific expression even following excitatory injury. Together, our findings confirm that two previously created Cx3cr1-Cre lines remain as invaluable tools for studying microglia. Moreover, to ensure the quality of data generated and the soundness of conclusions drawn from such data, it should be compulsory to thoroughly examine reporter lines for spontaneous leakiness when labeling cells to study CNS function and diseases.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Microglia-specific Cre-lines are essential for studying the role of microglia in the CNS. Several Cx3cr1-Cre lines have been developed and used in a number of landmark studies. However, there is growing concern in the microglia research community regarding potential leakiness of Cre-lines into neurons. The conclusions drawn from previous studies are also being questioned and key ongoing studies have been stalled. We found that a GFP-reporter mouse lines used in a previous study displays spontaneous leakiness into neurons, independent of Cre recombinase. Furthermore, we confirmed that two Cre-lines are microglia-specific and thus can be redeployed without hesitation. Our study also suggests that testing for potential leakiness of GFP-reporter lines should be included as a control in cell-tracing experiments.</p>

Although the evolutionarily conserved functions of the ventral striatal components have been used as a priori knowledge for further studies, whether these functions are conserved between species remains unclear. In particular, whether macroscopic connectivity supports this given the disproportionate volumetric differences between species in the brain regions that project to the ventral striatum, including the prefrontal and limbic areas, has not been established. The evolutionarily conserved functions of the ventral striatal components have been suggested and used as a priori knowledge for further studies. However, whether this hypothesis is supported by macroscopic connectivity remains unclear, especially when considering the disproportionate volumetric differences between species in the brain regions known to project to the ventral striatum, including the prefrontal and limbic areas. In this study, the human and macaque striatum was first tractographically parcellated to define the ventral striatum and its two subregions, the nucleus accumbens (Acb)-like and the neurochemically unique domains of the Acb and putamen (NUDAPs)-like divisions. Our results revealed a similar topographical distribution of the connectivity-based ventral striatal components in the two primate brains. Successively, a set of targets was extracted to construct a connectivity fingerprint to characterize these parcellation results, enabling cross-species comparisons. Our results indicated that the connectivity fingerprints of the ventral striatum-like divisions were dissimilar in the two species. We localized this difference to specific targets to analyze possible interspecies functional modifications. Our results also revealed interspecies-convergent connectivity ratio fingerprints of the target group to these two ventral striatum-like subregions. This convergence may suggest synchronous connectional changes of these ventral striatal components during primate evolution.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00619">The Age-Related Central Auditory Processing Disorder: Silent Impairment of the Cognitive Ear</a></h4>

Age-related hearing loss (ARHL), also called presbycusis, is a progressive disorder affecting hearing functions and among the elderly has been recognized as the third most frequent condition. Among ARHL components, the age-related central auditory processing disorder (CAPD) refers to changes in the auditory network, negatively impacting auditory perception and/or the speech communication performance. The relationship between auditory-perception and speech communication difficulties in age-related CAPD is difficult to establish, mainly because many older subjects have concomitant peripheral ARHL and age-related cognitive changes. In the last two decades, the association between cognitive impairment and ARHL has received great attention. Peripheral ARHL has recently been defined as the modifiable risk factor with the greatest impact on the development of dementia. Even if very few studies have analyzed the relationship between cognitive decline and age-related CAPD, a strong association was highlighted. Therefore, age-related CAPD could be a specific process related to neurodegeneration. Since these two disorders can be concomitant, drawing causal inferences is difficult. The assumption that ARHL, particularly age-related CAPD, may increase the risk of cognitive impairment in the elderly remains unchallenged. This review aims to summarize the evidence of associations between age-related CAPD and cognitive disorders and to define the diagnostic procedure of CAPD in the elderly. Finally, we highlight the importance of tailoring the rehabilitation strategy to this relationship. Future longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes and the use of adequate assessment tools that can disentangle cognitive dysfunction from sensory impairments are warranted.

Positron Emission Tomography (PET) represents a unique molecular tool to get in vivo access to a wide spectrum of biological and neuropathological processes, of crucial relevance for neurodegenerative conditions. Although most PET findings are based on massive univariate approaches, in the last decade the increasing interest in multivariate methods has paved the way to the assessment of unexplored cerebral features, spanning from resting state brain networks to whole-brain connectome properties. Currently, the combination of molecular neuroimaging techniques with multivariate connectivity methods represents one of the most powerful, yet still emerging, approach to achieve novel insights into the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. In this Review, we will summarize the available evidence in the field of PET molecular connectivity, with the aim to provide an overview of how these studies may increase the understanding of the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, over and above “traditional” structural/functional connectivity studies. Considering the available evidence, a major focus will be represented by molecular connectivity studies using [18F]FDG-PET, today applied in the major neuropathological spectra, from amyloidopathies and tauopathies to synucleinopathies and beyond. Pioneering studies using PET tracers targeting brain neuropathology and neurotransmission systems for connectivity studies will be discussed, and their strengths and limitations highlighted with reference to both applied methodology and results interpretation. The most common methods for molecular connectivity assessment will be reviewed, with particular emphasis on the available strategies to investigate molecular connectivity at the single-subject level, of potential relevance for not only research but also diagnostic purposes. Finally, we will highlight possible future perspectives in the field, with reference in particular to newly available PET tracers, which will expand the application of molecular connectivity to new, exciting, unforeseen possibilities.

Studies of functional neurosurgery and electroencephalography in Parkinson’s disease have demonstrated abnormally synchronous activity between basal ganglia and motor cortex. 
Functional neuroimaging studies investigated brain dysfunction during motor task or resting state and primarily have shown altered patterns of activation and connectivity for motor areas. L-dopa administration relatively normalized these functional alterations.
The aim of this pilot study was to examine the effects of L-dopa administration on functional connectivity in early-stage PD, as revealed by simultaneous recording of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalographic (EEG) data.
Six patients with diagnosis of probable PD underwent EEG-fMRI acquisitions (1.5 T MR scanner and 64-channel cap) before and immediately after the intake of L-dopa. Regions of interest in the primary motor and sensorimotor regions were used for resting state fMRI analysis. From the EEG data, weighted partial directed coherence was computed in the inverse space after the removal of gradient and cardioballistic artifacts.
FMRI results showed that the intake of L-dopa increased functional connectivity within the sensorimotor network, and between motor areas and both attention and default mode networks. 
EEG connectivity among regions of the motor network did not change significantly, while regions of the default mode network showed a strong tendency to increase their outflow toward the rest of the brain.
This pilot study provided a first insight into the potentiality of simultaneous EEG-fMRI acquisitions in PD patients, showing for both techniques the analogous direction of increased connectivity after L-dopa intake, mainly involving motor, dorsal attention and default mode networks.

Brain functional connectivity network (BFCN) analysis has been widely used in diagnosis of mental disorder, such as schizophrenia. In BFCN methods, the brain network construction is one of the core tasks due to its great influence on the diagnosis result. Most of the existing BFCN construction methods only consider the first-order relationship existing in each pair of brain regions and ignore the useful high-order information, including multi-regions correlation in the whole brain. Some of the early schizophrenia patients have subtle changes in brain function networks, which cannot be detected in conventional BFCN construction methods. It is well known that the high-order method is usually more sensitive to the subtle changes in signal than the low-order method. For exploiting the high-order information among brain regions, we define the triplet correlation among three brain regions, and derive the second-order brain network based on the connectivity difference and ordinal information in each triplet. For making full use of the complementary information in different brain networks, we proposed a hybrid approach to fuse the first-order and second-order brain networks. The proposed method is applied to identifying the biomarkers of schizophrenia. The experimental results on six schizophrenia datasets (totally including 439 patients and 426 controls) show that the proposed method outperforms the existing brain network methods in diagnosis of schizophrenia.

Tissue morphology and mechanics are crucial to the regulation of organ function. Investigating the exceptionally complex tissue of the brain at the sub-micron scale turns out to be challenging due to the complex structure and softness of this tissue despite the large interest of biologist, medical engineers, biophysicists and other sin this topic. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) both as an imaging and as a mechanical tool provides an excellent opportunity to study soft biological samples such as live brain tissues. Here we review the principles of AFM, the performance of AFM in tissue imaging and me-chanical mapping of cells and tissues, and finally opening the prospects and challenges of probing the biophysical properties of brain tissue using AFM.

Parkinson’s disease (PD) and related disorders are characterized by filamentous or fibrous structures consisting of abnormal α-synuclein in the brains of patients, and the distributions and spread of these pathologies are closely correlated with disease progression. L-DOPA (a dopamine precursor) is the most effective therapy for PD, but it remains unclear whether the drug has any effect on the formation and propagation of pathogenic abnormal α-synuclein in vivo. Here, we tested whether or not L-DOPA influences the prion-like spread of α-synuclein pathologies in a wild-type mouse model of α-synuclein propagation. To quantitate the pathological α-synuclein in mice, we prepared brain sections stained with an anti-phosphoSer129 (PS129) antibody after pretreatments with autoclaving and formic acid, and carefully analyzed positive aggregates on multiple sections covering the areas of interest using a microscope. Notably, a significant reduction in the accumulation of phosphorylated α-synuclein was detected in substantia nigra of L-DOPA/benserazide (a dopamine decarboxylase inhibitor)-treated mice, compared with control mice. These results suggest that L-DOPA may slow the progression of PD in vivo by suppressing the aggregation of α-synuclein in dopaminergic neurons and the cell-to-cell propagation of abnormal α-synuclein. This is the first report describing the suppressing effect of L-DOPA/benserazide on the propagation of pathological α-synuclein. The experimental protocols and detection methods in this study are expected to be useful for evaluation of drug candidates or new therapies targeting the propagation of α-synuclein.

Spinal cord edema,mainly including vasogenic and cytotoxic edema,influence neurological outcome after spinal cord contusion (SCC).Aquaporin 4 (AQP4) is the most ubiquitous water channel in central nervous system (CNS),which is a rate-limiting factor in vasogenic edema expressing in brain injury,and it contributes to the formation of cytotoxic edema locating in astrocytes.However,little is known the regulatory mechanism of AQP4 within vasogenic and cytotoxic edema in SCC,and whether regulation mechanism of AQP4 is related to Cytochrome coxidase (COX5A) affecting energy metabolism.Therefore,SCC model is established by Allen’s method,and the degree of edema and neuronal area is measured.Motor function of rats is evaluated by the Basso,Beattie,and Bresnahan (BBB) scoring system.Meanwhile,AQP4 and COX5A are detected by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot (WB).localization of targeted protein is exhibited by immunohistochemical staining (IHC) and immunofluoresce (IF).Besides,the methodology of AQP4 lentivirus-mediated RNA interference (AQP4-RNAi) is used to reveal the effect on edema of SCC and the regulating molecular mechanism. Firstly,we observe that tissue water content increase after SCC,and decrease after the peak value of tissue water content at 3 days (P&lt;0.05) with abundant expression of AQP4 protein locating around vascular endothelial cells,which suggests that the increasing AQP4 promotes water reabsorption and improves vasogenic edema in the early stage of SCC.However,neuronal area is larger than sham group in the 7 days(P&lt;0.05) with the total water content of spinal cord decrease.Meanwhile AQP4 migrate from vascular endothelial cells to neuronal cytomembrane,which indicates that AQP4 play a crucial role in aggravating the formation and development of cytotoxic edema in the middle stages of SCC. Secondly,AQP4-RNAi is used to elucidate the mechanism of AQP4 to edema of SCC.The neuronal area shrinks and the area of cytotoxic edema reduces after AQP4 downregulation.BBB scores is significantly higher than vector group after AQP4-RNAi at 5d,7d and 14d(P &lt; 0.05).There is a relationship between AQP4 and COX5A shown by bioinformatics analysis.After AQP4 inhibition,expression of COX5A significantly up-regulated in the swelling astrocytes.Therefore,inhibition of AQP4 expression reduces cytotoxic edema in SCC and improves motor function,which may associate with upregulation of COX5A via affecting energy metabolism.Moreover,it isn’t clear how the inhibition of AQP4 directly causes the upregulation of COX5A.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00205">Semantic Processing in Bilingual Aphasia: Evidence of Language Dependency</a></h4>

Individuals with aphasia frequently show lexical retrieval deficits due to increased interference of semantically related competitors, a phenomenon that can be observed in tasks such as naming pictures grouped by semantic category. These deficits are explained in terms of impaired semantic control, a set of abilities that are to some extent dependent upon executive control (EC). However, the extent to which semantic control abilities can be affected in a second and non-dominant language has not been extensively explored. Additionally, findings in healthy individuals are inconclusive regarding the degree to which semantic processing is shared between languages. In this study, we explored the effect of brain damage on semantic processing by comparing the performance of bilingual individuals with aphasia on tasks involving semantic control during word production and comprehension. Furthermore, we explored whether semantic deficits are related to domain-general (EC) deficits. 
First, we investigated the naming performance of Catalan-Spanish bilinguals with fluent aphasia and age-matched healthy controls on a semantically blocked cyclic naming task in each of their two languages. This task measured semantic interference in terms of the difference in naming latencies between pictures grouped by the same semantic category or different categories. Second, we explored whether lexical deficits extend to comprehension by testing participants in a word-picture matching task during a mixed language condition. Third, we used a conflict monitoring task to explore the presence of EC deficits in patients. 
We found two main results. First, in both language tasks, bilingual patients’ performances were more affected than those of healthy controls when they performed the task in their non-dominant language. Second, there was a significant correlation between the speed of processing on the EC task and the magnitude of the semantic interference effect exclusively in the non-dominant language.
Taken together, these results suggest that lexical retrieval may be selectively impaired in bilinguals within those conditions where semantic competition is higher and this could be explained by an excessive amount of language inhibition. Moreover, lexico-semantic impairments seem to be at least somewhat related to conflict monitoring deficits, suggesting a certain degree of overlap between EC and semantic control.

Growing evidence indicates that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neuropsychological disconnection syndrome that can be analysed using various complex network metrics used as pathology biomarkers. Recently, community detection and analysis rooted in the complex network and graph theories have been introduced to investigate the changes in resting-state functional network community structure under neurological pathologies. However, the potential of hidden patterns in the modular organisation of networks derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to predict brain pathology has never been investigated. In this study, we present a novel analysis technique to identify alterations in community patterns in functional networks under ASD. In addition, we design machine learning classifiers to predict the clinical class of patients with ASD and controls by using only community pattern quality metrics as features. Analyses conducted on six publicly available datasets from 235 subjects, including patients with ASD and age-matched controls revealed that the modular structure is significantly disturbed in patients with ASD. Machine learning algorithms showed that the predictive power of our five metrics is relatively high (~85.16 peak accuracy for in-site data and ~75.00% peak accuracy for multisite data). These results lend further credence to the dysconnectivity theory of this pathology.

Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have previously been shown to be useful tools for signal decoding and analysis in a variety of complex domains, such as image processing and speech recognition. By learning from large amounts of data, the representations encoded by these deep networks are often invariant to moderate changes in the underlying feature spaces. Recently, we proposed a CNN architecture that could be applied to electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding and analysis. In this article, we train our CNN model using data from prior experiments in order to later decode the P300 evoked response from an unseen, hold-out experiment. We analyze the CNN output as a function of the underlying variability in the P300 response and demonstrate that the CNN output is sensitive to the experiment-induced changes in the neural response. We then assess the utility of our approach as a means of improving the overall signal-to-noise ratio in the EEG record. Finally, we show an example of how CNN-based decoding can be applied to the analysis of complex data.

Abstract<p>Brain computations involve multiple processes by which sensory information is encoded and transformed to drive behavior. These computations are thought to be mediated by dynamic interactions between populations of neurons. Here we demonstrate that human brains exhibit a reliable sequence of neural interactions during speech production. We use an autoregressive hidden Markov model to identify dynamical network states exhibited by electrocorticographic signals recorded from human neurosurgical patients. Our method resolves dynamic latent network states on a trial-by-trial basis. We characterize individual network states according to the patterns of directional information flow between cortical regions of interest. These network states occur consistently and in a specific, interpretable sequence across trials and subjects: the data support the hypothesis of a fixed-length visual processing state, followed by a variable-length language state, and then by a terminal articulation state. This empirical evidence validates classical psycho-linguistic theories that have posited such intermediate states during speaking. It further reveals these state dynamics are not localized to one brain area or one sequence of areas, but are instead a network phenomenon.</p><p><b>Significance</b> Cued speech production engages a distributed set of brain regions that must interact with each other to perform this behavior rapidly and precisely. To characterize the spatio-temporal properties of the networks engaged in picture naming, we recorded from electrodes placed directly on the brain surfaces of patients with epilepsy being evaluated for surgical resection. We used a flexible statistical model applied to broadband gamma to characterize changing brain interactions. Unlike conventional models, ours can identify changes on individual trials that correlate with behavior. Our results reveal that interactions between brain regions are consistent across trials. This flexible statistical model provides a useful platform for quantifying brain dynamics during cognitive processes.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Outcome prediction in patients after cardiac arrest (CA) is challenging. Electroencephalographic reactivity (EEG‐R) might be a reliable predictor. We aimed to determine the prognostic value of EEG‐R using a standardized assessment.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a prospective cohort study, a strictly defined EEG‐R assessment protocol was executed twice per day in adult patients after CA. EEG‐R was classified as present or absent by 3 EEG readers, blinded to patient characteristics. Uncertain reactivity was classified as present. Primary outcome was best Cerebral Performance Category score (CPC) in 6 months after CA, dichotomized as good (CPC = 1–2) or poor (CPC = 3–5). EEG‐R was considered reliable for predicting poor outcome if specificity was ≥95%. For good outcome prediction, a specificity of ≥80% was used. Added value of EEG‐R was the increase in specificity when combined with EEG background, neurological examination, and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 160 patients enrolled, 149 were available for analyses. Absence of EEG‐R for poor outcome prediction had a specificity of 82% and a sensitivity of 73%. For good outcome prediction, specificity was 73% and sensitivity 82%. Specificity for poor outcome prediction increased from 98% to 99% when EEG‐R was added to a multimodal model. For good outcome prediction, specificity increased from 70% to 89%.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>EEG‐R testing in itself is not sufficiently reliable for outcome prediction in patients after CA. For poor outcome prediction, it has no substantial added value to EEG background, neurological examination, and SSEPs. For prediction of good outcome, EEG‐R seems to have added value.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Spasticity is one of the most common symptoms manifested in humans with spinal cord injury (SCI). The neural mechanisms contributing to its development are not yet understood. Using neurophysiological and imaging techniques, we examined the influence of residual descending motor pathways on spasticity in humans with SCI.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We measured spasticity in 33 individuals with motor complete SCI (determined by clinical examination) without preservation of voluntary motor output in the quadriceps femoris muscle. To examine residual descending motor pathways, we used magnetic and electrical stimulation over the leg motor cortex to elicit motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in the quadriceps femoris muscle and structural magnetic resonance imaging to measure spinal cord atrophy.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that 60% of participants showed symptoms of spasticity, whereas the other 40% showed no spasticity, demonstrating the presence of 2 clear subgroups of humans with motor complete SCI. MEPs were only present in individuals who had spasticity, and MEP size correlated with the severity of spasticity. Spinal cord atrophy was greater in nonspastic compared with spastic subjects. Notably, the degree of spared tissue in the lateral regions of the spinal cord was positively correlated with the severity of spasticity, indicating preservation of white matter related to motor tracts when spasticity was present.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results support the hypothesis that preservation of descending motor pathways influences spasticity in humans with motor complete SCI; this knowledge might help the rehabilitation and assessment of people with SCI. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To test whether systemic cytokine release is associated with central nervous system inflammatory responses and glial injury in immune effector cell‐associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) after chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)‐T cell therapy in children and young adults.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a prospective cohort study of clinical manifestations as well as imaging, pathology, CSF, and blood biomarkers on 43 subjects ages 1 to 25 who received CD19‐directed CAR/T cells for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Neurotoxicity occurred in 19 of 43 (44%) subjects. Nine subjects (21%) had CTCAE grade 3 or 4 neurological symptoms, with no neurotoxicity‐related deaths. Reversible delirium, headache, decreased level of consciousness, tremor, and seizures were most commonly observed. Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium (CAPD) scores ≥9 had 94% sensitivity and 33% specificity for grade ≥3 neurotoxicity, and 91% sensitivity and 72% specificity for grade ≥2 neurotoxicity. Neurotoxicity correlated with severity of cytokine release syndrome, abnormal past brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and higher peak CAR‐T cell numbers in blood, but not cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF levels of S100 calcium‐binding protein B and glial fibrillary acidic protein increased during neurotoxicity, indicating astrocyte injury. There were concomitant increases in CSF white blood cells, protein, interferon‐γ (IFNγ), interleukin (IL)‐6, IL‐10, and granzyme B (GzB), with concurrent elevation of serum IFNγ IL‐10, GzB, granulocyte macrophage colony‐stimulating factor, macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha, and tumor necrosis factor alpha, but not IL‐6. We did not find direct evidence of endothelial activation.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data are most consistent with ICANS as a syndrome of systemic inflammation, which affects the brain through compromise of the neurovascular unit and astrocyte injury. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We investigated whether cognitive reserve modifies the risk of dementia attributable to apolipoprotein ε4 (<i>APOE‐</i>ε4), a well‐known genetic risk factor for dementia.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We followed 2,556 cognitively intact participants aged ≥60 years from the ongoing prospective community‐based Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen (SNAC‐K). Dementia was ascertained through clinical and neuropsychological assessments and diagnosed according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition criteria. Structural equation modeling was used to generate a cognitive reserve indicator from 4 previously validated contributors: early life education, midlife substantive work complexity, late life leisure activities, and late life social networks. Cox proportional hazard models estimated dementia risk in relation to cognitive reserve indicator. The interaction between the cognitive reserve indicator and <i>APOE‐</i>ε4 was assessed on multiplicative and additive scales.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>After an average of 6.3 years (range = 2.1–10.7) of follow‐up, 232 dementia cases were ascertained. Relative to individuals in the lowest tertile of cognitive reserve indicator, those with moderate and high reserve were at a reduced risk of dementia. There was no multiplicative interaction between <i>APOE‐</i>ε4 status and cognitive reserve indicator (<i>p</i> = 0.113). Additive interaction was statistically significant. Relative to <i>APOE‐</i>ε4 carriers with low cognitive reserve, ε4 carriers with high reserve had a reduced risk of dementia (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.13–0.59). The magnitude of risk reduction was similar in ε4 noncarriers with a high cognitive reserve indicator (HR = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.15–0.40).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Lifelong engagement in reserve‐enhancing activities attenuates the risk of dementia attributable to <i>APOE</i>‐ε4. Promoting cognitive reserve might be especially effective in subpopulations with high genetic risk of dementia. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth (CMT) disease 4B1 and 4B2 (CMT4B1/B2) are characterized by recessive inheritance, early onset, severe course, slowed nerve conduction, and myelin outfoldings. CMT4B3 shows a more heterogeneous phenotype. All are associated with myotubularin‐related protein (MTMR) mutations. We conducted a multicenter, retrospective study to better characterize CMT4B.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We collected clinical and genetic data from CMT4B subjects in 18 centers using a predefined minimal data set including Medical Research Council (MRC) scores of nine muscle pairs and CMT Neuropathy Score.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There were 50 patients, 21 of whom never reported before, carrying 44 mutations, of which 21 were novel and six representing novel disease associations of known rare variants. CMT4B1 patients had significantly more‐severe disease than CMT4B2, with earlier onset, more‐frequent motor milestones delay, wheelchair use, and respiratory involvement as well as worse MRC scores and motor CMT Examination Score components despite younger age at examination. Vocal cord involvement was common in both subtypes, whereas glaucoma occurred in CMT4B2 only. Nerve conduction velocities were similarly slowed in both subtypes. Regression analyses showed that disease severity is significantly associated with age in CMT4B1. Slopes are steeper for CMT4B1, indicating faster disease progression. Almost none of the mutations in the <i>MTMR2</i> and <i>MTMR13</i> genes, responsible for CMT4B1 and B2, respectively, influence the correlation between disease severity and age, in agreement with the hypothesis of a complete loss of function of MTMR2/13 proteins for such mutations.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This is the largest CMT4B series ever reported, demonstrating that CMT4B1 is significantly more severe than CMT4B2, and allowing an estimate of prognosis. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

Stem cells can stay quiescent for long period of time or proliferate and differentiate into multiple lineages. The activity of stage-specific metabolic programs allows stem cells to best adapt their functions in different microenvironments. Specific cellular phenotypes can be, therefore, defined by precise metabolic signatures. Notably, not only cellular metabolism describes a defined cellular phenotype, but experimental evidences now clearly indicate that also rewiring cells towards a particular cellular metabolism can drive their cellular phenotype and function accordingly. 
Cellular metabolism can be studied by both targeted and untargeted approaches. Targeted analyses focus on a subset of identified metabolites and on their metabolic fluxes. In addition, the overall assessment of the oxygen consumption rate gives a measure of the overall cellular oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial function.  Untargeted approach provides a large-scale identification and quantification of the whole metabolome with the aim to describe a metabolic fingerprinting. 
In this review, we overview the methodologies currently available for the study of in vitro stem cell metabolism, including metabolic fluxes, fingerprint analyses, and single cell metabolomics. Moreover, we summarize available approaches for the study of in vivo stem cell metabolism. For all of the described methods, we highlight their specificities and limitations. In addition, we discuss practical concerns about the most threatening steps, including metabolic quenching, sample preparation and extraction. A better knowledge of the precise metabolic signature defining specific cell population is instrumental to the design of novel therapeutic strategies able to drive undifferentiated stem cells towards a selective and valuable cellular phenotype.

Noise trauma causes loss of synaptic connections between cochlear inner hair cells (IHCs) and the spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). Such synaptic loss can trigger slow and progressive degeneration of SGNs. Macrophage fractalkine signaling is critical for neuron survival in the injured cochlea, but its role in cochlear synaptopathy is unknown. Fractalkine, a chemokine, is constitutively expressed by SGNs and signals via its receptor CX3CR1 that is expressed on macrophages. The present study characterized the immune response and examined the function of fractalkine signaling in degeneration and repair of cochlear synapses following noise trauma. Adult mice wild type, heterozygous and knockout for CX3CR1 on a C57BL/6 background were exposed for 2 hours to an octave band noise at 90 dB SPL. Noise exposure caused temporary shifts in hearing thresholds without any evident loss of hair cells in CX3CR1 heterozygous mice that have intact fractalkine signaling. Enhanced macrophage migration towards the inner hair cell-synaptic region was observed immediately after exposure in all genotypes. Synaptic immunolabeling revealed a rapid loss of synapses throughout the basal turn of the cochlea of all genotypes. The damaged synapses spontaneously recovered in mice with intact CX3CR1. However, CX3CR1 knockout (KO) animals displayed enhanced synaptic degeneration that correlated with attenuated suprathreshold neural responses at higher frequencies. Exposed CX3CR1 KO mice also exhibited increased loss of IHCs and SGN cell bodies compared to exposed heterozygous mice. These results indicate that macrophages can promote repair of damaged synapses after moderate noise trauma and that repair requires fractalkine signaling.

Peripheral electrical stimulation (PES), which encompasses several techniques with heterogeneous physiological responses, has shown in some cases remarkable outcomes for pain treatment and clinical rehabilitation. However, results are still mixed, mainly because there is a lack of understanding regarding its neural mechanisms of action. In this study, we aimed to assess its effects by measuring cortical activation as indexed by functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). fNIRS is a functional optical imaging method to evaluate hemodynamic changes in oxygenated (HbO) and de-oxygenated (HbR) blood hemoglobin concentrations in cortical capillary networks that can be related to cortical activity. We hypothesized that non-painful PES of accessory spinal nerve (ASN) can promote cortical activation of sensorimotor cortex (SMC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) pain processing cortical areas. Fifteen healthy volunteers received both active and sham ASN electrical stimulation in a randomized crossover study. The hemodynamic cortical response to unilateral right ASN burst electrical stimulation with 10 Hz was measured by a 40-channel fNIRS system. The effect of ASN electrical stimulation over HbO concentration in cortical areas of interest was observed through the activation of right-DLPFC (p=0.025) and left-SMC (p=0.042) in the active group but not in sham group. Regarding left-DLPFC (p=0.610) and right-SMC (p=0.174) there was no statistical difference between groups. As in non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) top-down modulation, bottom-up electrical stimulation to the accessory spinal nerve seems to activate the same critical cortical areas on pain pathways related to sensory-discriminative and affective-motivational pain dimensions. These results provide additional mechanistic evidence to develop and optimize the effects of peripheral neural electrical stimulation. (NCT 03295370 - clinicaltrials.gov).

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00199">Links Between the Amplitude Modulation of Low-Frequency Spontaneous Fluctuation Across Resting State Conditions and Thalamic Functional Connectivity</a></h4>

A comparison of the different types of resting state reveals some interesting characteristics of spontaneous brain activity that cannot be found in a single condition. Differences in the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) between the eyes open (EO) and the eyes closed (EC) almost have a spatially distinct pattern with traditional EO-EC activation within sensory systems, suggesting the divergent functional roles of ALFF and activation. However, the underlying mechanism is far from clear. Since the thalamus plays an essential role in sensory processing, one critical step towards understanding the divergences is to depict the relationships between the thalamus and the ALFF modulation in sensory regions. In this preliminary study, we examined the association between the changes of ALFF and the changes of thalamic functional connectivity (FC) between EO and EC. We focused on two visual thalamic nuclei, the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and the pulvinar (Pu). FC results showed that LGN had stronger synchronization with regions in lateral but not in medial visual networks, while Pu had a weaker synchronization with auditory and sensorimotor areas during EO compared with EC. Moreover, the patterns of FC modulation exhibited considerable overlaps with the ALFF modulation, and there were significant correlations between them across subjects. Our findings support the crucial role of the thalamus in amplitude modulation of low-frequency spontaneous activity in sensory systems, and may pave the way to elucidate the mechanisms governing distinction between evoked activation and modulation of low-frequency spontaneous brain activity.

Background
The fronto-striatal network is involved in various motor, cognitive and emotional processes, such as spatial attention, working memory, decision-making and emotion regulation. Intermittent theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (iTBS) has been shown to modulate functional connectivity of brain networks. Long stimulation intervals, as well as high stimulation intensities are typically applied in transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy for mood disorders. The role of stimulation intensity on network function and homeostasis has not been explored systematically yet. 
Objective
We aimed to modulate fronto-striatal connectivity by applying iTBS at different intensities to the left dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). We measured individual and group changes by comparing resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) pre-iTBS und post iTBS. Differential effects of individual sub- versus supra-resting motor-threshold stimulation intensities were assessed.
Methods
Sixteen healthy subjects underwent excitatory iTBS at two intensities (90 % and 120 % of individual resting motor threshold) on separate days. 600 pulses (2 s trains, 8 s pauses, duration of 3 minutes, 20 seconds) were applied over the left DLPFC. Directly before and 7 min after stimulation, task-free rsfMRI sessions, lasting 10 min each, were conducted. Individual seed-to-seed functional connectivity changes were calculated for ten fronto-striatal and amygdala regions of interest with the SPM toolbox DPABI.
Results
Sub-threshold-iTBS increased functional connectivity directly between the left DLPFC and the left and right caudate, respectively, as well as between the right DLPFC and the left caudate. Indirectly, functional connectivity between the right putamen and the left nucleus accumbens and the left amygdala, respectively, was increased. 
Supra-threshold stimulation did not change fronto-striatal functional connectivity, but only increased functional connectivity between the left amygdala and the caudate nuclei, as well as the left putamen, respectively.
Conclusion
A short iTBS protocol applied at sub-threshold intensities was not only sufficient, but favourable in order to increase bilateral fronto-striatal functional connectivity, while minimising side effects. Decreased functional connectivity after supra-threshold stimulation was possibly caused by network homeostatic effects.

It is often assumed that Hebbian synaptic plasticity forms a cell assembly, a mutually interacting group of neurons that encodes memory. However, in recurrently connected networks with pure Hebbian plasticity, cell assemblies typically diverge or fade under ongoing changes of synaptic strength. Previously assumed mechanisms that stabilize cell assemblies do not robustly reproduce the experimentally reported unimodal and long-tailed distribution of synaptic strengths. Here, we show that augmenting Hebbian plasticity with experimentally observed intrinsic spine dynamics can stabilize cell assemblies and reproduce the distribution of synaptic strengths. Moreover, we posit that strong intrinsic spine dynamics impair learning performance. Our theory explains how excessively strong spine dynamics, experimentally observed in several animal models of autism spectrum disorder, impair learning associations in the brain.

Transient potassium current channels (IA channels), which are expressed in most brain areas, have a central role in modulating feedforward and feedback inhibition along the dendroaxonic axis. Loss of the modulatory channels is tightly associated with a number of brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, fragile X syndrome, Parkinson’s disease, chronic pain, tinnitus, and ataxia. However, the functional significance of IA channels in these diseases has so far been underestimated. In this review, we discuss the distribution and function of IA channels. Particularly, we posit that downregulation of IA channels results in neuronal (mostly dendritic) hyperexcitability accompanied by imbalanced excitation and inhibition ratio in the brain's networks, eventually causing the brain diseases. Finally, we propose a potential therapeutic target: the enhanced action of IA channels to counteract Ca2+-permeable channels including NMDA receptors could be harnessed to restore dendritic excitability, leading to a balanced neuronal state.

The role of neuroinflammation has been increasingly recognized in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. Many studies focusing on the glial cells involved in the inflammatory responses of the brain, namely microglia and astroglia, have over the years pointed out the dynamic and changing behavior of these cells, accompanied by different morphologies and activation forms. This is particularly evident in diseased conditions, where glia react to any shift from homeostasis, acquiring different phenotypes. Particularly for microglia, it has soon become clear that such phenotypes are multiple, as multiple are the functions related to them. Several approaches have over time revealed different facets of microglial phenotypic diversity, and advanced genetic analyses, in recent years, have added new insights into microglial heterogeneity, opening novel scenarios that researchers have just started to explore. Among neurodegenerative diseases, an important section is represented by alpha-synucleinopathies. Here alpha-synuclein accumulates abnormally in the brain and, depending on its pattern of distribution, leads to the development of different clinical conditions. Also for these proteinopathies, neuroinflammation and glial activation have been identified as constant and crucial factors during disease development. In the present review we will address the current literature about glial phenotypic changes with respect to alpha-synucleinopathies, as well as consider the pathophysiological and therapeutic implications of such a dynamic cellular behavior.

Ketamine exposure in the developing brain disturbed normal neurogenesis and resulted in subsequent neurocognitive deficits. 17β-estradiol provides robust neuroprotection in a variety of brain injury models in animals of both sexes and attenuates neurodegeneration induced by anesthesia agents. In the present study, we investigated whether 17β-estradiol could attenuate disturbed neurogenesis and behavioural deficits induced by ketamine exposure in neonatal rats.
Sprague-Dawley rats at postnatal day (PND) 7 and neural stem cells (NSCs) were treated with either normal saline, ketamine, or 17β-estradiol prior/after ketamine exposure, respectively. The rats were decapitated at PND14 for detection of neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampus by immunostaining. NSC proliferation, neuronal differentiation, and apoptosis were assessed by immunohistochemistry and TUNEL, respectively. The protein expressions of caspase-3 in vivo and GSK-3β, p-GSK-3β in vitro were assessed by western blotting. Spatial learning and memory abilities were measured by the Morris water maze test at PND 42-47.
Ketamine exposure decreased cell proliferation in the SVZ and SGZ, inhibited NSC proliferation and neuronal differentiation, promoted NSC apoptosis and led to late cognitive deficits. Furthermore, ketamine increased caspase-3 expression in vivo and decreased protein expressions of p-GSK-3β in vitro. Treatment with 17β-estradiol attenuated ketamine-elicited changes both in vivo and in vitro.
We for the first time showed that 17β-estradiol alleviated ketamine-induced neurogenesis damage and neurocognitive deficits in developing rat brain. Moreover, the protection of17β-estradiol is associated with the GSK-3β.

Although the hippocampus plays a critical role in spatial and episodic memories, the mechanisms underlying memory formation, stabilization, and recall for adaptive behavior remain relatively unknown. During exploration, within single cycles of the ongoing theta rhythm that dominates hippocampal local field potentials, place cells form precisely ordered sequences of activity. These neural sequences result from the integration of both external inputs conveying sensory-motor information, and intrinsic network dynamics possibly related to memory processes. Their endogenous replay during subsequent sleep is critical for memory consolidation. The present review discusses possible mechanisms and functions of hippocampal theta sequences during exploration. We present several lines of evidence suggesting that these neural sequences play a key role in information processing and support the formation of initial memory traces, and discuss potential functional distinctions between neural sequences emerging during theta versus awake sharp-wave ripples.

The aging retinal pigment epithelium and oxidative stress, mediated by reactive oxygen species accumulation, have been implicated in the mechanisms of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The expression level of the adapter protein p66shc, a key protein that regulates cellular oxidative stress, is relatively low under normal conditions because of the effects of silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1) on the binding of fully deacetylated histone H3’ to the p66shc promoter region, thus inhibiting p66shc transcription and expression. The equilibrium between SIRT1 and p66shc is disrupted in the presence of various stresses, including AMD. As a major target gene, SIRT1 is regulated by microRNA-34a (miR-34a), and overexpression of miR-34a results in significant inhibition of post-transcriptional expression of SIRT1. Furthermore, our recent studies demonstrated that miR-34a is significantly upregulated, accompanied by reduced tolerance to oxidative stress in hydrogen peroxide-induced prematurely senescent ARPE-19 cells. Moreover, the expression of SIRT1 is decreased, whereas that of p66shc is increased in these cells. Accordingly, miR-34a may play a key role in age-related susceptibility to oxidative stress in ARPE-19 cells by targeting the SIRT1/p66shc pathway, leading to AMD. In this review, we discuss the functions of miR-34a in modulating the SIRT1/p66shc pathway in age-related conditions, including AMD.

Abstract<p>Thanks to patients Phineas Gage and Henry Molaison, we have long known that behavioral control depends on the frontal lobes, whereas declarative memory depends on the medial temporal lobes (MTL). For decades, cognitive functions – behavioral control, declarative memory – have served as labels for characterizing the division of labor in cortex. This approach has made enormous contributions to understanding how the brain enables the mind, providing a systems-level explanation of brain function that constrains lower-level investigations of neural mechanism. Today, the approach has evolved such that functional labels are often applied to brain networks rather than focal brain regions. Furthermore, the labels have diversified to include both broadly-defined cognitive functions (declarative memory, visual perception) and more circumscribed mental processes (recollection, familiarity, priming). We ask whether a process – a high-level mental phenomenon corresponding to an introspectively-identifiable cognitive event – is the most productive label for dissecting memory. For example, recollection conflates a neurocomputational <i>operation</i> (pattern completion-based retrieval) with a class of <i>representational content</i> (associative, high-dimensional memories). Because a full theory of memory must identify operations and representations separately, and specify how they interact, we argue that processes like recollection constitute inadequate labels for characterizing neural mechanisms. Instead, we advocate considering the component operations and representations of processes like recollection in isolation. For the organization of memory, the evidence suggests that pattern completion is recapitulated widely across the ventral visual stream and MTL, but the division of labor between sites within this pathway can be explained by representational content.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Accounts of cognition often assume that the brain is organized along lines of cognitive process, for example, with recollection mediated by one neural structure and familiarity by another. We argue that cognitive processes – introspectively-identifiable mental events like recollection – are inadequate labels for characterizing neural mechanisms, because they conflate lower-level components of the mechanisms we seek to identify. Recollection involves both a neurocomputational operation (pattern completion) and a neural representation (high-dimensional, associative content). To uncover memory's mechanisms, we must decompose memory processes into their operations and representations, asking how each contributes to mnemonic phenomena. Decomposing recollection suggests that, within the ventral visual pathway and MTL, different brain regions contribute to memory retrieval according to their representational content.</p>

Abstract
<p>Dopamine is hypothesized to convey error information in reinforcement learning tasks with explicit appetitive or aversive cues. However, during motor skill learning feedback signals arise from an animal’s evaluation of sensory feedback resulting from its own behavior, rather than any external reward or punishment. It has previously been shown that intact dopaminergic signaling from the ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra pars compacta (VTA/SNc) complex is necessary for vocal learning when songbirds modify their vocalizations to avoid hearing distorted auditory feedback (playbacks of white noise). However, it remains unclear whether dopaminergic signaling underlies vocal learning in response to more naturalistic errors (pitch-shifted feedback delivered via headphones). We used male Bengalese finches (<i>Lonchura striata</i> var. <i>domestica</i>) to test the hypothesis that the necessity of dopamine signaling is shared between the two types of learning. We combined 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions of dopaminergic terminals within Area X, a basal ganglia nucleus critical for song learning, with a headphones learning paradigm that shifted the pitch of auditory feedback and compared their learning to that of unlesioned controls. We found that 6-OHDA lesions affected song behavior in two ways. First, over a period of days lesioned birds systematically lowered their pitch regardless of the presence or absence of auditory errors. Second, 6-OHDA lesioned birds also displayed severe deficits in sensorimotor learning in response to pitch-shifted feedback. Our results suggest roles for dopamine in both motor production and auditory error processing, and a shared mechanism underlying vocal learning in response to both distorted and pitch-shifted auditory feedback.</p>

<p>The cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin corrects neurological phenotypes in animal models of fragile X syndrome (FX), a commonly identified genetic cause of autism and intellectual disability (ID). The therapeutic efficacy of lovastatin is being tested in clinical trials for FX; however, the structurally similar drug simvastatin has been proposed as an alternative due to an increased potency and brain penetrance. Here, we perform a side-by-side comparison of the effects of lovastatin and simvastatin treatment on two core phenotypes in <i>Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup></i> mice versus WT littermates: excessive hippocampal protein synthesis and susceptibility to audiogenic seizures (AGSs). We find that simvastatin does not correct excessive hippocampal protein synthesis in the <i>Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup></i> hippocampus at any dose tested. In fact, simvastatin significantly increases protein synthesis in both <i>Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup></i> and WT. Moreover, injection of simvastatin does not reduce AGS in the <i>Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup></i> mouse, while lovastatin significantly reduces AGS incidence and severity versus vehicle-treated animals. These results show that unlike lovastatin, simvastatin does not correct core phenotypes in the <i>Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup></i> mouse model.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00147">Accelerated Age-Related Degradation of the Tectorial Membrane in the Ceacam16βgal/βgal Null Mutant Mouse, a Model for Late-Onset Human Hereditary Deafness DFNB113</a></h4>

CEACAM16 is a non-collagenous protein of the tectorial membrane, an extracellular structure of the cochlea essential for normal hearing. Dominant and recessive mutations in CEACAM16 have been reported to cause postlingual and progressive forms of deafness in humans. In a previous study of young Ceacam16 βgal/βgal null mutant mice on a C57Bl/6J background, the incidence of spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAEs) was greatly increased relative to Ceacam16+/+ and Ceacam16+/βgal mice, but auditory brain-stem responses (ABRs) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were near normal, indicating auditory thresholds were not significantly affected. To determine if the loss of CEACAM16 leads to hearing loss at later ages in this mouse line, cochlear structure and auditory function were examined in Ceacam16+/+, Ceacam16+/βgal and Ceacam16βgal/βgal mice at 6 and 12 months of age and compared to that previously described at 1 month.  Analysis of older Ceacam16βgal/βgal mice reveals a progressive loss of matrix from the core of the tectorial membrane that is more extensive in the apical, low-frequency regions of the cochlea. In Ceacam16βgal/βgal mice at 6-7 months, the DPOAE magnitude at 2f1-f2 and the incidence of SOAEs both decrease relative to young animals. By ~12 months, SOAEs and DPOAEs are not detected in Ceacam16βgal/βgal mice and ABR thresholds are increased by up to ~40 dB across frequency, despite a complement of hair cells similar to that present in Ceacam16+/+ mice. Although SOAE incidence decreases with age in Ceacam16βgal/βgal mice, it increases in ageing heterozygous Ceacam16+/βgal mice and is accompanied by a reduction in the accumulation of CEACAM16 in the tectorial membrane relative to controls. An apically-biased loss of matrix from the core of the tectorial membrane, similar to that observed in young Ceacam16βgal/βgal mice, is also seen in Ceacam16+/+ and Ceacam16+/βgal  mice, and other strains of wild-type mice, but at much later ages. The loss of Ceacam16 therefore accelerates age-related degeneration of the tectorial membrane leading, as in humans with mutations in CEACAM16, to a late-onset progressive form of hearing loss.

Atypical Parkinson Syndromes (APSs) often have symptoms that overlap with those of Parkinson's disease (PD), especially in early in disease, making these disorders difficult to diagnose. Previous studies have demonstrated association of oligomeric α-synuclein (α-Syn), a key element in the pathogenesis of PD, with Sirtuin (SIRT)2 proteins for modulating PD. We aimed to evaluate SIRT proteins expression in serum of PD patients and compare it with APSs and normal elderly control (GC); and correlate with α-Syn. SIRT proteins expression was evaluated in sera of 68 PD; 34 APS and 68 GC without any neuro-psychiatric illness as controls by Surface Plasmon Resonance. SIRT2 expression was correlated with α-Syn in PD and GC. Significant (p&lt;0.0001) differences were observed between serum SIRT2 concentration in PD and APS and GC; and between APS and GC. ROC analysis revealed the strong cut off value to differentiate PD from APS and GC and also APS from GC. Significant correlation was observed among SIRT2 levels in early PD patients with UPDRS, H and Y and increase duration of disease. In addition, a strong positive correlation of SIRT2 with α-Syn (p&lt;0.0001) was observed. However, no such difference was detected for serum SIRT1 in cases of PD and APS; and GC. The present study is the first to report elevated serum SIRT2 in PD. The study also provided a simple test to distinguish PD from APS and may have translational utility for diagnosis.

Background: Short-latency intracortical inhibition (SICI) and motor surround inhibition (mSI) are cortical phenomena that have been investigated with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). mSI is believed to be necessary for the execution of fine finger movements, and SICI may participate in mSI genesis, however, the mechanisms underlying both mSI and SICI are not entirely clear. Objective: We explored the cortical physiology of SICI and mSI in healthy subjects by TMS-evoked cortical potentials (TEPs). Methods: Single (sp) and paired-pulse (pp) TMS were delivered on the ADM muscle cortical hotspot while recording EEG and EMG. Three conditions were tested: spTMS and ppTMS at rest, and spTMS at the onset of an index finger movement. SICI and mSI were calculated on the ADM motor evoked potential (MEP) and two groups were defined based on the presence of mSI. Average TEPs were calculated for each condition and for five regions of interest. Results: At movement onset we observed a widespread reduction of the inhibitory late component N100 suggesting cortical facilitation associated with motor performance. At motor cortex level, SICI and mSI are associated with similar modulation of TEPs consisting in a reduction of P30 and an increase of N45 amplitude. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that SICI and mSI modulate cortical excitability with shared inhibitory mechanisms.

Neurodegenerative diseases present a major and increasing burden in the societies worldwide. With aging populations, the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases is increasing, yet there are no effective cures and very few treatment options are available. Alzheimer’s disease is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative conditions and although the pathology is well studied, the pathogenesis of this debilitating illness is still poorly understood. This is, among other reasons, also due to the lack of good animal models as laboratory rodents do not develop spontaneous neurodegenerative diseases and human Alzheimer’s disease is only partially mimicked by transgenic rodent models. On the other hand, older dogs commonly develop canine cognitive dysfunction, a disease that is similar to Alzheimer’s disease in many aspects. Dogs show cognitive deficits that could be paralleled to human symptoms such as disorientation, memory loss, changes in behavior, and in their brains, beta amyloid plaques are commonly detected both in extracellular space as senile plaques and around the blood vessels. Dogs could be therefore potentially a very good model for studying pathological process and novel treatment options for Alzheimer’s disease. In the present article, we will review the current knowledge about the pathogenesis of canine cognitive dysfunction, its similarities and dissimilarities with Alzheimer’s disease, and developments of novel treatments for these two diseases with a focus on canine cognitive dysfunction.

Recent advances in image acquisition and processing techniques, along with the success of novel deep learning architectures, have given the opportunity to develop innovative algorithms capable to provide a better characterization of neurological related diseases. In this work, we introduce a neural network based approach to classify Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients into four clinical profiles. Starting from their structural connectivity information, obtained by diffusion tensor imaging and represented as a graph, we evaluate the classification performances using unweighted and weighted connectivity matrices. Furthermore, we investigate the role of graph- based features for a better characterization and classification of the pathology. 90 MS patients (12 clinically isolated syndrome, 30 relapsing-remitting, 28 secondary-progressive, and 20 primary- progressive) along with 24 healthy controls, were considered in this study. This work shows the great performances achieved by neural networks methods in the classification of the clinical profiles. Furthermore, it shows local graph metrics do not improve the classification results suggesting that the latent features created by the neural network in its layers have a much important informative content. Finally, we observe that graph weights representation of brain connections preserve important information to discriminate between clinical forms.

Purpose: Estimation of uncertainty of MAP-MRI metrics
is an important topic, for several reasons. Bootstrap derived
uncertainty, such as the standard deviation, provides
valuable information, and can be incorporated in MAP-MRI
studies to provide more extensive insight.

Methods: In this paper, the uncertainty of different MAPMRI
metrics was quantified by estimating the empirical distributions
using the wild bootstrap. We applied the wild
bootstrap to both phantom data and human brain data, and
obtain empirical distributions for theMAP-MRImetrics returnto-
origin probability (RTOP), non-Gaussianity (NG) and propagator
anisotropy (PA).

Results: We demonstrated the impact of diffusion acquisition
scheme (number of shells and number of measurements
per shell) on the uncertainty of MAP-MRI metrics.
We demonstrated how the uncertainty of these metrics can
be used to improve group analyses, and to compare different
preprocessing pipelines. We demonstrated that with
uncertainty considered, the results for a group analysis can
be different.

Conclusion: Bootstrap derived uncertain measures provide
additional information to the MAP-MRI derived metrics, and
should be incorporated in ongoing and future MAP-MRI
studies to provide more extensive insight.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00198">Disparities in Diffuse Cortical White Matter Integrity Between Socioeconomic Groups</a></h4>

There is a growing literature demonstrating a link between lower socioeconomic status (SES) and poorer neuroanatomical health, such as smaller total and regional gray and white matter volumes, as well as greater white matter lesion volumes. Little is known, however, about the relation between SES and white matter integrity. Here we examined the relation between SES and white matter integrity of the brain’s primary cortical regions, and evaluated potential moderating influences of age and self-identified race. Participants were 192 neurologically intact, community-dwelling African American and White adults (mean age = 52 years; 44% male, 60% White, low SES = 52%) from the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) SCAN study. Participants underwent 3.0-T cranial magnetic resonance imaging. Diffusion tensor imaging was used to estimate regional fractional anisotropy (FA) to quantify the brain’s white matter integrity and trace to capture diffusivity. Multiple regression analyses examined independent and interactive associations of SES, age, and race with FA of the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes bilaterally. Sensitivity analyses assessed the influence of several biopsychosocial risk factors on these associations. Exploratory analyses examined these relations with trace and using additional SES indicators. Results indicated there were no significant interactions of SES, age, and race for any region. Individuals with low SES had lower FA in all regions, and higher trace in the right and left frontal, right and left temporal, and left occipital lobes. Findings remained largely unchanged after inclusion of sensitivity variables. Older age was associated with lower FA and greater trace for all regions, except for the right temporal lobe with FA. No main effects were found for race in FA, and Whites had higher trace values in the parietal lobes. Novel findings of this study indicate that relative to the high SES group, low SES was associated with poorer white matter integrity and greater diffusivity. These results may, in part, reflect exposures to various biopsychosocial risk factors experienced by those of lower SES across the lifespan, and may help explain the preponderance of cognitive and functional disparities between socioeconomic groups.

Verbal Working memory (vWM) capacity measures the ability to maintain and manipulate verbal information for a short period of time. The specific neural correlates of this construct are still a matter of debate. The aim of this study was to conduct a coordinate-based meta-analysis of 42 fMRI studies on visual vWM in healthy subjects (n=795, males=459, females=325, unknown=11; age range: 18-75). The studies were obtained after an exhaustive literature search on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Brainmap database. We analyzed regional activation differences during fMRI tasks with the anisotropic effect-size version of seed-based d mapping software (ES-SDM). The results were further validated by performing jackknife sensitivity analyses and heterogeneity analyses. We investigated the effect of numerous relevant influencing factors by fitting corresponding linear regression models. We isolated consistent activation in a network containing fronto-parietal areas, right cerebellum, and basal ganglia structures. Regarding lateralization, the results pointed towards a bilateral frontal activation, a left-lateralization of parietal regions and a right-lateralization of the cerebellum, indicating that the left-hemisphere concept of vWM should be reconsidered. We also isolated activation in regions important for response inhibition, emphasizing the role of attentional control in vWM. Moreover, we found a significant influence of mean reaction time, load and age on activation associated with vWM. Activation in left medial frontal gyrus, left precentral gyrus and left precentral gyrus turned out to be positively associated with mean reaction time whereas load was associated with activation across the PFC, fusiform gyrus, parietal cortex and parts of the cerebellum. In the latter case activation was mainly detectable in both hemispheres whereas the influence of age became manifest predominantly in the left hemisphere. This led us to conclude that future vWM studies should take these factors into consideration.

The “neural correlates of consciousness” (NCC) is a familiar topic in neuroscience, overlapping with research on the brain’s “default mode network”. Task-based studies of NCC by their nature recruit one part of the cortical network to study another, and are therefore both limited and compromised in what they can reveal about consciousness itself. The form of consciousness explored in such research, we term the human default consciousness (DCs), our everyday waking consciousness. In contrast, studies of anaesthesia, coma, deep sleep, or some extreme pathological states such as epilepsy, reveal very different cortical activity; all of which states are essentially involuntary, and generally regarded as “unconscious”. An exception to involuntary disruption of consciousness is Buddhist jhāna meditation, whose implicit aim is to intentionally withdraw from the default consciousness, to an inward-directed state of stillness referred to as jhāna consciousness, as a basis to develop insight. The default consciousness is sensorily-based, where information about, and our experience of, the outer world is evaluated against personal and organic needs and forms the basis of our ongoing self-experience. This view conforms both to Buddhist models, and to the emerging work on active inference and minimisation of free energy in determining the network balance of the human default consciousness. 

This paper is a preliminary report on the first detailed EEG study of jhāna meditation, with findings radically different to studies of more familiar, less focused forms of meditation. While remaining highly alert and “present” in their subjective experience, a high proportion of subjects display “spindle” activity in their EEG, superficially similar to sleep spindles of stage 2 nREM sleep, while more-experienced subjects display high voltage slow-waves reminiscent, but significantly different, to the slow waves of deeper stage 4 nREM sleep, or even high-voltage delta coma. Some others show brief posterior spike-wave bursts, again similar, but with significant differences, to absence epilepsy. Some subjects also develop the ability to consciously evoke clonic seizure-like activity at will, under full control. We suggest that the remarkable nature of these observations reflects a profound disruption of the human DCs when the personal element is progressively withdrawn.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00173">EEG Microstates Analysis in Young Adults With Autism Spectrum Disorder During Resting-State</a></h4>

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a useful tool to inspect the brain activity in resting-state and allows to characterize spontaneous brain activity that is not detected when a subject is cognitively engaged. Moreover, taking advantage of the high time resolution in EEG, it is possible to perform fast topographical reference-free analysis, since different scalp potential fields correspond to changes in the underlying sources within the brain. 
In this study, the spontaneous EEG resting-state (eyes closed) was compared between ten young adults ages 18-30 years with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and thirteen neurotypical controls. A microstate analysis was applied, focusing on four temporal parameters: mean duration, the frequency of occurrence, the ratio of time coverage, and the Global Explained Variance (GEV).
Using data that were acquired from a 65 channel EEG system, six resting-state topographies that best describe the dataset across all subjects were identified by running a two-step cluster analysis, labeled as microstate classes A-F. The results indicated that microstates B and E displayed a statistically significant differences between both groups among the temporal parameters evaluated. Classes B, D, E, and F were consistently more present in ASD, and class C in controls. The combination of these findings with the putative functional significance of the different classes suggests that during resting-state, the ASD group was more focused on visual scene-reconstruction, while the control group was more engaged with self-memory retrieval. Furthermore, from a connectivity perspective, the resting-state networks that have been previously associated with each microstate class overlap the brain regions implicated in impaired social communication and repetitive behaviors that characterize ASD.

Event-related fMRI have been widely used in locating brain regions that respond to specific tasks. However, activities of brain regions which modulate or indirectly participate in the response to a specific task are not event-related. Event-related fMRI can’t locate these regulatory regions, detrimental to the integrity of the result that event-related fMRI revealed. Direct-current EEG shifts (DC shifts) have been found linked to the inner brain activity, a fusion DC shifts-fMRI method may have the ability to reveal a more complete response of the brain. In this study, we used DC shifts-fMRI to verify that even when responding to a very simple task, 1). The response of the brain is complicated than event-related fMRI generally revealed; 2). DC shifts-fMRI have the ability of revealing brain regions whose responses are not in event-related way. We used a classical and simple paradigm which is often used in auditory cortex tonotopic mapping. Data were recorded from 50 subjects (25 male, 25 female) who were presented with randomly presented pure tone sequences with six different frequencies (200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, 6400 Hz). Our traditional fMRI results are consistent with previous findings that the activations are concentrate on the auditory cortex. Our DC shifts-fMRI results showed that the cingulate-caudate-thalamus network which underpins sustained attention is positively activated while the dorsal attention network and the right middle frontal gyrus which underpin attention orientation are negatively activated. The regional-specific correlations between DC shifts and brain networks indicate the complexity of the response of the brain even to a simple task and that the DC shifts can effectively reflect these non-event-related inner brain activities.

Small size of an axon and presynaptic structures have hindered direct functional analysis of axonal signaling and transmitter release at presynaptic boutons in the central nervous system. However, recent technical advances in subcellular patch-clamp recordings and in fluorescent imagings are shedding light on the dynamic nature of axonal and presynaptic mechanisms. Here I summarize the functional design of an axon and presynaptic boutons, such as diversity and activity-dependent changes of action potential waveforms, Ca2+ influx, and kinetics of transmitter release, revealed by the technical tour de force of direct patch-clamp recordings and the leading-edge fluorescent imagings. I highlight the critical factors for dynamic modulation of transmitter release and presynaptic short-term plasticity.

In hippocampal CA1, muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor (mAChR) activation via exogenous application of cholinergic agonists has been shown to presynaptically inhibit Schaffer collateral (SC) glutamatergic inputs in stratum radiatum (SR), and temporoammonic (TA) and thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE) glutamatergic inputs in stratum lacunosum-moleculare (SLM). However, steady-state uniform mAChR activation may not mimic the effect of ACh release in an intact hippocampal network. To more accurately examine the effect of ACh release on glutamatergic synaptic efficacy, we measured electrically evoked synaptic responses in CA1 pyramidal cells (PCs) following the optogenetic release of ACh in genetically modified mouse brain slices. The ratio of synaptic amplitudes in response to paired-pulse SR stimulation (stimulus 2/stimulus 1) was significantly reduced by the optogenetic release of ACh, consistent with a postsynaptic decrease in synaptic efficacy. The effect of ACh release was blocked by the M3 receptor antagonist 4-DAMP, the GABAB receptor antagonist CGP 52432, inclusion of GDP-β-S, cesium, QX314 in the intracellular patch clamp solution, or extracellular barium. These observations suggest that ACh release decreased SC synaptic transmission through an M3 muscarinic receptor-mediated increase in inhibitory interneuron excitability, which activate GABAB receptors and inwardly rectifying potassium channels on CA1 pyramidal cells. In contrast, the ratio of synaptic amplitudes in response to paired-pulse stimulation in the SLM was increased by ACh release, consistent with presynaptic inhibition. ACh-mediated effects in SLM were blocked by the M2 receptor antagonist AF-DX 116, presumably located on presynaptic terminals. Therefore, our data indicate that ACh release differentially modulates excitatory inputs in SR and SLM of CA1 through different cellular and network mechanisms.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00266">Hedgehog Pathway Activation Alters Ciliary Signaling in Primary Hypothalamic Cultures</a></h4>

Primary cilia dysfunction has been associated with hyperphagia and obesity in both ciliopathy patients and mouse models of cilia perturbation. Neurons throughout the brain possess these solitary cellular appendages, including in the feeding centers of the hypothalamus. Several cell biology questions associated with primary neuronal cilia signaling are challenging to address in vivo. Here we utilize primary hypothalamic neuronal cultures to study ciliary signaling in relevant cell types. Importantly, these cultures contain neuronal populations critical for appetite and satiety such as pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and agouti related peptide (AgRP) expressing neurons and are thus useful for studying signaling involved in feeding behavior. Correspondingly, these cultured neurons also display electrophysiological activity and respond to both local and peripheral signals that act on the hypothalamus to influence feeding behaviors, such as leptin and melanin concentrating hormone (MCH). Interestingly, we found that cilia mediated hedgehog signaling, generally associated with developmental processes, can influence ciliary GPCR signaling (Mchr1) in terminally differentiated neurons. Specifically, pharmacological activation of the hedgehog-signaling pathway using the smoothened agonist, SAG, attenuated the ability of neurons to respond to ligands (MCH) of ciliary GPCRs. Understanding how the hedgehog pathway influences cilia GPCR signaling in terminally differentiated neurons could reveal the molecular mechanisms associated with clinical features of ciliopathies, such as hyperphagia-associated obesity.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00256">Synaptic FUS Localization During Motoneuron Development and Its Accumulation in Human ALS Synapses</a></h4>

Mutations in the Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) gene induce cytoplasmic FUS aggregations, contributing to the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in certain cases. While FUS is mainly a nuclear protein involved in transcriptional processes with limited cytoplasmatic functions, it shows an additional somatodendritic localization in neurons. In this study we analyzed the localization of FUS in motoneuron synapses, these being the most affected neurons in ALS, using super-resolution microscopy to distinguish between the pre- and postsynaptic compartments. We report a maturation based variation of FUS localization in rodent synapses where a predominantly postsynaptic FUS was observed in the early stages of synaptic development, while in mature synapses the protein was entirely localized in the axonal terminal. Likewise, we also show that at the synapse of human motoneurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells of a healthy control, FUS is mainly postsynaptic in the early developmental stages. In motoneurons derived from ALS patients harboring a very aggressive juvenile FUS mutation, increased synaptic accumulation of mutated FUS was observed. Moreover increased aggregation of other synaptic proteins Bassoon and Homer1 was also detected in these abnormal synapses. Having demonstrated changes in the FUS localization during synaptogenesis, a role of synaptic FUS in both dendritic and axonal cellular compartments is probable, and we propose a gain-of-toxic-function due to the synaptic aggregation of mutant FUS in ALS.

Cell-based therapy is an alternative strategy to improve outcomes of peripheral nerve injury (PNI). Epidermal neural crest stem cell (EPI-NCSC) is obtained from autologous tissue without immunological rejection, which could expand quickly in vitro and is suitable candidate for cell-based therapy. Olfactory ensheathing cell (OEC) could secrete multiple neurotrophic factors, which is often used to repair PNI individually. However, whether the combination of EPI-NCSC and OEC have better effects on PNI repair remains unclear. Here we use EPI-NCSC and OEC co-transplantation in a rat sciatic nerve defect model to ascertain the effects and potential mechanisms of cells co-transplantation on PNI. The effect of EPI-NCSC and OEC co-transplantation on PNI is assessed by using a combination of immunohistochemistry (IHC), electrophysiological recording and neural function test. Co-transplantation of EPI-NCSC and OEC exerts a beneficial effect upon PNI such as better organized structure, nerve function recovery, and lower motoneuron apoptosis. IHC and ELISA further demonstrate that cells co-transplantation may improve PNI via the expression of BDNF and NGF up-regulated by EPI-NCSC and OEC synergistically. Eventually, the results from this study reveal that EPI-NCSC and OEC co-transplantation effectively repairs PNI through enhancing the level of BDNF and NGF, indicating that cells co-transplantation may serve as a fruitful avenue for PNI in clinic treatment.

Type 2 diabetes increases the risk for dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Pioglitazone (Pio), a pharmacological agonist of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), improves insulin sensitivity and has been suggested to have potential in the management of AD symptoms, albeit through mostly unknown mechanisms. We here investigated the potential of Pio to counter synaptic malfunction and loss, a characteristic of AD pathology and its accompanying cognitive deficits. Results from experiments on primary mouse neuronal cultures and a human neural cell line (SH-SY5Y) show that Pio treatment attenuates amyloid β (Aβ)-triggered the pathological (mis-)processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and inhibits Aβ-induced accumulation and hyperphosphorylation of Tau. These events are accompanied by increased glutamatergic receptor 2B subunit (GluN2B) levels that are causally linked with neuronal death. Further, Pio treatment blocks Aβ-triggered missorting of hyperphosphorylated Tau to synapses and the subsequent loss of PSD95-positive synapses. These latter effects of Pio are PPARγ-mediated since they are blocked in the presence of GW9662, a selective PPARγ inhibitor. Collectively, these data show that activated PPARγ buffer neurons against APP misprocessing, Tau hyperphosphorylation and its missorting to synapses and subsequently, synaptic loss. These first insights into the mechanisms through which PPARγ influences synaptic loss make a case for further exploration of the potential usefulness of PPARγ agonists in the prevention and treatment of synaptic pathology in AD.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00133">Mental Flexibility Influences the Association Between Poor Balance and Falls in Older People – A Secondary Analysis</a></h4>

Impairments of balance predispose older people to falls. Some cognitive functions, especially executive functioning have been shown to affect balance and discriminate fallers from non-fallers. Mental flexibility is a component of the executive function and comprises multiple cognitive processes that work together to adjust the course of thoughts or actions according to the changing demands of a situation without the use of explicit instructions. However, the role of mental flexibility in balance in older people remains unclear. Mental flexibility comprises complementary cognitive functions required for dealing with unpredictable environmental demands. The study aim was to examine the relationship between mental flexibility and falls in a cohort of 212 older people (80.6 ±4.9 years; 62% female). We hypothesized that: (i) participants with impaired balance would have worse mental flexibility compared to those with good balance; and (ii) poor mental flexibility would predict falls in the sub-group with impaired balance. Balance performance was assessed by measuring postural sway while standing on a medium density foam mat with eyes open for 30 seconds. Mental flexibility was assessed using a computerized short-form of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST; 64 cards) with its sub-components comprising general performance, perseveration, failure-to-maintain set and conceptual ability. Falls were measured prospectively for 12-months using monthly calendars. MANCOVA revealed that WCST performance was associated with balance (Wilks’ Lambda = 0.883, F=2.168; p=0.013, partial eta squared (η2p) =.061) due primarily to reduced concept formation ability (F2,207=5.787, p=0.004, η2p =.053). Negative binomial regression analysis adjusting for age, education, contrast sensitivity, proprioception, inhibition and inhibitory choice stepping reaction time revealed that lower concept formation ability was predictive for falls (Incidence Rate Ratio 1.0648 (95% confidence interval 1.0316-1.08199)). Further, lower concept formation ability partly explained the association between balance and falls: i.e. fallers in the upper balance tertile had reduced concept formation performance whereas non-fallers had similar concept formation performance across the three balance tertiles. These findings suggest that poor mental flexibility affects the ability to maintain steady balance contributing to increased risk of falls in older people.

Background and Purpose：This study aimed to investigate whether insulin resistance (IR) was associated with overall cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) burden, independent of other clinical risk factors in old nondiabetic healthy subjects.
Methods: We recruited old nondiabetic healthy subjects with no taking any medications prospectively. The overall effect of CSVD on the brain was described by validated CSVD score. The homeostasis model assessment–estimated insulin resistance index(HOMA-IR) was used for IR estimation, and HOMA-IR ≥2.80 was defined as IR. We evaluated the association between IR and increasing severity of CSVD score by ordinal regression models, adjusted for demographics and cardiovascular risk factors.
Results: Our study included 156 healthy participants. 34 showed IR, 122 showed non-IR. The mean age of the IR group was older than non-IR group(70.03± 7.30 versus 67.45 ±5.92, p=0.04), and the ratio of hypertension in IR was higher than non-IR.( 53.28% versus 82.35%, p&lt;0.01). The distribution of lacunar, CMB, EPVS and CSVD score was different between 2 groups, but the WMH. In ordinal regression analysis, IR was positively associated with increasing severity of the total CSVD score (adjusted odds ratio 3.74, 95%CI was 1.63-5.08, and p&lt;0.01 ) after adjusting for traditional risk factors. Furthermore, HOMA-IR levels revealed a positive dose-dependent correlation with the total CSVD score(p &lt;0.01, p for trend &lt;0.01).
Conclusions: IR was independently associated with  increasing severity of overall CSVD burden, independent of other clinical risk factors in nondiabetic healthy adult population. Furthermore, HOMA-IR level is correlated with CSVD burden in a dose-dependent manner.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00146">Effects of the LPA1 Receptor Deficiency and Stress on the Hippocampal LPA Species in Mice</a></h4>

Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is an important bioactive lipid species that functions in intracellular signaling through six characterized G protein-coupled receptors (LPA1–6). Among these receptors, LPA1 is a strong candidate to mediate the central effects of LPA on emotion and may be involved in promoting normal emotional behaviors. Alterations in this receptor may induce vulnerability to stress and predispose an individual to a psychopathological disease. In fact, mice lacking the LPA1 receptor exhibit emotional dysregulation and cognitive alterations in hippocampus-dependent tasks. Moreover, the loss of this receptor results in a phenotype of low resilience with dysfunctional coping in response to stress and induces anxiety and several behavioral and neurobiological changes that are strongly correlated with mood disorders. In fact, our group proposes that maLPA1-null mice represent an animal model of anxious depression.
However, despite the key role of the LPA-LPA1-pathway in emotion and stress coping behaviors, the available information describing the mechanisms by which the LPA-LPA1-pathway regulates emotion is currently insufficient. Because activation of LPA1 requires LPA, here, we used a Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/ Ionization mass spectrometry-based approach to evaluate the effects of an LPA1 receptor deficiency on the hippocampal levels of LPA species. Additionally, the impact of stress on the LPA profile was also examined in both wild-type (WT) and the Malaga variant of LPA1-null mice (maLPA1-null-mice). Mice lacking LPA1 did not exhibit gross perturbations in the hippocampal LPA species, but the LPA profile was modified, showing an altered relative abundance of 18:0 LPA. Regardless of the genotype, restraint stress produced profound changes in all LPA species examined, revealing that hippocampal LPA species are a key target of stress. Finally, the relationship between the hippocampal levels of LPA species and performance in the elevated plus maze was established. 
	To our knowledge, this study is the first to detect, identify and profile LPA species in the hippocampus of both LPA1-receptor null mice and WT mice at baseline and after acute stress, as well as to link these LPA species with anxiety-like behaviors. In conclusion, the hippocampal LPA species are a key target of stress and may be involved in psychopathological conditions.

Hypothermia therapy is an old and important method of neuroprotection. Until now, many neurological diseases such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, intracranial pressure elevation, subarachnoid hemorrhage, spinal cord injury, hepatic encephalopathy, and neonatal peripartum encephalopathy have proven to be suppressed by therapeutic hypothermia. Beneficial effects of therapeutic hypothermia have also been discovered, and progress has been made towards improving the benefits of therapeutic hypothermia further through combinations with other neuroprotective treatments and by probing the mechanism of hypothermia neuroprotection. In this review, we compare different hypothermia induction methods and provide a summarized account of the synergistic effect of hypothermia therapy with other neuroprotective treatments along with an overview of hypothermia neuroprotection mechanisms and cold/hypothermia-induced proteins.

There is much controversy about the optimal trade-off between blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) sensitivity and spatial precision in experiments on brain’s topology properties using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The sparse empirical evidence and regional specificity of these interactions pose a practical burden for the choice of imaging protocol parameters. Here, we test in a motor somatotopy experiment the impact of fMRI spatial resolution on differentiation between body part representations in cortex and subcortical structures. Motor somatotopy patterns were obtained in a block-design paradigm and visually cued movements of face, upper and lower limbs at 1.5, 2 and 3 mm3 spatial resolution. The degree of segregation of the body parts’ spatial representations was estimated using a pattern component model. In cortical areas, we observed the same level of segregation between somatotopy maps across all three resolutions. In subcortical areas the degree of effective similarity between spatial representations was significantly impacted by the image resolution. The 1.5 mm 3D EPI and 3 mm 2D EPI protocols led to higher segregation between motor representations compared to the 2 mm 3D EPI protocol. This finding could not be attributed to differential BOLD sensitivity or delineation of functional areas alone and suggests a crucial role of the image encoding scheme (2D vs 3D EPI). Our study contributes to the field by providing empirical evidence about the impact of acquisition protocols for the delineation of somatotopic areas in cortical and sub-cortical brain regions.

Network dysfunction is well established in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and has been shown to be present early in the disease. This is especially interesting in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) since the majority later develop AD. In EEG, one type of network analysis is microstates where the EEG is divided into quasi-stable states and these microstates have been linked to networks found with resting state functional MRI. In the current exploratory study, we therefore wanted to explore the changes in microstates in MCI, and AD compared to healthy controls (HC) and whether microstates were able to separate patients with MCI who progressed (pMCI) and those who remained stable (sMCI). EEGs were recorded at baseline for 17 patients with AD, 27 patients with MCI, and 38 older HC and the patients were followed for three years. To investigate whole-brain dynamics we extracted different microstate parameters. We found that patients with MCI, and AD had significantly higher occurrence (p-value = 0.028), and coverage (p-value = 0.010) for microstate A compared to HC. However, we did not find any significant systematic deviation of the transition probabilities from randomness for any of the groups. No significant differences were found between pMCI and sMCI but the largest difference in duration was found for microstate C. Microstate A has been linked to the temporal lobes in studies combining EEG and fMRI and the temporal lobes are the most affected by AD pathology in the early stages of the disease. This supports our idea that microstate A may be the first affected microstate in early AD.  Even though not significant between pMCI and sMCI, Microstate C has previously been shown to be associated with the cingulate gyri in fMRI and studies have found that posterior cingulate cortex is associated with progression from MCI to AD. However, larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Neurodegenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are increasing in prevalence but lack targeted therapeutics. Although the pathological mechanisms behind these diseases remain unclear, both ALS and FTD are characterized pathologically by aberrant protein aggregation and inclusion formation within neurons, which correlates with neurodegeneration. Notably, aggregation of several key proteins, including TAR DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), and tau, have been implicated in these diseases. Proteomics methods are being increasingly applied to better understand disease-related mechanisms and to identify biomarkers of disease, using model systems as well as human samples. Proteomics-based approaches offer unbiased, high-throughput, and quantitative results with numerous applications for investigating proteins of interest. Here, we review recent advances in the understanding of ALS and FTD pathophysiology obtained using proteomics approaches, and we assess technical and experimental limitations. We compare findings from various mass spectrometry approaches including quantitative proteomics methods such as stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) and tandem mass tagging (TMT) to approaches such as label-free quantitation (LFQ) and sequential windowed acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion mass spectra (SWATH-MS) in studies of ALS and FTD. Similarly, we describe disease-related protein-protein interaction (PPI) studies using approaches including immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry (IP-MS) and proximity dependent biotin identification (BioID) and discuss future application of new techniques including proximity-dependent ascorbic acid peroxidase labelling (APEX) and biotinylation by antibody recognition (BAR). Furthermore, we explore the use of mass spectrometry to detect post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination and phosphorylation, of disease-relevant proteins in ALS and FTD. We also discuss upstream technologies that enable enrichment of proteins of interest, highlighting the contributions of new techniques to isolate disease-relevant protein inclusions including flow cytometric analysis of inclusions and trafficking (FloIT). These recently developed approaches, as well as related advances yet to be applied to studies of these neurodegenerative diseases, offer numerous opportunities for discovery of potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers for ALS and FTD.

It is evident the need for designing and validating novel biomarkers for the detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI patients have a high risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and for that reason the introduction of novel and reliable biomarkers is of significant clinical importance. Motivated by recent findings about the rich information of dynamic functional connectivity graphs (DFCGs) about brain (dys)function, we introduced a novel approach of identifying MCI based on magnetoencephalographic (MEG)  resting state recordings. 
The activity of different brain rhythms {δ, θ, α1, α2, β1, β2, γ1, γ2} was first beamformed with linear constrained minimum norm variance in the MEG data to determine ninety anatomical regions of interest (ROIs). A dynamic functional connectivity graph (DFCG) was then estimated using the imaginary part of phase lag value (iPLV) for both intra-frequency coupling (8) and also cross-frequency coupling pairs (28). We analysed DFCG profiles of neuromagnetic resting state recordings of 18 Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients and 20 healthy controls. We followed our model of identifying the dominant intrinsic coupling mode (DICM) across MEG sources and temporal segments that further leads to the construction of an integrated DFCG (iDFCG). We then filtered statistically and topologically every snapshot of the iDFCG with data-driven approaches. Estimation of the normalized Laplacian transformation for every temporal segment of the iDFCG and the related eigenvalues created a 2D map based on the network metric time series of the eigenvalues (NMTSeigs). NMTSeigs preserves the non-stationarity of the fluctuated synchronizability of iDCFG for each subject. Employing the initial set of 20 healthy elders and 20 MCI patients, as training set, we built an overcomplete dictionary set of network microstates (nμstates). Afterward, we tested the whole procedure in an extra blind set of 20 subjects for external validation. 
We succeeded a high classification accuracy on the blind dataset (85 %) which further supports the proposed Markovian modelling of the evolution of brain states. The adaptation of appropriate neuroinformatic tools that combine advanced signal processing and network neuroscience tools could manipulate properly the non-stationarity of time-resolved FC patterns revealing a robust biomarker for MCI.

Developmental body topography, particularly of the face, is a fundamental research topic in the current decade. However, empirical investigation of this topic for very young children faces a number of difficulties related to the task requirements and technical procedures. In this study, we developed a new task to study the spatially-sensed position of facial parts in a self-face recognition task for 2.5- and 3.5-year-old children. Using the technique of augmented reality (AR) and 3D face tracking technology, we presented participants with their projected self-image on a screen, accompanied by a digital mark located on parts of their face. We prepared a cheerful visual and auditory reward on the screen when participants showed correct localization of the mark. We then tested whether they could indicate the position of the mark on their own faces and remain motivated for task repetition. To assess the efficacy of this task, thirty-one 2.5- and eleven 3.5-year-old children participated in this study. About half of the 2.5-year-olds and 80% of the 3.5-year-olds could perform more than 30 trials. Our new task, then, was to maintain young children’s motivation for task repetition using the cheerful visual and auditory reward. The analysis of localization errors suggested the uniqueness of spatial knowledge of self-face in young children. The efficacy of this new task for studying the development of body image has been confirmed.

The olfactory bulb (OB) is the first processing station in the olfactory pathway. Despite smell impairment is considered an early event in Alzheimer´s disease (AD), little is known about the initial molecular disturbances that accompany the AD development at olfactory level. We have interrogated the time-dependent OB molecular landscape in Tg2576 AD mice prior to the appearance of neuropathological amyloid plaques (2-, and 6-month-old), using combinatorial omics analysis. The metabolic modulation induced by human mutated amyloid precursor protein (APP) overproduction clearly differs between both time points. Besides the progressive perturbation of the APP interactome, functional network analysis unveiled an inverse regulation of downstream extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) routes in 2-month-old Tg2576 mice respect to wild-type (WT) mice. In contrast, Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase Kinase 4 (SEK1)/ stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) axis were parallel activated in the OB of 6-months-old-Tg2576 mice. Furthermore, a survival kinome profiling performed during the aging process (2-, 6-, and 18-month-old) revealed that olfactory APP overexpression leads to changes in the activation dynamics of protein kinase A (PKA), and SEK1/MKK4-SAPK/JNK between 6 and 18 months of age, when memory deficits appear and AD pathology is well established in transgenic mice. Interestingly, both olfactory pathways were differentially activated in a stage-dependent manner in human sporadic AD subjects with different neuropathological grading. Taken together, our data reflect the early impact of mutated APP on the OB molecular homeostasis, highlighting the progressive modulation of specific signaling pathways during the olfactory amyloidogenic pathology.

Many neurodegenerative diseases manifest in an overall aged population, the pathology of which is hallmarked by abnormal protein aggregation. It is known that across aging, sleep quality becomes less efficient and protein homeostatic regulatory mechanisms deteriorate. There is a known relationship between extended wakefulness and poorly consolidated sleep and an increase in cellular stress. In an aged population, when sleep is chronically poor, and proteostatic regulatory mechanisms are less efficient, the cell is inundated with misfolded proteins and suffers a collapse in homeostasis. In this review, we explore the interplay between aging, sleep quality, and proteostasis and how these processes are implicated in the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s disease. We also present data suggesting that reducing cellular stress and improving proteostasis and sleep quality could serve as potential therapeutic solutions for the prevention or delay in the progression of these diseases.

Behavioral and physiological evidence suggests that developmental changes lead to enhanced cortical differentiation and integration through maturation and learning, and that senescent changes during aging result in dedifferentiation and reduced cortical specialization of neural cell assemblies. We used electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings to evaluate network structure and network topology dynamics during rest with eyes closed and open, and during auditory oddball task across the lifespan. For this evaluation, we constructed a hyper-frequency network (HFN) based on within- and cross-frequency coupling (WFC and CFC, respectively) at 10 oscillation frequencies ranging between 2 and 20 Hz. We found that WFC increased monotonously across the lifespan, whereas CFC showed a U-shaped relationship. These changes in WFC and CFC strengths coevolve with changes in network structure and network topology dynamics, namely the magnitude of graph-theoretical topology measures increased linearly with age (except for characteristic path length, which is going shorter), while their standard deviation showed an inverse U-shaped relationship with a peak in young adults. Temporal as well as structural or nodal similarity of network topology (with some exceptions) seems to coincide with variability changes, i.e., stronger variability is related to higher similarity between consecutive time windows or nodes. Furthermore, network complexity measures showed different lifespan-related patterns, which depended on the balance of WFC and CFC strengths. Both variability and complexity of HFNs were strongly related to the perceptual speed scores. Finally, investigation of the modular organization of the networks revealed higher number of modules and stronger similarity of community structures across time in young adults as compared with children and older adults. We conclude that network variability and complexity measures reflect temporal and structural topology changes in the functional organization and reorganization of neuronal cell assemblies across the lifespan.

Phase-amplitude coupling is a promising construct to study cognitive processes in electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetencephalography (MEG). Due to the novelty of the concept, various measures are used in the literature to calculate phase-amplitude coupling. Here, performance of the three most widely used phase-amplitude coupling measures – phase-locking value (PLV), mean vector length (MVL), and modulation index (MI) – and of the generalized linear modeling cross-frequency coupling (GLM-CFC) method is thoroughly compared with the help of simulated data. We combine advantages of previous reviews and use a realistic data simulation, examine moderators and provide inferential statistics for the comparison of all four indices of phase-amplitude coupling. Our analyses show that all four indices successfully differentiate coupling strength and coupling width when monophasic coupling is present. While the mean vector length was most sensitive to modulations in coupling strengths and width, only the modulation index and GLM-CFC can detect biphasic coupling. Coupling values of all four indices were influenced by moderators including data length, signal-to-noise-ratio, and sampling rate when approaching Nyquist frequencies. The modulation index was most robust against confounding influences of these moderators. Based on our analyses, we recommend the modulation index for noisy and short data epochs with unknown forms of coupling. For high quality and long data epochs with monophasic coupling and a high signal-to-noise ratio, the use of the mean vector length is recommended. Ideally, both indices are reported simultaneously for one data set.

Diffusion MR images are prone to severe geometric distortions induced by head movement, eddy-current and inhomogeneity of magnetic susceptibility. Various correction methods have been proposed that depend on the choice of the acquisition settings and potentially provide highly different data quality. However, the impact of this choice has not been evaluated in terms of the ratio between scan time and preprocessed data quality. This study aims at investigating the impact of six well-known preprocessing methods, each associated to specific acquisition settings, on the outcome of diffusion analyses. For this purpose, we developed a comprehensive toolbox called Diffuse which automatically guides the user to the best preprocessing pipeline according to the input data. Using MR images of 20 subjects from the HCP dataset, we compared the six pre-processing pipelines regarding the following criteria: the ability to recover brain’s true geometry, the tensor model estimation and derived indices in the white matter, and finally the spatial dispersion of six well known connectivity pathways. As expected, the pipeline associated to the longer acquisition fully repeated with reversed phase-encoding (RPE) yielded the higher data quality and was used as a reference to evaluate the other pipelines. In this way, we highlighted several significant aspects of other pre-processing pipelines. Our results first established that eddy-current correction improves the tensor-fitting performance with a localized impact especially in the corpus callosum. Concerning susceptibility distortions, we showed that the use of a field map is not sufficient and involves additional smoothing, yielding to an artificial decrease of tensor-fitting error. Of most importance, our findings demonstrate that, for an equivalent scan time, the acquisition of a b0 volume with RPE ensures a better brain’s geometry reconstruction and local improvement of tensor quality, without any smoothing of the image. This was found to be the best scan time / data quality compromise. To conclude, this study highlights and attempts to quantify the strong dependence of diffusion metrics on acquisition settings and preprocessing methods.

As a consequence of worldwide improvement in health care, the aging portion of the human population has increased, now representing a higher proportion of the total population. This fact raises great concern regarding how to age while maintaining good brain function. Very often, alterations in brain electrophysiological signaling are associated with age-dependent functional disorders of the brain. Therefore, animal models suitable for the study of age-related changes in electrical activity of the brain can be very useful. Herein, we review changes in brain electrophysiological features as a function of age by analyzing studies in the rat brain on the phenomenon known as cortical spreading depression (CSD). Alterations in the brain’s capability to generate and propagate CSD may be related to differences in the propensity to develop certain neurological diseases, such as epilepsy, stroke, and migraine, which can biunivocally interact with the aging process. In this review, we revisit ours and others’ previous studies on electrophysiological features of the CSD phenomenon, such as its velocity of propagation and amplitude and duration of its slow negative DC shift, as a function of the animal age, as well as the interaction between age and other factors, such as ethanol consumption, physical exercise, and nutritional status. In addition, we discuss one relatively new feature through which CSD modulates brain signaling: the ability to potentiate the brain’s spontaneous electrical activity. We conclude that the CSD model might importantly contribute to a better understanding of the aging/brain signaling relationship.

Intrinsic functional connectivity of large-scale brain networks has been shown to change with aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD).  These alterations are thought to reflect changes in synaptic function, but the underlying biological mechanisms are poorly understood. This study examined whether Neuronal Pentraxin 2 (NPTX2), a synaptic protein that mediates homeostatic strengthening of inhibitory circuits to control cortical excitability, is associated with functional connectivity as measured by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) in five large-scale cognitive brain networks.  In this cross-sectional study, rsfMRI scans were obtained from 130 older individuals (mean age=69 years) with normal cognition (N=113) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (N=17); NPTX2 was measured in the same individuals in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).   Higher levels of NPTX2 in CSF were associated with greater functional connectivity in the salience/ventral attention network, based on linear regression analysis. Moreover, this association was stronger among individuals with lower levels of cognitive reserve, as measured by a composite score (comprised of years of education, reading, and vocabulary measures). Additionally, higher connectivity in the salience/ventral attention network was related to better performance on a composite measure of executive function. Levels of NPTX2 were not associated with connectivity in other networks (executive control, limbic, dorsal attention, and default-mode). Findings also confirmed prior reports that individuals with MCI have lower levels of NPTX2 compared to those with normal cognition. Taken together, the results suggest that NPTX2 mechanisms may play a central role among older individuals in connectivity within the salience/ventral attention network and for cognitive tasks that require modulation of attention and response selection.

The current ‘one size fits all’ approach to our cognitive aging population is not adequate to close the gap between cognitive health span and lifespan.  In this review paper, we present a  a novel  model for understanding, preventing, and treating age-related cognitive impairment (ARCI) based on the concepts precision medicine.  We will discuss how multiple risk factors can be classified into risk categories because of their interrelatedness in real life, the brain drivers or common mechanisms mediating brain aging, and the genetic variants that increase sensitivity to, or ameliorate, risk for ARCI. Rather than providing a definitive model of risk for ARCI and cognitive decline, the Precision Aging model is meant as a starting point to guide future research. To that end, after briefly discussing key risk categories, brain drivers, and genetic risks, we conclude with a discussion of steps that can be taken to move the field forward.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00148">Axon Guidance and Collective Cell Migration by Substrate-Derived Attractants</a></h4>

Neurons have evolved specialized growth structures to reach and innervate their target cells. These growth cones express specific receptor molecules that sense environmental cues and transform them into steering decisions. Historically, various concepts of axon guidance have been developed to better understand how axons reach and identify their targets. The essence of these efforts seems to be that growth cones require solid substrates, and that major guidance decisions are initiated by extracellular cues. These sometimes highly conserved ligands and receptors have been extensively characterized and mediate four major guidance forces: chemoattraction, chemorepulsion, contact attraction and contact repulsion. However, during development, cells, too, do migrate in order to reach molecularly-defined niches at target locations. In fact, axonal growth could be regarded as a special case of cellular migration, where only a highly polarized portion of the cell is elongating. Here, I combine several examples from genetically tractable model organisms, such as Drosophila or zebrafish, in which cells and axons are guided by attractive cues. Regardless, if these cues are secreted into the extracellular space or exposed on cellular surfaces, migrating cells and axons seem to keep close contact to these attractants and seem to detect them right at their source. Migration towards and along such substrate-derived attractants seem to be particularly robust, as genetic deletion induces obvious searching behaviors and permanent guidance errors. In addition, forced expression of these factors in ectopic tissues is highly distractive too, regardless of the pattern of other endogenous cues. Thus, guidance and migration towards and along attractive tissues is a powerful steering mechanism that exploits affinity differences to the surroundings and, in some instances, determines growth trajectories from source to target region.

Background: Analysis of the human connectome using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) started in the mid-1990s and attracted increasing attention in attempts to discover the neural underpinnings of human cognition and neurological disorders. In general, brain connectivity patterns from fMRI data are classified as statistical dependencies (functional connectivity) or causal interactions (effective connectivity) among various neural units. Computational methods, especially graph theory-based methods, have recently played a significant role in understanding brain connectivity architecture.

Objectives: Thanks to the emergence of graph theoretical analysis, the main purpose of the current paper is to systematically review how brain properties can emerge through the interactions of distinct neuronal units in various cognitive and neurological applications using fMRI. Moreover, this article provides an overview of the existing functional and effective connectivity methods used to construct the brain network, along with their advantages and pitfalls.

Methods: In this systematic review, the databases Science Direct, Scopus, arXiv, Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, PsycINFO, PubMed, and SpringerLink are employed for exploring the evolution of computational methods in human brain connectivity from 1990 to the present, focusing on graph theory. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool was used to assess the risk of bias in individual studies.

Results: Our results show that graph theory and its implications in cognitive neuroscience have attracted the attention of researchers since 2009 (as the Human Connectome Project launched), because of their prominent capability in characterizing the behavior of complex brain systems. Although graph theoretical approach can be generally applied to either functional or effective connectivity patterns during rest or task performance, to date, most articles have focused on the resting-state functional connectivity.

Conclusions: This review provides an insight into how to utilize graph theoretical measures to make neurobiological inferences regarding the mechanisms underlying human cognition and behavior as well as different brain disorders.

The neurons of the olivocerebellar circuit exhibit complex electroresponsive dynamics, which are thought to play a fundamental role for network entraining, plasticity induction, signal processing and noise filtering. In order to reproduce these properties in single-point neuron models, we have optimized the Extended-Generalized Leaky Integrate and Fire (E-GLIF) neuron through a multi-objective gradient-based algorithm targeting the desired input-output relationships. In this way, E-GLIF was tuned toward the unique input-output properties of Golgi cells, granule cells, Purkinje cells, molecular layer interneurons, deep cerebellar nuclei cells and inferior olivary cells. E-GLIF proved able to simulate the complex cell-specific electroresponsive dynamics of the main olivocerebellar neurons including pacemaking, adaptation, bursting, post-inhibitory rebound excitation, subthreshold oscillations, resonance and phase reset. The integration of these E-GLIF point-neuron models into olivocerebellar Spiking Neural Networks will allow to evaluate the impact of complex electroresponsive dynamics at the higher scales, up to motor behaviour, in closed-loop simulations of sensorimotor tasks.

Recent studies have indicated that direct administration of viral vectors or small compounds to the inner ear may aid in the treatment of sensorineural hearing loss. However, due to species differences between humans and rodents, translating experimental results into clinical applications remains challenging. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a New World monkey, is considered a pre-clinical animal model. In the present study, we describe morphometric data acquired from the temporal bone of the common marmoset in order to define the routes of topical drug administration to the inner ear. Dissection and diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) were performed on the fixed cadaverous heads of thirteen common marmosets. To investigate potential routes for drug administration to the inner ear, we explored the anatomy of the round window, oval window, semicircular canal, and endolymphatic sac. Among these, the approach via the round window with posterior tympanotomy appeared feasible for delivering drugs to the inner ear without manipulating the tympanic membrane, minimizing the chances of conductive hearing loss. The courses of four critical nerves (including the facial nerve) were visualized using three-dimensional DTT, which may help to avoid nerve damage during surgery. Finally, to investigate the feasibility of actual drug administration, we measured the volume of the round window niche, which was approximately 0.9 µL. The present findings may help to establish experimental standards for evaluating new therapies in this primate model.

In olfaction, all volatile odor information is tunneled through the main olfactory bulb (OB). Odor information is then processed before it is transferred to higher brain centers.  Odor processing in the OB is carried out by numerous local inhibitory circuits and modulated by top-down input. Top-down modulation of OB function has been shown to act via interneurons but evidence also exists for its direct impact onto the principle mitral and tufted cells (M/Ts). Here, we used monosynaptic rabies trans-synaptic tracing from the OB to map and quantify the local and top-down presynaptic landscape of M/Ts and local inhibitory interneurons. We found that M/Ts receive a significant amount of top-down inputs from various brain regions that matches qualitatively but not quantitatively those that synapse onto local inhibitory inter-neurons. These results show that M/Ts are direct targets of top-down inputs.

Tau protein is of primary importance for many physiological processes in neurons, where it affects the dynamics of the microtubule system. When hyperphosphorylated (PP-Tau), Tau monomers detach from microtubules and tend to aggregate firstly in oligomers, and then in neurofibrillary tangles, as it occurs in a group of neurodegenerative disorders named thauopathies. 
A hypothermia-related accumulation of PP-Tau, which is quickly reversed after the return to normothermia, has been shown to occur in the brain of hibernators during torpor. Since, recently, in our lab, a hypothermic torpor-like condition (synthetic torpor, ST) was pharmacologically induced in the rat, a non-hibernator, the aim of the present work was to assess whether ST can lead to a reversible PP-Tau accumulation in the rat brain. 
PP-Tau was immunohistochemically assessed by staining for AT8 (phosphorylated Tau) and Tau-1 (non-phosphorylated Tau) in 19 brain structures, which were chosen mostly due to their involvement in the regulation of autonomic and cognitive functions in relation to behavioral states. During ST, AT8 staining was strongly expressed throughout the brain, while Tau-1 staining was reduced compared to control conditions. During the following recovery period, AT8 staining progressively reduced close to zero after 6h from ST. However, Tau-1 staining remained low even after 38h from ST. Thus, overall, these results show that ST induced an accumulation of PP Tau that was, apparently, only partially reversed to normal during the recovery period. 
While the accumulation of PP-Tau may only depend on the physicochemical characteristics of the enzymes regulating Tau phosphorylation, the reverse process of dephosphorylation should be actively regulated, also in non-hibernators. In conclusion, in this work a reversible and widespread PP-Tau accumulation has been induced through a procedure that leads a non-hibernator to a degree of reversible hypothermia, which is comparable to that observed in hibernators. Therefore, the physiological mechanism involved in this process can sustain an adaptive neuronal response to extreme conditions, which may however lead to neurodegeneration when particular intensities and durations are exceeded.

Several different potassium channels modulate the activity of sleep-promoting neurons in the Drosophila brain, but the regulation of these channels is not completely understood. A recent study (Kempf et al., Nature, 2019) found that one of the potassium channel subunits, Hyperkinetic, alters the firing properties of sleep-promoting neurons in response to NADPH oxidation. These findings are the first to link cellular redox state and mitochondrial metabolism directly to sleep.

In the human brain, oscillations occur during neural processes that are relevant for memory. This has been demonstrated by a plethora of studies relating memory processes to specific oscillatory signatures. Several recent studies have gone beyond such correlative approaches and provided evidence supporting the idea that modulating oscillations via frequency-specific entrainment can alter memory functions. Such causal evidence is important because it allows distinguishing mechanisms directly related to memory from mere epiphenomenal oscillatory signatures of memory.

Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease (PD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) are chronic, progressive and age-associated neurological disorders characterized by neuronal deterioration in specific brain regions. Although the specific pathological mechanisms underlying these disorders have remained elusive, ion channel dysfunction has become increasingly accepted as a potential mechanism for neurodegenerative diseases. Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels are encoded by the HCN1-4 gene family and conduct the hyperpolarization-activated current (Ih). These channels play important roles in modulating cellular excitability, rhythmic activity, dendritic integration and synaptic transmission. In the present review we first provide a comprehensive picture of the role of HCN channels in PD by summarizing their role in the regulation of neuronal activity in PD-related brain regions. Dysfunction of Ih may participate in 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-induced toxicity and represent a pathogenic mechanism in PD. Given current reports that the critical role of HCN channels in neuroinflammation and depression, we also discussed the putative contribution of HCN channels in inflammatory processes and non-motor symptoms in PD. In the second section, we summarize how HCN channels regulate the formation of β-amyloid peptide in AD and the role of these channels in learning and memory. Finally, we briefly discuss the effects of HCN channels in ALS and SMA based on existing discoveries.

Mood disorders have multiple phenotypes and complex underlying biological mechanisms, and as such, there are no effective therapeutic strategies. A review of recent work on the role of astrocytes in mood disorders is thus warranted and we argue that there is tremendous potential for novel strategies for therapeutic interventions based on the role of astrocytes.
Astrocytes are traditionally considered to have supporting roles within the brain, yet emerging evidence has shown that astrocytes have more direct roles in influencing brain function. Notably, evidence from postmortem human brain tissues has highlighted changes in glial cell morphology, density and astrocyte-related biomarkers and genes following mood disorders, indicating astrocyte involvement in mood disorders. Findings from animal models imply strongly that astrocytes not only change astrocyte morphology and physiological characteristics but also influence neural circuits via synapse structure and formation. This review pays particular attention to interactions between astrocytes and neurons and argues that astrocyte dysfunction affects the monoaminergic system, excitatory-inhibitory balance and neurotrophic states of local networks. Together, these studies provide a foundation of knowledge about the exact role of astrocytes in mood disorders.
Changing focus from neurons to glial cells and their interactions is important so that we can understand newly proposed mechanisms underlying mood disorders, and to identify more diagnostic indicators or effective targets for treatment of these diseases.

Iron homeostasis is an essential prerequisite for metabolic and neurological functions throughout the healthy human life, with a dynamic interplay between intracellular and systemic iron metabolism. The development of different neurodegenerative diseases is associated with alterations of the intracellular transport of iron and heavy metals, principally mediated by Divalent Metal Transporter1 (DMT1), responsible for Non Transferrin Bound Iron transport (NTBI). In addition, DMT1 regulation and its compartmentalization in specific brain regions play important roles during aging. This review highlights the contribution of DMT1 to the physiological exchange and distribution of body iron and heavy metals during aging and neurodegenerative diseases. DMT1 also mediates the crosstalk between central nervous system and peripheral tissues, by systemic diffusion through the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB), with the involvement of peripheral iron homeostasis in association with inflammation. In conclusion, a survey about the role of DMT1 and iron will illustrate the complex panel of interrelationship with aging, neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation.

Neuroinflammation plays an important role in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathogenesis. However, it is difficult to evaluate inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS) or the relationship between neuroinflammation and disease progression in ALS patients. Recent advances in the field of exosomes and CNS-derived exosomes extraction technology provide the possibility of measuring the inflammatory status in the CNS without brain biopsy. In this pilot study, we extracted astrocyte-derived exosomes from the plasma of sporadic ALS patients and age-, sex-matched healthy controls and determined Interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The IL-6 levels in astrocyte-derived exosomes were increased in sALS patients and positively associated with the rate of disease progression. However, the association between IL-6 levels and disease progression rate was limited to patients whose disease duration were less than 12 months. These data suggest an increased inflammatory cascade in the CNS of sALS patients. Our pilot study demonstrates that CNS-derived exosomes could be useful to reveal neuroinflammation of the CNS in ALS patients.

The right orbitofrontal cortex (rOFC) has been proposed as the region where conscious olfactory perception arises; however, evidence supporting this hypothesis has all been collected from neuroimaging and lesion studies in which only correlation and not a temporal pattern can be established. Continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) causes a reversible disruption of cortical activity and has been used successfully to disrupt orbitofrontal activity. To overcome intrinsic limitations of current experimental research, a crossover, double-blind, prospective and longitudinal study was carried out in which cTBS was applied over the rOFC to evaluate its effect on odorant stimuli detection. All subjects received real and sham cTBS. Experimental procedures were done in two different sessions with a separation of at least one week between them to avoid carryover and learning effects. A total of 15 subjects completed the experiment, and their data were included in the final analysis (10 women, 5 men, mean age 22.40 ± 3.41). Every session consisted of two different measures of the conscious olfactory perception task: A baseline measure and one 5 minutes after cTBS/sham. Compared to baseline, marks in the olfactory task during the sham cTBS session increased (p =0.010), while marks during the real cTBS session decreased (p =0.017). Our results support the hypothesis that rOFC is an important node of a complex network required for conscious olfactory perception to arise. However, the exact mechanism that explains our results is unclear and could be explained by the disruption of other cognitive functions related to the rOFC.

Amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, neurofibrillary tangles induced by phosphorylation of tau protein and neuronal apoptosis are pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).The dementia rate in the alcoholic abusers were found to be higher than the control people. The present study explored potential roles of alcohol dehydrogenase 1B (ADH1B) in AD pathological process.The results showed that ADH1B level decreased significantly both in the serum of AD patients and in the hippocampus of APP/PS-1 AD model mice.The apoptotic rate was reduced and the viability was elevated significantly for the AD model cell transfected with ADH1B over-expressed vector. Moreover,the level of p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), a receptor of Aβ1-42,was down-regulated in the ADH1B over-expressed AD model cell and up-regulated in the cells transfected with shRNA vector of ADH1B. Furthermore, the protein levels of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax decreased significantly, and Bcl-2 level increased in the cells when overexpressing ADH1B.The opposite trend of cleaved caspase-3,Bax and Bcl-2 were observed in the cells transfected with shRNA vector of ADH1B. The level of reactive oxidative species (ROS) was found to be reduced in the ADH1B over-expressed cells and be enhanced when transfected with shRNA vector of ADH1B. These results indicated that ADH1B might be significant in the prevention of AD, especially for the abusers of alcohol, and a new potential target of AD treatment.

Nav1.2, a voltage-gated sodium channel subunit encoded by the Scn2a gene, has been implicated in various brain disorders, including epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, and schizophrenia. Nav1.2 is known to regulate the generation of action potentials in the axon initial segment and their propagation along axonal pathways. Nav1.2 also regulates synaptic integration and plasticity by promoting back-propagation of action potentials to dendrites, but whether Nav1.2 deletion in mice affects neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, and/or disease-related animal behaviors remains largely unclear. Here we report that mice heterozygous for the Scn2a gene (Scn2a+/– mice) show decreased neuronal excitability and suppressed excitatory synaptic transmission in the presence of network activity in the hippocampus. In addition, Scn2a+/– mice show suppressed hippocampal long-term potentiation in association with impaired spatial learning and memory, but show largely normal locomotor activity, anxiety-like behavior, social interaction, repetitive behavior, and whole-brain excitation. These results suggest that Nav1.2 regulates hippocampal neuronal excitability, excitatory synaptic drive, long-term potentiation, and spatial learning and memory in mice.

Neurodegenerative diseases are devastating medical conditions with no effective treatments. Restoration of impaired neurogenesis represents a promising therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases. Milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor-factor VIII (MFG-E8) is a secretory glycoprotein that plays a wide range of cellular functions including phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, anti-inflammation, tissue regeneration and homeostasis. The beneficial role of MFG-E8 has been shown in cerebral ischemia (stroke), neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, and traumatic brain injury (TBI). In stroke, MFG-E8 promotes neural stem cell proliferation and their migration towards the ischemic brain tissues. These novel functions of MFG-E8 are primarily mediated through its receptor αvβ3-integrin. Here we focus on the pivotal role of MFG-E8 in protecting against neuronal diseases by promoting neurogenesis. We also discuss the mechanisms of MFG-E8-mediated neural stem/progenitor cell (NSPC) proliferation and migration, and the potential of MFG-E8 for neural stem cell niche maintenance via angiogenesis. We propose further investigation of the molecular pathways for MFG-E8 signaling in NSPC and effective strategies for MFG-E8 delivery across the blood-brain barrier, which will help develop MFG-E8 as a future drug candidate for the bedside management of neurodegenerative diseases.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00568">Cortical Excitability Dynamics During Fear Processing</a></h4>

Background: Little is known about the modulation of cortical excitability in the prefrontal cortex during fear processing in humans. Here, we aimed to transiently modulate and test the cortical excitability during fear processing using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and brain oscillations in theta and alpha frequency bands with electroencephalography (EEG). 
Methods: We conducted two separate experiments (no-TMS and TMS). In the no-TMS experiment, EEG recordings were performed during the instructed fear paradigm in which a visual cue (CS+) was paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (electric shock), while the other visual cue was unpaired (CS-). In the TMS experiment, in addition the TMS was applied on the right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). The participants also underwent structural MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scanning and were assigned pseudo-randomly to both experiments, such that age and gender were matched. The cortical excitability was evaluated by time-frequency analysis and functional connectivity with weighted phase lag index (WPLI). We further linked the excitability patterns with markers of stress coping capability.
Results: After visual cue onset, we found increased theta power in the frontal lobe and decreased alpha power in the occipital lobe during CS+ relative to CS- trials. TMS of dmPFC increased theta power in the frontal lobe and reduced alpha power in the occipital lobe during CS+. The TMS pulse increased the information flow from the sensorimotor region to the prefrontal and occipital regions in the theta and alpha bands respectively during CS+ compared to CS-. Pre-stimulation frontal theta power (0.75-1 s) predicted the magnitude of frontal theta power changes after stimulation (1-1.25 s). Finally, the increased frontal theta power during CS+ compared to CS- was positively correlated with stress coping behavior. 
Conclusion: Our results show that TMS over dmPFC transiently modulated the regional cortical excitability and the fronto-occipital information flows during fear processing, while the pre-stimulation frontal theta power determined the strength of achieved effects. The frontal theta power may serve as a biomarker for fear processing and stress-coping responses in individuals and could be clinically tested in mental disorders.

Reliable EEG source analysis depends on sufficiently detailed and accurate head models. In this study, we investigate how uncertainties inherent to the experimentally determined conductivity values of the different conductive compartments influence the results of EEG source analysis.
In a single source scenario, the superficial and focal somatosensory P20/N20 component, we analyze the influence of varying conductivities on dipole reconstructions using a generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) approach. We find that in particular the conductivity uncertainties for skin and skull have a significant influence on the EEG inverse solution, leading to variations in source localization by several centimeters. The conductivity uncertainties for gray and white matter were found to have little influence on the source localization, but a strong influence on the strength and orientation of the reconstructed source, respectively. As the CSF conductivity is most accurately determined of all conductivities in a realistic head model, CSF conductivity uncertainties had a negligible influence on the source reconstruction. This small uncertainty is a further benefit of distinguishing the CSF in realistic volume conductor models.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00518">Design and Development of Microscale Thickness Shear Mode (TSM) Resonators for Sensing Neuronal Adhesion</a></h4>

The overall goal of this study is to develop thickness shear mode (TSM) resonators for real-time, label-free, non-destructive sensing of biological adhesion events in small populations (hundreds) of neurons in a cell culture medium and subsequently in vivo in the future. Such measurements will enable discoveries of the role of biomechanical events in neuronal function and dysfunction. Conventional TSM resonators have been used for chemical sensing and biosensing applications in media with hundreds of thousands of cells in culture. However, the sensitivity and spatial resolution of conventional TSM devices need to be further enhanced for sensing smaller cell populations or molecules of interest. In this report, we focus on key challenges such as eliminating inharmonics in solution and maximizing Q-factor while simultaneously miniaturizing the active sensing (electrode) area to make them suitable for small populations of cells. We use theoretical expressions for sensitivity and electrode area of TSM sensors operating in liquid. As a validation of the above design effort, we fabricated prototype TSM sensors with resonant frequencies of 42, 47, 75 and 90 MHz and characterized their performance in liquid using electrode diameters of 150, 200, 400, 800 and 1200 μm and electrode thicknesses of 33 and 230 nm. We validated a candidate TSM resonator with the highest sensitivity and Q-factor for real-time monitoring of adhesion of cortical neurons. We reduced the size of the sensing area to 150-400 μm for TSM devices improving the spatial resolution by monitoring few 100s to 1000s of neurons. Finally, we modified the electrode surface with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) to further enhance adhesion and sensitivity of the TSM sensor to adhering neurons (Marx, 2003).

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a key technology in multimodal animal studies of brain connectivity and disease pathology. In vivo MRI provides non-invasive, whole brain macroscopic images containing structural and functional information, thereby complementing invasive in vivo high-resolution microscopy and ex vivo molecular techniques. Brain mapping, the correlation of corresponding regions between multiple brains in a standard brain atlas system, is widely used in human MRI. For small animal MRI, however, there is no scientific consensus on pre-processing strategies and atlas-based neuroinformatics. Thus, it remains difficult to compare and validate results from different pre-clinical studies which were processed using custom-made code or individual adjustments of clinical MRI software and without a standard brain reference atlas. Here, we describe AIDAmri, a novel Atlas-based Imaging Data Analysis pipeline to process structural and functional mouse brain data including anatomical MRI, fiber tracking using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional connectivity analysis using resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI). The AIDAmri pipeline includes automated pre-processing steps, such as raw data conversion, skull-stripping and bias-field correction as well as image registration with the Allen Brain Reference Atlas (ARA). Following a modular structure developed in Python scripting language, the pipeline integrates established and newly developed algorithms. Each processing step was optimized for efficient data processing requiring minimal user-input and user programming skills. The raw data is analyzed and results transferred to the ARA coordinate system in order to allow an efficient and highly-accurate region-based analysis. AIDAmri is intended to fill the gap of a missing open-access and cross-platform toolbox for the most relevant mouse brain MRI sequences thereby facilitating data processing in large cohorts and multi-center studies.

Due to the limited field of view of the microscopes, acquisitions of macroscopic specimens require many parallel image stacks to cover the whole volume of interest.
Overlapping regions are introduced among stacks in order to make it possible automatic alignment by means of a 3D stitching tool.
Since state-of-the-art microscopes coupled with chemical clearing procedures can generate 3D images whose size exceeds the Terabyte, parallelization is required to keep stitching time within acceptable limits.

In the present paper we discuss how multi-level parallelization reduces the execution times of TeraStitcher, a tool designed to deal with very large images.
%Parallelization has been carried out in such a way that its impact on user interface and software maintenance is negligible.
Two algorithms performing dataset partition for efficient parallelization in a transparent way are presented together with experimental results proving the effectiveness of the approach that achieves a speedup close to 300$\times$, when both coarse- and fine-grained parallelism are exploited.

Multi-level parallelization of TeraStitcher led to a significant reduction of processing times with no changes in the user interface, and with no additional effort required for the maintenance of code.

Distress is a critical problem in developed societies given its long-term negative effects on physical and mental health. The interest in studying this emotion has notably increased during last years, being electroencephalography (EEG) signals preferred over other physiological variables in this research field. In addition, the non-stationary nature of brain dynamics has impulsed the use of non-linear metrics such as symbolic entropies in brain signal analysis. However, only consecutive samples in a time series have been considered in the scientific literature for entropy computation applied to distress identification. Thus, the influence of time-lag on brain patterns assessment has not been tested. Hence, in the present study two permutation entropies denominated Delayed Permutation Entropy and Permutation Min-Entropy have been computed for the first time at different time-lags to discern between calmness and distress emotional states in EEG signals. Moreover, a number of curve-related features were also calculated to assess the signal dynamics across different temporal intervals.Complementary information among these variables was studied through stepwise regression and ten-fold cross-validation approaches. According to the results obtained, the multi-lag analysis has been able to reveal new significant insights so far undiscovered, thus notably improving the process of distress recognition from EEG recordings.

Heterogeneity of neural properties within a given neural class is ubiquitous in the nervous system and permits different sub-classes of neurons to specialize for specific purposes. This principle has been thoroughly investigated in the hindbrain of the weakly electric fish A. leptorhynchus in the primary electrosensory area, the Electrosensory Lateral Line lobe (ELL). The pyramidal cells that receive inputs from tuberous electroreceptors are organized in three maps in distinct segments of the ELL. The properties of these cells vary greatly across maps due to differences in connectivity, receptor expression, and ion channel composition. These cells are a seminal example of bursting neurons and their bursting dynamic relies on the presence of voltage-gated Na+ channels in the extensive apical dendrites of the superficial pyramidal cells. Other ion channels can affect burst generation and their expression varies across ELL neurons and segments. For example, SK channels cause hyperpolarizing after-potentials decreasing the likelihood of bursting, yet bursting propensity is similar across segments. We question whether the depolarizing mechanism that generates the bursts presents quantitative differences across segments that could counterbalance other differences having the opposite effect. Although their presence and role are established, the distribution and density of the apical dendrites’ Na+ channels have not been quantified and compared across ELL maps. Therefore, we test the hypothesis that Na+ channel density varies across segment by quantifying their distribution in the apical dendrites of immunolabeled ELL sections. We found the Na+ channels to be two-fold denser in the lateral segment than in the centro-medial segment, the centro-lateral segment being intermediate. Our results imply that this differential expression of voltage-gated Na+ channels could counterbalance or interact with other aspects of neuronal physiology that vary across segments (e.g. SK channels). We argue that burst coding of sensory signals, and the way the network regulates bursting, should be influenced by these variations in Na+ channel density.

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a sensitive tool for detecting brain tissue microstructural alterations in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Abnormal cerebral perfusion patterns have also been reported in PD patients using arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI. In this study we aimed to perform a combined DTI and ASL assessment in PD patients within the basal ganglia, in order to test the relationship between microstructural and perfusion alterations.
Fifty-two subjects participated in this study. Specifically, twenty-six PD patients (mean age [SD]=66.7[8.9] years, 21 males, median [IQR] Modified Hoehn and Yahr = 1.5 [1-1.6]) and twenty-six healthy controls (HC, mean age [SD]=65.2[7.5], 15 males) were scanned with 1.5T MRI. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD) maps were derived from diffusion-weighted images, while cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps were computed from ASL data. After registration to Montreal Neurological Institute standard space, FA, MD, AD, RD and CBF median values were extracted within specific regions of interest: substantia nigra, caudate, putamen, globus pallidum, thalamus, red nucleus and subthalamic nucleus. DTI measures and CBF were compared between the two groups. The relationship between diffusion parameters and CBF was tested with Spearman’s correlations. False discovery rate (FDR)-corrected p-values lower than 0.05 were considered significant, while uncorrected p-values &lt; 0.05 were considered a trend.
No significant FA differences were observed. AD was significantly increased in PD patients compared with HC in the putamen (p=0.039, pFDR=0.035). No significant CBF differences were found between PD patients and HC. Diffusion parameters were not significantly correlated with CBF in the HC group, while a significant correlation emerged for PD patients in the caudate nucleus, for all DTI measures (with FA: r=0.543, pFDR=0.028; with MD: r=-0.661, pFDR=0.002; with AD: r=-0.628, pFDR=0.007; with RD: r=-0.635, pFDR=0.003).
This study showed that DTI is a more sensitive technique than ASL to detect alterations in the basal ganglia in the early phase of PD. Our results suggest that, although DTI and ASL convey different information, a relationship between microstructural integrity and perfusion changes in the caudate may be present.

The relationship between neurons and perineuronal nets (PNNs) is attracting attention as a central mechanism controlling brain plasticity. In the cortex, PNNs primarily surround inhibitory parvalbumin interneurons, playing roles as both a regulator of synaptic plasticity and a protective barrier. PNNs have a delayed developmental trajectory and are key components in the closure of critical periods of heightened neuroplasticity. In animal models, manipulating PNNs outside this critical window can enhance cognition, suggesting a potentially therapeutic approach for attenuating cognitive decline.

In this Perspective we explore filopodia of endothelial cells in the developing central nervous system using the Golgi method and transmission electron microscopy. Filopodia of endothelial cells play a crucial role in the anastomosis of growing capillaries of the central nervous system. The leading endothelial cells filopodia from approaching capillaries interconnect forming complex conglomerates that precede the anastomotic event. The contacting filopodia form narrow spaces between them filled with proteinaceous basal lamina material. The original narrow spaces coalesce into larger ones leading to the formation of a single one that will interconnect (anastomose) the two approaching capillaries. The four leading endothelial cells (two for each approaching capillary) become the wall of the newly formed post-anastomotic CNS capillaries. These new CNS capillaries are very small with narrow and irregular lumina that might permit the passage of fluid but not yet of blood cells. Eventually, their lumen enlarges and permits the passage of blood cells.

Studies using rewilded laboratory mice have begun to provide important clues into the complex relationship between environment, immunity, and behavior. In a recent paper, Cope and colleagues (Hippocampus, 2019) showed that exposing laboratory mice to outdoor living, either with or without peripheral worm infection, increased adult neurogenesis and had major effects on microglia, but only outdoor living coupled with worm infection increased anxiety.

Presynaptic boutons support neurotransmitter release with nanoscale precision at sub-millisecond timescales. Studies over the past two decades have revealed a rich tapestry of molecular players governing synaptic vesicle fusion at highly specialized release sites in the active zone (AZ). However, the spatiotemporal organization of release at active synapses remains elusive, in part owing to the extremely small size of the AZ and the limited resolution of conventional approaches. Recent advances in fluorescence nanoscopy have revolutionized direct investigation of presynaptic release organization and dynamics.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00144">SUMOylating Two Distinct Sites on the A-type Potassium Channel, Kv4.2, Increases Surface Expression and Decreases Current Amplitude</a></h4>

Post-translational conjugation of Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO) peptides to lysine (K) residues on target proteins alters their interactions. SUMOylation of a target protein can either promote its interaction with other proteins that possess SUMO binding domains, or it can prevent target protein interactions that normally occur in the absence of SUMOylation. One subclass of voltage-gated potassium channels that mediates an A-type current, IA, exists as a ternary complex comprising Kv4 pore forming subunits, Kv channel interacting proteins (KChIP) and transmembrane dipeptidyl peptidase like proteins (DPPL). SUMOylation could potentially regulate intra- and/or intermolecular interactions within the complex. This study began to test this hypothesis and showed that Kv4.2 channels were SUMOylated in the rat brain and in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells expressing a GFP-tagged mouse Kv4.2 channel (Kv4.2g). Prediction software identified two putative SUMOylation sites in the Kv4.2 C-terminus at K437 and K579. These sites were conserved across mouse, rat, and human Kv4.2 channels and across mouse Kv4 isoforms. Increasing Kv4.2g SUMOylation at each site by ~30% produced a significant ~22-50% decrease in IA Gmax, and a ~70-95% increase in channel surface expression. Site-directed mutagenesis of Kv4.2g showed that K437 SUMOylation regulated channel surface expression, while K579 SUMOylation controlled IA Gmax. The K579R mutation mimicked and occluded the SUMOylation-mediated decrease in IA Gmax, suggesting that SUMOylation at K579 blocked an intra- or inter-protein interaction involving K579. The K437R mutation did not obviously alter channel surface expression or biophysical properties, but it did block the SUMOylation-mediated increase in channel surface expression. Interestingly, enhancing K437 SUMOylation in the K579R mutant roughly doubled channel surface expression, but produced no change in IA Gmax, suggesting that the newly inserted channels were electrically silent. This is the first report that Kv4.2 channels are SUMOylated and that SUMOylation can independently regulate Kv4.2 surface expression and IA Gmax in opposing directions. The next step will be to determine if/how SUMOylation affects Kv4 interactions within the ternary complex.

Derived from arachidonic acid (AA), the endogenous cannabinoid (eCB) 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) is a substrate for αβ-hydrolase domain 12 (ABHD12). Loss-of-function mutations of ABHD12 are associated with the neurodegenerative disorder polyneuropathy, hearing loss, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa, and cataract (PHARC). ABHD12 knockout (KO) mice show PHARC-like behaviors in older adulthood. Here, we test the hypothesis that ABHD12 deletion age-dependently regulates bioactive lipids in the CNS. Lipidomics analysis of the brainstem, cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, midbrain, striatum and thalamus from male young (3-4 months) and older (7 months) adult ABHD12 KO and age-matched wild-type (WT) mice was performed on over 80 lipids via HPLC/MS/MS, including eCBs, lipoamines, 2-acyl glycerols, free fatty acids, and prostaglandins (PGs). Aging and ABHD12 deletion drove widespread changes in the CNS lipidome; however, the effects of ABHD12 deletion were similar between old and young mice, meaning that many alterations in the lipidome precede PHARC-like symptoms. AA-derived lipids were particularly sensitive to ABHD12 deletion. 2-AG increased in the striatum, hippocampus, cerebellum, thalamus, midbrain, and brainstem, whereas the eCB N-arachidonoyl ethanolamine increased in all 8 brain regions, along with at least 2 PGs. Aging also had a widespread effect on the lipidome and more age-related changes in bioactive lipids were found in ABHD12 KO mice than WT suggesting that ABHD12 deletion exacerbates the effects of age. The most robust effects of aging (independent of genotype) across the CNS were decreases in N-acyl GABAs and N-acyl glycines. In conclusion, levels of bioactive lipids are dynamic throughout adulthood and deleting ABHD12 disrupts the wider lipidome, modulating multiple AA-derived lipids with potential consequences for neuropathology.

Among all organs of an adult animal, the central nervous system stands out because of its vast complexity and morphological diversity. During early development, the entire central nervous system develops from an apparently homogenous group of progenitors that differentiate into all neural cell types. Therefore, understanding the molecular and genetic mechanisms that give rise to the cellular and anatomical diversity of the brain is a key goal of the developmental neurobiology field. With this aim in mind, the development of the central nervous system of model organisms has been extensively studied. From more than a century, the mechanisms of neurogenesis have been studied in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The visual system comprises one of the major structures of the Drosophila brain. The visual information is collected by the eye-retina photoreceptors and then processed by the four optic lobe ganglia: the lamina, medulla, lobula and lobula plate. The molecular mechanisms that originate neuronal diversity in the optic lobe have been unveiled in the past decade. In this article, we describe the early development and differentiation of the lobula plate ganglion, from the formation of the optic placode and the inner proliferation centre to the specification of motion detection neurons. We focused specifically on how the precise combination of signalling pathways and cell-specific transcription factors patterns the pool of neural stem cells that generates the different neurons of the motion detection system.

In proestrus, the changing gonadal hormone milieu alters the physiological properties of GnRH neurons and contributes to the development of the GnRH surge. We hypothesized that proestrus also influences the expression of different ion channel genes in mouse GnRH neurons. Therefore, we performed gene expression profiling of GnRH neurons collected from intact, proestrous and metestrous GnRH-GFP transgenic mice, respectively. Proestrus changed the expression of 37 ion channel and 8 calcium homeostasis-regulating genes. Voltage-gated sodium channels responded with upregulation of three alpha subunits (Scn2a1, Scn3a and Scn9a). Within the voltage-gated potassium channel class, Kcna1, Kcnd3, Kcnh3 and Kcnq2 were upregulated, while others (Kcna4, Kcnc3, Kcnd2 and Kcng1) underwent downregulation. Proestrus also had impact on inwardly rectifying potassium channel subunits manifested in enhanced expression of Kcnj9 and Kcnj10 genes, whereas Kcnj1, Kcnj11 and Kcnj12 subunit genes were downregulated. The two-pore domain potassium channels also showed differential expression with upregulation of Kcnk1 and reduced expression of three subunit genes (Kcnk7, Kcnk12 and Kcnk16). Changes in expression of chloride channels involved both the voltage-gated (Clcn3 and Clcn6) and the intracellular (Clic1) subtypes. Regarding the pore-forming alpha-1 subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels, two (Cacna1b and Cacna1h) were upregulated, while Cacna1g showed downregulation. The ancillary subunits were also differentially regulated (Cacna2d1, Cacna2d2, Cacnb1, Cacnb3, Cacnb4, Cacng5, Cacng6 and Cacng8). In addition, ryanodine receptor 1 (Ryr1) gene was downregulated, while a transient receptor potential cation channel (Trpm3) gene showed enhanced expression. Genes encoding proteins regulating the intracellular calcium homeostasis were also influenced (Calb1, Hpca, Hpcal1, Hpcal4, Cabp7, Cab 39l and Cib2). The differential expression of genes coding for ion channel proteins in GnRH neurons at late proestrus indicates that the altering hormone milieu contributes to remodeling of different kinds of ion channels of GnRH neurons, which might be a prerequisite of enhanced cellular activity of GnRH neurons and the subsequent surge release of the neurohormone.

Background: Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show elevated levels of motor variability that are associated with clinical outcomes. Cortical-cerebellar networks involved in visuomotor control have been implicated in postmortem and anatomical imaging studies of ASD. However, the extent to which these networks show intrinsic functional alterations in patients, and the relationship between intrinsic functional properties of cortical-cerebellar networks and visuomotor impairments in ASD have not yet been clarified. 
Methods: We examined the amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) of cortical and cerebellar brain regions during resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) in 23 individuals with ASD and 16 typically developing (TD) controls. Regions of interest (ROIs) with ALFF values significantly associated with motor variability were identified for patients and controls respectively, and their functional connectivity (FC) to each other and the rest of the brain were examined. 
Results: For TD controls, greater ALFF in bilateral cerebellar crus I, left superior temporal gyrus, left inferior frontal gyrus, right supramarginal gyrus and left angular gyrus each were associated with greater visuomotor variability. Greater ALFF in cerebellar lobule VIII was associated with less visuomotor variability. For individuals with ASD, greater ALFF in right calcarine cortex, right middle temporal gyrus (including MT/V5), left Heschl’s gyrus, left postcentral gyrus, right precentral gyrus, and left precuneus was related to greater visuomotor variability. Greater ALFF in cerebellar vermis VI was associated with less visuomotor variability. Individuals with ASD and TD controls did not show differences in ALFF for any of these ROIs. Individuals with ASD showed greater posterior cerebellar connectivity with occipital and parietal cortices relative to TD controls, and reduced FC within cerebellum and between lateral cerebellum and prefrontal and other regions of association cortex. 
Conclusion: Together, these findings suggest that increased resting oscillations within visuomotor networks in ASD are associated with more severe deficits in controlling variability during precision visuomotor behavior. Differences between individuals with ASD and TD controls in the topography of networks showing relationships to visuomotor behavior suggest atypical patterns of cerebellar-cortical specialization and connectivity in ASD that underlies previously documented visuomotor deficits.
