Active intracellular transport of organelles relies on the coordinated activities of cytoplasmic dynein and kinesin, ATP-dependent microtubule motor proteins. While axonemal dynein was discovered during the mid-1960s, it was not until the mid-1980s that kinesin was discovered by Ron Vale and colleagues, as reported in 1985. Their research demonstrated that the newly identified protein, isolated from both squid axoplasm and bovine brain, was independently capable of driving microtubule gliding or organelle movement.

Using new methods to functionally dissect circuits, two papers from 2015 found enhanced synaptic properties of the inputs and outputs of hippocampal adult-born neurons specifically during a critical period of their development. These studies provided a circuit-level view of unique roles for new neurons and how they cope with the ever-changing environment.

The ability of central synapses to undergo long-term potentiation (LTP) still captures the imagination of scientists and has become one of the most fascinating and deeply studied questions in modern neuroscience. By the mid-1990s, however, the field was deeply ensnarled in trying to answer a passionately dichotomous question: is LTP expressed by a pre- or a postsynaptic mechanism? Experimental results that could only be seen by many as being incontrovertibly contradictory presented a perplexing conundrum.

Is an amygdala necessary to experience and perceive fear? Intriguing evidence comes from patient S.M. who lost her left and right amygdalae to disease. Initial testing suggested that S.M.’s most defining symptom was an inability to recognize fear in other people’s facial expressions. A fascinating paper by Adolphs and colleagues in 2005 examined one potential mechanism for this impairment: a failure to spontaneously attend to widened eyes, the most distinctive physical feature portrayed in symbolic fear expressions.

<p>by Stefano Zappacosta, Francesco Mannella, Marco Mirolli, Gianluca Baldassarre</p>

Learning in biologically relevant neural-network models usually relies on Hebb learning rules. The typical implementations of these rules change the synaptic strength on the basis of the co-occurrence of the neural events taking place at a certain time in the pre- and post-synaptic neurons. Differential Hebbian learning (DHL) rules, instead, are able to update the synapse by taking into account the temporal relation, captured with derivatives, between the neural events happening in the recent past. The few DHL rules proposed so far can update the synaptic weights only in few ways: this is a limitation for the study of dynamical neurons and neural-network models. Moreover, empirical evidence on brain spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) shows that different neurons express a surprisingly rich repertoire of different learning processes going far beyond existing DHL rules. This opens up a second problem of how capturing such processes with DHL rules. Here we propose a general DHL (G-DHL) rule generating the existing rules and many others. The rule has a high expressiveness as it combines in different ways the pre- and post- synaptic neuron signals and derivatives. The rule flexibility is shown by applying it to various signals of artificial neurons and by fitting several different STDP experimental data sets. To these purposes, we propose techniques to pre-process the neural signals and capture the temporal relations between the neural events of interest. We also propose a procedure to automatically identify the rule components and parameters that best fit different STDP data sets, and show how the identified components might be used to heuristically guide the search of the biophysical mechanisms underlying STDP. Overall, the results show that the G-DHL rule represents a useful means to study time-sensitive learning processes in both artificial neural networks and brain.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/avC1MDNSqOE" width="1" />

Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) constitute the main proliferative cells in the adult brain, and deregulation of OPC proliferation-differentiation balance results in either glioma formation or defective adaptive (re)myelination. OPC differentiation requires significant genetic reprogramming, implicating chromatin remodeling. Mounting evidence indicates that chromatin remodelers play important roles during normal development and...<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/Ct-pcgGWAos" width="1" />

<p>Information in the central nervous system (CNS) is conducted via electrical
signals known as action potentials and is encoded in time. Several neurological
disorders including depression, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
(ADHD), originate in faulty brain signaling frequencies. Here, we present a
Hodgkin-Huxley model analog for a strongly correlated VO2 artificial neuron
system that undergoes an electrically-driven insulator-metal transition. We
demonstrate that tuning of the insulating phase resistance in VO2 threshold
switch circuits can enable direct mimicry of neuronal origins of disorders in
the central nervous system. The results introduce use of circuits based on
quantum materials as complementary to model animal studies for neuroscience,
especially when precise measurements of local electrical properties or
competing parallel paths for conduction in complex neural circuits can be a
challenge to identify onset of breakdown or diagnose early symptoms of disease.

<p>We compare the robustness of humans and current convolutional deep neural
networks (DNNs) on object recognition under twelve different types of image
degradations. First, using three well known DNNs (ResNet-152, VGG-19,
GoogLeNet) we find the human visual system to be more robust to nearly all of
the tested image manipulations, and we observe progressively diverging
classification error-patterns between humans and DNNs when the signal gets
weaker. Secondly, we show that DNNs trained directly on distorted images
consistently surpass human performance on the exact distortion types they were
trained on, yet they display extremely poor generalisation abilities when
tested on other distortion types. For example, training on salt-and-pepper
noise does not imply robustness on uniform white noise and vice versa. Thus,
changes in the noise distribution between training and testing constitutes a
crucial challenge to deep learning vision systems that can be systematically
addressed in a lifelong machine learning approach. Our new dataset consisting
of 83K carefully measured human psychophysical trials provide a useful
reference for lifelong robustness against image degradations set by the human
visual system.

<p>Autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity is altered in autism spectrum
disorder (ASD). Heart rate variability (HRV) derived from electrocardiogram
(ECG) has been a powerful tool to identify alterations in ANS due to a plethora
of pathophysiological conditions, including psychological ones such as
depression. ECG-derived HRV thus carries a yet to be explored potential to be
used as a diagnostic and follow-up biomarker of ASD. However, few studies have
explored this potential. In a cohort of boys (ages 8 - 11 years) with (n=18)
and without ASD (n=18), we tested a set of linear and nonlinear HRV measures,
including phase rectified signal averaging (PRSA), applied to a segment of ECG
collected under resting conditions for their predictive properties of ASD. We
identified HRV measures derived from time, frequency and geometric
signal-analytical domains which are changed in ASD children relative to peers
without ASD and correlate to psychometric scores (p&lt;0.05 for each). Receiver
operating curves area ranged between 0.71 - 0.74 for each HRV measure. Despite
being a small cohort lacking external validation, these promising preliminary
results warrant larger prospective validation studies.

<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder.
Finding the biomarkers associated with ASD is extremely helpful to understand
the underlying roots of the disorder and can lead to earlier diagnosis and more
targeted treatment. Although Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been applied in
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify ASD, understanding the
data-driven computational decision making procedure has not been previously
explored. Therefore, in this work, we address the problem of interpreting
reliable biomarkers associated with identifying ASD; specifically, we propose a
2-stage method that classifies ASD and control subjects using fMRI images and
interprets the saliency features activated by the classifier. First, we trained
an accurate DNN classifier. Then, for detecting the biomarkers, different from
the DNN visualization works in computer vision, we take advantage of the
anatomical structure of brain fMRI and develop a frequency-normalized sampling
method to corrupt images. Furthermore, in the ASD vs. control subjects
classification scenario, we provide a new approach to detect and characterize
important brain features into three categories. The biomarkers we found by the
proposed method are robust and consistent with previous findings in the
literature. We also validate the detected biomarkers by neurological function
decoding and comparing with the DNN activation maps.

<p>We introduce a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) approach to account for
temporal dynamics and dependencies in brain networks observed via functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Our approach directly parameterizes temporal
dynamics through recurrent connections, which can be used to formulate blind
source separation with a conditional (rather than marginal) independence
assumption, which we call RNN-ICA. This formulation enables us to visualize the
temporal dynamics of both first order (activity) and second order (directed
connectivity) information in brain networks that are widely studied in a static
sense, but not well-characterized dynamically. RNN-ICA predicts dynamics
directly from the recurrent states of the RNN in both task and resting state
fMRI. Our results show both task-related and group-differentiating directed
connectivity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38358">Human T cell receptor occurrence patterns encode immune history, genetic background, and receptor specificity</a></h4>

The T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire encodes immune exposure history through the dynamic formation of immunological memory. Statistical analysis of repertoire sequencing data has the potential to decode disease associations from large cohorts with measured phenotypes. However, the repertoire perturbation induced by a given immunological challenge is conditioned on genetic background via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) polymorphism. We explore associations between MHC alleles, immune exposures, and shared TCRs in a large human cohort. Using a previously published repertoire sequencing dataset augmented with high-resolution MHC genotyping, our analysis reveals rich structure: striking imprints of common pathogens, clusters of co-occurring TCRs that may represent markers of shared immune exposures, and substantial variations in TCR-MHC association strength across MHC loci. Guided by atomic contacts in solved TCR:peptide-MHC structures, we identify sequence covariation between TCR and MHC. These insights and our analysis framework lay the groundwork for further explorations into TCR diversity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37762">Temperature explains broad patterns of Ross River virus transmission</a></h4>

Thermal biology predicts that vector-borne disease transmission peaks at intermediate temperatures and declines at high and low temperatures. However, thermal optima and limits remain unknown for most vector-borne pathogens. We built a mechanistic model for the thermal response of Ross River virus, an important mosquito-borne pathogen in Australia, Pacific Islands, and potentially at risk of emerging worldwide. Transmission peaks at moderate temperatures (26.4°C) and declines to zero at thermal limits (17.0 and 31.5°C). The model accurately predicts that transmission is year-round endemic in the tropics but seasonal in temperate areas, resulting in the nationwide seasonal peak in human cases. Climate warming will likely increase transmission in temperate areas (where most Australians live) but decrease transmission in tropical areas where mean temperatures are already near the thermal optimum. These results illustrate the importance of nonlinear models for inferring the role of temperature in disease dynamics and predicting responses to climate change.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37093">Blumenols as shoot markers for root symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi</a></h4>

High-through-put (HTP) screening for functional arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF)-associations is challenging because roots must be excavated and colonization evaluated by transcript analysis or microscopy. Here we show that specific leaf-metabolites provide broadly applicable accurate proxies of these associations, suitable for HTP-screens. With a combination of untargeted and targeted metabolomics, we show that shoot accumulations of hydroxy- and carboxyblumenol C-glucosides mirror root AMF-colonization in <i>Nicotiana attenuata </i>plants. Genetic/pharmacologic manipulations indicate that these AMF-indicative foliar blumenols are synthesized and transported from roots to shoots. These blumenol-derived foliar markers, found in many di- and monocotyledonous crop and model plants (<i>Solanum lycopersicum, Solanum tuberosum, Hordeum vulgare, Triticum aestivum, Medicago truncatula</i> and <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>), are not restricted to particular plant-AMF interactions, and are shown to be applicable for field-based QTL mapping of AMF-related genes.

To anticipate potential seedling damage, plants block seed germination under unfavorable conditions. Previous studies investigated how seed germination is controlled in response to abiotic stresses through gibberellic and abscisic acid signaling. However, little is known about whether seeds respond to rhizosphere bacterial pathogens. We found that <i>Arabidopsis</i> seed germination is blocked in the vicinity of the plant pathogen <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. We identified L-2-amino-4-methoxy-trans-3-butenoic acid (AMB), released by <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, as a biotic compound triggering germination arrest. We provide genetic evidence that in AMB-treated seeds DELLA factors promote the accumulation of the germination repressor ABI5 in a GA-independent manner. AMB production is controlled by the quorum sensing system IQS. In vitro experiments show that the AMB-dependent germination arrest protects seedlings from damage induced by AMB. We discuss the possibility that this could serve as a protective response to avoid severe seedling damage induced by AMB and exposure to a pathogen.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37078">Arabidopsis RNA processing factor SERRATE regulates the transcription of intronless genes</a></h4>

Intron splicing increases proteome complexity, promotes RNA stability, and enhances transcription. However, introns and the concomitant need for splicing extend the time required for gene expression and can cause an undesirable delay in the activation of genes. Here, we show that the plant microRNA processing factor SERRATE (SE) plays an unexpected and pivotal role in the regulation of intronless genes. Arabidopsis SE associated with more than 1000, mainly intronless, genes in a transcription-dependent manner. Chromatin-bound SE liaised with paused and elongating polymerase II complexes and promoted their association with intronless target genes. Our results indicate that stress-responsive genes contain no or few introns, which negatively affects their expression strength, but that some genes circumvent this limitation via a novel SE-dependent transcriptional activation mechanism. Transcriptome analysis of a Drosophila mutant defective in ARS2, the metazoan homologue of SE, suggests that SE/ARS2 function in regulating intronless genes might be conserved across kingdoms.

Most bacteria use an indirect pathway to generate aminoacylated glutamine and/or asparagine tRNAs. Clinical isolates of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> with increased rates of error in gene translation (mistranslation) involving the indirect tRNA-aminoacylation pathway have increased tolerance to the first-line antibiotic rifampicin. Here, we identify that the aminoglycoside kasugamycin can specifically decrease mistranslation due to the indirect tRNA pathway. Kasugamycin but not the aminoglycoside streptomycin, can limit emergence of rifampicin resistance <i>in vitro</i> and increases mycobacterial susceptibility to rifampicin both <i>in vitro</i> and in a murine model of infection. Moreover, despite parenteral administration of kasugamycin being unable to achieve the <i>in vitro</i> minimum inhibitory concentration, kasugamycin alone was able to significantly restrict growth of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> in mice. These data suggest that pharmacologically reducing mistranslation may be a novel mechanism for targeting bacterial adaptation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36741">Convergence between the microcosms of Southeast Asian and North American pitcher plants</a></h4>

The 'pitchers' of carnivorous pitcher plants are exquisite examples of convergent evolution. An open question is whether the living communities housed in pitchers also converge in structure or function. Using samples from more than 330 field-collected pitchers of eight species of Southeast Asian <i>Nepenthes</i> and six species of North American <i>Sarracenia</i>, we demonstrate that the pitcher microcosms, or miniature ecosystems with complex communities, are strikingly similar. Compared to communities from surrounding habitats, pitcher communities house fewer species. While communities associated with the two genera contain different microbial organisms and arthropods, the species are predominantly from the same phylogenetic clades. Microbiomes from both genera are enriched in degradation pathways and have high abundances of key degradation enzymes. Moreover, in a manipulative field experiment, <i>Nepenthes</i> pitchers placed in a North American bog assembled <i>Sarracenia</i>-like communities. An understanding of the convergent interactions in pitcher microcosms facilitates identification of selective pressures shaping the communities.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36607">Revealing a novel nociceptive network that links the subthalamic nucleus to pain processing</a></h4>

Pain is a prevalent symptom of Parkinson's disease, and is effectively treated by deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). However, the link between pain and the STN remains unclear. In the present work, we report that STN neurons exhibit complex tonic and phasic responses to noxious stimuli using <i>in vivo</i> electrophysiology in rats. We also show that nociception is altered following lesions of the STN, and characterize the role of the superior colliculus and the parabrachial nucleus in the transmission of nociceptive information to the STN, physiologically from both structures and anatomically in the case of the parabrachial nucleus. We show that STN nociceptive responses are abnormal in a rat model of PD, suggesting their dependence on the integrity of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system. The STN-linked nociceptive network we reveal is likely to be of considerable clinical importance in neurological diseases involving a dysfunction of the basal ganglia.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36375">Cyclin-dependent kinase control of motile ciliogenesis</a></h4>

Cycling cells maintain centriole number at precisely two per cell in part by limiting their duplication to S phase under the control of the cell cycle machinery. In contrast, postmitotic multiciliated cells (MCCs) uncouple centriole assembly from cell cycle progression and produce hundreds of centrioles in the absence of DNA replication to serve as basal bodies for motile cilia. Although some cell cycle regulators have previously been implicated in motile ciliogenesis, how the cell cycle machinery is employed to amplify centrioles is unclear. We use transgenic mice and primary airway epithelial cell culture to show that Cdk2, the kinase responsible for the G1 to S phase transition, is also required in MCCs to initiate motile ciliogenesis. While Cdk2 is coupled with Cyclins E and A2 during cell division, Cyclin A1 is required during ciliogenesis, contributing to an alternative regulatory landscape that facilitates centriole amplification without DNA replication.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The human high-level visual cortex comprises regions specialized for the processing of distinct types of stimuli, such as objects, animals, and human actions. How does this specialization emerge? Here, we investigated the role of effector-specific visuomotor coupling experience in shaping the organization of the action observation network (AON) as a window on this question. Observed body movements are frequently coupled with corresponding motor codes, e.g., during monitoring one’s own movements and imitation, resulting in bidirectionally connected circuits between areas involved in body movements observation (e.g., of the hand) and the motor codes involved in their execution. If the organization of the AON is shaped by this effector-specific visuomotor coupling, then, it should not form for body movements that do not belong to individuals’ motor repertoire. To test this prediction, we used fMRI to investigate the spatial arrangement and functional properties of the hand and foot action observation circuits in individuals born without upper limbs. Multivoxel pattern decoding, pattern similarity, and univariate analyses revealed an intact hand AON in the individuals born without upper limbs. This suggests that the organization of the AON does not require effector-specific visuomotor coupling.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Subplate (SP) neurons exhibit spontaneous plateau depolarizations mediated by connexin hemichannels. Postnatal (P1–P6) mice show identical voltage pattern and drug-sensitivity as observed in slices from human fetal cortex; indicating that the mouse is a useful model for studying the cellular physiology of the developing neocortex. In mouse SP neurons, spontaneous plateau depolarizations were insensitive to blockers of: synaptic transmission (glutamatergic, GABAergic, or glycinergic), pannexins (probenecid), or calcium channels (mibefradil, verapamil, diltiazem); while highly sensitive to blockers of gap junctions (octanol), hemichannels (La<sup>3+</sup>, lindane, Gd<sup>3+</sup>), or glial metabolism (DLFC). Application of La<sup>3+</sup> (100 μM) does not exert its effect on electrical activity by blocking calcium channels. Intracellular application of Gd<sup>3+</sup> determined that Gd<sup>3+</sup>-sensitive pores (putative connexin hemichannels) reside on the membrane of SP neurons. Immunostaining of cortical sections (P1–P6) detected connexins 26, and 45 in neurons, but not connexins 32 and 36. Vimentin-positive glial cells were detected in the SP zone suggesting a potential physiological interaction between SP neurons and radial glia. SP spontaneous activity was reduced by blocking glial metabolism with DFLC or by blocking purinergic receptors by PPADS. Connexin hemichannels and ATP release from vimentin-positive glial cells may underlie spontaneous plateau depolarizations in the developing mammalian cortex.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Previous in vivo studies revealed robust age-related variations in structural properties of the human cerebral cortex during adolescence. Neurobiology underlying these maturational phenomena is largely unknown. Here we employ a virtual-histology approach to gain insights into processes associated with inter-regional variations in cortical microstructure and its maturation, as indexed by magnetization transfer ratio (MTR). Inter-regional variations in MTR correlate with inter-regional variations in expression of genes specific to pyramidal cells (CA1) and ependymal cells; enrichment analyses indicate involvement of these genes in dendritic growth. On the other hand, inter-regional variations in the change of MTR during adolescence correlate with inter-regional profiles of oligodendrocyte-specific gene expression. Complemented by a quantitative hypothetical model of the contribution of surfaces associated with dendritic arbor (1631 m<sup>2</sup>) and myelin (48 m<sup>2</sup>), these findings suggest that MTR signals are driven mainly by macromolecules associated with dendritic arbor while maturational changes in the MTR signal are associated with myelination.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neural responses to small manipulable objects (“tools”) in high-level visual areas in ventral temporal cortex (VTC) provide an opportunity to test how anatomically remote regions modulate ventral stream processing in a domain-specific manner. Prior patient studies indicate that grasp-relevant information can be computed about objects by dorsal stream structures independently of processing in VTC. Prior functional neuroimaging studies indicate privileged functional connectivity between regions of VTC exhibiting tool preferences and regions of parietal cortex supporting object-directed action. Here we test whether lesions to parietal cortex modulate tool preferences within ventral and lateral temporal cortex. We found that lesions to the left anterior intraparietal sulcus, a region that supports hand-shaping during object grasping and manipulation, modulate tool preferences in left VTC and in the left posterior middle temporal gyrus. Control analyses demonstrated that neural responses to “place” stimuli in left VTC were unaffected by lesions to parietal cortex, indicating domain-specific consequences for ventral stream neural responses in the setting of parietal lesions. These findings provide causal evidence that neural specificity for “tools” in ventral and lateral temporal lobe areas may arise, in part, from online inputs to VTC from parietal areas that receive inputs via the dorsal visual pathway.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Becoming a proficient reader requires substantial learning over many years. However, it is unknown how learning to read affects development of distributed visual representations across human ventral temporal cortex (VTC). Using fMRI and a data-driven, computational approach, we quantified the development of distributed VTC responses to characters (pseudowords and numbers) versus other domains in children, preteens, and adults. Results reveal anatomical- and hemisphere-specific development. With development, distributed responses to words and characters became more distinctive and informative in lateral but not medial VTC, and in the left but not right hemisphere. While the development of voxels with both positive and negative preference to words affected distributed information, only development of voxels with positive preference to words (i.e., word-selective) was correlated with reading ability. These data show that developmental increases in informativeness of distributed left lateral VTC responses are related to proficient reading and have important implications for both developmental theories and for elucidating neural mechanisms of reading disabilities.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Information that is shared widely can profoundly shape society. Evidence from neuroimaging suggests that activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), a core region of the brain’s valuation system tracks with this sharing. However, the mechanisms linking vmPFC responses in individuals to population behavior are still unclear. We used a multilevel brain-as-predictor approach to address this gap, finding that individual differences in how closely vmPFC activity corresponded with population news article sharing related to how closely its activity tracked with social consensus about article value. Moreover, how closely vmPFC activity corresponded with population behavior was linked to daily life news experience: frequent news readers tended to show high vmPFC across all articles, whereas infrequent readers showed high vmPFC only to articles that were more broadly valued and heavily shared. Using functional connectivity analyses, we found that superior tracking of consensus value was related to decreased connectivity of vmPFC with a dorsolateral PFC region associated with controlled processing. Taken together, our results demonstrate variability in the brain’s capacity to track crowd wisdom about information value, and suggest (lower levels of) stimulus experience and vmPFC–dlPFC connectivity as psychological and neural sources of this variability.</span>

The biological stress response of the body forms one of the foundations of adaptive behavior, including promoting (and impairing) different forms of memory. This response transcends stressful experiences and underlies reactions to challenges and even reinforcers such as addictive substances. Nevertheless, drug-induced stress responses are rarely incorporated into models of addiction. We propose here that drug-induced stress responses (particularly glucocorticoids) play a crucial role in addictive behavior by modulating the formation of memories for substance-use experiences.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/402776v1?rss=1">Computational imperfections in human visual search</a></h4>

Numerous studies have reported that human behavior on perceptual inference tasks - such as cue combination and visual search - is well accounted for by optimal models. However, others have argued that optimal models are often overly flexible and, therefore, lack explanatory power. In addition, it has been suggested that inference performed by neural systems is inherently noisy, which would preclude optimality in many perception tasks. Here, we reconsider human performance on visual search by devising an approach that strongly reduces model flexibility and tests for suboptimalities due to imprecisions in neural inference. Subjects performed a target detection task in which targets and distractors were ellipses with orientations drawn from Gaussian distributions with different means. We controlled the level of sensory uncertainty through stimulus presentation time (short vs. unlimited) and the elongation of the ellipses (low vs. high). Moreover, we created four levels of external uncertainty by varying the amount of overlap between the target and distractor distributions. Since sensory noise was negligible in the conditions with unlimited display time, we were able to estimate deviations from optimality without having to fit free parameters. In conditions with short display time, we limited the flexibility of the optimal model by using a separate task to estimate sensory noise levels. We found clear evidence for suboptimalities in all tested conditions. Moreover, we estimate that the performance loss due to computational imperfections was of comparable magnitude to the loss due to sensory noise. Our results provide support for the proposal that neural inference is inherently imprecise and challenge previous claims of optimality in perception.

Computational models such as deep neural networks (DNN) trained for classification are often used to explain responses of the visual cortex. However, not all the areas of the visual cortex are involved in object/scene classification. For instance, scene selective occipital place area (OPA) plays a role in mapping navigational affordances. Therefore, for explaining responses of such task-specific brain area, we investigate if a model that performs a related task can serve as a better computational model than a model that performs an unrelated task. We found that DNN trained on a task (scene-parsing) related to the function (navigational affordances) of a brain region (OPA) explains its responses better than a DNN trained on a task (scene-classification) which is not explicitly related. In a subsequent analysis, we found that the DNNs that showed high correlation with a particular brain region were trained on a task that was consistent with functions of that brain region reported in previous neuroimaging studies. Our results demonstrate that the task is paramount for selecting a computational model of a brain area. Further, explaining the responses of a brain area by a diverse set of tasks has the potential to shed some light on its functions.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/402578v1?rss=1">Electrical Fields Induced Inside the Rat Brain with Skin, Skull, and Dural Placements of the Current Injection Electrode</a></h4>

Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) is rapidly becoming an indispensable clinical tool with its different forms. Animal data are crucially needed for better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of tES. For reproducibility of results in animal experiments, the electric fields inside the brain parenchyma induced by the injected currents need to be predicted accurately. In this study, we measured the electrical fields in the rat brain perpendicular to the brain surface when the stimulation electrode was placed over the skin, skull, or dura mater through a craniotomy hole. The E-field attenuation through the skin was a few times larger than that of the skull. The E-field declined much faster in the gray matter underneath the pial surface than it did in the white matter, and thus the large E-fields were contained mostly in the gray matter. The transition at the gray/white matter border caused a significant peak in the E-field, as well as any other local inhomogeneties. The vertical E-field near the cortex is about one third of what is estimated by analytical solutions for volume conductors that assume a semi-infinite homogenous medium for the brain and a conductivity value of 0.2 S/m. A global scaling factor of 1/3 can be useful to account for deviations from the analytical equations in rat experiments and for more realistic estimations of the E-field peak underneath the electrode. Finally, insertion of the current return electrode into the shoulder, submandibular, and hind leg muscles had virtually no effects on the measured E-field amplitudes in the cortex underneath the epidural electrodes.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/402321v1?rss=1">Sensitive period for cognitive repurposing of human visual cortex</a></h4>

Studies of sensory loss are a model for understanding the functional flexibility of human cortex. In congenital blindness, subsets of visual cortex are recruited during higher-cognitive tasks, such as language and math tasks. Is such dramatic functional repurposing possible throughout the lifespan or restricted to sensitive periods in development? We compared visual cortex function in individuals who lost their vision as adults (after age 17) to congenitally blind and sighted blindfolded adults. Participants took part in resting-state and task-based fMRI scans during which they solved math equations of varying difficulty and judged the meanings of sentences. Blindness at any age caused 'visual' cortices to synchronize with specific fronto-parietal networks at rest. However, in task-based data, visual cortices showed regional specialization for math and language and load-dependent activity only in congenital blindness. Thus, despite the presence of long-range functional connectivity, cognitive repurposing of human cortex is limited by sensitive periods.

The discrepancy between expected outcome and real outcome is at the base of error coding, a crucial process during adaptive behaviours. Previous studies indicate that performing or observing errors elicits specific EEG markers (e.g. Theta). Here we show how unexpected changes in the movement trajectory of the virtual co-actor in a human-avatar dyadic paradigm are mapped into the error-monitoring system of the human partner. We asked individuals to synchronize their reach-to-grasp movements with those of a virtual partner in conditions that did (Interactive condition), or did not, require (Cued condition) spatio-temporal adaptation to the partner's actions. Crucially, in certain trials the virtual partner suddenly changed its movement trajectory; thereby violating the human participant's expectation. These trials showed that fronto-central error-related EEG markers increased as a function of the individual's reliance on their partner's behaviour. Source localization showed that observing violations of the expected movements also generated a Theta increase over occipito-temporal regions, highlighting visuo-motor processing during erroneous interactions.

Defining the number, proportion, or lineage of distinct cell types in the developing human brain is an important goal of modern brain research. We defined single cell transcriptomic profiles for 40,000 cells at mid-gestation to identify cell types in the developing human neocortex. We define expression profiles corresponding to all known major cell types at this developmental period and identify multiple transcription factors and co-factors expressed in specific cell types, providing an unprecedented resource for understanding human neocortical development including the first single-cell characterization of human subplate neurons. We characterize major developmental trajectories during early neurogenesis, showing that cell type differentiation occurs on a continuum that involves transitions that tie cell cycle progression with early cell fate decisions. We use these data to deconvolute regulatory networks and map neuropsychiatric disease genes to specific cell types, implicating dysregulation of specific cell types, as the mechanistic underpinnings of several neurodevelopmental disorders. Together these results provide an extensive catalog of cell types in human neocortex and extend our understanding of early cortical development, human brain evolution and the cellular basis of neuropsychiatric disease.

<p>by Vito Paolo Pastore, Paolo Massobrio, Aleksandar Godjoski, Sergio Martinoia</p>

Functional-effective connectivity and network topology are nowadays key issues for studying brain physiological functions and pathologies. Inferring neuronal connectivity from electrophysiological recordings presents open challenges and unsolved problems. In this work, we present a cross-correlation based method for reliably estimating not only excitatory but also inhibitory links, by analyzing multi-unit spike activity from large-scale neuronal networks. The method is validated by means of realistic simulations of large-scale neuronal populations. New results related to functional connectivity estimation and network topology identification obtained by experimental electrophysiological recordings from high-density and large-scale (i.e., 4096 electrodes) microtransducer arrays coupled to <i>in vitro</i> neural populations are presented. Specifically, we show that: (i) functional inhibitory connections are accurately identified in <i>in vitro</i> cortical networks, providing that a reasonable firing rate and recording length are achieved; (ii) small-world topology, with scale-free and rich-club features are reliably obtained, on condition that a minimum number of active recording sites are available. The method and procedure can be directly extended and applied to <i>in vivo</i> multi-units brain activity recordings.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/I7N0_alGOGE" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>The transfer-appropriate processing (TAP) account holds that episodic memory depends on the overlap between encoding and retrieval processing. In the current study, we employed multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) of electroencephalography to examine the relevance of spontaneously engaged visual processing during encoding for later retrieval. Human participants encoded word-picture associations, where the picture could be a famous face, a landmark, or an object. At test, we manipulated the retrieval demands by asking participants to retrieve either visual or verbal information about the pictures. MVPA revealed classification between picture categories during early perceptual stages of encoding (~170 ms). Importantly, these visual category-specific neural patterns were predictive of later episodic remembering, but the direction of the relationship was contingent on the particular retrieval demand of the memory task: a benefit for the visual and a cost for the verbal. A reinstatement of the category-specific neural patterns established during encoding was observed during retrieval, and again the relationship with behavior varied with retrieval demands. Reactivation of visual representations during retrieval was associated with better memory in the visual task, but with lower performance in the verbal task. Our findings support and extend the TAP account by demonstrating that processing of particular aspects during memory formation can also have detrimental effects on later episodic remembering when other aspects of the event are called-for and shed new light on encoding and retrieval interactions in episodic memory.</p>

<p>Until recently, hypocretin (Hcrt) neurons were the only known wake-promoting neuronal population in the lateral hypothalamus (LH), but subpopulations of inhibitory neurons in this area and glutamatergic neurons in the nearby supramammillary nucleus (SuM) have recently been found that also promote wakefulness. We performed chemogenetic excitation of LH neurons in mice and observed increased wakefulness that lasted more than 4 h without unusual behavior or EEG anomalies. The increased wakefulness was similar in the presence or absence of the dual orexin receptor blocker almorexant (ALM). Analysis of hM3Dq transfection and c-FOS expression in LH inhibitory neurons and in the SuM failed to confirm that the increased wakefulness was due to these wake-promoting populations, although this possibility cannot be completely excluded. To evaluate the relationship to the Hcrt system, we repeated the study in <i>Orexin-tTA</i> mice in the presence or absence of dietary doxycycline (DOX), which enabled us to manipulate the percentage of Hcrt neurons that expressed hM3Dq. In DOX-fed mice, 18% of Hcrt neurons as well as many other LH neurons expressed hM3Dq; these mice showed a profound increase in wake after hM3Dq activation even in the presence of ALM. In mice switched to normal chow, 62% of Hcrt neurons expressed hM3Dq along with other LH cells; chemogenetic activation produced even more sustained arousal which could be reduced to previous levels by ALM treatment. Together, these results indicate an LH neuron population that promotes wakefulness through an Hcrt-independent pathway that can act synergistically with the Hcrt system to prolong arousal.</p>

Abstract
<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα (CaMKIIα) is a key mediator of activity-dependent neuronal modifications and has been implicated in the molecular mechanisms of learning and memory. Indeed, several types of CaMKIIα knock-in (KI) and knock-out (KO) mice revealed impairments in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and behavioral learning. On the other hand, a similar role for CaMKIIα has been implicated in amygdala-dependent memory, but detailed analyses have not much been performed yet. To better understand its involvement in amygdala-dependent memory as compared to hippocampus-dependent memory, here we performed biochemical analyses and behavioral memory tests using the kinase-dead CaMKIIα (K42R)-KI mouse. In the Morris water maze tasks, homozygous mutants performed well in the visible platform trials, while they failed to form spatial memory in the hippocampus-dependent hidden platform trials. In fear conditioning, these mice were impaired but showed a certain level of amygdala-dependent cued fear memory, which lasted four weeks, while they showed virtually no hippocampus-dependent context discrimination. Neither stronger stimulation nor repetitive stimulation compensated for their memory deficits. The differential outcome of hippocampus- and amygdala-dependent memory in the mutant mouse was not due to differential expression of CaMKIIα between the hippocampus and the amygdala, because biochemical analyses revealed that both kinase activity and protein levels of CaMKII were indistinguishable between the two brain regions. These results indicate that kinase activity of CaMKIIα is indispensable for hippocampus-dependent memory, but not necessarily for amygdala-dependent memory. There may be a secondary, CaMKIIα activity-independent pathway, in addition to the CaMKIIα activity-dependent pathway, in the acquisition of amygdala-dependent memory.</p>

Abstract<p>LGI1 is a secreted neuronal protein and a Nogo Receptor 1 (NgR1) ligand. Mutations in LGI1 in humans causes autosomal dominant lateral temporal lobe epilepsy and homozygous deletion of LGI1 in mice results in severe epileptic seizures that cause early postnatal death. NgR1 plays an important role in the development of central nervous system synapses and circuitry by limiting plasticity in the adult cortex via the activation of RhoA. These relationships and functions prompted us to examine the effect of LGI1 on synapse formation <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. We report that application of LGI1 increases synaptic density in neuronal culture and that LGI1 null hippocampus has fewer dendritic mushroom spines than in wild-type littermates. Further, our electrophysiological investigations demonstrate that LGI1 null hippocampal neurons possess fewer and weaker synapses. RhoA activity is significantly increased in cortical cultures derived from LGI1 null mice and using a reconstituted system, we show directly that LGI1 antagonizes NgR1-TROY signaling. Our data suggests that LGI1 enhances synapse formation in cortical and hippocampal neurons by reducing NgR1 signaling.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Mutations in leucine-rich glioma inactivated protein 1 (LGI1) causes autosomal dominant lateral temporal lobe epilepsy in humans. In the present study we used a combination of cellular imaging, electrophysiology, protein analysis and cell biology assays to show that LGI1 promotes synapse formation and maturation. LGI1 deletion in mice results in fewer synapses and causes synaptic activity defects. Mechanistically, LGI1 regulates RhoA signaling through a receptor complex containing NgR1 and TROY. Our experiments provide evidence that NgR1 and LGI1 balance regulates RhoA activity during synapse formation and thus impacts on synapse maturation, number and activity.</p>

Abstract<p>Individual hippocampal neurons selectively increase their firing rates in specific spatial locations. As a population these neurons provide a decodable representation of space that is robust against changes to sensory- and path-related cues. This neural code is sparse and distributed, theoretically rendering it undetectable with population recording methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Existing studies nonetheless report decoding spatial codes in the human hippocampus using such techniques. Here we present results from a virtual navigation experiment in humans in which we eliminated visual- and path-related confounds and statistical limitations present in existing studies, ensuring that any positive decoding results would represent a voxel-place code. Consistent with theoretical arguments derived from electrophysiological data and contrary to existing fMRI studies, our results show that although participants were fully oriented during the navigation task, there was no statistical evidence for a place code.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> More than four decades of research have demonstrated that hippocampal place cells in the mammalian brain play a central role in representing the spatial environment. Their encoding of location is both sparse and anatomically distributed, theoretically rendering it undetectable with population recording methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Here we present results showing that if visual confounds and statistical shortcomings are carefully eliminated, there is no evidence for the detectability of a human hippocampal place code using fMRI. Moreover, we discuss in detail how these confounds, amongst others, are manifest in existing studies and are themselves enough to produce false positive results. Our findings have important implications for research on mental representations of space.</p>

Abstract<p>Modeling is a useful tool for investigating various biophysical characteristics of neurons. Recent simulation studies of propagating action potentials (spike conduction) along axons include the investigation of neuronal activity evoked by electrical stimulation from implantable prosthetic devices. In contrast to point-neuron simulations, where a large variety of models are readily available, Hodgkin-Huxley (HH)-type conductance-based models have been almost the only option for simulating axonal spike conduction, as simpler models cannot faithfully replicate the waveforms of propagating spikes. Since the amount of available physiological data, especially in humans, is usually limited, calibration and justification of the large number of parameters of a complex model is generally difficult. In addition, not all simulation studies of axons require detailed descriptions of nonlinear ionic dynamics. In this study, we construct a simple model of spike generation and conduction based on the exponential integrate-and-fire model, which can simulate the rapid growth of the membrane potential at spike initiation. In terms of the number of parameters and equations, this model is much more compact than conventional models, but can still reliably simulate spike conduction along myelinated and unmyelinated axons that were stimulated intracellularly or extracellularly. Our simulations of auditory nerve fibers with this new model suggest that, because of the difference in intrinsic membrane properties, the axonal spike conduction of high-frequency nerve fibers is faster than that of low-frequency fibers. The simple model developed in this study can serve as a computationally efficient alternative to more complex models for future studies, including simulations of neuroprosthetic devices.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Conduction of electrical impulses (action potentials) along the axon is essential for information transfer between neurons. Simulation studies of propagating action potentials, which earlier focused on the biophysical mechanisms of conduction, have progressed to investigations of pathological malfunctions of nerves and electrical stimulations via prostheses. In contrast to dimensionless, single-neuron modeling, for which a number of different approaches are available, simulation of nerve conduction generally requires a complex model of ionic conductances to reproduce propagating action potentials. In this study, we present a simplified phenomenological model of axonal conduction with increased computational efficiency and a reduced number of parameters. This simple model can be used as an alternative to conventional models, especially for applications including prosthetic simulations of nerve conduction.</p>

Abstract<p>With the advent of optogenetics, it became possible to change the activity of a targeted population of neurons in a temporally controlled manner. To combine the advantages of sixty-channel in vivo tetrode recording and laser-based optogenetics, we have developed a closed-loop recording system that allows for the actual electrophysiological signal to be used as a trigger for the laser light mediating the optogenetic intervention. We have optimized the weight, size, and shape of the corresponding implant to make it compatible with the size, force, and movements of a behaving mouse, and we have shown that the system can efficiently block sharp wave ripple (SWR) events using those events themselves as a trigger. To demonstrate the full potential of the optogenetic recording system we present a pilot study addressing the contribution of SWR events to learning in a complex behavioral task.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Our custom optogenetic microdrive design takes into consideration the small size and force of the mice and offers an unusually high number of channels to collect murine electrophysiological data. The laser delivery is optimized to irradiate the brain at four points so targeting structures as large as the dorsal CA1 region becomes possible. The described technique provides a cutting-edge tool to study several aspects of cognition, learning, memory, sleep and decision making. All types of experiments where a larger brain area needs to be illuminated during extracellular recordings could exploit our newly developed implant. The preliminary data on the effect of SWR-blockade, presented here as an illustration of the new method, could inspire further experiments using larger number of animals.</p>

The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is a heterogeneous midbrain structure, containing neurons and astrocytes, that coordinates approach and avoidance behaviors by integrating activity from numerous afferents. Within astrocyte-neuron networks, astrocytes control signals from distinct afferents in a circuit-specific manner, but whether this capacity scales up to drive motivated behavior has been undetermined. Using genetic and optical dissection strategies in vitro and during behavior we report that VTA astrocytes tune glutamatergic signaling selectively on local inhibitory neurons to drive a functional circuit for learned avoidance. In this circuit, VTA astrocytes facilitate excitation of local GABA neurons to increase inhibition of dopamine neurons. The increased inhibition of dopamine neurons elicits real-time and learned avoidance behavior that is sufficient to impede expression of learned preference for reward. Despite the large number of functions performed by astrocytes, loss of one glutamate transporter (GLT-1) from VTA astrocytes selectively blocks these avoidance behaviors and spares preference for reward. Thus, VTA astrocytes selectively regulate excitation of local GABA neurons to drive a distinct learned avoidance circuit that opposes learned approach behavior.

Functional imaging research has already contributed with several results to the study of neural correlates of consciousness. Apart from task-related activation derived in fMRI, PET based glucose metabolism rate or cerebral blood flow account for a considerable proportion of the study of brain activity under different levels of consciousness. Resting state functional connectivity MRI is playing a crucial role to explore the consciousness related functional integration, successfully complementing PET, another widely used neuroimaging technique. Here, spontaneous hemodynamic response is introduced to characterize resting state brain activity giving information on the local metabolism (neurovascular coupling), and useful to improve the time-resolved activity and connectivity measures based on BOLD fMRI. This voxel-wise measure is then used to investigate the loss of consciousness under Propofol anesthesia and unresponsive wakefulness syndrome. The dysfunction of hemodynamic response in precuneus and posterior cingulate is found to be a common principle underlying loss of consciousness in both conditions. The thalamus appears to be less obviously modulated by Propofol, compared with frontoparietal regions. However, a significant increase in spontaneous thalamic hemodynamic response was found in patients in unresponsive wakefulness syndrome compared with healthy control. Our results ultimately show that anesthesia- or pathology-induced neurovascular coupling could be tracked by modulated spontaneous hemodynamic response derived from resting state fMRI.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/401422v1?rss=1">The Emotional Glue of the Senses: Affective Certainty and Congruency in the Rubber Hand Illusion</a></h4>

Our sense of body ownership relies on integrating different sensations according to their temporal and spatial congruency. Nevertheless, there is ongoing controversy about the role of affective congruency during multisensory integration, i.e. whether the stimuli to be perceived by the different sensory channels are congruent or incongruent in terms of their affective quality. In the present study, we applied a widely used multisensory integration paradigm, the Rubber Hand Illusion, to investigate the role of affective, top-down aspects of sensory congruency between visual and tactile modalities in the sense of body ownership. In Experiment 1 (N = 36), we touched participants with either soft or rough fabrics in their unseen hand, while they watched a rubber hand been touched synchronously with the same fabric or with a "hidden" fabric of "uncertain roughness". In Experiment 2 (N = 50), we used the same paradigm as in Experiment 1, but replaced the "uncertainty" condition with an "incongruent" one, in which participants saw the rubber hand being touched with a fabric of incongruent roughness and hence opposite valence. We found that certainty (Experiment 1) and congruency (Experiment 2) between the felt and vicariously perceived tactile affectivity led to higher subjective embodiment compared to uncertainty and incongruency, respectively, irrespective of any valence effect. Our results suggest that congruency in the affective top-down aspects of sensory stimulation is important to the multisensory integration process leading to embodiment, over and above temporal and spatial properties.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/401380v1?rss=1">Reconstructing meaning from bits of information</a></h4>

We can easily identify a dog merely by the sound of barking or an orange by its citrus scent. In this work, we study the neural underpinnings of how the brain combines bits of information into meaningful object representations. Modern theories of semantics posit that the meaning of words can be decomposed into a unique combination of individual semantic features (e.g., 'barks', 'has citrus scent'). Here, participants received clues of individual objects in form of three isolated semantic features, given as verbal descriptions. We used machine-learning-based neural decoding to learn a mapping between individual semantic features and BOLD activation patterns. We discovered that the recorded brain patterns were best decoded using a combination of not only the three semantic features that were presented as clues, but a far richer set of semantic features typically linked to the target object. We conclude that our experimental protocol allowed us to observe how fragmented information is combined into a complete semantic representation of an object and suggest neuroanatomical underpinnings for this process.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/401174v1?rss=1">The context-dependent nature of the neural implementation of intentions</a></h4>

Many studies have identified networks in parietal and prefrontal cortex that are involved in intentional action. Yet, knowledge about what these networks exactly encoded is still scarce. In this study we look into the content of those processes. We ask whether the neural representations of intentions are context- and reason-invariant, or whether these processes depend on the context we are in, and the reasons we have for choosing an action. We use a combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging and multivariate decoding to directly assess the context- and reason-dependency of the processes underlying intentional action. We were able to decode action decisions in the same context and for the same reasons from the fMRI data, in line with previous decoding studies. Furthermore, we could decode action decisions across different reasons for choosing an action. Importantly, though, decoding decisions across different contexts was at chance level. These results suggest that for voluntary action, there is considerable context-dependency in intention representations. This suggests that established invariance in neural processes may not reflect an essential feature of a certain process, but that this stable character could be dependent on invariance in the experimental setup, in line with predictions from situated cognition theory.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/401091v1?rss=1">Spatial neuronal synchronization and the waveform of oscillations: implications for EEG and MEG</a></h4>

Neuronal oscillations are ubiquitous in the human brain and are implicated in virtually all brain functions. Often they are referred to by their frequency content, i.e., alpha-, beta-, gamma-oscillations. Although they indeed can be described by a prominent peak in the power spectrum, their waveform is not necessarily sinusoidal and shows a rather complex morphology which needs to be captured with multiple spectral harmonics. Both frequency and temporal descriptions of such non-sinusoidal neuronal oscillations can be utilized. However, in non-invasive EEG/MEG recordings the waveform of oscillations often takes a sinusoidal shape which in turn leads to a rather oversimplified view on oscillatory processes. In this study, we show in simulations how spatial synchronization can mask non-sinusoidal features of the underlying rhythmic neuronal processes. Consequently, the degree of non-sinusoidality can serve as a measure of spatial synchronization. To confirm this empirically, we show that a mixture of EEG components is indeed associated with more sinusoidal oscillations compared to the waveform of oscillations in each constituent component. Using simulations, we also show that the spatial mixing of the non-sinusoidal neuronal signals strongly affects the amplitude ratio of the spectral harmonics constituting the waveform. This in turn has high relevance for the interpretation of the relative strength of spectral peaks, which is commonly used for inferring neuronal signatures corresponding to specific behavioral states. Moreover, our simulations show how spatial mixing can affect the strength and even the direction of the amplitude coupling between constituent neuronal harmonics. Consistently with these simulations, we also demonstrate these effects in real EEG recordings. Our findings have far reaching implications for the neurophysiological interpretation of neuronal oscillations and cross-frequency interactions, as well as for the unequivocal determination of oscillatory phase.

Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is desirable as a first-line measure to assist decision-making in cases of increased ICP. Clinically, non-invasive ICP monitoring is also required to avoid infection and hemorrhage in patients. The relationships among the arterial blood pressure (Pa), ICP, cerebral blood flow, and its velocity (QCBFv) measured by transcranial Doppler ultrasound measurement have been reported. However, real-time non-invasive ICP estimation using these modalities is less well documented. Here, we present a novel algorithm for real-time and non-invasive ICP monitoring with QCBFv and Pa, called direct-current (DC)-ICP. This technique is compared with invasive ICP for 11 traumatic-brain-injury patients admitted to Cheju Halla Hospital and Gangnam Severance Hospital from July 2017 to June 2018. The inter-subject correlation coefficient between true and estimate was 0.70. The AUCs of the ROCs for prediction of increased ICP for the DC-ICP methods are 0.816. Thus, QCBFv monitoring can facilitate reliable real-time ICP tracking with our novel DC-ICP algorithm, which can provide valuable information under clinical conditions.

1) Laminar information across different deep brain structures and cortical regions need to be decoded in order to understand the spatiotemporal ensembles that represent cognition and memory. Pig models are widely used in translational research, and may provide an excellent bridge between rodents and non-human primates for CNS disease models due to their gyrencephalic neuroanatomy and significant white matter composition. One of the major obstacles to addressing the research questions and approaches currently accessible to smaller-brained animals, are technical limitations in microelectrodes. 2) We tested various designs of multichannel silicon probes developed for large animal electrophysiology acutely in Yucatan pigs by recording neurophysiological signals from laminar structures under anesthesia. 3) Electrophysiological parameters of single units and local field potentials were analyzed to evaluate performance of given silicon probes acutely. 4) Cross-sectional area of multichannel silicon probes was found to be a crucial determinant for a performance of the silicon probes. EDGE style probes have the highest yields during cortical and intra-hippocampal recordings in pigs, with a potential for use in chronic implantations and awake behavior. The new CAMB 64-channel probes with EDGE style and a poly-2 site arrangement have an even better single unit separation and a denser sampling of the laminar structure, identifying them as potential candidates for chronic implantations. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of acute silicon probes designed for large animal laminar electrophysiology.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/399972v1?rss=1">Reactivated spatial context guides episodic recall</a></h4>

The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is known as the locus of spatial coding and episodic memory, but the interaction between these cognitive domains, as well as the extent to which they rely on common neurophysiological mechanisms is poorly understood. Here, we use a hybrid spatial-episodic memory task to determine how spatial information is dynamically reactivated in sub-regions of the MTL and how this reactivation guides recall of episodic information. Our results implicate theta oscillations across the MTL as a common neurophysiological substrate for spatial coding in navigation and episodic recall. We further show that spatial context information is initially retrieved in the hippocampus (HC) and subsequently emerges in the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), which is known as the main input region to the HC during encoding. Our results therefore support the notion that the predominant direction of information flow in the MTL reverses during retrieval. Finally, we demonstrate that hippocampal theta phase modulates parahippocampal gamma amplitude, suggesting a role for cross frequency coupling in coding and transmitting retrieved information.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/400754v1?rss=1">Environmental programming of adult foraging behavior in C. elegans</a></h4>

Foraging strategies must be tuned to the availability and distribution of resources in the environment. This can occur over generations and lead to genetic differences in foraging behavior, or it can occur on shorter time scales within an individual's life span. Both genetic and experience-based strategies must be implemented by neural circuits that respond to environmental cues and track internal states, and the analysis of such circuits provides insight into the neural basis of complex decision making. In C. elegans, between-strain genetic differences and within-strain plasticity in foraging has been observed. Most individual changes in foraging are short-term, based on experience over several hours. Here, we tested if developmental experience could permanently alter foraging. We found that in wild strains that are normally highly exploratory, early-life starvation leads to "cautious" foraging behavior in which exploration is reduced. We characterize the behavioral bases for these strategies and identify changes in the dynamics of a locomotory circuit involved in navigation. Overall, we show that some C. elegans strains exhibit adaptive tuning of their foraging behavior based on early-life experience, and this is associated with changes in a core navigation circuit.

Objective: To investigate the use of the Goalkeeper Game (GG) to assess gait automaticity decline under dual task conditions in people with Parkinson's disease (PPD) and compare its predictive power with the one of the MoCA test. Materials and Methods: 74 PPD (H&amp;Y stages: 23 in stage 1; 31 in stage 2; 20 in stage 3), without dementia (MoCA cut-off 23), tested in ON period with dopaminergic medication were submitted to single individual cognitive/motor evaluation sessions. The tests applied were: MoCA, GG, dynamic gait index (DGI) task and timed up and go test (TUG) under single and dual-task (DT) conditions. GG test resulted in 9 measures extracted via a statistical model. The predictive power of the GG measures and the MoCA score with respect to gait performance, as assessed by DGI and DT-TUG, were compared. Results: The predictive models based on GG measures and MoCA score obtained a proportion of correct classification of 65% and 56% for DGI scores and 59% and 57% for DT-TUG cost. GG application proved to be feasible and aroused more motivation in PPDs than MoCa. Conclusion: GG, a friendly and ludic game, was able to reach a good power of gait performance prediction in people at initial and intermediate stages of PD evolution.

Gradient-based approaches to brain function have recently unmasked fundamental properties of brain organization. Diffusion map embedding analysis of resting-state fMRI data revealed a primary-to-transmodal axis of cerebral cortical macroscale functional organization. The same method was recently used to analyze resting-state data within the cerebellum, revealing for the first time a sensorimotor-fugal macroscale organization principle of cerebellar function. Cerebellar gradient 1 extended from motor to non-motor task-unfocused (default-mode network) areas, and cerebellar gradient 2 isolated task-focused processing regions. Here we present a freely available and easily accessible tool that applies this new knowledge to the topographical interpretation of cerebellar neuroimaging findings. LittleBrain generates scatterplots that illustrate the relationship between cerebellar data (e.g., volumetric patient study clusters, task activation maps, etc.) and cerebellar gradients 1 and 2. This novel method of data mapping provides alternative, gradual visualizations that complement discrete parcellation maps of cerebellar functional neuroanatomy. We present application examples to show that LittleBrain can also capture subtle, progressive aspects of cerebellar functional neuroanatomy that would be difficult to visualize using conventional mapping techniques.

Evolution has tuned the nervous system of most animals to produce stereotyped behavioural responses to ethologically relevant stimuli. For example, female Drosophila avoid laying eggs in the presence of geosmin, an odorant produced by toxic moulds. Using this system, we now identify third order olfactory neurons that are essential for an innate aversive behaviour. Connectomics data place these neurons in the context of a complete synaptic circuit from sensory input to descending output. We find multiple levels of valence-specific convergence, including a novel form of axo-axonic input onto second order neurons conveying another danger signal, the pheromone of parasitoid wasps. However we also observe a massive divergence as geosmin-responsive second order olfactory neurons connect with a diverse array of ~75 cell types. Our data suggest a transition from a labelled line organisation in the periphery to one in which olfactory information is mapped onto many different higher order populations with distinct behavioural significance.

<p>by Xing Chen, Jun Yin, Jia Qu, Li Huang</p>

Recently, a growing number of biological research and scientific experiments have demonstrated that microRNA (miRNA) affects the development of human complex diseases. Discovering miRNA-disease associations plays an increasingly vital role in devising diagnostic and therapeutic tools for diseases. However, since uncovering associations via experimental methods is expensive and time-consuming, novel and effective computational methods for association prediction are in demand. In this study, we developed a computational model of Matrix Decomposition and Heterogeneous Graph Inference for miRNA-disease association prediction (MDHGI) to discover new miRNA-disease associations by integrating the predicted association probability obtained from matrix decomposition through sparse learning method, the miRNA functional similarity, the disease semantic similarity, and the Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity for diseases and miRNAs into a heterogeneous network. Compared with previous computational models based on heterogeneous networks, our model took full advantage of matrix decomposition before the construction of heterogeneous network, thereby improving the prediction accuracy. MDHGI obtained AUCs of 0.8945 and 0.8240 in the global and the local leave-one-out cross validation, respectively. Moreover, the AUC of 0.8794+/-0.0021 in 5-fold cross validation confirmed its stability of predictive performance. In addition, to further evaluate the model's accuracy, we applied MDHGI to four important human cancers in three different kinds of case studies. In the first type, 98% (Esophageal Neoplasms) and 98% (Lymphoma) of top 50 predicted miRNAs have been confirmed by at least one of the two databases (dbDEMC and miR2Disease) or at least one experimental literature in PubMed. In the second type of case study, what made a difference was that we removed all known associations between the miRNAs and Lung Neoplasms before implementing MDHGI on Lung Neoplasms. As a result, 100% (Lung Neoplasms) of top 50 related miRNAs have been indexed by at least one of the three databases (dbDEMC, miR2Disease and HMDD V2.0) or at least one experimental literature in PubMed. Furthermore, we also tested our prediction method on the HMDD V1.0 database to prove the applicability of MDHGI to different datasets. The results showed that 50 out of top 50 miRNAs related with the breast neoplasms were validated by at least one of the three databases (HMDD V2.0, dbDEMC, and miR2Disease) or at least one experimental literature.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zmqWoqKvbTA" width="1" />

<p>by Alena van Bömmel, Michael I. Love, Ho-Ryun Chung, Martin Vingron</p>

Cell-type specific gene expression is regulated by the combinatorial action of transcription factors (TFs). In this study, we predict transcription factor (TF) combinations that cooperatively bind in a cell-type specific manner. We first divide DNase hypersensitive sites into cell-type specifically open vs. ubiquitously open sites in 64 cell types to describe possible cell-type specific enhancers. Based on the pattern contrast between these two groups of sequences we develop “co-occurring TF predictor on Cell-Type specific Enhancers” (coTRaCTE) - a novel statistical method to determine regulatory TF co-occurrences. Contrasting the co-binding of TF pairs between cell-type specific and ubiquitously open chromatin guarantees the high cell-type specificity of the predictions. coTRaCTE predicts more than 2000 co-occurring TF pairs in 64 cell types. The large majority (70%) of these TF pairs is highly cell-type specific and overlaps in TF pair co-occurrence are highly consistent among related cell types. Furthermore, independently validated co-occurring and directly interacting TFs are significantly enriched in our predictions. Focusing on the regulatory network derived from the predicted co-occurring TF pairs in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) we find that it consists of three subnetworks with distinct functions: maintenance of pluripotency governed by OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG, regulation of early development governed by KLF4, STAT3, ZIC3 and ZNF148 and general functions governed by MYC, TCF3 and YY1. In summary, coTRaCTE predicts highly cell-type specific co-occurring TFs which reveal new insights into transcriptional regulatory mechanisms.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9JI8ApvfZSc" width="1" />

<p>by Massimo Silvetti, Eliana Vassena, Elger Abrahamse, Tom Verguts</p>

Optimal decision-making is based on integrating information from several dimensions of decisional space (e.g., reward expectation, cost estimation, effort exertion). Despite considerable empirical and theoretical efforts, the computational and neural bases of such multidimensional integration have remained largely elusive. Here we propose that the current theoretical stalemate may be broken by considering the computational properties of a cortical-subcortical circuit involving the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the brainstem neuromodulatory nuclei: ventral tegmental area (VTA) and locus coeruleus (LC). From this perspective, the dACC optimizes decisions about stimuli and actions, and using the same computational machinery, it also modulates cortical functions (meta-learning), via neuromodulatory control (VTA and LC). We implemented this theory in a novel neuro-computational model–the Reinforcement Meta Learner (RML). We outline how the RML captures critical empirical findings from an unprecedented range of theoretical domains, and parsimoniously integrates various previous proposals on dACC functioning.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pRztMdJh6VU" width="1" />

<p>Energy landscapes are a useful aid for the understanding of dynamical
systems, and a valuable tool for their analysis. For a broad class of rate
models of neural networks, we derive a global Lyapunov function which provides
an energy landscape without any symmetry constraint. This newly obtained
`nonequilibrium potential' (NEP) predicts with high accuracy the outcomes of
the dynamics in the globally stable cases studied here. Common features of the
models in this class are bistability --with implications for working memory and
slow neural oscillations --and `population burst', also relevant in
neuroscience. Instead, limit cycles are not found. Their nonexistence can be
proven by resort to the Bendixson--Dulac theorem, at least when the NEP remains
positive and in the (also generic) singular limit of these models. Hopefully,
this NEP will help understand average neural network dynamics from a more
formal standpoint, and will also be of help in the description of large
heterogeneous neural networks.

<p>With respect to biological findings underlying fly's physiology in the past
decade, we present a directionally selective neural network, with a
feed-forward structure and entirely low-level visual processing, so as to
implement direction selective neurons in the fly's visual system, which are
mainly sensitive to wide-field translational movements in four cardinal
directions. In this research, we highlight the functionality of ON and OFF
pathways, separating motion information for parallel computation corresponding
to light-on and light-off selectivity. Through this modeling study, we
demonstrate several achievements compared with former bio-plausible
translational motion detectors, like the elementary motion detectors. First, we
thoroughly mimic the fly's preliminary motion-detecting pathways with newly
revealed fly's physiology. Second, we improve the speed response to moving
dark/light features via the design of ensembles of same polarity cells in the
dual-pathways. Moreover, we alleviate the impact of irrelevant motion in a
visually cluttered environment like the shifting of background and windblown
vegetation, via the modeling of spatiotemporal dynamics. We systematically
tested the DSNN against stimuli ranging from synthetic and real-world scenes,
to notably a visual modality of a ground micro robot. The results demonstrated
that the DSNN outperforms former bio-plausible translational motion detectors.
Importantly, we verified its computational simplicity and effectiveness
benefiting the building of neuromorphic vision sensor for robots.

<p>A common practice to account for psychophysical biases in vision is to frame
them as consequences of a dynamic process relying on optimal inference with
respect to a generative model. The present study details the complete
formulation of such a generative model intended to probe visual motion
perception with a dynamic texture model. It is first derived in a set of
axiomatic steps constrained by biological plausibility. We extend previous
contributions by detailing three equivalent formulations of this texture model.
First, the composite dynamic textures are constructed by the random aggregation
of warped patterns, which can be viewed as 3D Gaussian fields. Secondly, these
textures are cast as solutions to a stochastic partial differential equation
(sPDE). This essential step enables real time, on-the-fly texture synthesis
using time-discretized auto-regressive processes. It also allows for the
derivation of a local motion-energy model, which corresponds to the
log-likelihood of the probability density. The log-likelihoods are essential
for the construction of a Bayesian inference framework. We use the dynamic
texture model to psychophysically probe speed perception in humans using
zoom-like changes in the spatial frequency content of the stimulus. The human
data replicates previous findings showing perceived speed to be positively
biased by spatial frequency increments. A Bayesian observer who combines a
Gaussian likelihood centered at the true speed and a spatial frequency
dependent width with a "slow speed prior" successfully accounts for the
perceptual bias. More precisely, the bias arises from a decrease in the
observer's likelihood width estimated from the experiments as the spatial
frequency increases. Such a trend is compatible with the trend of the dynamic
texture likelihood width.

Epigenetic clocks for mice were generated based on deep-sequencing analysis of the methylome. Here, we demonstrate that site-specific analysis of DNA methylation levels by pyrosequencing at only three CG dinucleotides (CpGs) in the genes <i>Prima1</i>, <i>Hsf4</i>, and <i>Kcns1</i> facilitates precise estimation of chronological age in murine blood samples, too. DBA/2 mice revealed accelerated epigenetic aging as compared to C57BL6 mice, which is in line with their shorter life-expectancy. The three-CpG-predictor provides a simple and cost-effective biomarker to determine biological age in large intervention studies with mice.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/34929">Causal contribution and dynamical encoding in the striatum during evidence accumulation</a></h4>

A broad range of decision-making processes involve gradual accumulation of evidence over time, but the neural circuits responsible for this computation are not yet established. Recent data indicates that cortical regions prominently associated with accumulating evidence, such as posterior parietal cortex and the frontal orienting fields, may not be directly involved in this computation. Which, then, are the regions involved? Regions directly involved in evidence accumulation should directly influence the accumulation-based decision-making behavior, have a graded neural encoding of accumulated evidence and contribute throughout the accumulation process. Here, we investigated the role of the anterior dorsal striatum (ADS) in a rodent auditory evidence accumulation task using a combination of behavioral, pharmacological, optogenetic, electrophysiological and computational approaches. We find that the ADS is the first brain region known to satisfy the three criteria. Thus, the ADS may be the first identified node in the network responsible for evidence accumulation.

Behavioral adaptations occur through remodeling of brain circuits, as arising, for instance, from experience-dependent synaptic plasticity. Drugs of abuse and aversive stimuli, such as stress, act on the mesocorticolimbic system, dysregulating adaptive mechanisms and leading to a variety of aberrant behaviors associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. Until recently, research in the field has commonly focused on experience-dependent synaptic plasticity at excitatory synapses. However, there is growing evidence that synaptic plasticity within inhibitory circuits is an important contributor to maladaptive behaviors.

<p>by Richard E. Rosch, Paul R. Hunter, Torsten Baldeweg, Karl J. Friston, Martin P. Meyer</p>

Pathophysiological explanations of epilepsy typically focus on either the micro/mesoscale (e.g. excitation-inhibition imbalance), or on the macroscale (e.g. network architecture). Linking abnormalities across spatial scales remains difficult, partly because of technical limitations in measuring neuronal signatures concurrently at the scales involved. Here we use light sheet imaging of the larval zebrafish brain during acute epileptic seizure induced with pentylenetetrazole. Spectral changes of spontaneous neuronal activity during the seizure are then modelled using neural mass models, allowing Bayesian inference on changes in effective network connectivity and their underlying synaptic dynamics. This dynamic causal modelling of seizures in the zebrafish brain reveals concurrent changes in synaptic coupling at macro- and mesoscale. Fluctuations of both synaptic connection strength and their temporal dynamics are required to explain observed seizure patterns. These findings highlight distinct changes in local (intrinsic) and long-range (extrinsic) synaptic transmission dynamics as a possible seizure pathomechanism and illustrate how our Bayesian model inversion approach can be used to link existing neural mass models of seizure activity and novel experimental methods.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kBUcHrhwctQ" width="1" />

<p>by Niru Maheswaranathan, David B. Kastner, Stephen A. Baccus, Surya Ganguli</p>

A central challenge in sensory neuroscience involves understanding how neural circuits shape computations across cascaded cell layers. Here we attempt to reconstruct the response properties of experimentally unobserved neurons in the interior of a multilayered neural circuit, using cascaded linear-nonlinear (LN-LN) models. We combine non-smooth regularization with proximal consensus algorithms to overcome difficulties in fitting such models that arise from the high dimensionality of their parameter space. We apply this framework to retinal ganglion cell processing, learning LN-LN models of retinal circuitry consisting of thousands of parameters, using 40 minutes of responses to white noise. Our models demonstrate a 53% improvement in predicting ganglion cell spikes over classical linear-nonlinear (LN) models. Internal nonlinear subunits of the model match properties of retinal bipolar cells in both receptive field structure and number. Subunits have consistently high thresholds, supressing all but a small fraction of inputs, leading to sparse activity patterns in which only one subunit drives ganglion cell spiking at any time. From the model’s parameters, we predict that the removal of visual redundancies through stimulus decorrelation across space, a central tenet of efficient coding theory, originates primarily from bipolar cell synapses. Furthermore, the composite nonlinear computation performed by retinal circuitry corresponds to a boolean OR function applied to bipolar cell feature detectors. Our methods are statistically and computationally efficient, enabling us to rapidly learn hierarchical non-linear models as well as efficiently compute widely used descriptive statistics such as the spike triggered average (STA) and covariance (STC) for high dimensional stimuli. This general computational framework may aid in extracting principles of nonlinear hierarchical sensory processing across diverse modalities from limited data.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oIPwD8-KVAo" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39088">Stepwise wiring of the Drosophila olfactory map requires specific Plexin B levels</a></h4>

The precise assembly of a neural circuit involves many consecutive steps. The conflict between a limited number of wiring molecules and the complexity of the neural network impels each molecule to execute multiple functions at different steps. Here, we examined the cell-type specific distribution of endogenous levels of axon guidance receptor Plexin B (PlexB) in the developing antennal lobe, the first olfactory processing center in <i>Drosophila</i>. We found that different classes of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) express PlexB at different levels in two wiring steps - axonal trajectory choice and subsequent target selection. In line with its temporally distinct patterns, the proper levels of PlexB control both steps in succession. Genetic interactions further revealed that the effect of high-level PlexB is antagonized by its canonical partner Sema2b. Thus, PlexB plays a multifaceted role in instructing the assembly of the <i>Drosophila</i> olfactory circuit through temporally-regulated expression patterns and expression level-dependent effects.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38529">Negative regulation of conserved <i>RSL</i> class I bHLH transcription factors evolved independently among land plants</a></h4>

Basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors encoded by <i>RSL</i> class I genes control a gene regulatory network that positively regulates the development of filamentous rooting cells - root hairs and rhizoids - in land plants. The GLABRA2 transcription factor negatively regulates these genes in the angiosperm <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. To find negative regulators of <i>RSL</i> class I genes in early diverging land plants we conducted a mutant screen in the liverwort <i>Marchantia polymorpha</i>. This identified FEW RHIZOIDS1 (MpFRH1) microRNA (miRNA) that negatively regulates the <i>RSL </i>class I gene Mp<i>RSL1</i>. The miRNA and its mRNA target constitute a feedback mechanism that controls epidermal cell differentiation. MpFRH1 miRNA target sites are conserved among liverwort <i>RSL</i> class I mRNAs but are not present in <i>RSL</i> class I mRNAs of other land plants. These findings indicate that while <i>RSL</i> class I genes are ancient and conserved, independent negative regulatory mechanisms evolved in different lineages during land plant evolution.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37911">An asymmetric centromeric nucleosome</a></h4>

Nucleosomes contain two copies of each core histone, held together by a naturally symmetric, homodimeric histone H3-H3 interface. This symmetry has complicated efforts to determine the regulatory potential of this architecture. Through molecular design and in vivo selection, we recently generated obligately heterodimeric H3s, providing a powerful tool for discovery of the degree to which nucleosome symmetry regulates chromosomal functions in living cells (Ichikawa et al., 2017). We now have extended this tool to the centromeric H3 isoform (Cse4/CENP-A) in budding yeast. These studies indicate that a single Cse4 N- or C-terminal extension per pair of Cse4 molecules is sufficient for kinetochore function, and validate previous experiments indicating that an octameric centromeric nucleosome is required for viability in this organism. These data also support the generality of the H3 asymmetric interface for probing general questions in chromatin biology.

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by the progressive degeneration of motoneurons in the primary motor cortex (pMO) and in spinal cord. However, the pathogenic process involves multiple subnetworks in the brain and functional MRI studies demonstrate an increase in functional connectivity in areas connected to pMO despite the ongoing neurodegeneration. The extent and the structural basis of the motor subnetwork remodelling in experimentally-tractable models remain unclear. We have developed a new retrograde AAV9 to quantitatively map the projections to pMO in the SOD1(G93A) ALS mouse model. We show an increase in the number of neurons projecting from somatosensory cortex to pMO at presymptomatic stages, followed by an increase in projections from thalamus, auditory cortex and contralateral MO (inputs from 20 other structures remains unchanged) as disease advances. The stage- and structure-dependent remodeling of projection to pMO in ALS may provide insights into the hyperconnectivity observed in ALS patients.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Maternal folic acid supplementation during pregnancy is associated with improved cognitive performances in offspring. However, the effect of supplementation on offspring’s neurogenesis and synaptogenesis is unknown, and whether supplementation should be continued throughout pregnancy is controversial. In present study, 3 groups of female rats were fed a folate-normal diet, folate-deficient diet, or folate-supplemented diet from 1 week before mating until the end of pregnancy. A fourth group fed folate-normal diet from 1 week before mating until mating, then fed folate-supplemented diet for 10 consecutive days, then fed folate-normal diet until the end of pregnancy. Offspring were sacrificed on postnatal day 0 for measurement of neurogenesis and synaptogenesis by immunofluorescence and western blot. Additionally neural stem cells (NSCs) were cultured from offspring’s hippocampus for immunocytochemical measurement of their rates of proliferation and neuronal differentiation. The results demonstrated that maternal folic acid supplementation stimulated hippocampal neurogenesis by increasing proliferation and neuronal differentiation of NSCs, and also enhanced synaptogenesis in cerebral cortex of neonatal offspring. Hippocampal neurogenesis was stimulated more when supplementation was continued throughout pregnancy instead of being limited to the periconceptional period. In conclusion, maternal folic acid supplementation, especially if continued throughout pregnancy, improves neurogenesis and synaptogenesis in neonatal offspring.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are increasingly prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by sociocommunicative impairments. Growing consensus indicates that neurobehavioral abnormalities require explanation in terms of interconnected networks. Despite theoretical speculations about increased local and reduced distal connectivity, links between local and distal functional connectivity have not been systematically investigated in ASDs. Specifically, it remains open whether hypothesized local overconnectivity may reflect isolated versus overly integrative processing. Resting state functional MRI data from 57 children and adolescents with ASDs and 51 typically developing (TD) participants were included. In regional homogeneity (ReHo) analyses, pericalcarine visual cortex was found be locally overconnected (ASD &gt; TD). Using this region as seed in whole-brain analyses, we observed overconnectivity in distal regions, specifically middle frontal gyri, for an ASD subgroup identified through <span style="font-style: italic;">k</span>-means clustering. While in this subgroup local occipital to distal frontal overconnectivity was associated with greater symptom severity, a second subgroup showed the opposite pattern of connectivity and symptom severity correlations. Our findings suggest that increased local connectivity in ASDs is region-specific and may be partially associated with more integrative long-distance connectivity. Results also highlight the need to test for subtypes, as differential patterns of brain–behavior links were observed in two distinct subgroups of our ASD cohort.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Memory retrieval can strengthen, but also distort memories. Parietal cortex is a candidate region involved in retrieval-induced memory changes as it reflects retrieval success and represents retrieved content. Here, we conducted an fMRI experiment to test whether different forms of parietal reactivation predict distinct consequences of retrieval. Subjects studied associations between words and pictures of faces, scenes, or objects, and then repeatedly retrieved half of the pictures, reporting the vividness of the retrieved pictures (“retrieval practice”). On the following day, subjects completed a recognition memory test for individual pictures. Critically, the test included lures highly similar to studied pictures. Behaviorally, retrieval practice increased both hit and false alarm (FA) rates to similar lures, confirming a causal influence of retrieval on subsequent memory. Using pattern similarity analyses, we measured two different levels of reactivation during retrieval practice: generic “category-level” reactivation and idiosyncratic “item-level” reactivation. Vivid remembering during retrieval practice was associated with stronger category- and item-level reactivation in parietal cortex. However, these measures differentially predicted subsequent recognition memory performance: whereas higher category-level reactivation tended to predict FAs to lures, item-level reactivation predicted correct rejections. These findings indicate that parietal reactivation can be decomposed to tease apart distinct consequences of memory retrieval.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Lead (Pb) causes significant adverse effects on the developing brain, resulting in cognitive and learning disabilities in children. The process by which lead produces these negative changes is largely unknown. The fact that children with these syndromes also show deficits in central auditory processing, however, indicates a speculative but disturbing relationship between lead-exposure, impaired auditory processing, and behavioral dysfunction. Here we studied in rats the changes in cortical spatial tuning impacted by early lead-exposure and their potential restoration to normal by auditory training. We found animals that were exposed to lead early in life displayed significant behavioral impairments compared with naïve controls while conducting the sound-azimuth discrimination task. Lead-exposure also degraded the sound-azimuth selectivity of neurons in the primary auditory cortex. Subsequent sound-azimuth discrimination training, however, restored to nearly normal the lead-degraded cortical azimuth selectivity. This reversal of cortical spatial fidelity was paralleled by changes in cortical expression of certain excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor subunits. These results in a rodent model demonstrate the persisting neurotoxic effects of early lead-exposure on behavioral and cortical neuronal processing of spatial information of sound. They also indicate that attention-demanding auditory training may remediate lead-induced cortical neurological deficits even after these deficits have occurred.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The phenomenon of cortical thinning with age has been well established; however, the measured rate of change varies between studies. The source of this variation could be image acquisition techniques including hardware and vendor specific differences. Databases are often consolidated to increase the number of subjects but underlying differences between these datasets could have undesired effects. We explore differences in cerebral cortex thinning between 4 databases, totaling 1382 subjects. We investigate several aspects of these databases, including: 1) differences between databases of cortical thinning rates versus age, 2) correlation of cortical thinning rates between regions for each database, and 3) regression bootstrapping to determine the effect of the number of subjects included. We also examined the effect of different databases on age prediction modeling. Cortical thinning rates were significantly different between databases in all 68 parcellated regions (ANCOVA, <span style="font-style: italic;">P</span> &lt; 0.001). Subtle differences were observed in correlation matrices and bootstrapping convergence. Age prediction modeling using a leave-one-out cross-validation approach showed varying prediction performance (0.64 &lt; <span style="font-style: italic;">R</span><sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.82) between databases. When a database was used to calibrate the model and then applied to another database, prediction performance consistently decreased. We conclude that there are indeed differences in the measured cortical thinning rates between these large-scale databases.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Musical training has been demonstrated to benefit speech-in-noise perception. It is however unknown whether this effect translates to selective listening in cocktail party situations, and if so what its neural basis might be. We investigated this question using magnetoencephalography-based speech envelope reconstruction and a sustained selective listening task, in which participants with varying amounts of musical training attended to 1 of 2 speech streams while detecting rare target words. Cortical frequency-following responses (FFR) and auditory working memory were additionally measured to dissociate musical training-related effects on low-level auditory processing versus higher cognitive function. Results show that the duration of musical training is associated with a reduced distracting effect of competing speech on target detection accuracy. Remarkably, more musical training was related to a robust neural tracking of both the to-be-attended and the to-be-ignored speech stream, up until late cortical processing stages. Musical training-related increases in FFR power were associated with a robust speech tracking in auditory sensory areas, whereas training-related differences in auditory working memory were linked to an increased representation of the to-be-ignored stream beyond auditory cortex. Our findings suggest that musically trained persons can use additional information about the distracting stream to limit interference by competing speech.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an RNA-binding protein involved in translational regulation of mRNAs that play key roles in synaptic morphology and plasticity. The functional absence of FMRP causes the fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and the most common monogenic cause of autism. No effective treatment is available for FXS. We recently identified the <span style="font-style: italic;">Phosphodiesterase 2A</span> (<span style="font-style: italic;">Pde2a</span>) mRNA as a prominent target of FMRP. PDE2A enzymatic activity is increased in the brain of <span style="font-style: italic;">Fmr1</span>-KO mice, a recognized model of FXS, leading to decreased levels of cAMP and cGMP. Here, we pharmacologically inhibited PDE2A in <span style="font-style: italic;">Fmr1</span>-KO mice and observed a rescue both of the maturity of dendritic spines and of the exaggerated hippocampal mGluR-dependent long-term depression. Remarkably, PDE2A blockade rescued the social and communicative deficits of both mouse and rat <span style="font-style: italic;">Fmr1-</span>KO animals. Importantly, chronic inhibition of PDE2A in newborn <span style="font-style: italic;">Fmr1</span>-KO mice followed by a washout interval, resulted in the rescue of the altered social behavior observed in adolescent mice. Altogether, these results reveal the key role of PDE2A in the physiopathology of FXS and suggest that its pharmacological inhibition represents a novel therapeutic approach for FXS.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The hierarchical nature of language requires human brain to internally parse connected-speech and incrementally construct abstract linguistic structures. Recent research revealed multiple neural processing timescales underlying grammar-based configuration of linguistic hierarchies. However, little is known about where in the whole cerebral cortex such temporally scaled neural processes occur. This study used novel magnetoencephalography source imaging techniques combined with a unique language stimulation paradigm to segregate cortical maps synchronized to 3 levels of linguistic units (i.e., words, phrases, and sentences). Notably, distinct ensembles of cortical loci were identified to feature structures at different levels. The superior temporal gyrus was found to be involved in processing all 3 linguistic levels while distinct ensembles of other brain regions were recruited to encode each linguistic level. Neural activities in the right motor cortex only followed the rhythm of monosyllabic words which have clear acoustic boundaries, whereas the left anterior temporal lobe and the left inferior frontal gyrus were selectively recruited in processing phrases or sentences. Our results ground a multi-timescale hierarchical neural processing of speech in neuroanatomical reality with specific sets of cortices responsible for different levels of linguistic units.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Acupuncture can provide therapeutic analgesic benefits but is limited by its cost and scheduling difficulties. Guided imagery is a commonly used method for treating many disorders, such as chronic pain. The present study examined a novel intervention for pain relief that integrates acupuncture with imagery called video-guided acupuncture imagery treatment (VGAIT). A total of 27 healthy subjects were recruited for a crossover-design study that included 5 sessions administered in a randomized order (i.e., baseline and 4 different interventions). We investigated changes in pain threshold and fMRI signals modulated by: 1) VGAIT, watching a video of acupuncture previously administered on the participant’s own body at baseline while imagining it being concurrently applied; 2) a VGAIT control condition, watching a video of a cotton swab touching the skin; 3) real acupuncture; and 4) sham acupuncture. Results demonstrated that real acupuncture and VGAIT significantly increased pain threshold compared with respective control groups. Imaging showed that real acupuncture produced greater activation of the insula compared with VGAIT. VGAIT produced greater deactivation at the rostral anterior cingulate cortex. Our findings demonstrate that VGAIT holds potential clinical value for pain management.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Aging is characterized by substantial average decline in memory performance. Yet contradictory explanations have been given for how the brains of high-performing older adults work: either by engagement of compensatory processes such as recruitment of additional networks or by maintaining young adults’ patterns of activity. Distinguishing these components requires large experimental samples and longitudinal follow-up. Here, we investigate which features are key to high memory in aging, directly testing these hypotheses by studying a large sample of adult participants (<span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> &gt; 300) with fMRI during an episodic memory experiment where item-context relationships were implicitly encoded. The analyses revealed that low levels of activity in frontal networks—known to be involved in memory encoding—were associated with low memory performance in the older adults only. Importantly, older participants with low memory performance and low frontal activity exhibited a strong longitudinal memory decline in an independent verbal episodic memory task spanning 8 years back (<span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> = 52). These participants were also characterized by lower hippocampal volumes and steeper rates of cortical atrophy. Altogether, maintenance of frontal brain function during encoding seems to be a primary characteristic of preservation of memory function in aging, likely reflecting intact ability to integrate information.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The heterogeneous neuronal subgroups of the basal forebrain corticopetal system (BFcs) have been shown to modulate cortical functions through their cholinergic, gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic, and glutamatergic projections to the entire cortex. Although previous studies suggested that the basalo-cortical projection system influences various cognitive functions, particularly via its cholinergic component, these studies only focused on certain parts of the BFcs or nearby structures, leaving aside a more systematic picture of the functional connectivity of BFcs subcompartments. Moreover, these studies lacked the high-spatial resolution and the probability maps needed to identify specific subcompartments. Recent advances in the ultra-high field 7T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provided potentially unprecedented spatial resolution of functional MRI images to study the subdivision of the BFcs. In this study, the BF space containing corticopetal cells was divided into 3 functionally distinct subdivisions based on functional connection to cortical regions derived from fMRI. The overall functional connection of each BFcs subdivision was examined with a test-retest study. Finally, a meta-analysis was used to study the related functional topics of each BF subdivision. Our results demonstrate distinct functional connectivity patterns of these subdivisions along the rostrocaudal axis of the BF. All three compartments have shown consistent segregation and overlap at specific target regions including the hippocampus, insula, thalamus, and the cingulate gyrus, suggesting functional integration and separation in BFcs.</span>

Arousal is an important conserved behavioral state where animals show increased sensory responsiveness and locomotor hyperactivity. Chew et al. identify a neuromodulatory pathway that enables mechanosensory neurons to promote both sensory and locomotor arousal via activation of a neuroendocrine center.

Treatment-naive MDD patients have increased levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory markers, but overall the balance shifts toward immunosuppression of immune cells. Consistent with these findings, absence of response to antidepressant treatments has been associated with defective anti-inflammatory response.

Developmental remodeling is crucial for stereotypic neural circuit formation. Mayseless et al. describe a neural circuit in Drosophila that undergoes coordinated remodeling. They show that neurons within the same circuit interact via neuronal activity and Ca2+/Calmodulin signaling to coordinate remodeling.

A user ready, portable, documented software package, <i>NFTsim</i>, is presented to facilitate numerical simulations of a wide range of brain systems using continuum neural field modeling. <i>NFTsim</i> enables users to simulate key aspects of brain activity at multiple scales. At the microscopic scale, it incorporates characteristics of local interactions between cells, neurotransmitter effects, synaptodendritic delays and feedbacks. At the mesoscopic scale, it incorporates information about medium to large scale axonal ranges of fibers, which are essential to model dissipative wave transmission and to produce synchronous oscillations and associated cross-correlation patterns as observed in local field potential recordings of active tissue. At the scale of the whole brain, <i>NFTsim</i> allows for the inclusion of long range pathways, such as thalamocortical projections, when generating macroscopic activity fields. The multiscale nature of the neural activity produced by <i>NFTsim</i> has the potential to enable the modeling of resulting quantities measurable via various neuroimaging techniques. In this work, we give a comprehensive description of the design and implementation of the software. Due to its modularity and flexibility, <i>NFTsim</i> enables the systematic study of an unlimited number of neural systems with multiple neural populations under a unified framework and allows for direct comparison with analytic and experimental predictions. The code is written in C++ and bundled with Matlab routines for a rapid quantitative analysis and visualization of the outputs. The output of <i>NFTsim</i> is stored in plain text file enabling users to select from a broad range of tools for offline analysis. This software enables a wide and convenient use of powerful physiologically-based neural field approaches to brain modeling. <i>NFTsim</i> is distributed under the Apache 2.0 license.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/g1o5xA2JDTA" width="1" />

<p>by Arnab Bandyopadhyay, Huijing Wang, J. Christian J. Ray</p>

The molecular makeup of the offspring of a dividing cell gradually becomes phenotypically decorrelated from the parent cell by noise and regulatory mechanisms that amplify phenotypic heterogeneity. Such regulatory mechanisms form networks that contain thresholds between phenotypes. Populations of cells can be poised near the threshold so that a subset of the population probabilistically undergoes the phenotypic transition. We sought to characterize the diversity of bacterial populations around a growth-modulating threshold via analysis of the effect of non-genetic inheritance, similar to conditions that create antibiotic-tolerant persister cells and other examples of bet hedging. Using simulations and experimental lineage data in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, we present evidence that regulation of growth amplifies the dependence of growth arrest on cellular lineage, causing clusters of related cells undergo growth arrest in certain conditions. Our simulations predict that lineage correlations and the sensitivity of growth to changes in toxin levels coincide in a critical regime. Below the critical regime, the sizes of related growth arrested clusters are distributed exponentially, while in the critical regime clusters sizes are more likely to become large. Furthermore, phenotypic diversity can be nearly as high as possible near the critical regime, but for most parameter values it falls far below the theoretical limit. We conclude that lineage information is indispensable for understanding regulation of cellular growth.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fxo6jPZ5mP4" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Oscillations in local field potentials (LFPs) are prevalent and contribute to brain function. An understanding of the cellular correlates and pathways affecting LFPs is needed but many overlapping pathways in vivo make this difficult to achieve. A prevalent LFP rhythm in the hippocampus associated with memory processing and spatial navigation is the theta (3-12 Hz) oscillation. Theta rhythms emerge intrinsically in an in vitro whole hippocampus preparation and this reduced preparation makes it possible to assess the contribution of different cell types to LFP generation. We focus on oriens-lacunosum/moleculare (OLM) cells as a major class of interneurons in the hippocampus. OLM cells can influence pyramidal (PYR) cells through two distinct pathways: by direct inhibition of PYR cell distal dendrites, and by indirect disinhibition of PYR cell proximal dendrites. We use previous inhibitory network models and build biophysical LFP models using volume conductor theory. We examine the effect of OLM cells to ongoing intrinsic LFP theta rhythms by directly comparing our model LFP features with experiment. We find that OLM cell inputs regulate the robustness of LFP responses without affecting their average power and that this robust response depends on co-activation of distal inhibition and basal excitation. We use our models to estimate the spatial extent of the region generating LFP theta rhythms, leading us to predict that about 22,000 PYR cells participate in intrinsic theta generation. Besides obtaining an understanding of OLM cell contributions to intrinsic LFP theta rhythms, our work can help decipher cellular correlates of in vivo LFPs.</p><p><b>Significance</b> Oscillatory local field potentials (LFPs) are extracellularly recorded signals that are widely used to interpret information processing in the brain. Theta (3-12 Hz) LFP rhythms are correlated with memory processing, and inhibitory cell subtypes contribute in particular ways to theta. While a precise biophysical modeling scheme linking cellular activity to LFP signals has been established, it is difficult to assess cellular contributions <i>in vivo</i> to LFPs because of spatiotemporally overlapping pathways that prevent the unambiguous separation of signals. Using an <i>in vitro</i> preparation that exhibits theta rhythms and where there is much less overlap, we build biophysical LFP models and uncover distinct inhibitory cellular contributions. This work brings us closer to obtaining cellular correlates of LFPs and brain function.</p>

<p>Fractional extensions of the cable equation have been proposed in the
literature to describe transmembrane potential in spiny dendrites. The
anomalous behavior has been related in the literature to the geometrical
properties of the system, in particular, the density of spines, by experiments,
computer simulations, and in comb-like models.~The same PDE can be related to
more than one stochastic process leading to anomalous diffusion behavior. The
time-fractional diffusion equation can be associated to a continuous time
random walk (CTRW) with power-law waiting time probability or to a special case
of the Erd\'ely-Kober fractional diffusion, described by the ggBm. In this
work, we show that time fractional generalization of the cable equation arises
naturally in the CTRW by considering a superposition of Markovian processes and
in a {\it ggBm-like} construction of the random variable.

<p>Continuous attractor neural networks generate a set of smoothly connected
attractor states. In memory systems of the brain, these attractor states may
represent continuous pieces of information such as spatial locations and head
directions of animals. However, during the replay of previous experiences,
hippocampal neurons show a discontinuous sequence in which discrete transitions
of neural state are phase-locked with the slow-gamma (30-40 Hz) oscillation.
Here, we explored the underlying mechanisms of the discontinuous sequence
generation. We found that a continuous attractor neural network has several
phases depending on the interactions between external input and local
inhibitory feedback. The discrete-attractor-like behavior naturally emerges in
one of these phases without any discreteness assumption. We propose that the
dynamics of continuous attractor neural networks is the key to generate
discontinuous state changes phase-locked to the brain rhythm.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38867">The aryl hydrocarbon receptor and interferon gamma generate antiviral states via transcriptional repression</a></h4>

The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor whose activation induces the expression of numerous genes, with many effects on cells. However, AhR activation is not known to affect the replication of viruses. We show that AhR activation in macrophages causes a block to HIV-1 and HSV-1 replication. We find that AhR activation transcriptionally represses cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)1/2 and their associated cyclins, thereby reducing SAMHD1 phosphorylation, cellular dNTP levels and both HIV-1 and HSV-1 replication. Remarkably, a different antiviral stimulus, interferon gamma (IFN-g), that induces a largely non-overlapping set of genes, also transcriptionally represses CDK1, CDK2 and their associated cyclins, resulting in similar dNTP depletion and antiviral effects. Concordantly, the SIV Vpx protein provides complete and partial resistance to the antiviral effects of AhR and IFN-g, respectively. Thus, distinct antiviral signaling pathways converge on CDK/cyclin repression, causing inhibition of viral DNA synthesis and replication.

Many internal organs change volume periodically. For example, the stomach accommodates ingested food and drink, the bladder stores urine, the heart fills with blood, and the lungs expand with every breath. Specialized peripheral sensory neurons function as mechanoreceptors that detect tissue stretch to infer changes in organ volume and then relay this information to the brain. Central neural circuits process this information and evoke perceptions (satiety, nausea), control physiology (breathing, heart rate), and impact behavior (feeding, micturition).

Melanopsin is a photopigment expressed by certain types of retinal ganglion cells that mediate non-image-forming visual functions, such as circadian photoentrainment. In this issue of Neuron, Sonoda et al. (2018) reveal how melanopsin also regulates the sensitivity of conventional image-forming vision.

Current evidence challenges the traditional view of attention as a continuously active spotlight, suggesting instead a rhythmic operation at around 4–8 Hz. New intracranial recordings in monkeys and humans, including two papers in this issue of Neuron, by Helfrich et al. (2018) and Fiebelkorn et al. (2018), now validate this alternative notion and characterize its oscillatory neural bases.

<p>The peripheral trigeminovascular pathway mediates orofacial and craniofacial pain and projects centrally to the brainstem trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNc). Sensitization of this pathway is involved in many pain conditions, but little is known about synaptic plasticity at its first central synapse. We have taken advantage of optogenetics to investigate plasticity selectively evoked at synapses of nociceptive primary afferents onto TNc neurons. Based on immunolabeling in the trigeminal ganglia, TRPV1-lineage neurons comprise primarily peptidergic and nonpeptidergic nociceptors. Optical stimulation of channelrhodopsin-expressing axons in the TRPV1/ChR2 mouse in TNc slices thus allowed us to activate a nociceptor-enriched subset of primary afferents. We recorded from lamina I/II neurons in acutely prepared transverse TNc slices, and alternately stimulated two independent afferent pathways, one with light-activated nociceptive afferents and the other with electrically-activated inputs. Low-frequency optical stimulation induced robust long-term depression (LTD) of optically-evoked EPSCs, but not of electrically-evoked EPSCs in the same neurons. Blocking NMDA receptors or nitric oxide synthase strongly attenuated LTD, whereas a cannabinoid receptor 1 antagonist had no effect. The neuropeptide PACAP-38 or the nitric oxide donors nitroglycerin or sodium nitroprusside are pharmacologic triggers of human headache. Bath application of any of these three compounds also persistently depressed optically-evoked EPSCs. Together, our data show that LTD of nociceptive afferent synapses on trigeminal nucleus neurons is elicited when the afferents are activated at frequencies consistent with the development of central sensitization of the trigeminovascular pathway.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Animal models suggest that sensitization of trigeminovascular afferents plays a major role in craniofacial pain syndromes including primary headaches and trigeminal neuralgia, yet little is known about synaptic transmission and plasticity in the brainstem trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNc). Here we used optogenetics to selectively drive a nociceptor-enriched population of trigeminal afferents while recording from superficial laminae neurons in the TNc. Low-frequency optical stimulation evoked robust long-term depression at TRPV1/ChR2 synapses. Moreover, application of three different headache trigger drugs also depressed TRPV1/ChR2 synapses. Synaptic depression at these primary afferent synapses may represent a newly identified mechanism contributing to central sensitization during headache.</p>

<p>Epigenetic mechanisms have gained increasing attention as regulators of synaptic plasticity and responsiveness to drugs of abuse. In particular, it has been shown that the activity of the DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a) mediates certain long-lasting effects of cocaine. Here we examined the role of the Dnmt isoforms, <i>Dnmt3a1</i> and <i>Dnmt3a2</i>, within the nucleus accumbens (NAc) on transcriptional activity of immediate early genes (IEGs) and acute and long-lasting responsiveness to cocaine and cocaine conditioned cues. Using primary striatal cultures, we show that transcription of <i>Dnmt3a2</i>, but not that of <i>Dnmt3a1</i>, is activated by dopamine D1 receptor signaling and that knockdown of <i>Dnmt3a2</i> using viral vector-mediated expression of Dnmt3a2-specific shRNAs impairs induction of the IEGs, <i>Arc</i>, <i>FosB</i>, and <i>Egr2</i>. Acute cocaine administration increases expression of <i>Dnmt3a2</i> but not that of <i>Dnmt3a1</i> in the NAc shell. In contrast, in the NAc core, expression of <i>Dnmt3a1</i> and <i>Dnmt3a2</i> was unaffected by cocaine administration. shRNA-mediated knockdown of <i>Dnmt3a2 in vivo</i> impairs the induction of IEGs, including <i>Egr2</i> and <i>FosB</i> indicating that Dnmt3a2 regulates cocaine-dependent expression of plasticity genes in the rat NAc shell. Cocaine self-administration experiments in rats revealed that Dnmt3a2 regulates drug cue memories that drive reinstatement of cocaine seeking as well as incubation of this phenomenon within the NAc shell. Dnmt3a2 does not influence the primary reinforcing effects of cocaine. Thus, Dnmt3a2 mediates long-lasting cocaine cue memories within the NAc shell. Targeting <i>Dnmt3a2</i> expression or function may interfere with cocaine craving and relapse.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In humans, drug craving can occur in response to conditioned cues, even after extended periods of abstinence. In rats, cue-induced cocaine seeking has been shown to increase progressively during the first 2 months of abstinence from drug self-administration. This phenomenon, referred to as incubation of cocaine seeking, is consistent with the hypothesis that in humans craving increases over time and remains high following prolonged abstinence. Those long-lasting behavioral changes are likely to be mediated by epigenetic effects and neuroplastic changes within the mesolimbic brain reward system. Here we show that a specific isoform of DNA-methyltransferases in the NAc shell regulates drug cue memories that drive reinstatement of cocaine seeking after both early abstinence and incubation of cocaine craving.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/34/7505?rss=1">Evidence for Compartmentalized Axonal Mitochondrial Biogenesis: Mitochondrial DNA Replication Increases in Distal Axons As an Early Response to Parkinson's Disease-Relevant Stress</a></h4>

<p>Dysregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis is implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). However, it is not clear how mitochondrial biogenesis is regulated in neurons, with their unique compartmentalized anatomy and energetic demands. This is particularly relevant in PD because selectively vulnerable neurons feature long, highly arborized axons where degeneration initiates. We previously found that exposure of neurons to chronic, sublethal doses of rotenone, a complex I inhibitor linked to PD, causes early increases in mitochondrial density specifically in distal axons, suggesting possible upregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis within axons. Here, we directly evaluated for evidence of mitochondrial biogenesis in distal axons and examined whether PD-relevant stress causes compartmentalized alterations. Using BrdU labeling and imaging to quantify replicating mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in primary rat neurons (pooled from both sexes), we provide evidence of mtDNA replication in axons along with cell bodies and proximal dendrites. We found that exposure to chronic, sublethal rotenone increases mtDNA replication first in neurites and later extending to cell bodies, complementing our mitochondrial density data. Further, isolating axons from cell bodies and dendrites, we discovered that rotenone exposure upregulates mtDNA replication in distal axons. Utilizing superresolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) imaging, we identified mtDNA replication at sites of mitochondrial–endoplasmic reticulum contacts in axons. Our evidence suggests that mitochondrial biogenesis occurs not only in cell bodies, but also in distal axons, and is altered under PD-relevant stress conditions in an anatomically compartmentalized manner. We hypothesize that this contributes to vulnerability in neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Mitochondrial biogenesis is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial and cellular health and has been linked to neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis. However, regulation of this process is poorly understood in CNS neurons, which rely on mitochondrial function for survival. Our findings offer fundamental insight into these regulatory mechanisms by demonstrating that replication of mitochondrial DNA, an essential precursor for biogenesis, can occur in distal regions of CNS neuron axons independent of the soma. Further, this process is upregulated specifically in axons as an early response to neurodegeneration-relevant stress. This is the first demonstration of the compartmentalized regulation of CNS neuronal mitochondrial biogenesis in response to stress and may prove a useful target in development of therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative disease.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/34/7492?rss=1">Face Repetition Probability Does Not Affect Repetition Suppression in Macaque Inferotemporal Cortex</a></h4>

<p>Repetition suppression, which refers to reduced neural activity for repeated stimuli, is typically explained by bottom-up or local adaptation mechanisms. However, recent theories have emphasized the role of top-down processes, suggesting that this response reduction reflects the fulfillment of perceptual expectations. To support this, an influential human fMRI study showed that the magnitude of suppression is modulated by the probability of a repetition. No such repetition probability effect was found in macaque inferior temporal (IT) cortex for spiking activity despite the presence of repetition suppression. Contrary to the human fMRI studies that showed an effect of repetition probability, the macaque single-unit study used a large variety of unfamiliar stimuli and the monkeys were not required to attend the stimuli. Here, as in the human fMRI studies, we used faces as stimuli and made the monkeys attend to the stimulus content. We simultaneously recorded spiking activity and local field potentials (LFPs) in the middle lateral face patch (ML) of one monkey (male) and a face-responsive region of another (female). Although we observed significant repetition suppression of spiking activity and high gamma-band LFPs in both animals, there were no effects of repetition probability even when repetitions were task relevant and repetition probability affected behavioral decisions. In conclusion, despite the use of face stimuli and a stimulus-related task, no neural signature of repetition probability was present for faces in a face responsive patch of macaque IT. This further challenges a general perceptual expectation account of repetition suppression.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Repetition suppression is a reduced brain activity for repeated stimuli commonly observed across species. In the predictive coding framework, such suppression is thought to reflect fulfilled perceptual expectations. Although this hypothesis is supported by several human fMRI studies reporting an effect of repetition probability on repetition suppression, this could not be replicated in single-cell recordings in monkey inferior temporal (IT) cortex. Subsequent studies narrowed down the conditions for the effect to requiring attention and being limited to particular stimulus categories such as faces. Here, we show that, even under these conditions, repetition suppression in monkey IT neurons is still unaffected by repetition probability, even in a task with a behavioral effect, challenging the perceptual expectation account of repetition suppression.</p>

<p>The widely projecting catecholaminergic (norepinephrine and dopamine) neurotransmitter systems profoundly shape the state of neuronal networks in the forebrain. Current models posit that the effects of catecholaminergic modulation on network dynamics are homogeneous across the brain. However, the brain is equipped with a variety of catecholamine receptors with distinct functional effects and heterogeneous density across brain regions. Consequently, catecholaminergic effects on brainwide network dynamics might be more spatially specific than assumed. We tested this idea through the analysis of fMRI measurements performed in humans (19 females, 5 males) at "rest" under pharmacological (atomoxetine-induced) elevation of catecholamine levels. We used a linear decomposition technique to identify spatial patterns of correlated fMRI signal fluctuations that were either increased or decreased by atomoxetine. This yielded two distinct spatial patterns, each expressing reliable and specific drug effects. The spatial structure of both fluctuation patterns resembled the spatial distribution of the expression of catecholamine receptor genes: α<sub>1</sub> norepinephrine receptors (for the fluctuation pattern: placebo &gt; atomoxetine), D<sub>2</sub>-like dopamine receptors (pattern: atomoxetine &gt; placebo), and β norepinephrine receptors (for both patterns, with correlations of opposite sign). We conclude that catecholaminergic effects on the forebrain are spatially more structured than traditionally assumed and at least in part explained by the heterogeneous distribution of various catecholamine receptors. Our findings link catecholaminergic effects on large-scale brain networks to low-level characteristics of the underlying neurotransmitter systems. They also provide key constraints for the development of realistic models of neuromodulatory effects on large-scale brain network dynamics.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The catecholamines norepinephrine and dopamine are an important class of modulatory neurotransmitters. Because of the widespread and diffuse release of these neuromodulators, it has commonly been assumed that their effects on neural interactions are homogeneous across the brain. Here, we present results from the human brain that challenge this view. We pharmacologically increased catecholamine levels and imaged the effects on the spontaneous covariations between brainwide fMRI signals at "rest." We identified two distinct spatial patterns of covariations: one that was amplified and another that was suppressed by catecholamines. Each pattern was associated with the heterogeneous spatial distribution of the expression of distinct catecholamine receptor genes. Our results provide novel insights into the catecholaminergic modulation of large-scale human brain dynamics.</p>

<p>Cilia of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) are the primary site of odor binding; hence, their loss results in anosmia, a clinical manifestation of pleiotropic ciliopathies for which there are no curative therapies. We used OSN-specific Ift88 knock-out mice (<i>Ift88</i><sup>osnKO</sup>) of both sexes to examine the mechanisms of ciliopathy-induced olfactory dysfunction and the potential for gene replacement to rescue odorant detection, restore olfactory circuitry, and restore odor-guided behaviors. Loss of OSN cilia in <i>Ift88</i><sup>osnKO</sup> mice resulted in substantially reduced odor detection and odor-driven synaptic activity in the olfactory bulb (OB). Defects in OSN axon targeting to the OB were also observed in parallel with aberrant odor-guided behavior. Intranasal gene delivery of wild-type IFT88 to <i>Ift88</i><sup>osnKO</sup> mice rescued OSN ciliation and peripheral olfactory function. Importantly, this recovery of sensory input in a limited number of mature OSNs was sufficient to restore axonal targeting in the OB of juvenile mice, and with delayed onset in adult mice. In addition, restoration of sensory input re-established course odor-guided behaviors. These findings highlight the spare capacity of the olfactory epithelium and the plasticity of primary synaptic input into the central olfactory system. The restoration of peripheral and central neuronal function supports the potential for treatment of ciliopathy-related anosmia using gene therapy.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Ciliopathies, for which there are no curative therapies, are genetic disorders that alter cilia morphology and/or function in numerous tissue types, including the olfactory system, leading to sensory dysfunction. We show that <i>in vivo</i> intranasal gene delivery restores peripheral olfactory function in a ciliopathy mouse model, including axonal targeting in the juvenile and adult olfactory bulb. Gene therapy also demonstrated restoration of olfactory perception by rescuing odor-guided behaviors. Understanding the therapeutic window and viability for gene therapy to restore odor detection and perception may facilitate translation of therapies to ciliopathy patients with olfactory dysfunctions.</p>

<p>Prediction plays a crucial role in perception, as prominently suggested by predictive coding theories. However, the exact form and mechanism of predictive modulations of sensory processing remain unclear, with some studies reporting a downregulation of the sensory response for predictable input whereas others observed an enhanced response. In a similar vein, downregulation of the sensory response for predictable input has been linked to either sharpening or dampening of the sensory representation, which are opposite in nature. In the present study, we set out to investigate the neural consequences of perceptual expectation of object stimuli throughout the visual hierarchy, using fMRI in human volunteers. Participants of both sexes were exposed to pairs of sequentially presented object images in a statistical learning paradigm, in which the first object predicted the identity of the second object. Image transitions were not task relevant; thus, all learning of statistical regularities was incidental. We found strong suppression of neural responses to expected compared with unexpected stimuli throughout the ventral visual stream, including primary visual cortex, lateral occipital complex, and anterior ventral visual areas. Expectation suppression in lateral occipital complex scaled positively with image preference and voxel selectivity, lending support to the dampening account of expectation suppression in object perception.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It has been suggested that the brain fundamentally relies on predictions and constructs models of the world to make sense of sensory information. Previous research on the neural basis of prediction has documented suppressed neural responses to expected compared with unexpected stimuli. In the present study, we demonstrate robust expectation suppression throughout the entire ventral visual stream, and underlying this suppression a dampening of the sensory representation in object-selective visual cortex, but not in primary visual cortex. Together, our results provide novel evidence in support of theories conceptualizing perception as an active inference process, which selectively dampens cortical representations of predictable objects. This dampening may support our ability to automatically filter out irrelevant, predictable objects.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/34/7440?rss=1">Enhancement of the Medial Olivocochlear System Prevents Hidden Hearing Loss</a></h4>

<p>Cochlear synaptopathy produced by exposure to noise levels that cause only transient auditory threshold elevations is a condition that affects many people and is believed to contribute to poor speech discrimination in noisy environments. These functional deficits in hearing, without changes in sensitivity, have been called hidden hearing loss (HHL). It has been proposed that activity of the medial olivocochlear (MOC) system can ameliorate acoustic trauma effects. Here we explore the role of the MOC system in HHL by comparing the performance of two different mouse models: an α9 nicotinic receptor subunit knock-out (KO; <i>Chrna9</i> KO), which lacks cholinergic transmission between efferent neurons and hair cells; and a gain-of-function knock-in (KI; <i>Chrna9L9</i>'<i>T</i> KI) carrying an α9 point mutation that leads to enhanced cholinergic activity. Animals of either sex were exposed to sound pressure levels that in wild-type produced transient cochlear threshold shifts and a decrease in neural response amplitudes, together with the loss of ribbon synapses, which is indicative of cochlear synaptopathy. Moreover, a reduction in the number of efferent contacts to outer hair cells was observed. In <i>Chrna9</i> KO ears, noise exposure produced permanent auditory threshold elevations together with cochlear synaptopathy. In contrast, the <i>Chrna9L9</i>'<i>T</i> KI was completely resistant to the same acoustic exposure protocol. These results show a positive correlation between the degree of HHL prevention and the level of cholinergic activity. Notably, enhancement of the MOC feedback promoted new afferent synapse formation, suggesting that it can trigger cellular and molecular mechanisms to protect and/or repair the inner ear sensory epithelium.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Noise overexposure is a major cause of a variety of perceptual disabilities, including speech-in-noise difficulties, tinnitus, and hyperacusis. Here we show that exposure to noise levels that do not cause permanent threshold elevations or hair cell death can produce a loss of cochlear nerve synapses to inner hair cells as well as degeneration of medial olivocochlear (MOC) terminals contacting the outer hair cells. Enhancement of the MOC reflex can prevent both types of neuropathy, highlighting the potential use of drugs that increase α9α10 nicotinic cholinergic receptor activity as a pharmacotherapeutic strategy to avoid hidden hearing loss.</p>

<p>Increased memory load is often signified by enhanced neural oscillatory power in the alpha range (8–13 Hz), which is taken to reflect inhibition of task-irrelevant brain regions. The corresponding neural correlates of memory decay, however, are not yet well understood. In the current study, we investigated auditory short-term memory decay in humans using a delayed matching-to-sample task with pure-tone sequences. First, in a behavioral experiment, we modeled memory performance over six different delay-phase durations. Second, in a MEG experiment, we assessed alpha-power modulations over three different delay-phase durations. In both experiments, the temporal expectation for the to-be-remembered sound was manipulated so that it was either temporally expected or not. In both studies, memory performance declined over time, but this decline was weaker when the onset time of the to-be-remembered sound was expected. Similarly, patterns of alpha power in and alpha-tuned connectivity between sensory cortices changed parametrically with delay duration (i.e., decrease in occipitoparietal regions, increase in temporal regions). Temporal expectation not only counteracted alpha-power decline in heteromodal brain areas (i.e., supramarginal gyrus), but also had a beneficial effect on memory decay, counteracting memory performance decline. Correspondingly, temporal expectation also boosted alpha connectivity within attention networks known to play an active role during memory maintenance. The present data show how patterns of alpha power orchestrate short-term memory decay and encourage a more nuanced perspective on alpha power across brain space and time beyond its inhibitory role.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our sensory memories of the physical world fade quickly. We show here that this decay of short-term memory can be counteracted by so-called temporal expectation; that is, knowledge of when to expect a sensory event that an individual must remember. We also show that neural oscillations in the "alpha" (8–13 Hz) range index both the degree of memory decay (for brief sound patterns) and the respective memory benefit from temporal expectation. Spatially distributed cortical patterns of alpha power show opposing effects in auditory versus visual sensory cortices. Moreover, alpha-tuned connectivity changes within supramodal attention networks reflect the allocation of neural resources as short-term memory representations fade.</p>

<p>Over-engagement of the mesolimbic dopamine system is thought to enhance motivation in adolescents. Whereas human neuroimaging has characterized event-evoked responses of the mesolimbic system in adolescents, research has yet to characterize state-dependent engagement (i.e., seconds to minutes) of this system in goal-relevant contexts. In the current longitudinal study, we characterized age-related changes in state-dependent coupling in male and female human participants ranging in age from adolescence to adulthood. Analyses focused on two key regions of the mesolimbic dopamine system, the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Although there were no differences in VTA–NAcc functional coupling in a resting-state context, VTA–NAcc functional coupling was enhanced in preadolescence/early adolescence and decreased into adulthood in a motivational context, in which individuals had to translate goal-relevant cues into instrumental actions. Furthermore, we found that task-related activation in orbitofrontal cortex, middle temporal gyrus, and visual association cortex partially mediated age-related changes in state-dependent VTA–NAcc functional coupling. These results extend prior models of neurodevelopment by showing a relationship between cortical event-evoked activation and state-dependent increases in subcortical engagement of mesolimbic systems.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Adolescence is characterized by increased motivated behavior, which is thought to result from an over-engagement of mesolimbic dopamine systems. Rodent models show increases in state-dependent engagement of mesolimbic systems in adolescence. However, human neuroimaging research has mainly focused on event-evoked responses (i.e., reward cues). We show that in motivational contexts, there is increased state-dependent coupling across mesolimbic systems in preadolescence/early adolescence that decreases into adulthood and is further predicted by event-evoked cortical responses. Critically, these developmental trajectories were specific to motivationally relevant contexts and were not apparent during resting state. These findings extend emerging models of human development and suggest that state-dependent increases in dopamine signaling may underlie heightened motivation.</p>

<p>Inositol hexakisphosphate kinases (IP6Ks) regulate various biological processes. Among pyrophosphates generated by IP6Ks, diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate (IP7), and bis-diphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphate have been extensively characterized. IP7 is produced in mammals by a family of inositol hexakisphosphate kinases, IP6K1, IP6K2, and IP6K3, which have distinct biological functions. We report that IP6K2 binds protein 4.1.N with high affinity and specificity. Nuclear translocation of 4.1N, which is required for its principal functions, is dependent on IP6K2. Both of these proteins are highly expressed in granule cells of the cerebellum where their interaction regulates Purkinje cell morphology and cerebellar synapses. The deletion of IP6K2 in male/female mice elicits substantial defects in synaptic influences of granule cells upon Purkinje cells as well as notable impairment of locomotor function. Moreover, the disruption of IP6K2–4.1N interactions impairs cell viability. Thus, IP6K2 and its interaction with 4.1N appear to be major determinants of cerebellar disposition and psychomotor behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Inositol phosphates are produced by a family of inositol hexakisphosphate kinases (IP6Ks)—IP6K1, IP6K2, and IP6K3. Of these, the physiological roles of IP6K2 in the brain have been least characterized. In the present study, we report that IP6K2 binds selectively to the neuronal protein 4.1N. Both of these proteins are highly expressed in granule cells of the cerebellum. Using IP6K2 knock-out (KO) mice, we establish that IP6K2–4.1N interactions in granule cells regulate Purkinje cell morphology, the viability of cerebellar neurons, and psychomotor behavior.</p>

<p>Literature suggests that the hippocampus is central to processing visual scenes to remember contextual information, but the roles of its downstream structure, subiculum, remain unknown. Here, single units were recorded simultaneously in the dorsal CA1 and subiculum while male rats made spatial choices using visual scenes as cues in a T-maze. The firing fields of subicular neurons were schematically organized following the task structure, largely divided into pre-choice and post-choice epochs, whereas those of CA1 cells were more punctate and bound to specific locations. When the rats were tested with highly familiar scenes, neurons in the CA1 and subiculum were indistinguishable in coding the task-related information (e.g., scene, choice) through rate remapping. However, when the familiar scenes were blurred parametrically, the neurons in the CA1 responded sensitively to the novelty in task demand and changed its representations parametrically following the physical changes of the stimuli, whereas these functional characteristics were absent in the subiculum. These results suggest that the unique function of the hippocampus is to acquire contextual representations in association with discrete positions in space, especially when facing new and ambiguous scenes, whereas the subiculum may translate the position-bound visual contextual information of the hippocampus into schematic codes once learning is established.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Although the potential functional significance has been recognized for decades for the subiculum, its exact roles in a goal-directed memory task still remain elusive. In the current study, we present experimental evidence that may indicate that the neural population in the subiculum could translate the location-bound spatial representations of the hippocampus into more schematic representations of task demands. Our findings also imply that the visual scene-based codes conveyed by the hippocampus and subiculum may be identical in a well learned task, whereas the hippocampus may be more specialized in representing altered visual scenes than the subiculum.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/34/7378?rss=1">Estrogen Treatment Reverses Prematurity-Induced Disruption in Cortical Interneuron Population</a></h4>

<p>Development of cortical interneurons continues until the end of human pregnancy. Premature birth deprives the newborns from the supply of maternal estrogen and a secure intrauterine environment. Indeed, preterm infants suffer from neurobehavioral disorders. This can result from both preterm birth and associated postnatal complications, which might disrupt recruitment and maturation of cortical interneurons. We hypothesized that interneuron subtypes, including parvalbumin-positive (PV<sup>+</sup>), somatostatin-positive (SST<sup>+</sup>), calretinin-positive (CalR<sup>+</sup>), and neuropeptide Y-positive (NPY<sup>+</sup>) interneurons, were recruited in the upper and lower cortical layers in a distinct manner with advancing gestational age. In addition, preterm birth would disrupt the heterogeneity of cortical interneurons, which might be reversed by estrogen treatment. These hypotheses were tested by analyzing autopsy samples from premature infants and evaluating the effect of estrogen supplementation in prematurely delivered rabbits. The PV<sup>+</sup> and CalR<sup>+</sup> neurons were abundant, whereas SST<sup>+</sup> and NPY<sup>+</sup> neurons were few in cortical layers of preterm human infants. Premature birth of infants reduced the density of PV<sup>+</sup> or GAD67<sup>+</sup> neurons and increased SST<sup>+</sup> interneurons in the upper cortical layers. Importantly, 17 β-estradiol treatment in preterm rabbits increased the number of PV<sup>+</sup> neurons in the upper cortical layers relative to controls at postnatal day 14 (P14) and P21 and transiently reduced SST population at P14. Moreover, protein and mRNA levels of Arx, a key regulator of cortical interneuron maturation and migration, were higher in estrogen-treated rabbits relative to controls. Therefore, deficits in PV<sup>+</sup> and excess of SST<sup>+</sup> neurons in premature newborns are ameliorated by estrogen replacement, which can be attributed to elevated Arx levels. Estrogen replacement might enhance neurodevelopmental outcomes in extremely preterm infants.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Premature birth often leads to neurodevelopmental delays and behavioral disorders, which may be ascribed to disturbances in the development and maturation of cortical interneurons. Here, we show that preterm birth in humans is associated with reduced population of parvalbumin-positive (PV<sup>+</sup>) neurons and an excess of somatostatin-expressing interneurons in the cerebral cortex. More importantly, 17 β-estradiol treatment increased the number of PV<sup>+</sup> neurons in preterm-born rabbits, which appears to be mediated by an elevation in the expression of Arx transcription factor. Hence the present study highlights prematurity-induced reduction in PV<sup>+</sup> neurons in human infants and reversal in their population by estrogen replacement in preterm rabbits. Because preterm birth drops plasma estrogen level 100-fold, estrogen replacement in extremely preterm infants might improve their developmental outcome and minimize neurobehavioral disorders.</p>

<p>Animals successfully thrive in noisy environments with finite resources. The necessity to function with resource constraints has led evolution to design animal brains (and bodies) to be optimal in their use of computational power while being adaptable to their environmental niche. A key process undergirding this ability to adapt is the process of learning. Although a complete characterization of the neural basis of learning remains ongoing, scientists for nearly a century have used the brain as inspiration to design artificial neural networks capable of learning, a case in point being deep learning. In this viewpoint, we advocate that deep learning can be further enhanced by incorporating and tightly integrating five fundamental principles of neural circuit design and function: optimizing the system to environmental need and making it robust to environmental noise, customizing learning to context, modularizing the system, learning without supervision, and learning using reinforcement strategies. We illustrate how animals integrate these learning principles using the fruit fly olfactory learning circuit, one of nature's best-characterized and highly optimized schemes for learning. Incorporating these principles may not just improve deep learning but also expose common computational constraints. With judicious use, deep learning can become yet another effective tool to understand how and why brains are designed the way they are.</p>

<p>by Jaime Agudo-Canalejo, Reinhard Lipowsky</p>

ESCRT proteins participate in the fission step of exocytic membrane budding, by assisting in the closure and scission of the membrane neck that connects the nascent bud to the plasma membrane. However, the precise mechanism by which the proteins achieve this so-called reverse-topology membrane scission remains to be elucidated. One mechanism is described by the <i>dome model</i>, which postulates that ESCRT-III proteins assemble in the shape of a hemispherical dome at the location of the neck, and guide the closure of this neck <i>via</i> membrane–protein adhesion. A different mechanism is described by the <i>flattening cone model</i>, in which the ESCRT-III complex first assembles at the neck in the shape of a cone, which then flattens leading to neck closure. Here, we use the theoretical framework of curvature elasticity and membrane–protein adhesion to quantitatively describe and compare both mechanisms. This comparison shows that the minimal adhesive strength of the membrane–protein interactions required for scission is much lower for cones than for domes, and that the geometric constraints on the shape of the assembly required to induce scission are more stringent for domes than for cones. Finally, we compute for the first time the adhesion-induced constriction forces exerted by the ESCRT assemblies onto the membrane necks. These forces are higher for cones and of the order of 100 pN.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/p98M67IYI2Y" width="1" />

Abstract<p>During early developmental windows known as critical periods (CP) of plasticity, passive alterations in the quality and quantity of sensory inputs are sufficient to induce profound and long-lasting distortions in cortical sensory representations. With CP closure those representations are stabilized, a process requiring the maturation of inhibitory networks and the maintenance of sufficient GABAergic tone in the cortex. In humans and rodents however, cortical inhibition progressively decreases with advancing age, raising the possibility that the regulation of plasticity could be altered in older individuals. Here we tested the hypothesis that aging results in a destabilization of sensory representations and maladaptive dysregulated plasticity in the rat primary auditory cortex (A1). Consistent with this idea, we found that passive tone exposure is sufficient to distort frequency tuning in the A1 of older but not younger adult rats. However, we also found that these passive distortions decayed rapidly, indicating an ongoing instability of A1 tuning in the aging cortex. These changes were associated with a decrease in GABA neurotransmitter concentration and a reduction in parvalbumin and perineuronal net expression in the cortex. Finally, we show that artificially increasing GABA tone in the aging A1 is sufficient to restore representational stability and improve the retention of learning.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> In this study, we examined brain plasticity in the auditory cortex of young adult and older adult rats in the context of different types of auditory stimulation and training. Surprisingly, older brains retained an equal or even higher potential for plasticity compared to young adults. In older brains, however, changes elicited by auditory stimulation and training were rapidly lost, suggesting that such increased plasticity might be detrimental as the older brains were unable to consolidate these changes. This increased but poorly regulated plasticity was associated with a reduction in cortical inhibition which normally maintains the stability of sensory representations in the young adult brain. Importantly, increasing inhibition artificially with clinically available drugs restored stability and improved the retention of learning.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06578">Paradoxical LTP maintenance with inhibition of protein synthesis and the proteasome suggests a novel protein synthesis requirement for early LTP reversal. (arXiv:1808.06578v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>The transition from early long-term potentiation (E-LTP) to late LTP (L-LTP)
involves protein synthesis and degradation. L-LTP is blocked by inhibiting
either protein synthesis or proteasome-dependent degradation prior to and
during a tetanic stimulus, but paradoxically, L-LTP is not blocked when
synthesis and degradation are inhibited simultaneously, suggesting
counter-acting positive and negative proteins regulate L-LTP. To investigate
this paradox, we modeled LTP at the Schaffer collateral synapse. Nine
differential equations describe the levels of positive and negative regulator
proteins (PP and NP) and transitions among five discrete synaptic states, a
basal state (BAS), three E-LTP states (EP1, EP2, ED), and a L-LTP state (LP). A
stimulus initiates the transition from BAS to EP1 and from EP1 to EP2,
initiates the synthesis of PP and NP, and activates the ubiquitin-proteasome
system (UPS). UPS mediates transitions of EP1 and EP2 to ED and the degradation
of NP. The conversion of E-LTP to L-LTP is mediated by a PP-dependent
transition from ED to LP. NP mediates reversal of EP2 to BAS. This model
simulates empirical observations: 1) normal L-LTP, 2) block by either
proteasome inhibitor or protein synthesis inhibitor alone, and 3) preservation
of L-LTP when both inhibitors are applied together. Elements of this abstract
model can be correlated with specific molecules and processes. Moreover, the
model makes testable predictions, such as a unique synaptic state ED that
precedes the transition to L-LTP, and a time window for the action of the UPS
(during the transitions from EP1 and EP2 to ED). Tests of these predictions
will provide insights into the processes of long-term synaptic plasticity.

Abstract
<p>Noise exposure is one of the most common causes of hearing loss and peripheral damage to the auditory system. A growing literature suggests that the auditory system can compensate for peripheral loss through increased central neural activity. The current study sought to investigate the link between noise exposure, increases in central gain, synaptic reorganization, and auditory function. All axons of the auditory nerve project to the cochlear nucleus, making it a requisite nucleus for sound detection. As the first synapse in the central auditory system, the cochlear nucleus is well positioned to respond plastically to loss of peripheral input. To investigate noise-induced compensation in the central auditory system, we measured auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and auditory perception and collected tissue from mice exposed to broadband noise. Noise-exposed mice showed elevated ABR thresholds, reduced ABR wave 1 amplitudes, and spiral ganglion neuron loss. Despite peripheral damage, noise-exposed mice were hyperreactive to loud sounds and showed nearly normal behavioral sound detection thresholds. Ratios of late ABR peaks (2–4) relative to the first ABR peak indicated that brainstem pathways were hyperactive in noise-exposed mice, while anatomical analysis indicated there was an imbalance between expression of excitatory and inhibitory proteins in the ventral cochlear nucleus. The results of the current study suggest that a reorganization of excitation and inhibition in the ventral cochlear nucleus may drive hyperactivity in the central auditory system. This increase in central gain can compensate for peripheral loss to restore some aspects of auditory function.</p>

Abstract
<p>β-Site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is required for the production of β-amyloid (Aβ), one of the major pathogenic molecules of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and is therefore being actively pursued as a drug target for AD. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) is a lifelong process that is known to be important for learning and memory and may have the potential to regenerate damaged neural tissue. In this study, we examined whether BACE1 regulates AHN, which holds important implications for its suitability as a drug target in AD. Cohorts of 2-month-old wild-type (BACE1<sup>+/+</sup>), heterozygous, and homozygous BACE1 knockout mice (BACE1<sup>+/–</sup> and BACE1<sup>–/–</sup>, respectively) were injected with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) and sacrificed 1 day later to examine the impact of loss of BACE1 on neural precursor cell (NPC) proliferation in the adult brain. Parallel cohorts of mice were sacrificed 4 weeks after BrdU injection to determine the effects of BACE1 on survival and differentiation of newborn NPCs. We found that NPC proliferation was increased in BACE1<sup>–/–</sup> mice compared to BACE1<sup>+/+</sup> mice, while no difference was observed in NPC survival across genotypes. Differentiation of NPCs to neuronal lineage was impaired in BACE1<sup>–/–</sup> mice. However, no differences were observed in astrogenesis, the proportion of immature neurons, or the production of oligodendrocytes across genotypes. Importantly, corresponding with a decrease in neuronal differentiation in the absence of a complementary increase in an alternate cell fate, BACE1<sup>–/–</sup> mice were found to have a pool of undifferentiated NPCs in the hippocampus compared to BACE1<sup>+/+</sup> and BACE1<sup>+/–</sup> mice.</p>

Abstract<p>It is often assumed that during rapid eye-movement (REM) sleep the cerebral cortex homogenously shows electroencephalogram activity highly similar to wakefulness. However, to date no studies have compared neural oscillatory activity in human REM sleep to resting wakefulness with high spatial sampling. In the current study, we evaluated high-resolution topographical changes in neural oscillatory power between both early and late naturalistic REM sleep and resting wakefulness in adult humans. All-night recordings with 256-channel high-density electroencephalography (hd-EEG) were collected in healthy volunteers (N = 12). Topographic analysis revealed that, compared to wake, both the first and last cycle of REM sleep were associated with increased low-frequency oscillations in local central and occipital regions. In contrast, high frequency activity in both alpha and beta bands (8-20 Hz) was globally decreased during both early and late REM sleep cycles compared to wakefulness. No significant differences in topographic power in any frequency band were observed between REM sleep cycles occurring early and late in the night. We replicated these findings in an independent dataset (N = 33). Together our findings show that human REM sleep shows consistent topographical changes in oscillatory power across both early and late sleep cycles compared to resting wakefulness.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> In this work we present the first high-resolution topographical study of changes in neural oscillatory power between rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and wakefulness in healthy adult humans. Our results show that REM sleep is characterized by globally reduced high-frequency power as well as increased low-frequency oscillations in local regions of the cerebral cortex, including primary sensory, motor and visual cortices. Our findings are consistent with a recent study using laminar recordings rodents, which found that local slow waves occur during REM sleep in middle/superficial layers (layers 3 and 4) of primary visual, sensory and motor areas. Local low-frequency oscillations in primary sensory and motor cortices could be a potential mechanism for disconnection from the external environment during REM sleep.</p>

<p>by Shishir Adhikari, Jacob Moran, Christopher Weddle, Michael Hinczewski</p>

The adherens junctions between epithelial cells involve a protein complex formed by E-cadherin, <i>β</i>-catenin, <i>α</i>-catenin and F-actin. The stability of this complex was a puzzle for many years, since in vitro studies could reconstitute various stable subsets of the individual proteins, but never the entirety. The missing ingredient turned out to be mechanical tension: a recent experiment that applied physiological forces to the complex with an optical tweezer dramatically increased its lifetime, a phenomenon known as catch bonding. However, in the absence of a crystal structure for the full complex, the microscopic details of the catch bond mechanism remain mysterious. Building on structural clues that point to <i>α</i>-catenin as the force transducer, we present a quantitative theoretical model for how the catch bond arises, fully accounting for the experimental lifetime distributions. The underlying hypothesis is that force induces a rotational transition between two conformations of <i>α</i>-catenin, overcoming a significant energy barrier due to a network of salt bridges. This transition allosterically regulates the energies at the interface between <i>α</i>-catenin and F-actin. The model allows us to predict these energetic changes, as well as highlighting the importance of the salt bridge rotational barrier. By stabilizing one of the <i>α</i>-catenin states, this barrier could play a role in how the complex responds to additional <i>in vivo</i> binding partners like vinculin. Since significant conformational energy barriers are a common feature of other adhesion systems that exhibit catch bonds, our model can be adapted into a general theoretical framework for integrating structure and function in a variety of force-regulated protein complexes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9aUuhIvPsVU" width="1" />

<p>by Kirsten Henderson, Michel Loreau</p>

It is estimated that the Earth’s biocapacity is unable to meet current demands, which begs the question: is a sustainable future possible for both humans and the environment? The UN projects a human population of approximately 11 billion by the end of the 21st century; requiring additional agricultural land, greater demands for natural resources, and technological advancements. We model human population over the next century, emphasizing feedbacks between natural and agricultural resource availability and human demography. We argue that an intensive agriculture approach to feeding the growing population is ill-conceived, without considering biodiversity and ecosystem services (e.g., nutrient cycling, pollination, water purification, pest control). The productivity of agricultural land and human population dynamics are dependent on the area of natural land—generally, tipping at 5 billion ha of natural land (approximately 40% of the Earth’s terrestrial area). Furthermore, our model shows that an imprudent proactive approach (i.e., focusing on agriculture and ignoring ecosystem services) limits the success of reactive measures (i.e., restoration) in the future, while the inability to react to changes and recover natural systems leads to human population decline.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Z66BhJkqos0" width="1" />

We present ggsashimi, a command-line tool for the visualization of splicing events across multiple samples. Given a specified genomic region, ggsashimi creates sashimi plots for individual RNA-seq experiments as well as aggregated plots for groups of experiments, a feature unique to this software. Compared to the existing versions of programs generating sashimi plots, it uses popular bioinformatics file formats, it is annotation-independent, and allows the visualization of splicing events even for large genomic regions by scaling down the genomic segments between splice sites. ggsashimi is freely available at https://github.com/guigolab/ggsashimi. It is implemented in python, and internally generates R code for plotting.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MeouJav9pZQ" width="1" />

<p>by Christina L. Hamlet, Kathleen A. Hoffman, Eric D. Tytell, Lisa J. Fauci</p>

Like other animals, lampreys have a central pattern generator (CPG) circuit that activates muscles for locomotion and also adjusts the activity to respond to sensory inputs from the environment. Such a feedback system is crucial for responding appropriately to unexpected perturbations, but it is also active during normal unperturbed steady swimming and influences the baseline swimming pattern. In this study, we investigate different functional forms of body curvature-based sensory feedback and evaluate their effects on steady swimming energetics and kinematics, since little is known experimentally about the functional form of curvature feedback. The distributed CPG is modeled as chains of coupled oscillators. Pairs of phase oscillators represent the left and right sides of segments along the lamprey body. These activate muscles that flex the body and move the lamprey through a fluid environment, which is simulated using a full Navier-Stokes model. The emergent curvature of the body then serves as an input to the CPG oscillators, closing the loop. We consider two forms of feedback, each consistent with experimental results on lamprey proprioceptive sensory receptors. The first, referred to as directional feedback, excites or inhibits the oscillators on the same side, depending on the sign of a chosen gain parameter, and has the opposite effect on oscillators on the opposite side. We find that directional feedback does not affect beat frequency, but does change the duration of muscle activity. The second feedback model, referred to as magnitude feedback, provides a symmetric excitatory or inhibitory effect to oscillators on both sides. This model tends to increase beat frequency and reduces the energetic cost to the lamprey when the gain is high and positive. With both types of feedback, the body curvature has a similar magnitude. Thus, these results indicate that the same magnitude of curvature-based feedback on the CPG with different functional forms can cause distinct differences in swimming performance.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ak7h54Q3iz4" width="1" />

<p>by Gert Peters, Jo Maertens, Jeroen Lammertyn, Marjan De Mey</p>

Metabolic engineering increasingly depends upon RNA technology to customly rewire the metabolism to maximize production. To this end, pure riboregulators allow dynamic gene repression without the need of a potentially burdensome coexpressed protein like typical Hfq binding small RNAs and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats technology. Despite this clear advantage, no clear general design principles are available to <i>de novo</i> develop repressing riboregulators, limiting the availability and the reliable development of these type of riboregulators. Here, to overcome this lack of knowledge on the functionality of repressing riboregulators, translation inhibiting RNAs are developed from scratch. These <i>de novo</i> developed riboregulators explore features related to thermodynamical and structural factors previously attributed to translation initiation modulation. In total, 12 structural and thermodynamic features were defined of which six features were retained after removing correlations from an <i>in silico</i> generated riboregulator library. From this translation inhibiting RNA library, 18 riboregulators were selected using a experimental design and subsequently constructed and co-expressed with two target untranslated regions to link the translation inhibiting RNA features to functionality. The pure riboregulators in the design of experiments showed repression down to 6% of the original protein expression levels, which could only be partially explained by a ordinary least squares regression model. To allow reliable forward engineering, a partial least squares regression model was constructed and validated to link the properties of translation inhibiting RNA riboregulators to gene repression. In this model both structural and thermodynamic features were important for efficient gene repression by pure riboregulators. This approach enables a more reliable <i>de novo</i> forward engineering of effective pure riboregulators, which further expands the RNA toolbox for gene expression modulation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eHvHrDTnq_0" width="1" />

<p>In this paper we address the memory demands that come with the processing of
3-dimensional, high-resolution, multi-channeled medical images in deep
learning. We exploit memory-efficient backpropagation techniques, to reduce the
memory complexity of network training from being linear in the network's depth,
to being roughly constant $ - $ permitting us to elongate deep architectures
with negligible memory increase. We evaluate our methodology in the paradigm of
Image Quality Transfer, whilst noting its potential application to various
tasks that use deep learning. We study the impact of depth on accuracy and show
that deeper models have more predictive power, which may exploit larger
training sets. We obtain substantially better results than the previous
state-of-the-art model with a slight memory increase, reducing the
root-mean-squared-error by $ 13\% $. Our code is publicly available.

<p>Almost all EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) need some labeled
subject-specific data to calibrate a new subject, as neural responses are
different across subjects to even the same stimulus. So, a major challenge in
developing high-performance and user-friendly BCIs is to cope with such
individual differences so that the calibration can be reduced or even
completely eliminated. This paper focuses on the latter. More specifically, we
consider an offline application scenario, in which we have unlabeled EEG trials
from a new subject, and would like to accurately label them by leveraging
auxiliary labeled EEG trials from other subjects in the same task. To
accommodate the individual differences, we propose a novel unsupervised
approach to align the EEG trials from different subjects in the Euclidean space
to make them more consistent. It has three desirable properties: 1) the aligned
trial lie in the Euclidean space, which can be used by any Euclidean space
signal processing and machine learning approach; 2) it can be computed very
efficiently; and, 3) it does not need any labeled trials from the new subject.
Experiments on motor imagery and event-related potentials demonstrated the
effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05284">Robustness of functional networks at criticality against structural defects. (arXiv:1808.05284v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>The robustness of dynamical properties of neuronal networks against
structural damages is a central problem in computational and experimental
neuroscience. Research has shown that the cortical network of a healthy brain
works near a critical state, and moreover, that functional neuronal networks
often have scale-free and small-world properties. In this work, we study how
the robustness of simple functional networks at criticality is affected by
structural defects. In particular, we consider a 2D Ising model at the critical
temperature and investigate how its functional network changes with the
increasing degree of structural defects. We show that the scale-free and
small-world properties of the functional network at criticality are robust
against large degrees of structural lesions while the system remains below the
percolation limit. Although the Ising model is only a conceptual description of
a two-state neuron, our research reveals fundamental robustness properties of

<p>by Christos Vlachos, Robert Kofler</p>

Evolve and Resequencing (E&amp;R) studies allow us to monitor adaptation at the genomic level. By sequencing evolving populations at regular time intervals, E&amp;R studies promise to shed light on some of the major open questions in evolutionary biology such as the repeatability of evolution and the molecular basis of adaptation. However, data interpretation, statistical analysis and the experimental design of E&amp;R studies increasingly require simulations of evolving populations, a task that is difficult to accomplish with existing tools, which may i) be too slow, ii) require substantial reformatting of data, iii) not support an adaptive scenario of interest or iv) not sufficiently capture the biology of the used model organism. Therefore we developed MimicrEE2, a multi-threaded Java program for genome-wide forward simulations of evolving populations. MimicrEE2 enables the convenient usage of available genomic resources, supports biological particulars of model organism frequently used in E&amp;R studies and offers a wide range of different adaptive models (selective sweeps, polygenic adaptation, epistasis). Due to its user-friendly and efficient design MimicrEE2 will facilitate simulations of E&amp;R studies even for small labs with limited bioinformatics expertise or computational resources. Additionally, the scripts provided for executing MimicrEE2 on a computer cluster permit the coverage even of a large parameter space. MimicrEE2 runs on any computer with Java installed.

<p>by Robert C. Cope, Joshua V. Ross, Monique Chilver, Nigel P. Stocks, Lewis Mitchell</p>

Understanding the epidemiology of seasonal influenza is critical for healthcare resource allocation and early detection of anomalous seasons. It can be challenging to obtain high-quality data of influenza cases specifically, as clinical presentations with influenza-like symptoms may instead be cases of one of a number of alternate respiratory viruses. We use a new dataset of confirmed influenza virological data from 2011-2016, along with high-quality denominators informing a hierarchical observation process, to model seasonal influenza dynamics in New South Wales, Australia. We use approximate Bayesian computation to estimate parameters in a climate-driven stochastic epidemic model, including the basic reproduction number <i>R</i><sub>0</sub>, the proportion of the population susceptible to the circulating strain at the beginning of the season, and the probability an infected individual seeks treatment. We conclude that <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> and initial population susceptibility were strongly related, emphasising the challenges of identifying these parameters. Relatively high <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> values alongside low initial population susceptibility were among the results most consistent with these data. Our results reinforce the importance of distinguishing between <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> and the effective reproduction number (<i>R</i><sub>e</sub>) in modelling studies.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZAXthSm1MzA" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Phosphorylation of MARCKS (myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate) reflects neurite degeneration at the early stage of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), before extracellular Aβ aggregates are histologically detectable. Here, we demonstrate that similar changes in MARCKS occur in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy body (DLB) pathologies in both mouse models and human patients. The increase in the level of pSer46-MARCKS began before α-synuclein aggregate formation, at a time when human α-Syn-BAC-Tg/GBA-hetero-KO mice exhibited no symptoms, and was sustained during aging, consistent with the pattern in human postmortem brains. The results strongly imply a common mechanism of pre-aggregation neurite degeneration in AD and PD/DLB pathologies.</p><p><b>Significance Statement:</b> At early stage of Alzheimer’s disease before the aggregation of extracellular Aβ, phosphorylation of MARCKS at Ser46 reflects neurite degeneration. In this study, we confirmed the similar changes both in mouse models and human patients of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). Phosphorylation of MARCKS at Ser46 was increased before α-synuclein aggregation was detected, and the increase of pSer46-MARCKS was sustained during aging. These results suggest that neurite degeneration detected by pSer46-MARCKS is a common pre-aggregation mechanism shared by AD and PD/DLB pathologies.</p>

Abstract<p>Excessive noise exposure damages sensory hair cells, leading to permanent hearing loss. Zebrafish are a highly tractable model that have advanced our understanding of drug-induced hair cell death, yet no comparable model exists for noise exposure research. We demonstrate the utility of zebrafish as model to increase understanding of hair cell damage from acoustic trauma and develop protective therapies. We created an acoustic trauma system using underwater cavitation to stimulate lateral line hair cells. We found that acoustic stimulation resulted in exposure time- and intensity-dependent lateral line and saccular hair cell damage that is maximal at 48-72h post-trauma. The number of TUNEL positive lateral line hair cells increased 72h post-exposure whereas no increase was observed in TUNEL positive supporting cells, demonstrating that acoustic stimulation causes hair cell-specific damage. Lateral line hair cells damaged by acoustic stimulation regenerate within three days, consistent with prior regeneration studies utilizing ototoxic drugs. Acoustic stimulation-induced hair cell damage is attenuated by pharmacological inhibition of protein synthesis or caspase activation, suggesting a requirement for translation and activation of apoptotic signaling cascades. Surviving hair cells exposed to acoustic stimulation showed signs of synaptopathy, consistent with mammalian studies. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of this platform to identify compounds that prevent acoustic trauma by screening a small redox library for protective compounds. Our data suggest that acoustic stimulation results in lateral line hair cell damage consistent with acoustic trauma research in mammals, providing a highly tractable model for high-throughput genetic and drug discovery studies.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Noise overexposure damages hair cells, leading to permanent hearing loss. A critical step in understanding and preventing noise-induced hearing loss is establishing an accessible <i>in vivo</i> model to test for genetic and chemical modulators of noise damage. We developed a novel acoustic trauma system, using cavitation, to stimulate and damage zebrafish lateral line hair cells. We demonstrate that acoustic stimulation damages zebrafish lateral line hair cells in an exposure time- and intensity-dependent manner, consistent with acoustic trauma research in mammals. This novel system provides a model for <i>in vivo</i>, real-time studies of noise exposure, and for rapid discovery of chemical and genetic modulators of acoustic trauma-induced hair cell damage.</p>

<p>A rigorous bridge between spiking-level and macroscopic quantities is an
on-going and well-developed story for asynchronously firing neurons, but focus
has shifted to include neural populations exhibiting varying synchronous
dynamics. Recent literature has used the Ott--Antonsen ansatz (2008) to great
effect, allowing a rigorous derivation of an order parameter for large
oscillator populations. The ansatz has been successfully applied using several
models including networks of Kuramoto oscillators, theta models, and
integrate-and-fire neurons, along with many types of network topologies. In the
present study, we take a converse approach: given the mean field dynamics of
slow synapses, predict the synchronization properties of finite neural
populations. The slow synapse assumption is amenable to averaging theory and
the method of multiple timescales. Our proposed theory applies to two
heterogeneous populations of N excitatory n-dimensional and N inhibitory
m-dimensional oscillators with homogeneous synaptic weights. We then
demonstrate our theory using two examples. In the first example we take a
network of excitatory and inhibitory theta neurons and consider the case with
and without heterogeneous inputs. In the second example we use Traub models
with calcium for the excitatory neurons and Wang-Buzs{\'a}ki models for the
inhibitory neurons. We accurately predict phase drift and phase locking in each
example even when the slow synapses exhibit non-trivial mean-field dynamics.

<p>Humans can fluidly adapt their interest in complex environments in ways that
machines cannot. Here, we lay the groundwork for a real-world system that
passively monitors and merges neural correlates of visual interest across team
members via Collaborative Brain Computer Interface (cBCI). When group interest
is detected and co-registered in time and space, it can be used to model the
task relevance of items in a dynamic, natural environment. Previous work in
cBCIs focuses on static stimuli, stimulus- or response- locked analyses, and
often within-subject and experiment model training. The contributions of this
work are twofold. First, we test the utility of cBCI on a scenario that more
closely resembles natural conditions, where subjects visually scanned a video
for target items in a virtual environment. Second, we use an
experiment-agnostic deep learning model to account for the real-world use case
where no training set exists that exactly matches the end-users task and
circumstances. With our approach we show improved performance as the number of
subjects in the cBCI ensemble grows, and the potential to reconstruct
ground-truth target occurrence in an otherwise noisy and complex environment.

<p>Computational ghost imaging relies on the decomposition of an image into
patterns that are summed together with weights that measure the overlap of each
pattern with the scene being imaged. These tasks rely on a computer. Here we
demonstrate that the computational integration can be performed directly with
the human eye. We use this human ghost imaging technique to evaluate the
temporal response of the eye and establish the image persistence time to be
around 20 ms followed by a further 20 ms exponential decay. These persistence
times are in agreement with previous studies but can now potentially be
extended to include a more precise characterisation of visual stimuli and
provide a new experimental tool for the study of visual perception.

<p>Response delay is an inherent and essential part of human actions. In the
context of human balance control, the response delay is traditionally modeled
using the formalism of delay-differential equations, which adopts the
approximation of fixed delay. However, experimental studies revealing
substantial variability, adaptive anticipation, and non-stationary dynamics of
response delay provide evidence against this approximation. In this paper, we
call for development of principally new mathematical formalism describing human
response delay. To support this, we present the experimental data from a simple
virtual stick balancing task. Our results demonstrate that human response delay
is a widely distributed random variable with complex properties, which can
exhibit oscillatory and adaptive dynamics characterized by long-range
correlations. Given this, we argue that the fixed-delay approximation ignores
essential properties of human response, and conclude with possible directions
for future developments of new mathematical notions describing human control.

<p>by Bernard Cazelles, Clara Champagne, Joseph Dureau</p>

The spread of disease through human populations is complex. The characteristics of disease propagation evolve with time, as a result of a multitude of environmental and anthropic factors, this non-stationarity is a key factor in this huge complexity. In the absence of appropriate external data sources, to correctly describe the disease propagation, we explore a flexible approach, based on stochastic models for the disease dynamics, and on diffusion processes for the parameter dynamics. Using such a diffusion process has the advantage of not requiring a specific mathematical function for the parameter dynamics. Coupled with particle MCMC, this approach allows us to reconstruct the time evolution of some key parameters (average transmission rate for instance). Thus, by capturing the time-varying nature of the different mechanisms involved in disease propagation, the epidemic can be described. Firstly we demonstrate the efficiency of this methodology on a toy model, where the parameters and the observation process are known. Applied then to real datasets, our methodology is able, based solely on simple stochastic models, to reconstruct complex epidemics, such as flu or dengue, over long time periods. Hence we demonstrate that time-varying parameters can improve the accuracy of model performances, and we suggest that our methodology can be used as a first step towards a better understanding of a complex epidemic, in situation where data is limited and/or uncertain.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_KepOZ4SmRU" width="1" />

<p>Maximum entropy principle (MEP) analysis with few non-zero effective
interactions successfully characterizes the distribution of dynamical states of
pulse-coupled networks in many experiments, e.g., in neuroscience. To better
understand the underlying mechanism, we found a relation between the dynamical
structure, i.e., effective interactions in MEP analysis, and the coupling
structure of pulse-coupled network to understand how a sparse coupling
structure could lead to a sparse coding by effective interactions. This
relation quantitatively displays how the dynamical structure is closely related
to the coupling structure.

<p>Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in brain white matter probes
tissue microstructure and allows for the estimation of compartmental diffusion
parameters. Recently, it became apparent that traditional single-direction
diffusion encodings are not fully sufficient to resolve the white matter
compartmental diffusivities. Multiple diffusion encodings have been suggested
to make the problem less ambiguous, however, it still remained unclear whether
such protocols would completely solve the problem. Here, we constructively
prove that a combination of linear and planar diffusion encodings is enough to
determine the parameters of the three compartment white matter model.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Social dominance, the main organizing principle of social hierarchies, facilitates priority access to resources by dominant individuals. Throughout taxa, individuals are more likely to become dominant if they act first in social situations and acting fast may provide evolutionary advantage; yet whether fast decision-making is a behavioral predisposition of dominant persons outside of social contexts is not known. Following characterization of participants for social dominance motivation, we found that, indeed, men high in social dominance respond faster–without loss of accuracy–than those low in dominance across a variety of decision-making tasks. Both groups did not differ in a simple reaction task. Then, we selected a decision-making task and applied high-density electroencephalography (EEG) to assess temporal dynamics of brain activation through event related potentials. We found that promptness to respond in the choice task in dominant individuals is related to a strikingly amplified brain signal at approximately 240 ms post-stimulus presentation. Source imaging analyses identified higher activity in the left insula and in the cingulate, right inferior temporal and right angular gyri in high than in low dominance participants. Our findings suggest that promptness to respond in choice situations, regardless of social context, is a biomarker for social disposition.</span>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/Ppry0EpfyZw/article">Integration and multiplexing of positional and contextual information by the hippocampal network</a></h4>

<p>by Lorenzo Posani, Simona Cocco, Rémi Monasson</p>

The hippocampus is known to store cognitive representations, or maps, that encode both positional and contextual information, critical for episodic memories and functional behavior. How path integration and contextual cues are dynamically combined and processed by the hippocampus to maintain these representations accurate over time remains unclear. To answer this question, we propose a two-way data analysis and modeling approach to CA3 multi-electrode recordings of a moving rat submitted to rapid changes of contextual (light) cues, triggering back-and-forth instabitilies between two cognitive representations (“teleportation” experiment of Jezek et al). We develop a dual neural activity decoder, capable of independently identifying the recalled cognitive map at high temporal resolution (comparable to theta cycle) and the position of the rodent given a map. Remarkably, position can be reconstructed at any time with an accuracy comparable to fixed-context periods, even during highly unstable periods. These findings provide evidence for the capability of the hippocampal neural activity to maintain an accurate encoding of spatial and contextual variables, while one of these variables undergoes rapid changes independently of the other. To explain this result we introduce an attractor neural network model for the hippocampal activity that process inputs from external cues and the path integrator. Our model allows us to make predictions on the frequency of the cognitive map instability, its duration, and the detailed nature of the place-cell population activity, which are validated by a further analysis of the data. Our work therefore sheds light on the mechanisms by which the hippocampal network achieves and updates multi-dimensional neural representations from various input streams.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ppry0EpfyZw" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Influenza during pregnancy is associated with the development of psychopathology in the offspring. We sought to determine if maternal cytokines produced following administration of viral mimetic polyI:C to pregnant rats were predictive of behavioral abnormalities in the adult offspring. Timed-pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats received a single intravenous injection of 4 mg/kg polyI:C or saline on gestational day 15. Blood was collected for serum analysis of cytokine levels with ELISA. Male offspring were tested in a battery of behavioral tests at adulthood and behavior correlated with maternal cytokine levels. Maternal serum levels of CXCL1 and IL-6, but not TNF-α or CXCL2, were elevated in polyI:C-treated dams. PolyI:C-treated dams experienced post-treatment weight loss and polyI:C pups were smaller than controls at postnatal day 1. Various behavior alterations were seen in the polyI:C-treated offspring. Male polyI:C offspring had enhanced MK-801-induced locomotion, and reduced sociability. PolyI:C offspring failed to display crossmodal and visual memory, and oddity preference was also impaired. Set-shifting, assessed with a lever-based operant conditioning task, was facilitated while touchscreen-based reversal learning was impaired. Correlations were found between maternal serum concentrations of CXCL1, acute maternal temperature and body weight changes, neonatal pup mass, and odd object discrimination and social behavior. Overall, while the offspring of polyI:C-treated rats displayed behavior abnormalities, maternal serum cytokines were not related to the long-term behavior changes in the offspring. Maternal sickness effects and neonatal pup size may be better indicators of later effects in the offspring.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Psychiatric pathology is complex, poorly understood, and often results in chronic illness. Many psychiatric conditions are believed to occur as a result of genetic and environmental factors. Gestational adversity such as inflammation in pregnancy may act as a priming experience for the later emergence of psychopathologies, and accurate identification of risk factors may advise early interventions. We sought to characterize long-term behavior effects in the offspring of rats exposed to an inflammatory event during pregnancy and relate these effects to the serum levels of relevant cytokines CXCL1, IL-6, and TNF-α. Our results suggest that these maternal cytokines are not strongly related to offspring behavior outcomes, and other measures may have greater value as predictors of behavior outcomes.</p>

Abstract
<p>Alterations in fractional anisotropy (FA) have been considered to reflect microstructural white matter (WM) changes in disease conditions; however, no study to date has examined WM changes using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in adolescents with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The objective of the present study was two-fold: (1) to determine whether differences in FA, and other non-FA metrics, were present in adolescents with IBS compared to healthy controls using whole-brain, region of interest (ROI)-restricted tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and canonical ROI DTI analyses for the cingulum bundle, and (2) to determine whether these metrics were related to clinical measures of disease duration and pain intensity in the IBS group. A total of 16 adolescents with a Rome III diagnosis of IBS (females = 12; mean age = 16.29, age range: 11.96–18.5 years) and 16 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (females = 12; mean age = 16.24; age range: 11.71–20.32 years) participated in this study. Diffusion-weighted images were acquired using a Siemens 3-T Trio Tim Syngo MRI scanner with a 32-channel head coil. The ROI-restricted TBSS and canonical ROI-based DTI analyses revealed that adolescents with IBS showed decreased FA in the right dorsal cingulum bundle compared to controls. No relationship between FA and disease severity measures was found. Microstructural WM alterations in the right dorsal cingulum bundle in adolescents with IBS may reflect a premorbid brain state or the emergence of a disease-driven process that results from complex changes in pain- and affect-related processing via spinothalamic and corticolimbic pathways.</p>

Abstract<p>Neuromodulators play a critical role in sensorimotor processing via various actions, including pre- and postsynaptic signal modulation and direct modulation of signal encoding in peripheral dendrites. Here we present a new mechanism that allows state-dependent modulation of signal encoding in sensory dendrites by neuromodulatory projection neurons. We studied the impact of antidromic action potentials (APs) on stimulus encoding using the anterior gastric receptor (AGR) neuron in the heavily modulated crustacean stomatogastric ganglion. We found that ectopic AP initiation in AGR's axon trunk is under direct neuromodulatory control by the inferior ventricular (IV) neurons, a pair of descending projection neurons. IV neuron activation elicited a long-lasting decrease in AGR ectopic activity. This modulation was specific to the site of AP initiation and could be mimicked by focal application of the IV neuron co-transmitter histamine. IV neuron actions were diminished after blocking H<sub>2</sub> receptors in AGR's axon trunk, suggesting a direct axonal modulation. This local modulation did not affect the propagation dynamics of en-passant APs. However, decreases in ectopic AP frequency prolonged sensory bursts elicited distantly near AGR's dendrites. This frequency-dependent effect was mediated via the reduction of antidromic APs, and the diminishment of backpropagation into the sensory dendrites. Computational models suggest that invading antidromic APs interact with local ionic conductances the rate constants of which determine the sign and strength of the frequency-dependent change in sensory sensitivity. Antidromic APs therefore provide descending projection neurons with a means to influence sensory encoding without affecting AP propagation or stimulus transduction.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Descending modulatory projection neurons are a hallmark of motor systems and fundamentally involved in sensorimotor processing. While they have been shown to interact on many levels with motor networks to dynamically and rapidly adjust motor and behavioral output, their actions on sensory neurons are not well understood. We found that descending projection neurons directly modulate action potential initiation in a sensory axon, diminishing the frequency of spontaneously generated ectopic action potentials that propagate antidromically into peripheral sensory dendrites. Changes in the frequency of these backpropagating action potentials determined the response of the sensory neuron to sensory stimuli. This suggests that descending projection neurons modulate sensory encoding by altering axonal membrane excitability and the frequency of antidromic action potential initiation.</p>

Abstract<p>L-selectin, a lectin-like receptor on all leukocyte classes, functions in adhesive and signaling roles in the recruitment of myeloid cells from the blood to sites of inflammation. Herein, we consider L-selectin as a determinant of neurological recovery in a murine model of spinal cord injury. Spinal cord-injured, L-selectin knockout mice (male) showed improved long-term recovery with greater white matter sparing relative to wildtype mice and reduced oxidative stress in the injured cord at 72 hours post-spinal cord injury. There was a partial and transient reduction in accumulation of neutrophils in the injured spinal cords of knockouts at 24 hours post-injury. To complement these findings with knockout mice, we sought a pharmacologic means for lowering L-selectin levels. We found that diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, induced the shedding of L-selectin from the cell surface of myeloid subsets, specifically neutrophils and non-classical monocytes, in the blood and the injured spinal cord. Diclofenac administration to injured wildtype mice enhanced neurological recovery to a level comparable to that of knockouts but did not improve recovery in knockouts. While diclofenac treatment had no effect on myeloid cell accumulation, there was a reduction in oxidative stress at 72 hours post-spinal cord injury. These findings implicate L-selectin in secondary pathogenesis beyond a role in leukocyte recruitment and raise the possibility of repurposing diclofenac for the treatment of spinal cord injury.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> In this study, we establish L-selectin, an adhesion and signaling receptor on immune cells, as a determinant of long-term recovery and tissue sparing after spinal cord injury. We demonstrate that L-selectin contributes to secondary pathogenesis during acute inflammation, and implicate L-selectin in novel roles other than recruitment. We also report a strategy to improve recovery by employing diclofenac, an FDA-approved NSAID that induces the shedding of L-selectin from the surface of innate immune cells. Our findings demonstrate a critical time-period for anti-inflammatory intervention in a murine model of spinal cord injury and suggest that diclofenac be tested as an acute therapy for attenuating neurologic deficits following spinal cord injury in humans.</p>

<p>Human balance is a complex process in healthy adults, requiring precisely timed coordination among sensory information, cognitive processing, and motor control. It has been difficult to quantify brain dynamics during human balance control due to limitations in brain-imaging modalities. The goal of this study was to determine whether by using high-density electroencephalography (EEG) and independent component analysis, we can identify common cortical responses to visual and physical balance perturbations during walking and standing. We studied the responses of 30 healthy young adults to sensorimotor perturbations that challenged their balance. Subjects performed four 10 min trials of beam walking and tandem stance while either being mediolaterally pulled at the waist or viewing brief 20° field-of-view rotations in virtual reality. We recorded high-density EEG, motion capture, lower leg electromyography (EMG), and neck EMG. We hypothesized that both physical pull and visual rotation perturbations would elicit time–frequency fluctuations in theta (4–8 Hz) and beta (13–30 Hz) bands, with increased occipito-parietal activity during visual rotations compared with pull perturbations. Our results confirmed this hypothesis. For both perturbations, we found early theta synchronization and late alpha–beta (8–30 Hz) desynchronization following perturbation onset. This pattern was strongest in occipito-parietal areas during visual perturbations and strongest in sensorimotor areas during pull perturbations. These results suggest a similar time–frequency electrocortical pattern when humans respond to sensorimotor conflict, but with substantive differences in the brain areas involved for visual versus physical perturbations. Our findings may have important implications for assessing and training balance in individuals with and without motor disabilities.</p>

Although the primate posterior parietal cortex (PPC) has been largely associated with space, attention, and action-related processing, a growing number of studies have reported the direct representation of a diverse array of action-independent nonspatial visual information in the PPC during both perception and visual working memory. By describing the distinctions and the close interactions of visual representation with space, attention, and action-related processing in the PPC, here I propose that we may understand these diverse PPC functions together through the unique contribution of the PPC to adaptive visual processing and form a more integrated and structured view of the role of the PPC in vision, cognition, and action.

Understanding the neural underpinnings of vocal–motor control in humans and other animals remains a major challenge in neurobiology. The Lombard effect – a rise in call amplitude in response to background noise – has been demonstrated in a wide range of vertebrates. Here, we review both behavioral and neurophysiological data and propose that the Lombard effect is driven by a subcortical neural network, which can be modulated by cortical processes. The proposed framework offers mechanistic explanations for two fundamental features of the Lombard effect: its widespread taxonomic distribution across the vertebrate phylogenetic tree and the widely observed variations in compensation magnitude.
