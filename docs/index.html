	<p>Infant attention is a cognitive function that underlines sensory&amp;amp;ndash;motor integration processes at the interface between the baby and the surrounding physical and socio-relational environment, mainly with the caregivers. The investigation of the role of non-visual inputs (i.e., vocal and tactile) provided by the caregivers in shaping infants&amp;amp;rsquo; attention in the context of visual impairment is relevant from both a theoretical and clinical point of view. This study investigated the social attention (i.e., gaze orientation) skills in a group of visually impaired (VI) and age-matched sighted controls (SCs) between 9 and 12 months of age. Moreover, the role of VI severity and maternal vocalizations and touch in shaping the social attention were investigated. Overall, 45 infants and their mothers participated in a video-recorded 4 min interaction procedure, including a play and a still-face episode. The infants&amp;amp;rsquo; gaze orientation (i.e., mother-directed, object-directed, or unfocused) and the types of maternal vocalizations and touch (i.e., socio-cognitive, affective) were micro-analytically coded. Maternal vocalizations and touch were found to influence gaze orientation differently in VI infants compared SCs. Moreover, the group comparisons during the play episode showed that controls were predominantly oriented to the mothers, while VI infants were less socially oriented. Visual impairment severity did not emerge as linked with social attention. These findings contribute to our understanding of socio-cognitive developmental trajectories in VI infants and highlight the need for tailored interventions to promote optimal outcomes for VI populations.</p>

	<p>Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological diseases. Epileptic seizures very often result in head injuries that may lead to many adverse consequences, both acute and chronic. They contribute to the need for hospitalization, modification of treatment, and a general decline in social productivity. The objective of our review is to characterize and assess management aspects of seizure-related head injuries (SRHIs) as an important and frequent clinical problem present in emergency department settings. PubMed and other relevant databases and websites were systematically searched for articles on traumatic brain injuries connected with the occurrence of seizures published from inception to 9 April 2024; then, we reviewed the available literature. Our review showed that SRHIs can lead to various acute complications, in some cases requiring hospitalization and neurosurgical intervention. Long-term complications and cognitive decline after injury might be present, eventually implying a negative impact on a patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s quality of life. Despite being frequent and clinically important, there are still no widely accepted, uniform recommendations for the management of patients with SRHIs. As such, a concise and standardized protocol for the management of seizure-related head injuries in emergency departments is worth consideration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1351/v2?src=rss">Intention for internal whistleblowing to report sexual violence in higher education institutions: a Nigerian national study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Sexual violence is prevalent in higher education institutions in Nigeria and stakeholders have encouraged staff and students to blow the whistle whenever they fall victim to or are aware of any sexual violence case. However, there is lack of data about whether the staff and students of these institutions have the intention to blow the whistle internally (within the institution) or not. There is also a lack of data on the existing reporting mechanisms or preferred whistleblowing mechanisms in these institutions. These have hindered the analysis of stakeholders’ opinions on this topic. Methods This data note presents a comprehensive quantitative and qualitative data set collected from staff and students of three categories of government owned higher education institutions (Universities, Polytechnics, Colleges of Education) in Nigeria. Data collection was between February and December, 2021, during which quantitative data were collected from 21,937 students and 3,108 staff. Qualitatively, 138 students and 111 staff participated in a total of 35 focus group discussion sessions. The study provides unique information on respondents’ attitude, self-efficacy, and subjective norm to sexual violence whistleblowing. It also provides information on self-reported sexual violence experiences, whistleblowing intention, reporting systems in higher institutions and the preferred sexual violence whistleblowing mechanisms. Conclusions In this data note, we provide a detailed account of the variables in the dataset and then highlight the potential of this study to contribute to improved sexual violence reporting in higher education institutions, thereby reducing the occurrence of the social menace.

                Background Smartphone use has grown in providing healthcare for patients with low back pain (LBP), but the literature lacks an analysis of the use of smartphone apps. This scoping review aimed to identify current areas of smartphone apps use for managing LBP. We also aimed to evaluate the current status of the effectiveness or scientific validity of such use and determine perspectives for their potential development. Methods We searched PubMed, PEDro and Embase for articles published in English up to May 3rd, 2021 that investigated smartphone use for LBP healthcare and their purpose. All types of study design were accepted. Studies concerning telemedicine or telerehabilitation but without use of a smartphone were not included. The same search strategy was performed by two researchers independently and a third researcher validated the synthesis of the included studies. Results We included 43 articles: randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (n=12), study protocols (n=6), reliability/validity studies (n=6), systematic reviews (n=7), cohort studies (n=4), qualitative studies (n=6), and case series (n=1). The purposes of the smartphone app were for 1) evaluation, 2) telerehabilitation, 3) self-management, and 4) data collection. Self-management was the most-studied use, showing promising results derived from moderate- to good-quality RCTs for patients with chronic LBP and patients after spinal surgery. Promising results exist regarding evaluation and data collection use and contradictory results regarding measurement use. Conclusions This scoping review revealed a notable interest in the scientific literatures regarding the use of smartphone apps for LBP patients. The identified purposes point to current scientific status and perspectives for further studies including RCTs and systematic reviews targeting specific usage.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-357/v2?src=rss">A detailed methodology for the long-term in vitro culture and analysis of three-dimensional, self-structuring bone models generated from cell lines or primary osteoblastic cell populations [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background There are insufficient in vitro bone models that accommodate long-term culture of osteoblasts and support their differentiation to osteocytes. The increased demand for effective therapies for bone diseases, and the ethical requirement to replace animals in research, warrants the development of such models. Here we present an in-depth protocol to prepare, create and maintain three-dimensional, in vitro, self-structuring bone models that support osteocytogenesis and long-term osteoblast survival (>1 year). Methods Osteoblastic cells are seeded on a fibrin hydrogel, cast between two beta-tricalcium phosphate anchors. Analytical methods optimised for these self-structuring bone model (SSBM) constructs, including RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence staining and XRF, are described in detail. Results Over time, the cells restructure and replace the initial matrix with a collagen-rich, mineralising one; and demonstrate differentiation towards osteocytes within 12 weeks of culture. Conclusions Whilst optimised using a secondary human cell line (hFOB 1.19), this protocol readily accommodates osteoblasts from other species (rat and mouse) and origins (primary and secondary). This simple, straightforward method creates reproducible in vitro bone models that are responsive to exogenous stimuli, offering a versatile platform for conducting preclinical translatable research studies.

                Background This randomized controlled trial aimed to compare the efficacy of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) and casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate fluoride varnish (CPP-ACPFV) in preventing caries development, enamel breakdown, and sensitivity on molars affected by molar incisor hypomineralization (MIH) in children. Methods A total of 100 children aged 6 to 9 years were enrolled in the study with two contralateral permanent molars mildly affected by MIH. Affected molars were randomly and equally assigned to receive either SDF or CPP-ACPFV treatment. The interventions were applied at four different time points (baseline, 3, 6, 9 months), and the incidence of caries, caries progression, enamel breakdown, and sensitivity were assessed. Results The findings of this study revealed significant differences in the incidence of caries between the groups treated with SDF and CPP-ACPFV (P-value < 0.05). Similarly, there was a significant difference in caries progression between the two groups (P-value < 0.05). However, no significant differences were observed in enamel breakdown scores between the treatment groups, as the majority of teeth in both groups exhibited a score of 0. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in sensitivity between the treatment groups throughout the study period. Conclusions In conclusion, the results of this study provide evidence that molars treated with SDF demonstrated a lower incidence of caries and a higher rate of caries arrest compared to those treated with CPP-ACPFV. Both interventions showed promise in preventing enamel breakdown and improving sensitivity. These findings highlight the potential of SDF and CPP-ACPFV as effective treatments for caries prevention and management, emphasizing the importance of early intervention and appropriate dental care strategies in maintaining oral health.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-474/v2?src=rss">Traumatic spinal spondyloptosis presenting in a tertiary care unit in central Nepal [version 2; peer review: 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Traumatic spinal spondyloptosis, though rare, harbingers a high risk of mortality as well as permanent and disabling neurological deficits. They invariably become socially aloof and marginalized in most parts of our subcontinent owing to the lack of dedicated rehabilitation units amid their poor economic status. There is a paucity of studies pertaining to such rare epiphenomenon within our region. Materials ad Methods A retrospective study of 16 patients presenting with spinal spondyloptosis in a tertiary care center in Nepal was undertaken. The clinical records of the patients were retrieved from the hospital record section to study the demographic variables, modes of injury, American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) grades, salient radiological characteristics, management strategies, and the resultant clinical outcomes. Result The mean age of the cohorts in our study was 40 years with an age range of 25-80 years. Most of the patients presented in ASIA ‘A’ neurological grade (75%). The cervical spine was involved in the majority (68.75%) of cases. 8 (50%) patients left against medical advice, 2 (12.5%) were managed conservatively, and 6 (37.5%) were operated. The posterior-only approach was undertaken in 4(66.67%) cases. Tracheo-oesophageal fistula occurred in 2 (33.33%) patients. And cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak occurred in 2 (33.33%) patients. The overall hospital mortality was 3(37.5%). Conclusion Traumatic spinal spondyloptosis on our center mostly involved cervical spine (68.75%). 75% of the patients presented with ASIA ‘A’ neurological grade. 50% of them left against medical advice. 37.5% were operated. The overall hospital mortality was 37.5%. This study emphasizes the implementation of a national spinal trauma data bank and the systematic implementation of dedicated neuro-rehabilitation units. This will thereby help improve the clinical outcome among these ‘socially aloof’ and marginalized subsets of neurosurgical patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1291/v3?src=rss">Exploring Sample Size Determination in Educational Research: A Comprehensive Review [version 3; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 3 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background By conducting an in-depth study of the publications, a review was conducted with the goal of evaluating the sample size in educational research. The sample size, represented by the letter “n,” is a key factor in this research because it specifies the number of participants who represent the target population. Although various studies have been published in the literature defining the processes for calculating sample sizes, there is still much uncertainty. It is vital to understand that there is no single all-encompassing method for determining sample sizes for different study designs. Instead, different study designs call for different approaches to determine sample numbers. Methods Information was retrieved from the databases in accordance with updated PRISMA recommendations. The keywords used for the retrieval of the relevant articles from two databases (Google Scholar and PubMed). The articles were selected by thorough scrutiny and application of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results Seven articles were selected and the comparison was made among the studies in the relation to methods, objective, and outcome from the enrolled studies. Conclusions The evaluation of the seven studies as a whole concluded that the sample size for testing any novel approach essentially required 24.24 participants in each group. The median sample size for the simulation-based educational research was 30. Further research is required to determine the proper sample size based on a single universal formula for all types of designs.

                Background Machine learning and AI promise to revolutionize the way we leverage medical imaging data for improving care but require large datasets to train computational models that can be implemented in clinical practice. However, processing large and complex medical imaging datasets remains an open challenge. Methods To address this issue, we developed Med-ImageTools, a new Python open-source software package to automate data curation and processing while allowing researchers to share their data processing configurations more easily, lowering the barrier for other researchers to reproduce published works. Use cases We have demonstrated the efficiency of Med-ImageTools across three different datasets, resulting in significantly reduced processing times. Conclusions The AutoPipeline feature will improve the accessibility of raw clinical datasets on public archives, such as the Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA), the largest public repository of cancer imaging, allowing machine learning researchers to process analysis-ready formats without requiring deep domain knowledge.

                Background The COVID-19 pandemic affected stakeholder engagement in sustainability research projects in many ways. But which effects appear permanent today, after the pandemic ended? Methods To address this, we interviewed researchers and stakeholders and carried out a survey among European sustainability research projects in 2022. Results We find that the pandemic years disrupted stakeholder-based research, also with lasting effects. The forced shift to online modes showed how digital engagement can bring benefits in terms of easier and more efficient stakeholder engagement, but also that important aspects are lost, particularly regarding intensity of collaboration and depth of insights. Whether to go online or stay offline depends largely on the research objective, which stakeholders to involve, and how well researchers and stakeholders already know each other. Most researchers and stakeholders want to continue online collaboration in the long term, especially those with positive online collaboration experiences from the pandemic years. Conclusions The pandemic has a long-term impact on stakeholder engagement in research; online engagement cannot replace all benefit of previous in-person interactions with stakeholders, but it has led to digital innovations and expanded the engagement portfolio. Our research has provided qualitative insights into the impact of the pandemic on stakeholder engagement in various sustainability research projects and the implications for the long-term future that are relevant to researchers and funding agencies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-104/v2?src=rss">Hepatocellular carcinoma: Advances in systemic therapies [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is traditionally associated with limited treatment options and a poor prognosis. Sorafenib, a multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was introduced in 2007 as a first-in-class systemic agent for advanced HCC. After sorafenib, a range of targeted therapies and immunotherapies have demonstrated survival benefits in the past 5 years, revolutionizing the treatment landscape of advanced HCC. More recently, evidence of novel combinations of systemic agents with distinct mechanisms has emerged. In particular, combination trials on atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and durvalumab plus tremelimumab have shown encouraging efficacy. Hence, international societies have revamped their guidelines to incorporate new recommendations for these novel systemic agents. Aside from treatment in advanced HCC, the indications for systemic therapy are expanding. For example, the combination of systemic therapeutics with locoregional therapy (trans-arterial chemoembolization or stereotactic body radiation therapy) has demonstrated promising early results in downstaging HCC. Recent trials have also explored the role of systemic therapy as neoadjuvant treatment for borderline-resectable HCC or as adjuvant treatment to reduce recurrence risk after curative resection. Despite encouraging results from clinical trials, the real-world efficacy of systemic agents in specific patient subgroups (such as patients with advanced cirrhosis, high bleeding risk, renal impairment, or cardiometabolic diseases) remains uncertain. The effect of liver disease etiology on systemic treatment efficacy warrants further research. With an increased understanding of the pathophysiological pathways and accumulation of clinical data, personalized treatment decisions will be possible, and the field of systemic treatment for HCC will continue to evolve.

                Prediabetes has attracted considerable attention because it increases the risk of developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Prediabetes is also associated with obesity and dyslipidemia. Chronic low-grade inflammation is a crucial element in the clinical course of metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. C-Reactive Protein (CRP) is a biomarker of inflammation that tends to increase in patients with diabetes and prediabetes. Most serological markers of diabetes are detected using invasive techniques that cause anxiety and pain. Therefore, the use of noninvasive techniques for frequent biomarker monitoring is necessary. Salivary diagnostics is an upcoming field for sensitive biomarker detection, such as hs-CRP. HbA1C is a valuable glycemic risk marker and has proven to be a reliable test of time. Both HbA1C and CRP play pivotal roles in diabetes and prediabetes. hs-CRP is a measure of CRP level with greater accuracy. The lower limit of its measurement is 0.01 mg/L and the measurement is more than100 times as sensitive than the CRP measurement (lower limit 5 mg/L). Therefore, our study aimed to evaluate and establish a relationship between these factors in prediabetics. Since metabolic syndrome and prediabetes are the cause and effect of each other, correlating anthropometric measurements and lipid profile with HbA1C and hs-CRP will be our focus.

                Delirium is a brain dysfunction characterized by attention and cognitive disturbances in a fluctuating manner. The international guidelines recommend daily screening for delirium. The Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) and Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) are the most commonly used methods for assessing delirium. This study aimed to identify barriers and gaps in knowledge and practice. This was a hospital-based Cross-Sectional study. Stratified random sampling was used in this study. 72 ICU doctors were randomly selected. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS version 23. Descriptive data were presented, and the chi-squared test was used to determine the associations among variables. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. More than 70% of the doctors were ≤ 30 years of age and female. A total of 69.4% of the participants had < 1year of experience. In total, 94.4% of the participants worked in medical ICUs. Less than 20% of the doctors used delirium assessment tools, with a statistically significant difference based on experience (p=0.012). Delirium was not regularly assessed in 13.9% of the patients. Non-pharmacological management was applied by 76.4% of doctors, and communication with patients was the most frequent (75%). Haloperidol was the most commonly used drug (83.3%). A total of 40.3% of doctors did not stop delirium medication on ICU discharge. A regular delirium assessment was performed. However, the use of validated assessment tools is uncommon. Nonpharmacological management of delirium is important and is mostly performed. Our doctors prescribed antipsychotics for the treatment of both forms of delirium, and almost half of them did not stop the medications on ICU discharge. Medication reconciliation and contact with the next in-charge of the patients are important.

                Heart rate, arterial blood pressure, and arrhythmias significantly surge during laryngoscopy and intubation. Anesthesiologists constantly look for ways to minimize these unwanted reactions. Several medicinal interventions have been suggested to mitigate these side effects; intravenous magnesium sulphate injection is one such intervention. Magnesium sulphate is a divalent salt widely recognized for its capacity to lower sympathetic nervous system muscle cell excitability, which lowers blood pressure and causes vasodilation. It is approved as a medicine to treat preeclampsia and control blood pressure. Moreover, there is growing recognition of its benefits on hemodynamic parameters in patients suffering from ischemic infective endocarditis and heart disease. Magnesium is an asset for reducing negative cardiovascular reactions occurring at the time of laryngoscopy and intubation because of its capacity to reduce catecholamine synthesis from adrenergic nerve ends and the adrenal medulla. Intravenous magnesium sulphate will be used in this trial to assess its effect on reducing adverse hemodynamic responses in candidates for elective laryngoscopy and intubation for ENT surgeries.

                Background Many males encounter the condition of erectile dysfunction (ED), particularly individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Stem cell therapy is a burgeoning treatment modality being explored for individuals with erectile dysfunction in the context of type 2 DM. Nevertheless, the available body of clinical evidence supporting its efficacy remains limited. This study aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy in managing erectile dysfunction (ED) resulting from type 2 DM. Methods A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in Indonesia from October 2020 to January 2023. A total of 26 eligible patients were randomly assigned to two groups: one receiving intracavernosal injections of MSC and the other receiving a placebo. Follow-up assessments were conducted at baseline, month one, and month three. The primary outcomes were measured using the IIEF-5 questionnaire and dorsal artery peak systolic velocity (PSV). Metabolic markers were used as secondary outcomes. Results The IIEF-5 scores for both groups showed a significant increase (p < 0.001) from baseline to month three. There was no significant difference observed between the MSC and placebo groups. Moreover, no significant differences were observed in the PSV of the dorsal artery between the two groups (p>0.05). There were no significant differences in metabolic markers between the groups. The incidence of mild post-injection pain was reported by only 11% of individuals, indicating a low occurrence of adverse events. Conclusions Intracavernous administration of MSC did not demonstrate superior efficacy compared to a placebo in improving metabolic or erectile function in diabetic males with erectile dysfunction. Additional research utilizing larger sample sizes and more extended follow-up periods is necessary.

                Background Psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the skin, joints, and nails (2-3% worldwide), significantly affects quality of life. Genetic and environmental factors also play key roles. Topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and oral corticosteroids help to manage plaque psoriasis symptoms, but combination therapies might offer greater effectiveness and improved safety profiles. These combinations could potentially reduce medication dosages and side effects in patients. Objective To assess the efficacy and safety of various drug combinations over conventional monotherapies in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, which incorporates palmoplantar psoriasis and psoriasis vulgaris, by discovering and utilizing research articles comprising the same or similar variables as PASI 75 and evaluating the information using RevMan v5.4.1. Method We reviewed the efficacy and safety of combination therapy vs. monotherapy/placebo for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (palmoplantar and vulgaris) using PASI 75 via RevMan v5.4.1. Risk of bias assessment and funnel plots were employed to assess the heterogeneity of each paper. Inclusion criteria – Publications < 20yrs, RCTs, plaque/palmoplantar/psoriasis vulgaris; exclusion criteria – Guttate/arthritic psoriasis, pediatric and pregnant individuals, publications > 20 yrs. Results Seventeen studies were analyzed, comprising a total of 2291 patients (n=1147 with combination regimens and n=1144 with control regimen in the analysis). A significant PASI 75- response was observed in the pioglitazone combination subgroup as compared to placebo (OR=4.92,95% CI 2.19-11.05, P = 0.0001); methotrexate combination subgroup as compared to placebo (OR=2.56, 95% CI 1.67-3.94, P< 0.0001) test of subgroup differences showed P= 0.14, I2= 34%. Incidence rate of abnormality in levels of liver enzymes (OR=1.89,9.5% CI 6.69-5.22, P=0.22), nausea (OR=1.28,95% CI 0.77-2.14, P=0.34), headache (OR=1.28,95% CI 0.77-2.14, P=0.58), fatigue (OR=0.89, 95% CI 0.41-1.90, P=0.45).] Conclusion This study showed that combination therapy is very effective for plaque psoriasis, with promising combinations of pioglitazone. While safety seems similar between the groups, larger studies are needed to determine the long-term effects. These findings suggest that personalized treatment plans could improve outcomes; however, confirmation through larger trials is crucial before wider use. This opens doors to research on optimal combinations for individual patients.

                Cell-to-cell gene expression variability is an inherent feature of complex biological systems, such as immunity and development. Single-cell RNA sequencing is a powerful tool to quantify this heterogeneity, but it is prone to strong technical noise. In this article, we describe a step-by-step computational workflow that uses the BASiCS Bioconductor package to robustly quantify expression variability within and between known groups of cells (such as experimental conditions or cell types). BASiCS uses an integrated framework for data normalisation, technical noise quantification and downstream analyses, propagating statistical uncertainty across these steps. Within a single seemingly homogeneous cell population, BASiCS can identify highly variable genes that exhibit strong heterogeneity as well as lowly variable genes with stable expression. BASiCS also uses a probabilistic decision rule to identify changes in expression variability between cell populations, whilst avoiding confounding effects related to differences in technical noise or in overall abundance. Using a publicly available dataset, we guide users through a complete pipeline that includes preliminary steps for quality control, as well as data exploration using the scater and scran Bioconductor packages. The workflow is accompanied by a Docker image that ensures the reproducibility of our results.

                <p>by István Oszoli, István Zachar</p>

The emergence of multicellularity is one of the major transitions in evolution that happened multiple times independently. During aggregative multicellularity, genetically potentially unrelated lineages cooperate to form transient multicellular groups. Unlike clonal multicellularity, aggregative multicellular organisms do not rely on kin selection instead other mechanisms maintain cooperation against cheater phenotypes that benefit from cooperators but do not contribute to groups. Spatiality with limited diffusion can facilitate group selection, as interactions among individuals are restricted to local neighbourhoods only. Selection for larger size (e.g. avoiding predation) may facilitate the emergence of aggregation, though it is unknown, whether and how much role such selection played during the evolution of aggregative multicellularity. We have investigated the effect of spatiality and the necessity of predation on the stability of aggregative multicellularity via individual-based modelling on the ecological timescale. We have examined whether aggregation facilitates the survival of cooperators in a temporally heterogeneous environment against cheaters, where only a subset of the population is allowed to periodically colonize a new, resource-rich habitat. Cooperators constitutively produce adhesive molecules to promote aggregation and propagule-formation while cheaters spare this expense to grow faster but cannot aggregate on their own, hence depending on cooperators for long-term survival. We have compared different population-level reproduction modes with and without individual selection (predation) to evaluate the different hypotheses. In a temporally homogeneous environment without propagule-based colonization, cheaters always win. Predation can benefit cooperators, but it is not enough to maintain the necessary cooperator amount in successive dispersals, either randomly or by fragmentation. Aggregation-based propagation however can ensure the adequate ratio of cooperators-to-cheaters in the propagule and is sufficient to do so even without predation. Spatiality combined with temporal heterogeneity helps cooperators via group selection, thus facilitating aggregative multicellularity. External stress selecting for larger size (e.g. predation) may facilitate aggregation, however, according to our results, it is neither necessary nor sufficient for aggregative multicellularity to be maintained when there is effective group-selection.

Understanding and targeting functional RNA structures towards treatment of coronavirus infection can help us to prepare for novel variants of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19), and any other coronaviruses that could emerge via human-to-human transmission or potential zoonotic (inter-species) events. Leveraging the fact that all coronaviruses use a mechanism known as −1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (−1 PRF) to replicate, we apply algorithms to predict the most energetically favourable secondary structures (each nucleotide involved in at most one pairing) that may be involved in regulating the −1 PRF event in coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV-2. We compute previously unknown most stable structure predictions for the frameshift site of coronaviruses via hierarchical folding, a biologically motivated framework where initial non-crossing structure folds first, followed by subsequent, possibly crossing (pseudoknotted), structures. Using mutual information from 181 coronavirus sequences, in conjunction with the algorithm KnotAli, we compute secondary structure predictions for the frameshift site of different coronaviruses. We then utilize the Shapify algorithm to obtain most stable SARS-CoV-2 secondary structure predictions guided by frameshift sequence-specific and genome-wide experimental data. We build on our previous secondary structure investigation of the singular SARS-CoV-2 68 nt frameshift element sequence, by using Shapify to obtain predictions for 132 extended sequences and including covariation information. Previous investigations have not applied hierarchical folding to extended length SARS-CoV-2 frameshift sequences. By doing so, we simulate the effects of ribosome interaction with the frameshift site, providing insight to biological function. We contribute in-depth discussion to contextualize secondary structure dual-graph motifs for SARS-CoV-2, highlighting the energetic stability of the previously identified 3_8 motif alongside the known dominant 3_3 and 3_6 (native-type) −1 PRF structures. Using a combination of thermodynamic methods and sequence covariation, our novel predictions suggest function of the attenuator hairpin via previously unknown pseudoknotted base pairing. While certain initial RNA folding is consistent, other pseudoknotted base pairs form which indicate potential conformational switching between the two structures.

                <p>by Justin J. Quan, Lachezar A. Nikolov, Jihui Sha, James A. Wohlschlegel, Isabelle Coppens, Peter J. Bradley</p>

<i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> resides in its intracellular niche by employing a series of specialized secretory organelles that play roles in invasion, host cell manipulation, and parasite replication. Rab GTPases are major regulators of the parasite’s secretory traffic that function as nucleotide-dependent molecular switches to control vesicle trafficking. While many of the Rab proteins have been characterized in <i>T</i>. <i>gondii</i>, precisely how these Rabs are regulated remains poorly understood. To better understand the parasite’s secretory traffic, we investigated the entire family of Tre2-Bub2-Cdc16 (TBC) domain-containing proteins, which are known to be involved in vesicle fusion and secretory protein trafficking. We first determined the localization of all 18 TBC domain-containing proteins to discrete regions of the secretory pathway or other vesicles in the parasite. Second, we use an auxin-inducible degron approach to demonstrate that the protozoan-specific TgTBC9 protein, which localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is essential for parasite survival. Knockdown of TgTBC9 results in parasite growth arrest and affects the organization of the ER and mitochondrial morphology. TgTBC9 knockdown also results in the formation of large lipid droplets (LDs) and multi-membranous structures surrounded by ER membranes, further indicating a disruption of ER functions. We show that the conserved dual-finger active site in the TBC domain of the protein is critical for its GTPase-activating protein (GAP) function and that the <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> orthologue of TgTBC9 can rescue the lethal knockdown. We additionally show by immunoprecipitation and yeast 2 hybrid analyses that TgTBC9 preferentially binds Rab2, indicating that the TBC9-Rab2 pair controls ER morphology and vesicular trafficking in the parasite. Together, these studies identify the first essential TBC protein described in any protozoan and provide new insight into intracellular vesicle trafficking in <i>T</i>. <i>gondii</i>.

                <p>by Mathieu Malherbe, Liran Samuni, Sonja J. Ebel, Kathrin S. Kopp, Catherine Crockford, Roman M. Wittig</p>

Tool use is considered a driving force behind the evolution of brain expansion and prolonged juvenile dependency in the hominin lineage. However, it remains rare across animals, possibly due to inherent constraints related to manual dexterity and cognitive abilities. In our study, we investigated the ontogeny of tool use in chimpanzees (<i>Pan troglodytes</i>), a species known for its extensive and flexible tool use behavior. We observed 70 wild chimpanzees across all ages and analyzed 1,460 stick use events filmed in the Taï National Park, Côte d’Ivoire during the chimpanzee attempts to retrieve high-nutrient, but difficult-to-access, foods. We found that chimpanzees increasingly utilized hand grips employing more than 1 independent digit as they matured. Such hand grips emerged at the age of 2, became predominant and fully functional at the age of 6, and ubiquitous at the age of 15, enhancing task accuracy. Adults adjusted their hand grip based on the specific task at hand, favoring power grips for pounding actions and intermediate grips that combine power and precision, for others. Highly protracted development of suitable actions to acquire hidden (i.e., larvae) compared to non-hidden (i.e., nut kernel) food was evident, with adult skill levels achieved only after 15 years, suggesting a pronounced cognitive learning component to task success. The prolonged time required for cognitive assimilation compared to neuromotor control points to selection pressure favoring the retention of learning capacities into adulthood.

Algae and plants carry 2 organelles of endosymbiotic origin that have been co-evolving in their host cells for more than a billion years. The biology of plastids and mitochondria can differ significantly across major lineages and organelle changes likely accompanied the adaptation to new ecological niches such as the terrestrial habitat. Based on organelle proteome data and the genomes of 168 phototrophic (Archaeplastida) versus a broad range of 518 non-phototrophic eukaryotes, we screened for changes in plastid and mitochondrial biology across 1 billion years of evolution. Taking into account 331,571 protein families (or orthogroups), we identify 31,625 protein families that are unique to primary plastid-bearing eukaryotes. The 1,906 and 825 protein families are predicted to operate in plastids and mitochondria, respectively. Tracing the evolutionary history of these protein families through evolutionary time uncovers the significant remodeling the organelles experienced from algae to land plants. The analyses of gained orthogroups identifies molecular changes of organelle biology that connect to the diversification of major lineages and facilitated major transitions from chlorophytes en route to the global greening and origin of angiosperms.

Synaptic adhesion molecules (SAMs) are evolutionarily conserved proteins that play an important role in the form and function of neuronal synapses. Teneurins (Tenms) and latrophilins (Lphns) are well-known cell adhesion molecules that form a transsynaptic complex. Recent studies suggest that <i>Tenm3</i> and Lphn2 (gene symbol <i>Adgrl2</i>) are involved in hippocampal circuit assembly via their topographical expression. However, it is not known whether other teneurins and latrophilins display similar topographically restricted expression patterns during embryonic and postnatal development. Here, we reveal the cartography of all teneurin (<i>Tenm1-4</i>) and latrophilin (Lphn1-3 [<i>Adgrl1-3</i>]) paralog expression in the mouse hippocampus across prenatal and postnatal development as monitored by large-scale single-molecule RNA in situ hybridization mapping. Our results identify a striking heterogeneity in teneurin and latrophilin expression along the spatiotemporal axis of the hippocampus. Tenm2 and Tenm4 expression levels peak at the neonatal stage when compared to Tenm1 and Tenm3, while Tenm1 expression is restricted to the postnatal pyramidal cell layer. Tenm4 expression in the dentate gyrus (DG) exhibits an opposing topographical expression pattern in the embryonic and neonatal hippocampus. Our findings were validated by analyses of multiple RNA-seq datasets at bulk, single-cell, and spatial levels. Thus, our study presents a comprehensive spatiotemporal map of Tenm and Lphn expression in the hippocampus, showcasing their diverse expression patterns across developmental stages in distinct spatial axes.

                <p>by Md. Hassan uz-Zaman, Simon D’Alton, Jeffrey E. Barrick, Howard Ochman</p>

The phenomenon of de novo gene birth—the emergence of genes from non-genic sequences—has received considerable attention due to the widespread occurrence of genes that are unique to particular species or genomes. Most instances of de novo gene birth have been recognized through comparative analyses of genome sequences in eukaryotes, despite the abundance of novel, lineage-specific genes in bacteria and the relative ease with which bacteria can be studied in an experimental context. Here, we explore the genetic record of the <i>Escherichia coli</i> long-term evolution experiment (LTEE) for changes indicative of “proto-genic” phases of new gene birth in which non-genic sequences evolve stable transcription and/or translation. Over the time span of the LTEE, non-genic regions are frequently transcribed, translated and differentially expressed, with levels of transcription across low-expressed regions increasing in later generations of the experiment. Proto-genes formed downstream of new mutations result either from insertion element activity or chromosomal translocations that fused preexisting regulatory sequences to regions that were not expressed in the LTEE ancestor. Additionally, we identified instances of proto-gene emergence in which a previously unexpressed sequence was transcribed after formation of an upstream promoter, although such cases were rare compared to those caused by recruitment of preexisting promoters. Tracing the origin of the causative mutations, we discovered that most occurred early in the history of the LTEE, often within the first 20,000 generations, and became fixed soon after emergence. Our findings show that proto-genes emerge frequently within evolving populations, can persist stably, and can serve as potential substrates for new gene formation.

We report a new visualization tool for analysis of whole-genome assembly-assembly alignments, the Comparative Genome Viewer (CGV) (https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/cgv/). CGV visualizes pairwise same-species and cross-species alignments provided by National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using assembly alignment algorithms developed by us and others. Researchers can examine large structural differences spanning chromosomes, such as inversions or translocations. Users can also navigate to regions of interest, where they can detect and analyze smaller-scale deletions and rearrangements within specific chromosome or gene regions. RefSeq or user-provided gene annotation is displayed where available. CGV currently provides approximately 800 alignments from over 350 animal, plant, and fungal species. CGV and related NCBI viewers are undergoing active development to further meet needs of the research community in comparative genome visualization.

Activation of immune cells requires the remodeling of cell metabolism in order to support immune function. We study these metabolic changes through the infection of <i>Drosophila</i> larvae by parasitoid wasp. The parasitoid egg is neutralized by differentiating lamellocytes, which encapsulate the egg. A melanization cascade is initiated, producing toxic molecules to destroy the egg while the capsule also protects the host from the toxic reaction. We combined transcriptomics and metabolomics, including <sup>13</sup>C-labeled glucose and trehalose tracing, as well as genetic manipulation of sugar metabolism to study changes in metabolism, specifically in <i>Drosophila</i> hemocytes. We found that hemocytes increase the expression of several carbohydrate transporters and accordingly uptake more sugar during infection. These carbohydrates are metabolized by increased glycolysis, associated with lactate production, and cyclic pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), in which glucose-6-phosphate is re-oxidized to maximize NADPH yield. Oxidative PPP is required for lamellocyte differentiation and resistance, as is systemic trehalose metabolism. In addition, fully differentiated lamellocytes use a cytoplasmic form of trehalase to cleave trehalose to glucose and fuel cyclic PPP. Intracellular trehalose metabolism is not required for lamellocyte differentiation, but its down-regulation elevates levels of reactive oxygen species, associated with increased resistance and reduced fitness. Our results suggest that sugar metabolism, and specifically cyclic PPP, within immune cells is important not only to fight infection but also to protect the host from its own immune response and for ensuring fitness of the survivor.

The molecular mechanisms underlying ASD have not yet been elucidated completely. Evidence has emerged to support a link between microglial dysfunction and the etiology of ASD. This review summarizes current research on microglial dysfunction in neuroinflammation and synaptic pruning, which are associated with altered transcriptomes and autophagy in ASD. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota in ASD and its correlation with microglial dysfunction are also addressed.

                Introduction Carriers of variant alleles of genes that encode liver CYP450 and UGT enzymes may experience abnormal plasma levels of antipsychotics and, consequently, worse efficacy or tolerability. Although pharmacogenomics is a rapidly developing field, current guidelines often rely on limited, underpowered evidence. We have previously demonstrated that meta-analysis is a viable strategy for overcoming this problem. Here, we propose a project that will expand our previous work and create a living systematic review and meta-analysis of drug plasma level differences between carriers and non-carriers of variant genotype-predicted phenotypes for every pharmacokinetic drug-gene interaction relevant to commonly used antipsychotic drugs. Protocol First, a baseline systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted by searching for observational pharmacogenomics-pharmacokinetic studies. Data on dose-adjusted drug plasma levels will be extracted, and participants will be grouped based on their genotype for each drug-gene pair separately. Differences in plasma drug levels between different phenotypes will be compared using a random-effect ratio-of-means meta-analysis. The risk of bias will be assessed using ROBINS-I, and the certainty of evidence will be assessed using GRADE. Following the establishment of baseline results, the literature search will be re-run at least once every six months, and the baseline data will be updated and re-evaluated as new evidence is published. A freely available website will be designated to present up-to-date results and conclusions. Discussion This systematic review will provide evidence-based results that are continuously updated with evidence as it emerges in the rapidly developing field of pharmacogenomics. These results may help psychiatrists in their decision-making, as clinicians are becoming increasingly aware of the patients’ genetic data as testing becomes more widespread and cheaper. In addition, the results may serve as a scientific basis for the development of evidence-based pharmacogenomics algorithms for personalized dosing of antipsychotics to mitigate potentially harmful drug-gene interactions.

                Background Bibliometric analysis plays an essential role in scientific research. However, some research areas still have several gaps. This is also the case in the animal sciences. Therefore, the status of current studies can be analyzed to provide guidance for future research through scientific studies that will be conducted. The aim of this study was to perform a bibliometric analysis of goat breeding to evaluate current trends, gaps in knowledge, and future perspectives. Methods A large dataset was extracted from the Web of Science (WoS), a popular database for scientific studies. According to the WoS, we used 1000 scientific papers (1991–2023) that contained articles, book chapters, data papers, proceedings papers, meeting abstracts, and notes. All bibliometric analyses were performed using the bibliometrix package. Results and Conclusions In 2023, there were 34 studies available. Average citations per year showed that the highest average citation count occurred in 2006 (31.35). In total, 265 scientific journals in the WoS database have published goat breeding studies. Small Ruminant Research led to the remaining 145 articles. In conclusion, scientific studies on goat breeding have become popular in recent years. The authors may gravitate towards popular journals in the future.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-450/v1?src=rss">Environmental factors and daily suicides: a time series analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study investigated the association between weather, air pollution, and suicide risk in Sousse. Methods A two-time series analysis examined suicide cases recorded in the forensic service of Farhat Hached University Hospital of Sousse, confirmed by autopsy, over seven years (2010-2016). Climate data were retrieved from the Monastir-Airport weather station, and air pollution data were obtained from the National Agency for Environmental Protection’s modelling platform. Results During the study period, 118 suicides were recorded, with the highest number (19.5%) occurring in 2012. Multiple binary logistic regression analysis revealed that autumn and a decline in NH3 were independently associated with a decreased risk of suicide (p=0.045; ORa: 0.57 CI95% [0.33-0.98], p= 0.009; ORa: 0.24 CI95% [0.08-0.71], respectively). Conversely, a 1 ppm increase in PM10 was associated with a 2.5% increase in suicide risk (p<10-3; ORa: 1.02 CI95% [1.01-1.03]). Conclusions Environmental factors, including seasonality and air quality, may provide valuable insights into suicide risks. Understanding the influence of these factors may have implications in preventive strategies.

                Background Postoperative pain management is a crucial part of patient care for surgeries involving the upper limbs. A popular technique for providing both postoperative analgesia and regional anaesthesia is a supraclavicular plexus block guided by a peripheral nerve stimulator. Recent research has demonstrated that the analgesic effect of ropivacaine, a common local anaesthetic, can be enhanced by the addition of magnesium sulphate. The study aims to assess the safety and effectiveness of utilising magnesium sulphate in addition to ropivacaine alone for postoperative analgesia in patients having upper limb surgeries under peripheral nerve stimulator-guided supraclavicular plexus block. Methods This protocol outlines a prospective, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial that assesses the efficacy of ropivacaine versus ropivacaine plus magnesium sulphate for analgesia post surgery in patients undergoing upper limb surgeries under the guidance of a peripheral nerve stimulator (PNS). 50 Patients will be included in the study in total, and they will be split into two groups at random. PNS-guided supraclavicular plexus block with ropivacaine alone will be administered to one group, while ropivacaine combined with magnesium sulphate will be administered to the other. Regular monitoring will be done during the postoperative phase to determine pain levels, use of analgesics, motor and sensory blockade, and adverse events. Results The study aims to determine if ropivacaine with magnesium sulphate postoperative analgesia is superior to ropivacaine alone in supraclavicular plexus blocks. The motor and sensory blockade duration, opioid use, and any negative results will be evaluated as secondary outcomes. Statistical analysis will be performed to determine the significance of the differences between the two groups. Conclusion This study protocol compares the effectiveness of ropivacaine alone against ropivacaine with magnesium sulphate in peripheral nerve stimulator-guided supraclavicular plexus block, with the goal of adding to the repository of information on postoperative analgesia in upper limb procedures. The study’s findings could be very helpful in enhancing pain management strategies and enhancing patient outcomes in this context.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptor (H<sub>1</sub>R) in the central nervous system plays an important role in various functions, including learning and memory, aggression, feeding behaviors, and wakefulness, as evidenced by studies utilizing H<sub>1</sub>R knockout mice and pharmacological interventions. Although previous studies have reported the widespread distribution of H<sub>1</sub>R in the brains of rats, guinea pigs, monkeys, and humans, the detailed distribution in the mouse brain remains unclear. This study provides a comprehensive description of the distribution of H<sub>1</sub>R mRNA in the mouse brain using two recently developed techniques: RNAscope and in situ hybridization chain reaction, both of which offer enhanced sensitivity and resolution compared to traditional methodologies such as radioisotope labeling, which were used in previous studies. The H<sub>1</sub>R mRNA expression was observed throughout the entire brain, including key regions implicated in sleep–wake regulatory functions, such as the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus and dorsal raphe. Additionally, strong H<sub>1</sub>R mRNA signals were identified in the paraventricular hypothalamus and ventromedial hypothalamus, which may explain the potential mechanisms underlying histamine-mediated feeding regulation. Notably, we identified strong H<sub>1</sub>R mRNA expression in previously unreported cerebral regions, such as the dorsal endopiriform nucleus, bed nucleus of the accessory olfactory tract, and postsubiculum. These findings significantly contribute to our understanding of the multifaceted roles of H<sub>1</sub>R in diverse brain functions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83712">CYRI-B mediated macropinocytosis drives metastasis via lysophosphatidic acid receptor uptake</a></h4>

              
                Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma carries a dismal prognosis, with high rates of metastasis and few treatment options. Hyperactivation of KRAS in almost all tumours drives RAC1 activation, conferring enhanced migratory and proliferative capacity as well as macropinocytosis. Macropinocytosis is well understood as a nutrient scavenging mechanism, but little is known about its functions in trafficking of signaling receptors. We find that CYRI-B is highly expressed in pancreatic tumours in a mouse model of KRAS and p53-driven pancreatic cancer. Deletion of <i>Cyrib</i> (the gene encoding CYRI-B protein) accelerates tumourigenesis, leading to enhanced ERK and JNK-induced proliferation in precancerous lesions, indicating a potential role as a buffer of RAC1 hyperactivation in early stages. However, as disease progresses, loss of CYRI-B inhibits metastasis. CYRI-B depleted tumour cells show reduced chemotactic responses to lysophosphatidic acid, a major driver of tumour spread, due to impaired macropinocytic uptake of the lysophosphatidic acid receptor-1. Overall, we implicate CYRI-B as a mediator of growth and signaling in pancreatic cancer, providing new insights into pathways controlling metastasis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88953">A stochastic world model on gravity for stability inference</a></h4>

              
                The fact that objects without proper support will fall to the ground is not only a natural phenomenon, but also common sense in mind. Previous studies suggest that humans may infer objects’ stability through a world model that performs mental simulations with a priori knowledge of gravity acting upon the objects. Here we measured participants’ sensitivity to gravity to investigate how the world model works. We found that the world model on gravity was not a faithful replica of the physical laws, but instead encoded gravity’s vertical direction as a Gaussian distribution. The world model with this stochastic feature fit nicely with participants’ subjective sense of objects’ stability and explained the illusion that taller objects are perceived as more likely to fall. Furthermore, a computational model with reinforcement learning revealed that the stochastic characteristic likely originated from experience-dependent comparisons between predictions formed by internal simulations and the realities observed in the external world, which illustrated the ecological advantage of stochastic representation in balancing accuracy and speed for efficient stability inference. The stochastic world model on gravity provides an example of how a priori knowledge of the physical world is implemented in mind that helps humans operate flexibly in open-ended environments.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89423">Nanobody repertoire generated against the spike protein of ancestral SARS-CoV-2 remains efficacious against the rapidly evolving virus</a></h4>

              
                To date, all major modes of monoclonal antibody therapy targeting SARS-CoV-2 have lost significant efficacy against the latest circulating variants. As SARS-CoV-2 omicron sublineages account for over 90% of COVID-19 infections, evasion of immune responses generated by vaccination or exposure to previous variants poses a significant challenge. A compelling new therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2 is that of single-domain antibodies, termed nanobodies, which address certain limitations of monoclonal antibodies. Here, we demonstrate that our high-affinity nanobody repertoire, generated against wild-type SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Mast et al., 2021), remains effective against variants of concern, including omicron BA.4/BA.5; a subset is predicted to counter resistance in emerging XBB and BQ.1.1 sublineages. Furthermore, we reveal the synergistic potential of nanobody cocktails in neutralizing emerging variants. Our study highlights the power of nanobody technology as a versatile therapeutic and diagnostic tool to combat rapidly evolving infectious diseases such as SARS-CoV-2.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88991">Molecular dissection of PI3Kβ synergistic activation by receptor tyrosine kinases, GβGγ, and Rho-family GTPases</a></h4>

              
                Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) beta (PI3Kβ) is functionally unique in the ability to integrate signals derived from receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), G-protein coupled receptors, and Rho-family GTPases. The mechanism by which PI3Kβ prioritizes interactions with various membrane-tethered signaling inputs, however, remains unclear. Previous experiments did not determine whether interactions with membrane-tethered proteins primarily control PI3Kβ localization versus directly modulate lipid kinase activity. To address this gap in our knowledge, we established an assay to directly visualize how three distinct protein interactions regulate PI3Kβ when presented to the kinase in a biologically relevant configuration on supported lipid bilayers. Using single molecule Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) Microscopy, we determined the mechanism controlling PI3Kβ membrane localization, prioritization of signaling inputs, and lipid kinase activation. We find that auto-inhibited PI3Kβ prioritizes interactions with RTK-derived tyrosine phosphorylated (pY) peptides before engaging either GβGγ or Rac1(GTP). Although pY peptides strongly localize PI3Kβ to membranes, stimulation of lipid kinase activity is modest. In the presence of either pY/GβGγ or pY/Rac1(GTP), PI3Kβ activity is dramatically enhanced beyond what can be explained by simply increasing membrane localization. Instead, PI3Kβ is synergistically activated by pY/GβGγ and pY/Rac1 (GTP) through a mechanism consistent with allosteric regulation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92178">Uncharacterized yeast gene YBR238C, an effector of TORC1 signaling in a mitochondrial feedback loop, accelerates cellular aging via HAP4- and RMD9-dependent mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                Uncovering the regulators of cellular aging will unravel the complexity of aging biology and identify potential therapeutic interventions to delay the onset and progress of chronic, aging-related diseases. In this work, we systematically compared genesets involved in regulating the lifespan of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> (a powerful model organism to study the cellular aging of humans) and those with expression changes under rapamycin treatment. Among the functionally uncharacterized genes in the overlap set, <i>YBR238C</i> stood out as the only one downregulated by rapamycin and with an increased chronological and replicative lifespan upon deletion. We show that <i>YBR238C</i> and its paralog <i>RMD9</i> oppositely affect mitochondria and aging. <i>YBR238C</i> deletion increases the cellular lifespan by enhancing mitochondrial function. Its overexpression accelerates cellular aging via mitochondrial dysfunction. We find that the phenotypic effect of <i>YBR238C</i> is largely explained by <i>HAP4</i>- and <i>RMD9</i>-dependent mechanisms. Furthermore, we find that genetic- or chemical-based induction of mitochondrial dysfunction increases TORC1 (Target of Rapamycin Complex 1) activity that, subsequently, accelerates cellular aging. Notably, TORC1 inhibition by rapamycin (or deletion of <i>YBR238C</i>) improves the shortened lifespan under these mitochondrial dysfunction conditions in yeast and human cells. The growth of mutant cells (a proxy of TORC1 activity) with enhanced mitochondrial function is sensitive to rapamycin whereas the growth of defective mitochondrial mutants is largely resistant to rapamycin compared to wild type. Our findings demonstrate a feedback loop between TORC1 and mitochondria (the <span class="underline">TO</span>RC1–<span class="underline">MI</span>tochondria–<span class="underline">TO</span>RC1 (TOMITO) signaling process) that regulates cellular aging processes. Hereby, <i>YBR238C</i> is an effector of TORC1 modulating mitochondrial function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88053">Drift of neural ensembles driven by slow fluctuations of intrinsic excitability</a></h4>

              
                Representational drift refers to the dynamic nature of neural representations in the brain despite the behavior being seemingly stable. Although drift has been observed in many different brain regions, the mechanisms underlying it are not known. Since intrinsic neural excitability is suggested to play a key role in regulating memory allocation, fluctuations of excitability could bias the reactivation of previously stored memory ensembles and therefore act as a motor for drift. Here, we propose a rate-based plastic recurrent neural network with slow fluctuations of intrinsic excitability. We first show that subsequent reactivations of a neural ensemble can lead to drift of this ensemble. The model predicts that drift is induced by co-activation of previously active neurons along with neurons with high excitability which leads to remodeling of the recurrent weights. Consistent with previous experimental works, the drifting ensemble is informative about its temporal history. Crucially, we show that the gradual nature of the drift is necessary for decoding temporal information from the activity of the ensemble. Finally, we show that the memory is preserved and can be decoded by an output neuron having plastic synapses with the main region.

                The cytosolic proteins synucleins and synapsins are thought to play cooperative roles in regulating synaptic vesicle (SV) recycling, but mechanistic insight is lacking. Here, we identify the synapsin E-domain as an essential functional binding-partner of α-synuclein (α-syn). Synapsin E-domain allows α-syn functionality, binds to α-syn, and is necessary and sufficient for enabling effects of α-syn at synapses of cultured mouse hippocampal neurons. Together with previous studies implicating the E-domain in clustering SVs, our experiments advocate a cooperative role for these two proteins in maintaining physiologic SV clusters.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85694">Collaborative hunting in artificial agents with deep reinforcement learning</a></h4>

              
                Collaborative hunting, in which predators play different and complementary roles to capture prey, has been traditionally believed to be an advanced hunting strategy requiring large brains that involve high-level cognition. However, recent findings that collaborative hunting has also been documented in smaller-brained vertebrates have placed this previous belief under strain. Here, using computational multi-agent simulations based on deep reinforcement learning, we demonstrate that decisions underlying collaborative hunts do not necessarily rely on sophisticated cognitive processes. We found that apparently elaborate coordination can be achieved through a relatively simple decision process of mapping between states and actions related to distance-dependent internal representations formed by prior experience. Furthermore, we confirmed that this decision rule of predators is robust against unknown prey controlled by humans. Our computational ecological results emphasize that collaborative hunting can emerge in various intra- and inter-specific interactions in nature, and provide insights into the evolution of sociality.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92063">Some mechanistic underpinnings of molecular adaptations of SARS-COV-2 spike protein by integrating candidate adaptive polymorphisms with protein dynamics</a></h4>

              
                We integrate evolutionary predictions based on the neutral theory of molecular evolution with protein dynamics to generate mechanistic insight into the molecular adaptations of the SARS-COV-2 spike (S) protein. With this approach, we first identified candidate adaptive polymorphisms (CAPs) of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and assessed the impact of these CAPs through dynamics analysis. Not only have we found that CAPs frequently overlap with well-known functional sites, but also, using several different dynamics-based metrics, we reveal the critical allosteric interplay between SARS-CoV-2 CAPs and the S protein binding sites with the human ACE2 (hACE2) protein. CAPs interact far differently with the hACE2 binding site residues in the open conformation of the S protein compared to the closed form. In particular, the CAP sites control the dynamics of binding residues in the open state, suggesting an allosteric control of hACE2 binding. We also explored the characteristic mutations of different SARS-CoV-2 strains to find dynamic hallmarks and potential effects of future mutations. Our analyses reveal that Delta strain-specific variants have non-additive (i.e., epistatic) interactions with CAP sites, whereas the less pathogenic Omicron strains have mostly additive mutations. Finally, our dynamics-based analysis suggests that the novel mutations observed in the Omicron strain epistatically interact with the CAP sites to help escape antibody binding.

">Assessing the subarachnoid space anatomy on clinical imaging: utilizing normal and pathology to understand compartmentalization of the subarachnoid space</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND: The goal of the study is to use CT imaging in patients with aSAH to evaluate the anatomic distribution of hemorrhage and compartmentalization of subarachnoid space to investigate potential in vivo visualization of recently discovered layer named subarachnoid lymphatic like membrane (SLYM). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of cases with aneurysmal SAH (aSAH) at our institution between January 2015 and June 2022. Subarachnoid hemorrhage distribution into superficial and deep subarachnoid spaces was classified based on proximity to the dural or pial surfaces, respectively, as seen on multiplanar CT head. RESULTS: A total of 97 patients with aSAH were included. Patients with lower modified Fisher score (MFS) of 1-2 were more likely to have SAH compartmentalizing in the (deep) pial-adjacent subarachnoid space. Patients with higher MFS of 3-4 were more likely to have SAH in both (superficial) and (deep) compartments along the brainstem. There is a significant association between the severity of aSAH - quantified by the MFS - and the distribution of the blood. Patients with higher MFS scores were roughly 7.6 times (p-value = 0.049) more likely to have hemorrhage at the (Superficial) juxta-dural subarachnoid compartment when compared to those with lower MFS scores. CONCLUSION: This study suggests an imaging correlate to the recently discovered SLYM, potentially influencing aSAH compartmentalization, particularly in low-grade bleeds. While compartmentalization is limited in high-grade cases, these findings warrant further investigation with advanced imaging techniques to validate this membrane's role and potential impact on CSF flow and aSAH pathophysiology.

">Ih Block Reveals Separation of Timescales in Pyloric Rhythm Response to Temperature Changes in Cancer borealis</a></h4>

              
                Motor systems operate over a range of frequencies and relative timing (phase). We studied the contribution of the hyperpolarization-activated inward current (Ih) to frequency and phase in the pyloric rhythm of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the crab, Cancer borealis as temperature was altered from 11 degrees C to 21 degrees C. Under control conditions, the frequency of the rhythm increased monotonically with temperature, while the phases of the pyloric dilator (PD), lateral pyloric (LP), and pyloric (PY) neurons remained constant. When we blocked Ih> with cesium (Cs+) PD offset, LP onset, and LP offset were all phase advanced in Cs+ at 11 degrees C, and the latter two further advanced as temperature increased. In Cs+ the steady state increase in pyloric frequency with temperature diminished and the Q10 of the pyloric frequency dropped from ~1.75 to ~1.35. Unexpectedly in Cs+, the frequency displayed non-monotonic dynamics during temperature transitions; the frequency initially dropped as temperature increased, then rose once temperature stabilized, creating a characteristic jag. Interestingly, these jags were still present during temperature transitions in Cs+ when the pacemaker was isolated by picrotoxin, although the temperature-induced change in frequency recovered to control levels. Overall, these data suggest that Ih plays an important role in the ability of this circuit to produces smooth transitory responses and persistent frequency increases by different mechanisms during temperature fluctuations.

">Cdc25A phosphatase is activated and mediates neuronal cell death by PUMA via pRB/E2F1 pathway in a model of Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is a predominant movement disorder caused mainly due to selective loss of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the mid brain. There is currently no cure for PD barring treatments to manage symptoms. The reasons might be due to lack of precise understanding of molecular mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration. Aberrant cell cycle activation has been implicated in neuronal death pathways of various neurodegenerative diseases including PD. This study investigates the role of cell cycle regulator Cell division cycle 25A (Cdc25A) in a PD-relevant neuron death model induced by 6-OHDA treatment. We find Cdc25A is rapidly elevated, activated and is playing a key role in neuron death by regulating Rb phosphorylation and E2F1 activity. Knockdown of Cdc25A via shRNA downregulates the levels of pro-apoptotic PUMA, an E2F1 target and cleaved Caspase-3 levels, suggesting Cdc25A may regulate neuronal apoptosis through these effectors. Our work sheds light on the intricate signaling networks involved in neurodegeneration and highlights Cdc25A as a potential therapeutic target for mitigating aberrant cell cycle re-entry underlying PD pathogenesis. These novel insights into molecular mechanisms provide a foundation for future development of neuroprotective strategies to slow or prevent progression of this debilitating disease.

">Velocity-selective arterial spin labelling bolus duration measurements: Implications for consensus recommendations</a></h4>

              
                Velocity-selective arterial spin labelling (VSASL) MRI is insensitive to arterial transit time. This is an advantage over other perfusion measurements, where long arterial transit times can lead to bias. Therefore, VSASL can be used to study perfusion in the presence of long arterial transit times, such as in the ageing brain, in vascular pathologies, and cancer, or where arterial transit time changes, such as during measurement of cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR). However, when calculating perfusion (cerebral blood flow, CBF, in the brain) from VSASL signal, it is assumed that images are acquired before the trailing edge of the labelled blood has arrived in the imaging slice. The arrival of the trailing edge of the labelled bolus of blood will cause an underestimation of perfusion. Here we measure bolus duration in young, healthy human brains, both at rest and during elevated CBF. Grey matter bolus duration was 1.61 +/- 0.31 s, but there was a large spatial heterogeneity, with bolus duration being lower in anterior brain regions, with some areas having bolus duration < 1.2 s. We place these results in context of recommendations from a recent consensus paper, which recommends imaging 1.4 s after the label, potentially underestimating CBF in anterior regions. Further, we observed a 0.23 +/- 0.12 s reduction in grey matter bolus duration with 5% CO2 inhalation. These results can be used to inform the experimental design of future VSASL studies, to avoid underestimating perfusion by imaging after the arrival of the trailing edge of the labelled bolus.

">Type-I interferons drive the gastrointestinal inflammatory response in a mouse model of Parkinsons disease</a></h4>

              
                Background and Aims Parkinsons disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterised by classical motor symptoms due to a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. The type-I interferons (IFNs) are elevated in the aging brain and we have implicated them in the neuroinflammatory response in PD. With increasing evidence of gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction in PD patients, this study explored the contribution of the type-I IFNs to the transmission of pathology from the brain to the gut in PD. Methods Young (10-12 weeks) and aged (40-50 weeks) wildtype and IFNAR1-/- mice received an intrastriatal injection of human alpha-synuclein (-Syn) pre-formed fibrils (PFF) (8ug) with gut tissue analysed 6-months post-injection (p.i). A mouse intestinal organoid culture model was established to further characterise the -Syn induced inflammatory response in the gut. Results An intrastriatal injection of human -Syn PFFs was shown to initiate a type-I IFN-dependent neuroinflammatory response in the GI tract of wildtype mice at 6-months p.i. This response was attributed to an elevation in type-I IFN signalling in aged mice that was absent in the IFNAR1-/- mice. Mouse intestinal organoid cultures confirmed -Syn was taken up by the enteroendocrine cells (EECs) to induce a type-I IFN mediated pro-inflammatory response that was attenuated in IFNAR1-/- cultures. Conclusion This study has confirmed the type-I IFNs modulate the -Syn PFF induced inflammatory response within the gut potentiating pathology progression along the gut-brain axis. Early intervention of this type-I IFN response may be a potential therapeutic target to limit the progression of PD.

">An ultra-short-acting benzodiazepine in thalamic nucleus reuniens undermines fear extinction via intermediation of hippocamposeptal circuits</a></h4>

              
                Benzodiazepines, commonly used for anxiolytics, hinder conditioned fear extinction, and the underlying circuit mechanisms are unclear. Utilizing remimazolam, an ultra-short-acting benzodiazepine, we reveal its impact on the thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE) and interconnected hippocamposeptal circuits during fear extinction. Systemic or RE-specific administration of remimazolam impedes fear extinction by reducing RE activation through A type GABA receptors. Remimazolam enhances long-range GABAergic inhibition from lateral septum (LS) to RE, underlying the compromised fear extinction. RE projects to ventral hippocampus (vHPC), which in turn sends projections characterized by feed-forward inhibition to the GABAergic neurons of the LS. This is coupled with long-range GABAergic projections from the LS to RE, collectively constituting an overall positive feedback circuit construct that promotes fear extinction. RE-specific remimazolam negates the facilitation of fear extinction by disrupting this circuit. Thus, remimazolam in RE disrupts fear extinction caused by hippocamposeptal intermediation, offering mechanistic insights for the dilemma of combining anxiolytics with extinction-based exposure therapy.

">Scheduled feeding improves sleep in a mouse model of Huntington's disease.</a></h4>

              
                Sleep disturbances are common features of neurodegenerative disorders including Huntington's disease (HD). The sleep and circadian disruptions are recapitulated in animal models, and these models provide the opportunity to evaluate whether circadian interventions can be effective countermeasures for neurodegenerative disease. Time restricted feeding (TRF) interventions successfully improve activity rhythms, sleep behavior and motor performance in mouse models of HD. Seeking to determine if these benefits of scheduled feeding extend to physiological measures of sleep, electroencephalography (EEG) was used to measure sleep/wake states and polysomnographic patterns in adult mice (six month-old) under TRF and ad lib feeding (ALF). With each diet, both male and female wild-type (WT) and bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic (BACHD) mice were evaluated. Our findings show that male, but not female, BACHD mice exhibited significant changes in the temporal patterning of wake and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. The TRF intervention reduced the inappropriate early morning activity by increasing NREM sleep in the male BACHD mice. In addition, the scheduled feeding reduced sleep fragmentation (# bouts) in the male BACHD mice. The phase of the rhythm in rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep was significantly altered by the scheduled feeding. The treatment did impact the power spectral curves during the day in male but not female mice. Sleep homeostasis, as measured by the response to six hours of gentle handling, was not altered by the diet. Thus, TRF improves the temporal patterning and fragmentation of NREM sleep without impacting sleep homeostasis. This work adds critical support to the view that sleep is a modifiable risk factor in neurodegenerative diseases.

">State- and circuit-dependent opponent-processing of fear</a></h4>

              
                The presence of valence coding neurons in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) that form distinct projections to other brain regions implies functional opposition between aversion and reward during learning. However, evidence for opponent interactions in fear learning is sparse and may only be apparent under certain conditions. Here we test this possibility by studying the roles of the BLA-central amygdala (CeA) and BLA-nucleus accumbens (Acb) pathways in fear learning in male rats. First, we assessed the organisation of these pathways in the rat brain. BLA-CeA and BLA-Acb pathways were largely segregated in the BLA but shared overlapping molecular profiles. Then we assessed activity of the BLA-CeA and BLA-Acb pathways during two different forms of fear learning - fear learning in a neutral context and fear learning in a reward context. BLA-CeA neurons were robustly recruited by footshock regardless of where fear learning occurred whereas recruitment of BLA-Acb neurons was state-dependent because footshock only recruited this pathway in a reward context. Finally, we assessed the causal roles of activity in these pathways in fear learning. Photoinhibition of the BLA-CeA pathway during the footshock US impaired fear learning, regardless of where fear learning occurred. In contrast, photoinhibition of the BLA-Acb pathway augmented fear learning, but only in the reward context. Taken together, our findings show circuit- and state-dependent opponent processing of fear. Footshock-driven activity in the BLA-Acb pathway can functionally oppose the BLA-CeA pathway to limit how much fear is learned.

">Differential effects of PDE4A5 on cAMP-dependent forms of long-term potentiation</a></h4>

              
                cAMP signaling is critical for memory consolidation and certain of forms long-term potentiation (LTP). Phosphodiesterases (PDEs), enzymes that degrade the second messenger cAMP and cGMP, are highly conserved during evolution and represent a unique set of drug targets, given the involvement of these enzymes in several pathophysiological states including brain disorders. The PDE4 family of cAMP selective PDEs, exert regulatory roles in memory and synaptic plasticity, but the specific roles of distinct PDE4 isoforms in these processes are poorly understood. Building on our previous work demonstrating that spatial and contextual memory deficits were caused by expressing selectively the long isoform of the PDE4A subfamily, PDE4A5, in hippocampal excitatory neurons, we now investigate the effects of PDE4A isoforms on different cAMP-dependent forms of LTP. We find that PDE4A5 impairs long-lasting LTP induced by theta burst stimulation (TBS) while sparing long-lasting LTP induced by spaced 4-train stimulation (4X100Hz). This effect requires the unique N-terminus of PDE4A5 and is specific to this long isoform. Targeted overexpression of PDE4A5 in area CA1 is sufficient to impair TBS-LTP, suggesting that cAMP levels in the postsynaptic neuron are critical for TBS-LTP. Our results shed light on the inherent differences among the PDE4A subfamily isoforms, emphasizing the importance of the long isoforms, which have a unique N-terminal region. Advancing our understanding of the function of specific PDE isoforms will pave the way for developing isoform-selective approaches to treat the cognitive deficits that are debilitating aspects of psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative disorders.

">Mechanism, and treatment of anti-CV2/CRMP5 autoimmune pain</a></h4>

              
                Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes arise from autoimmune reactions against nervous system antigens due to a maladaptive immune response to a peripheral cancer. Patients with small cell lung carcinoma or malignant thymoma can develop an autoimmune response against the CV2/collapsin response mediator protein 5 (CRMP5) antigen. For reasons that are not understood, approximately 80% of patients experience painful neuropathies. Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying anti-CV2/CRMP5 autoantibodies (CV2/CRMP5-Abs)-related pain. We found that patient-derived CV2/CRMP5-Abs can bind to their target in rodent dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and superficial laminae of the spinal cord. CV2/CRMP5-Abs induced DRG neuron hyperexcitability and mechanical hypersensitivity in rats that were abolished by preventing binding to their cognate autoantigen CRMP5. The effect of CV2/CRMP5-Abs on sensory neuron hyperexcitability and mechanical hypersensitivity observed in patients was recapitulated in rats using genetic immunization providing an approach to rapidly identify possible therapeutic choices for treating autoantibody-induced pain including the repurposing of a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody that selectively deplete B-lymphocytes. These data reveal a previously unknown neuronal mechanism of neuropathic pain in patients with paraneoplastic neurological syndromes resulting directly from CV2/CRMP5-Abs-induced nociceptor excitability. CV2/CRMP5-Abs directly sensitize pain responses by increasing sensory neuron excitability and strategies aiming at either blocking or reducing CV2/CRMP5-Abs can treat pain as a comorbidity in patients with paraneoplastic neurological syndromes.

">Neuronal and oligodendroglial but not astroglial tau translates to in vivo tau-PET signals in primary tauopathies</a></h4>

              
                Tau-PET receives growing interest as an imaging biomarker for the 4-repeat tauopathy progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). However, the translation of in vitro 4R-tau binding to in vivo tau-PET signals is still unclear. Therefore, we conducted a longitudinal [18F]PI-2620 PET/MRI study in a 4-repeat-tau mouse model (PS19) and found elevated [18F]PI-2620 PET signal in the presence of high neuronal tau. Cell sorting after radiotracer injection in vivo revealed higher tracer uptake in single neurons compared to astrocytes of PS19 mice. Regional [18F]PI-2620 tau-PET signals during lifetime correlated with abundance of fibrillary tau in subsequent autopsy samples of PSP patients and disease controls. In autoradiography, tau-positive neurons and oligodendrocytes with high AT8 density but not tau-positive astrocytes were the driver of [18F]PI-2620 autoradiography signals in PSP. In summary, neuronal and oligodendroglial tau constitutes the dominant source of tau-PET radiotracer binding in 4-repeat-tauopathies, yielding the capacity to translate to an in vivo signal.

">The visuomotor transformations underlying defensive behaviors and hunting</a></h4>

              
                The visual system can identify stimuli as predators or prey, and respond with appropriate behaviors. To observe the transformation of visual information into behavior, we imaged the zebrafish visual system while larvae responded to three types of visual stimuli with innate hunting, freezing, and escape behaviors. We systematically identified visually driven neurons and behaviorally correlated sensorimotor neurons, and analyzed their responses to the different stimuli and behaviors. We found that the optic tectum contains broadly tuned sensory neurons, and sensorimotor neurons that respond specifically during one behavior. We also identified sensorimotor neurons in four other areas thought to be downstream of the tectum. Our findings support a model in which neurons in the tectum receive visual information describing an object's location, and may also receive input on the object's identity and the animal's state, in order to select a single behavioral outcome, which is then relayed to downstream areas.

">Timing Matters: Lessons from Perinatal Neurogenesis in the Olfactory Bulb</a></h4>

              
                In the olfactory bulb odorant receptor specific input converges into glomeruli. Deep to the glomeruli coding of odor information is tuned by local synaptic circuits. Deciphering the dendritic organization of granule cells relative to the secondary dendrites of projection neurons is a pivotal for understanding odor processing. We carried out a detailed interrogation of the granule cells including the timing of neurogenesis, laminar distribution and synaptogenesis between granule cells and projection neurons. In brief, the granule cells develop following a outside in maturation pattern from embryogenesis to adulthood following a developmental continuum. Granule cells born one week after birth exhibit a unique sublayer specific distribution pattern, marking a transition between embryonic or neonatal and adult stages. Integration into reciprocal synaptic circuits occurred 10 days post neurogenesis, We conclude that timing of neurogenesis dictates the anatomical configuration of granule cells within the olfactory bulb, which in turn regulates a preferential synaptic integration with either mitral cell or tufted cell secondary dendrites.

">Chronic abolition of evoked vesicle release from layer 5 projection neurons disrupts the laminar distribution of parvalbumin interneurons in the adult cortex</a></h4>

              
                Establishing precisely built neuronal networks during cortical development requires appropriate proportions of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. Developmental disturbances in pyramidal neuron activity can impede the development of GABAergic neurons with long-lasting effects on inhibitory networks. However, the role of deep-layer pyramidal neurons in instructing the development and distribution of GABAergic neurons remains unknown. To unravel the role of deep-layer pyramidal neuron activity in orchestrating the spatial and laminar organisation of parvalbumin neurons, we selectively manipulated the activity of projection neurons in layer 5 of the cortex. By ablating SNAP25 from subsets of glutamatergic L5 projection neurons across the cortical mantle, we abolished Ca2+-dependent vesicle release from Rbp4-Cre+ pyramidal neurons. We explored the local (location of the cell bodies) and the global (subcortical projection sites) effects of chronically silencing cortical L5 neurons on parvalbumin interneurons. We found that the chronic cessation of vesicle release from L5 projection neurons left the density, distribution, and developmental trajectory of cortical and subcortical PV neurons intact during the second and third postnatal week; however, it resulted in the reorganisation of the laminar distribution of cortical PV neurons in layer 4 of S1 in the adult cortex. The abolition of evoked vesicle release from L5 also affected the perineuronal nets in the adult motor cortex and revealed a significant decrease in the density of VVA+ and PV- VVA+ cells in L5 of M1 at 3 months of age. The alterations in the laminar arrangement of VVA+ neurons may imply that Ca2+-dependent synaptic transmission from L5 may control PNN density in adult networks. We also discovered that the absence of L5 activity only had a transient effect on the morphology of striatal PV neurons. The correlation between PV and VVA neurons was contingent on brain regions and cortical layers, therefore the link between the perineuronal net and PV neurons is significantly more intricate than previously believed. The present study will aid our understanding of the bidirectional relationship between deep-layer pyramidal cells and GABAergic neurons while uncovering the long-term effects of chronically disrupting pyramidal neurons on inhibitory networks.

">Remote automated delivery of mechanical stimuli coupled to brain recordings in behaving mice</a></h4>

              
                The canonical framework for testing pain and mechanical sensitivity in rodents is manual delivery of stimuli to the paw. However, this approach can produce variability in results, requires significant training, and is ergonomically unfavorable to the experimenter. To circumvent limitations in manual delivery of stimuli, we have created a device called the ARM (Automated Reproducible Mechano-stimulator). Built using a series of linear stages, cameras, and stimulus holders, the ARM is more accurate at hitting the desired target, delivers stimuli faster, and decreases variability in delivery of von Frey hair filaments. We demonstrate that the ARM can be combined with traditional measurements of pain behavior and automated machine-learning based pipelines. Importantly, the ARM enables remote testing of mice with experimenters outside the testing room. Using remote testing, we found that mice appeared to habituate more quickly when an experimenter was not present and experimenter presence leads to significant sex-dependent differences in withdrawal behavior. Lastly, to demonstrate the utility of the ARM for neural circuit dissection of pain mechanisms, we combined the ARM with cellular-resolved microendoscopy in the amygdala, linking stimulus, behavior, and brain activity of amygdalar neurons that encode negative pain states. Taken together, the ARM improves speed, accuracy, and robustness of mechanical pain assays and can be combined with automated pain detection systems and brain recordings to map pain sensation and affect.

">Influence of environmental and biological factors on functional connectivity of the superior temporal sulcus in neonates scanned at term age</a></h4>

              
                The superior temporal sulcus (STS), one of the first sulci visible during brain development, is a key region for human communication, notably hosting linguistic functions in the left hemisphere. Fetuses and premature newborns already process external sound, but the auditory environment is vastly different in-utero and ex-utero. Does this have an impact on the development of the auditory and linguistic networks? To answer this question, we studied the functional connectivity of regions bordering the STS, delimited in each individual including full-term and preterm male and female neonates born at different gestational ages but all scanned at term. We found that in addition to the expected contralateral connectivity, various STS parts were more strongly connected to specific distant regions, revealing the typical auditory/linguistic division across the two banks of the STS reported in adults. Furthermore, the right posterior STS was more connected to the contralateral hemisphere than the left. Finally, sex and premature birth had effects on both STS volume and connectivity. Female neonates displayed a lesser left-right asymmetry in STS depth, and heightened connectivity from the left posterior STS compared to males. Most importantly, despite equivalent scan age, full-term newborns had deeper sulci compared with preterms, and local connectivity in the right temporal region increased linearly with gestation length. These results emphasize the impact of both sex and early auditory environment on the setting up of the cerebral networks that might contribute to explain the milder impact of premature birth on language in females.

                Immature animals have the ability to interact with their environment, indicating that complex neural circuits are formed through mechanisms of self-organization. Correlated spontaneous activity among neurons suggests a universal principle behind the self-organization of complex neural circuits1,2, though the underlying mechanisms and functional roles in the central nervous system remain unclear. Here, we show that oligodendrocyte-dependent synchronized spontaneous activity during the critical period is indispensable for neural circuit refinement and brain functionalization. We found that oligodendrocyte deletion during specific time window disrupts Purkinje cell activity synchrony and synapse elimination in the mouse cerebellum. We further demonstrated that synchronized spontaneous activity is a prerequisite for synapse elimination. Behavioral analyses linked these developmental disruptions to adult cerebellar function, manifesting as anxiety-like behavior, reduced social interaction, and compromised motor coordination in adult mice. This association indicates the significance of following the appropriate developmental trajectory to ensure the integrity of brain function, suggesting that oligodendrocytes during development are vital organizers of brain functionalization. Our findings highlight the crucial role of oligodendrocytes in orchestrating synapse elimination and optimizing brain function through the mediation of synchronized activity during specific developmental stages.

">Singular Odorant Receptor Expression Orchestrated by Promoter Activation Specificity in Apis Mellifera Olfactory Sensory Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Honeybee, positioned as an outgroup of flies and mosquitos, have exhibited intriguing duplications and expansions of OR genes in genomic studies. However, little is known about how the OR genes are expressed and regulated in honeybee olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). In this study, we utilized a single-cell multi-omics approach to profile the transcriptome and chromatin accessibility in Apis mellifera antennal nuclei, aiming to elucidate OR gene expression and its underlying regulatory mechanisms. Our systematical analysis unveiled a similar singular expression pattern of ligand-specific receptors in Apis mellifera OSNs, parallel with those observed in Drosophila melanogaster. Mechanistically, we discovered that promoter activation of OR genes orchestrates receptor expression patterns. For instance, although multiple adjacent OR genes are co-expressed with a single active promoter through polycistronic transcription, only the first OR gene could produce functional receptor protein, as supported by transcriptome quantification in OSNs. Additionally, we found that co-expression of receptor proteins might occur only when co-expressed OR genes possess multiple accessible promoters. This scenario is less common than expected, considering the number and evolutionary age of OR genes in Apis mellifera, suggesting a selection favoring the specialization of rapidly expanded OR genes in Apis mellifera. Overall, our study provides significant insights into the insect olfaction system and the regulatory mechanisms of OR genes expression.

">PrediRep: Modelling hierarchical predictive coding with an unsupervised deep learning network</a></h4>

              
                Hierarchical predictive coding (hPC) proposes that the cortex continuously generates predictions of incoming sensory stimuli. Deep neural networks inspired by hPC are frequently used to probe the neurocomputational mechanisms suggested by the theory in silico and to generate hypotheses for experimental investigations. However, these networks often deviate from hPC by prioritizing computational efficiency over alignment with its principles. To remedy this, we introduce PrediRep, a deep learning model explicitly designed to emphasize alignment with the theory. PrediRep incorporates the principles of hPC found in the other networks, while avoiding their deviations from it. We evaluate the performance of PrediRep on a next-frame prediction task and its functional alignment with hPC, comparing it to other contemporary deep learning networks inspired by the theory. Our findings demonstrate that PrediRep achieves the closest functional alignment with hierarchical predictive coding without sacrificing computational performance.

">Helping behavior is associated with increased affiliative behavior, activation of the prosocial brain network and elevated oxytocin receptor expression in the nucleus accumbens</a></h4>

              
                A prosocial response to others in distress is increasingly recognized as a natural behavior for many social species, from humans to rodents. While prosocial behavior is more frequently observed towards familiar conspecifics, even within the same social context some individuals are more prone to help than others. For instance, in a rat helping behavior test, rats can release a distressed conspecific trapped inside a restrainer by opening the restrainer door. Typically, rats are motivated to release a trapped cagemate, and consistently release the trapped rat ('openers'), yet around 30% do not open the restrainer ('non-openers'). To characterize the difference between these populations, behavioral and neural activity were compared between opener and non-opener rats tested with a trapped cagemate in the helping test. Behaviorally, openers showed significantly more social affiliative behavior both before and after door-opening compared to non-openers. Analysis of brain-wide neural activity based on the immediate early gene c-Fos revealed increased activity in openers in the previously identified prosocial neural network compared to non-openers. The network includes regions associated with empathy in humans (somatosensory cortex, insula, cingulate cortex and frontal cortex), and motivation and reward regions such as the nucleus accumbens. Oxytocin receptor mRNA expression levels were higher in the accumbens but not the anterior insula. Several transcription control pathways were also significantly upregulated in openers' accumbens. These findings indicate that prosocial behavior may be predicted by affiliative behavior and activity in the prosocial neural network and provide targets for the investigation of causal mechanisms underlying prosocial behavior.

">Episodic memory supports the acquisition of structured task representations</a></h4>

              
                Generalization to new tasks requires learning of task representations that accurately reflect the similarity structure of the task space. Here, we argue that episodic memory (EM) plays an essential role in this process by stabilizing task representations, thereby supporting the accumulation of structured knowledge. We demonstrate this using a neural network model that infers task representations that minimize the current task's objective function; crucially, the model can retrieve previously encoded task representations from EM and use these to initialize the task inference process. With EM, the model succeeds in learning the underlying task structure; without EM, task representations drift and the network fails to learn the structure. We further show that EM errors can support structure learning by promoting the activation of similar task representations in tasks with similar sensory inputs. Overall, this model provides a novel account of how EM supports the acquisition of structured task representations.

	<p>Differences in sensorimotor integration mechanisms have been observed between people who stutter (PWS) and controls who do not. Delayed auditory feedback (DAF) introduces timing discrepancies between perception and action, disrupting sequence production in verbal and non-verbal domains. While DAF consistently enhances speech fluency in PWS, its impact on non-verbal sensorimotor synchronization abilities remains unexplored. A total of 11 PWS and 13 matched controls completed five tasks: (1) unpaced tapping; (2) synchronization-continuation task (SCT) without auditory feedback; (3) SCT with DAF, with instruction either to align the sound in time with the metronome; or (4) to ignore the sound and align their physical tap to the metronome. Additionally, we measured participants&amp;amp;rsquo; sensitivity to detecting delayed feedback using a (5) delay discrimination task. Results showed that DAF significantly affected performance in controls as a function of delay duration, despite being irrelevant to the task. Conversely, PWS performance remained stable across delays. When auditory feedback was absent, no differences were found between PWS and controls. Moreover, PWS were less able to detect delays in speech and tapping tasks. These findings show subtle differences in non-verbal sensorimotor performance between PWS and controls, specifically when action&amp;amp;ndash;perception loops are disrupted by delays, contributing to models of sensorimotor integration in stuttering.</p>

	<p>Plastic production, which exceeds one million tons per year, is of global concern. The constituent low-density polymers enable spread over large distances and micro/nano particles (MNPLs) induce organ toxicity via digestion, inhalation, and skin contact. Particles have been documented in all human tissues including breast milk. MNPLs, especially weathered particles, can breach the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier, inducing neurotoxicity. This has been documented in non-human species, and in human-induced pluripotent stem cell lines. Within the brain, MNPLs initiate an inflammatory response with pro-inflammatory cytokine production, oxidative stress with generation of reactive oxygen species, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Glutamate and GABA neurotransmitter dysfunction also ensues with alteration of excitatory/inhibitory balance in favor of reduced inhibition and resultant neuro-excitation. Inflammation and cortical hyperexcitability are key abnormalities involved in the pathogenic cascade of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and are intricately related to the mislocalization and aggregation of TDP-43, a hallmark of ALS. Water and many foods contain MNPLs and in humans, ingestion is the main form of exposure. Digestion of plastics within the gut can alter their properties, rendering them more toxic, and they cause gut microbiome dysbiosis and a dysfunctional gut&amp;amp;ndash;brain axis. This is recognized as a trigger and/or aggravating factor for ALS. ALS is associated with a long (years or decades) preclinical period and neonates and infants are exposed to MNPLs through breast milk, milk substitutes, and toys. This endangers a time of intense neurogenesis and establishment of neuronal circuitry, setting the stage for development of neurodegeneration in later life. MNPL neurotoxicity should be considered as a yet unrecognized risk factor for ALS and related diseases.</p>

	<p>Virtual reality (VR) enables the development of virtual training frameworks suitable for various domains, especially when real-world conditions may be hazardous or impossible to replicate because of unique additional resources (e.g., equipment, infrastructure, people, locations). Although VR technology has significantly advanced in recent years, methods for evaluating immersion (i.e., the extent to which the user is engaged with the sensory information from the virtual environment or is invested in the intended task) continue to rely on self-reported questionnaires, which are often administered after using the virtual scenario. Having an objective method to measure immersion is particularly important when using VR for training, education, and applications that promote the development, fine-tuning, or maintenance of skills. The level of immersion may impact performance and the translation of knowledge and skills to the real-world. This is particularly important in tasks where motor skills are combined with complex decision making, such as surgical procedures. Efforts to better measure immersion have included the use of physiological measurements including heart rate and skin response, but so far they do not offer robust metrics that provide the sensitivity to discriminate different states (idle, easy, and hard), which is critical when using VR for training to determine how successful the training is in engaging the user&amp;amp;rsquo;s senses and challenging their cognitive capabilities. In this study, electroencephalography (EEG) data were collected from 14 participants who completed VR jigsaw puzzles with two different levels of task difficulty. Machine learning was able to accurately classify the EEG data collected during three different states, obtaining accuracy rates of 86% and 97% for differentiating easy versus hard difficulty states and baseline vs. VR states. Building on these results may enable the identification of robust biomarkers of immersion in VR, enabling real-time recognition of the level of immersion that can be used to design more effective and translative VR-based training. This method has the potential to adjust aspects of VR related to task difficulty to ensure that participants are immersed in VR.</p>

	<p>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neuro-developmental disorder that affects approximately 5&amp;amp;ndash;10% of school-aged children worldwide. Early diagnosis and intervention are essential to improve the quality of life of patients and their families. In this study, we propose ConvMixer-ECA, a novel deep learning architecture that combines ConvMixer with efficient channel attention (ECA) blocks for the accurate diagnosis of ADHD using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The model was trained and evaluated using EEG recordings from 60 healthy children and 61 children with ADHD. A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the ConvMixer-ECA. The results showed that the ConvMixer-ECA performed well in ADHD recognition with 94.52% accuracy. The incorporation of attentional mechanisms, in particular ECA, improved the performance of ConvMixer; it outperformed other attention-based variants. In addition, ConvMixer-ECA outperformed state-of-the-art deep learning models including EEGNet, CNN, RNN, LSTM, and GRU. t-SNE visualization of the output of this model layer validated the effectiveness of ConvMixer-ECA in capturing the underlying patterns and features that separate ADHD from typically developing individuals through hierarchical feature learning. These outcomes demonstrate the potential of ConvMixer-ECA as a valuable tool to assist clinicians in the early diagnosis and intervention of ADHD in children.</p>

	<p>We present a novel set of quantitative measures for &amp;amp;ldquo;likeness&amp;amp;rdquo; (error function) designed to alleviate the time-consuming and subjective nature of manually comparing biological recordings from electrophysiological experiments with the outcomes of their mathematical models. Our innovative &amp;amp;ldquo;blended&amp;amp;rdquo; system approach offers an objective, high-throughput, and computationally efficient method for comparing biological and mathematical models. This approach involves using voltage recordings of biological neurons to drive and train mathematical models, facilitating the derivation of the error function for further parameter optimization. Our calibration process incorporates measurements such as action potential (AP) frequency, voltage moving average, voltage envelopes, and the probability of post-synaptic channels. To assess the effectiveness of our method, we utilized the sea slug Melibe leonina swim central pattern generator (CPG) as our model circuit and conducted electrophysiological experiments with TTX to isolate CPG interneurons. During the comparison of biological recordings and mathematically simulated neurons, we performed a grid search of inhibitory and excitatory synapse conductance. Our findings indicate that a weighted sum of simple functions is essential for comprehensively capturing a neuron&amp;amp;rsquo;s rhythmic activity. Overall, our study suggests that our blended system approach holds promise for enabling objective and high-throughput comparisons between biological and mathematical models, offering significant potential for advancing research in neural circuitry and related fields.</p>

	<p>B355252 is a small molecular compound known for potentiating neural growth factor and protecting against neuronal cell death induced by glutamate in vitro and cerebral ischemia in vivo. However, its other biological functions remain unclear. This study aims to investigate whether B355252 suppresses neuroinflammatory responses and cell death in the brain. C57BL/6j mice were intraperitoneally injected with a single dosage of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 mg/kg) to induce inflammation. B355252 (1 mg/kg) intervention was started two days prior to the LPS injection. The animal behavioral changes were assessed pre- and post-LPS injections. The animal brains were harvested at 4 and 24 h post-LPS injection, and histological, biochemical, and cytokine array outcomes were examined. Results showed that B355252 improved LPS-induced behavioral deterioration, mitigated brain tissue damage, and suppressed the activation of microglial and astrocytes. Furthermore, B355252 reduced the protein levels of key pyroptotic markers TLR4, NLRP3, and caspase-1 and inhibited the LPS-induced increases in IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, IL-18, and cytokines. In conclusion, B355252 demonstrates a potent anti-neuroinflammatory effect in vivo, suggesting that its potential therapeutic value warrants further investigation.</p>

	<p>The examination of connected speech may serve as a valuable tool for exploring speech output in both healthy speakers and individuals with language disorders. Numerous studies incorporate various fluency and silence measures into their analyses to investigate speech output patterns in different populations, along with the underlying cognitive processes that occur while speaking. However, methodological inconsistencies across existing studies pose challenges in comparing their results. In the current study, we introduce CSAP (Connected Speech Analysis Protocol), which is a specific methodological approach to investigate fluency metrics, such as articulation rate and speech rate, as well as silence measures, including silent pauses&amp;amp;rsquo; frequency and duration. We emphasize the importance of employing a comprehensive set of measures within a specific methodological framework to better understand speech output patterns. Additionally, we advocate for the use of distinct narrative tasks for a thorough investigation of speech output in different conditions. We provide an example of data on which we implement CSAP to showcase the proposed pipeline. In conclusion, CSAP offers a comprehensive framework for investigating speech output patterns, incorporating fluency metrics and silence measures in distinct narrative tasks, thus allowing a detailed quantification of connected speech in both healthy and clinical populations. We emphasize the significance of adopting a unified methodological approach in connected speech studies, enabling the integration of results for more robust and generalizable conclusions.</p>

	<p>Testing of ChatGPT has recently been performed over a diverse range of topics. However, most of these assessments have been based on broad domains of knowledge. Here, we test ChatGPT&amp;amp;rsquo;s knowledge of tinnitus, an important but specialized aspect of audiology and otolaryngology. Testing involved evaluating ChatGPT&amp;amp;rsquo;s answers to a defined set of 10 questions on tinnitus. Furthermore, given the technology is advancing quickly, we re-evaluated the responses to the same 10 questions 3 and 6 months later. The accuracy of the responses was rated by 6 experts (the authors) using a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5. Most of ChatGPT&amp;amp;rsquo;s responses were rated as satisfactory or better. However, we did detect a few instances where the responses were not accurate and might be considered somewhat misleading. Over the first 3 months, the ratings generally improved, but there was no more significant improvement at 6 months. In our judgment, ChatGPT provided unexpectedly good responses, given that the questions were quite specific. Although no potentially harmful errors were identified, some mistakes could be seen as somewhat misleading. ChatGPT shows great potential if further developed by experts in specific areas, but for now, it is not yet ready for serious application.</p>

	<p>Orexin/hypocretin terminals innervate the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), which projects to motor control areas important for spontaneous physical activity (SPA) and energy expenditure (EE). Orexin receptors are expressed in the DRN, and obesity-resistant (OR) rats show higher expression of these receptors in the DRN and elevated SPA/EE. We hypothesized that orexin-A in the DRN enhances SPA/EE and that DRN-GABA modulates the effect of orexin-A on SPA/EE. We manipulated orexin tone in the DRN either through direct injection of orexin-A or through the chemogenetic activation of lateral-hypothalamic (LH) orexin neurons. In the orexin neuron activation experiment, fifteen minutes prior to the chemogenetic activation of orexin neurons, the mice received either the GABA-agonist muscimol or antagonist bicuculline injected into the DRN, and SPA/EE was monitored for 24 h. In a separate experiment, orexin-A was injected into the DRN to study the direct effect of DRN orexin on SPA/EE. We found that the activation of orexin neurons elevates SPA/EE, and manipulation of GABA in the DRN does not alter the SPA response to orexin neuron activation. Similarly, intra-DRN orexin-A enhanced SPA and EE in the mice. These results suggest that orexin-A in the DRN facilitates negative energy balance by increasing physical activity-induced EE, and that modulation of DRN orexin-A is a potential strategy to promote SPA and EE.</p>

                <p>Sleep spindles appear to play an important role in learning new motor skills. Motor skill learning engages several brain regions with two important areas being the motor cortex (M1) and the cerebellum (CB). However, the neurophysiological processes in these areas during sleep, especially how spindle oscillations affect local and cross-region spiking, are not fully understood. We recorded an activity from the M1 and cerebellar cortex in eight rats during spontaneous activity to investigate how sleep spindles in these regions are related to local spiking as well as cross-region spiking. We found that M1 firing was significantly changed during both M1 and CB spindles, and this spiking occurred at a preferred phase of the spindle. On average, M1 and CB neurons showed most spiking at the M1 or CB spindle peaks. These neurons also developed a preferential phase locking to local or cross-area spindles with the greatest phase-locking value at spindle peaks; however, this preferential phase locking was not significant for cerebellar neurons when compared with CB spindles. Additionally, we found that the percentage of task-modulated cells in the M1 and CB that fired with nonuniform spike phase distribution during M1/CB spindle peaks were greater in the rats that learned a reach-to-grasp motor task robustly. Finally, we found that spindle band LFP coherence (for M1 and CB LFPs) showed a positive correlation with success rate in the motor task. These findings support the idea that sleep spindles in both the M1 and CB recruit neurons that participate in the awake task to support motor memory consolidation.</p>

                <p>Resting-state networks (RSNs) are increasingly forwarded as candidate biomarkers for neuropsychiatric disorders. Such biomarkers may provide objective measures for evaluating novel therapeutic interventions in nonhuman primates often used in translational neuroimaging research. This study aimed to characterize the RSNs of awake squirrel monkeys and compare the characteristics of those networks in adolescent and adult subjects. Twenty-seven squirrel monkeys [<I>n </I>= 12 adolescents (6 male/6 female) ~2.5&nbsp;years and <I>n </I>= 15 adults (7 male/8 female) ~9.5&nbsp;years] were gradually acclimated to awake scanning procedures; whole-brain fMRI images were acquired with a 9.4&nbsp;T scanner. Group-level independent component analysis (ICA; 30 ICs) with dual regression was used to detect and compare RSNs. Twenty ICs corresponding to physiologically meaningful networks representing a range of neural functions, including motor, sensory, reward, and cognitive processes, were identified in both adolescent and adult monkeys. The reproducibility of these RSNs was evaluated across several ICA model orders. Adults showed a trend for greater connectivity compared with adolescent subjects in two of the networks of interest: (1) in the right occipital region with the OFC network and (2) in the left temporal cortex, bilateral occipital cortex, and cerebellum with the posterior cingulate network. However, when age was entered into the above model, this trend for significance was lost. These results demonstrate that squirrel monkey RSNs are stable and consistent with RSNs previously identified in humans, rodents, and other nonhuman primate species. These data also identify several networks in adolescence that are conserved and others that may change into adulthood.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Brain networks mediating vestibular perception of self-motion overlap with those mediating balance. A systematic mapping of vestibular perceptual pathways in the thalamus may reveal new brain modulation targets for improving balance in neurological conditions.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Here, we systematically report how magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery of the nucleus ventralis intermedius of the thalamus commonly evokes transient patient-reported illusions of self-motion. In 46 consecutive patients, we linked the descriptions of self-motion to sonication power and 3-dimensional (3D) coordinates of sonication targets. Target coordinates were normalized using a standard atlas, and a 3D model of the nucleus ventralis intermedius and adjacent structures was created to link sonication target to the illusion.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 63% of patients reported illusions of self-motion, which were more likely with increased sonication power and with targets located more inferiorly along the rostrocaudal axis. Higher power and more inferiorly targeted sonications increased the likelihood of experiencing illusions of self-motion by 4 and 2 times, respectively (odds ratios = 4.03 for power, 2.098 for location).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The phenomenon of magnetic vestibular stimulation is the most plausible explanation for these illusions of self-motion. Temporary unilateral modulation of vestibular pathways (via magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound) unveils the central adaptation to the magnetic field-induced peripheral vestibular bias, leading to an explicable illusion of motion. Consequently, systematic mapping of vestibular perceptual pathways via magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound may reveal new intracerebral targets for improving balance in neurological conditions.

                <p>by Udaysankar Chockanathan, Krishnan Padmanabhan</p>

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is characterized by a range of behavioral alterations, including memory loss and psychiatric symptoms. While there is evidence that molecular pathologies, such as amyloid beta (Aβ), contribute to AD, it remains unclear how this histopathology gives rise to such disparate behavioral deficits. One hypothesis is that Aβ exerts differential effects on neuronal circuits across brain regions, depending on the neurophysiology and connectivity of different areas. To test this, we recorded from large neuronal populations in dorsal CA1 (dCA1) and ventral CA1 (vCA1), two hippocampal areas known to be structurally and functionally diverse, in the APP/PS1 mouse model of amyloidosis. Despite similar levels of Aβ pathology, dCA1 and vCA1 showed distinct disruptions in neuronal population activity as animals navigated a virtual reality environment. In dCA1, pairwise correlations and entropy, a measure of the diversity of activity patterns, were decreased in APP/PS1 mice relative to age-matched C57BL/6 controls. However, in vCA1, APP/PS1 mice had increased pair-wise correlations and entropy as compared to age matched controls. Finally, using maximum entropy models, we connected the microscopic features of population activity (correlations) to the macroscopic features of the population code (entropy). We found that the models’ performance increased in predicting dCA1 activity, but decreased in predicting vCA1 activity, in APP/PS1 mice relative to the controls. Taken together, we found that Aβ exerts distinct effects across different hippocampal regions, suggesting that the various behavioral deficits of AD may reflect underlying heterogeneities in neuronal circuits and the different disruptions that Aβ pathology causes in those circuits.

Chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies reveal the incredible complexity of genome organization. Maps of increasing size, depth, and resolution are now used to probe genome architecture across cell states, types, and organisms. Larger datasets add challenges at each step of computational analysis, from storage and memory constraints to researchers’ time; however, analysis tools that meet these increased resource demands have not kept pace. Furthermore, existing tools offer limited support for customizing analysis for specific use cases or new biology. Here we introduce <i>cooltools</i> (https://github.com/open2c/cooltools), a suite of computational tools that enables flexible, scalable, and reproducible analysis of high-resolution contact frequency data. <i>Cooltools</i> leverages the widely-adopted cooler format which handles storage and access for high-resolution datasets. <i>Cooltools</i> provides a paired command line interface (CLI) and Python application programming interface (API), which respectively facilitate workflows on high-performance computing clusters and in interactive analysis environments. In short, <i>cooltools</i> enables the effective use of the latest and largest genome folding datasets.

A challenging goal of neural coding is to characterize the neural representations underlying visual perception. To this end, multi-unit activity (MUA) of macaque visual cortex was recorded in a passive fixation task upon presentation of faces and natural images. We analyzed the relationship between MUA and latent representations of state-of-the-art deep generative models, including the conventional and feature-disentangled representations of generative adversarial networks (GANs) (i.e., <i>z</i>- and <i>w</i>-latents of StyleGAN, respectively) and language-contrastive representations of latent diffusion networks (i.e., CLIP-latents of Stable Diffusion). A mass univariate neural encoding analysis of the latent representations showed that feature-disentangled <i>w</i> representations outperform both <i>z</i> and CLIP representations in explaining neural responses. Further, <i>w</i>-latent features were found to be positioned at the higher end of the complexity gradient which indicates that they capture visual information relevant to high-level neural activity. Subsequently, a multivariate neural decoding analysis of the feature-disentangled representations resulted in state-of-the-art spatiotemporal reconstructions of visual perception. Taken together, our results not only highlight the important role of feature-disentanglement in shaping high-level neural representations underlying visual perception but also serve as an important benchmark for the future of neural coding.

                <p>by Benjamin Antin, Masato Sadahiro, Marta Gajowa, Marcus A. Triplett, Hillel Adesnik, Liam Paninski</p>

Monosynaptic connectivity mapping is crucial for building circuit-level models of neural computation. Two-photon optogenetic stimulation, when combined with whole-cell recording, enables large-scale mapping of physiological circuit parameters. In this experimental setup, recorded postsynaptic currents are used to infer the presence and strength of connections. For many cell types, nearby connections are those we expect to be strongest. However, when the postsynaptic cell expresses opsin, optical excitation of nearby cells can induce direct photocurrents in the postsynaptic cell. These photocurrent artifacts contaminate synaptic currents, making it difficult or impossible to probe connectivity for nearby cells. To overcome this problem, we developed a computational tool, Photocurrent Removal with Constraints (PhoRC). Our method is based on a constrained matrix factorization model which leverages the fact that photocurrent kinetics are less variable than those of synaptic currents. We demonstrate on real and simulated data that PhoRC consistently removes photocurrents while preserving synaptic currents, despite variations in photocurrent kinetics across datasets. Our method allows the discovery of synaptic connections which would have been otherwise obscured by photocurrent artifacts, and may thus reveal a more complete picture of synaptic connectivity. PhoRC runs faster than real time and is available as open source software.

                <p>by Yves Dumont, Clélia F. Oliva</p>

The sterile insect technique (SIT) can be an efficient solution for reducing or eliminating certain insect pest populations. It is widely used in agriculture against fruit flies, including the Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly), <i>Ceratitis capitata</i>. The re-mating tendency of medfly females and the fact that the released sterile males may have some residual fertility could be a challenge for the successful implementation of the SIT. Obtaining the right balance between sterility level and sterile male quality (competitiveness, longevity, etc) is the key to a cost-efficient program. Since field experimental approaches can be impacted by many environmental variables, it is difficult to get a clear understanding on how specific parameters, alone or in combination, may affect the SIT efficiency. The use of models not only helps to gather knowledge, but it allows the simulation of a wide range of scenarios and can be easily adapted to local populations and sterile male production.
In this study, we consider single- and double-mated females. We first show that SIT can be successful only if the residual fertility is less than a threshold value that depends on the basic offspring number of the targeted pest population, the re-mating rates, and the parameters of double-mated females. Then, we show how the sterile male release rate is affected by the parameters of double-mated females and the male residual fertility. Different scenarios are explored with continuous and periodic sterile male releases, with and without ginger aromatherapy, which is known to enhance sterile male competitiveness, and also taking into account some biological parameters related to females that have been mated twice, either first by a wild (sterile) male and then a sterile (wild) male, or by two wild males only. Parameter values were chosen for peach as host fruit to reflect what could be expected in the Corsican context, where SIT against the medfly is under consideration.
Our results suggest that ginger aromatherapy can be a decisive factor determining the success of SIT against medfly. We also emphasize the importance of estimating the duration of the refractory period between matings depending on whether a wild female has mated with a wild or sterile male. Further, we show the importance of parameters, like the (hatched) eggs deposit rate and the death-rate related to all fertile double-mated females. In general, re-mating is considered to be detrimental to SIT programs. However, our results show that, depending on the parameter values of double-mated females, re-mating may also be beneficial for SIT.
Our model can be easily adapted to different contexts and species, for a broader understanding of release strategies and management options.

                <p>by Héctor M. Sánchez C., David L. Smith, John M. Marshall</p>

Genetic surveillance of mosquito populations is becoming increasingly relevant as genetics-based mosquito control strategies advance from laboratory to field testing. Especially applicable are mosquito gene drive projects, the potential scale of which leads monitoring to be a significant cost driver. For these projects, monitoring will be required to detect unintended spread of gene drive mosquitoes beyond field sites, and the emergence of alternative alleles, such as drive-resistant alleles or non-functional effector genes, within intervention sites. This entails the need to distribute mosquito traps efficiently such that an allele of interest is detected as quickly as possible—ideally when remediation is still viable. Additionally, insecticide-based tools such as bednets are compromised by insecticide-resistance alleles for which there is also a need to detect as quickly as possible. To this end, we present MGSurvE (Mosquito Gene SurveillancE): a computational framework that optimizes trap placement for genetic surveillance of mosquito populations such that the time to detection of an allele of interest is minimized. A key strength of MGSurvE is that it allows important biological features of mosquitoes and the landscapes they inhabit to be accounted for, namely: i) resources required by mosquitoes (e.g., food sources and aquatic breeding sites) can be explicitly distributed through a landscape, ii) movement of mosquitoes may depend on their sex, the current state of their gonotrophic cycle (if female) and resource attractiveness, and iii) traps may differ in their attractiveness profile. Example MGSurvE analyses are presented to demonstrate optimal trap placement for: i) an <i>Aedes aegypti</i> population in a suburban landscape in Queensland, Australia, and ii) an <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> population on the island of São Tomé, São Tomé and Príncipe. Further documentation and use examples are provided in project’s documentation. MGSurvE is intended as a resource for both field and computational researchers interested in mosquito gene surveillance.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, forecasting COVID-19 trends to support planning and response was a priority for scientists and decision makers alike. In the United States, COVID-19 forecasting was coordinated by a large group of universities, companies, and government entities led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US COVID-19 Forecast Hub (https://covid19forecasthub.org). We evaluated approximately 9.7 million forecasts of weekly state-level COVID-19 cases for predictions 1–4 weeks into the future submitted by 24 teams from August 2020 to December 2021. We assessed coverage of central prediction intervals and weighted interval scores (WIS), adjusting for missing forecasts relative to a baseline forecast, and used a Gaussian generalized estimating equation (GEE) model to evaluate differences in skill across epidemic phases that were defined by the effective reproduction number. Overall, we found high variation in skill across individual models, with ensemble-based forecasts outperforming other approaches. Forecast skill relative to the baseline was generally higher for larger jurisdictions (e.g., states compared to counties). Over time, forecasts generally performed worst in periods of rapid changes in reported cases (either in increasing or decreasing epidemic phases) with 95% prediction interval coverage dropping below 50% during the growth phases of the winter 2020, Delta, and Omicron waves. Ideally, case forecasts could serve as a leading indicator of changes in transmission dynamics. However, while most COVID-19 case forecasts outperformed a naïve baseline model, even the most accurate case forecasts were unreliable in key phases. Further research could improve forecasts of leading indicators, like COVID-19 cases, by leveraging additional real-time data, addressing performance across phases, improving the characterization of forecast confidence, and ensuring that forecasts were coherent across spatial scales. In the meantime, it is critical for forecast users to appreciate current limitations and use a broad set of indicators to inform pandemic-related decision making.

     alt="IDO-1 inhibition improves outcome after fluid percussion injury in adult male rats"/>
<p>Pharmacological IDO1 inhibition was administered following the fluid percussion injury model of traumatic brain injury in young adult male rats. IDO1 inhibition prevented the increase in kynurenine pathway activity that was seen in the brain of the vehicle-treated group at 3 days postinjury, as demonstrated by the ratio of kynurenine to tryptophan (A). IDO1 inhibition also resulted in improved outcomes in spatial memory tasks, with treated rats spending more time in the target quadrant of the Barnes maze compared to vehicle controls at 28 days postinjury (B). In addition, IDO1 inhibition resulted in less anxiety-like behaviors, with rats spending a larger percentage of time in the inner field of the open field test compared to vehicle controls at 25 days postinjury (C). These results suggest increased KP activity after FPI may mediate neurological dysfunction, and IDO1 inhibition should be further investigated as a potential therapeutic target to improve recovery.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The enzyme indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the kynurenine pathway (KP) which produces both neuroprotective and neurotoxic metabolites. Neuroinflammatory signals produced as a result of pathological conditions can increase production of IDO1 and boost its enzymatic capacity. IDO1 and the KP have been implicated in behavioral recovery after human traumatic brain injury (TBI), but their roles in experimental models of TBI are for the most part unknown. We hypothesized there is an increase in KP activity in the fluid percussion injury (FPI) model of TBI, and that administration of an IDO1 inhibitor will improve neurological recovery. In this study, adult male Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to FPI or sham injury and received twice-daily oral administration of the IDO1 inhibitor PF-06840003 (100 mg/kg) or vehicle control. FPI resulted in a significant increase in KP activity, as demonstrated by an increased ratio of kynurenine: tryptophan, in the perilesional neocortex and ipsilateral hippocampus 3 days postinjury (DPI), which normalized by 7 DPI. The increase in KP activity was prevented by PF-06840003. IDO1 inhibition also improved memory performance as assessed in the Barnes maze and anxiety behaviors as assessed in open field testing in the first 28 DPI. These results suggest increased KP activity after FPI may mediate neurological dysfunction, and IDO1 inhibition should be further investigated as a potential therapeutic target to improve recovery.</p>

">Psilocybin facilitates fear extinction: importance of dose, context, and serotonin receptors</a></h4>

              
                A variety of classic psychedelics and MDMA have been shown to enhance fear extinction in rodent models. This has translational significance because a standard treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prolonged exposure therapy. However, few studies have investigated psilocybin's potential effect in fear learning paradigms. More specifically, the extents to which dose, timing of administration, and serotonin receptors may influence psilocybin's effect on fear extinction are not understood. In this study, we used a delay fear conditioning paradigm to determine the effects of psilocybin on fear extinction, extinction retention, and fear renewal in male and female mice. Psilocybin robustly enhances fear extinction when given acutely prior to testing for all doses tested. Psilocybin also exerts long-term effects to elevate extinction retention and suppress fear renewal in a novel context, though these changes were sensitive to dose. Administration of psilocybin prior to fear learning or immediately after extinction yielded no change in behavior, indicating that concurrent extinction experience is necessary for the drug's effects. Co-treatment with a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist blocked psilocybin's effects for extinction, extinction retention and fear renewal, whereas 5-HT1A receptor antagonism attenuated only the effect on fear renewal. Collectively, these results highlight dose, context, and serotonin receptors as crucial factors in psilocybin's ability to facilitate fear extinction. The study provides preclinical evidence to support investigating psilocybin as a pharmacological adjunct for extinction-based therapy for PTSD.

">RealtimeDecoder: A fast software module for online clusterless decoding</a></h4>

              
                Decoding algorithms provide a powerful tool for understanding the firing patterns that underlie cognitive processes such as motor control, learning, and recall. When implemented in the context of a real-time system, decoders also make it possible to deliver feedback based on the representational content of ongoing neural activity. That in turn allows experimenters to test hypotheses about the role of that content in driving downstream activity patterns and behaviors. While multiple real-time systems have been developed, they are typically implemented in C++ and are locked to a specific data acquisition system, making them difficult to adapt to new experiments.Here we present a Python software system that implements online clusterless decoding using state space models in a manner independent of data acquisition systems. The parallelized system processes neural data with temporal resolution of 6 ms and median computational latency <50 ms for medium- to large-scale (32+ tetrodes) rodent hippocampus recordings without the need for spike sorting. It also executes auxiliary functions such as detecting sharp wave ripples from local field potential (LFP) data. Performance is similar to state-of-the-art solutions which use compiled programming languages. We demonstrate this system use in a rat behavior experiment in which the decoder allowed closed loop neurofeedback based on decoded hippocampal spatial representations . This system provides a powerful and easy-to-modify tool for real-time feedback experiments.

">Daily glucocorticoids promote glioblastoma growth and circadian synchrony to the host</a></h4>

              
                Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor in adults with a poor prognosis despite aggressive therapy. A recent, retrospective clinical study found that administering Temozolomide in the morning increased patient overall survival by 6 months compared to evening. Here, we tested the hypothesis that daily host signaling regulates tumor growth and synchronizes circadian rhythms in GBM. We found daily Dexamethasone promoted or suppressed GBM growth depending on time of day of administration and on the clock gene, Bmal1. Blocking circadian signals, like VIP or glucocorticoids, dramatically slowed GBM growth and disease progression. Finally, mouse and human GBM models have intrinsic circadian rhythms in clock gene expression in vitro and in vivo that entrain to the host through glucocorticoid signaling, regardless of tumor type or host immune status. We conclude that GBM entrains to the circadian circuit of the brain, which modulates its growth through clock-controlled cues, like glucocorticoids.

">Novel clock neuron subtypes regulate temporal aspects of sleep</a></h4>

              
                Circadian neurons within animal brains orchestrate myriad physiological processes and behaviors, But the contribution of these neurons to the regulation of sleep is not well understood. To address this deficiency, we leveraged single cell RNA sequencing to generate a new and now comprehensive census of transcriptomic cell types of Drosophila clock neurons. We focused principally on the enigmatic DN3s, which constitute about half of the 75 pairs of clock neurons in the fly brain and were previously almost completely uncharacterized. These DN3s are organized into 12 clusters with unusual gene expression features compared to the more well-studied clock neurons. We further show that different DN3 subtypes with distinct projection patterns promote sleep at specific times of the day through a common G protein coupled receptor, TrissinR. Our findings indicate an intricate regulation of sleep behavior by clock neurons and highlight their remarkable diversity in gene expression, projection patterns and functional properties.

">DeepLeMiN: Deep-learning-empowered Physics-aware Lensless Miniscope</a></h4>

              
                Mask-based lensless fluorescence microscopy is a compact, portable imaging technique promising for biomedical research. It forms images through a thin optical mask near the camera without bulky optics, enabling snapshot three-dimensional imaging and a scalable field of view (FOV) without increasing device thickness. Lensless microscopy relies on computational algorithms to solve the inverse problem of object reconstruction. However, there has been a lack of efficient reconstruction algorithms for large-scale data. Furthermore, the entire FOV is typically reconstructed as a whole, which demands substantial computational resources and limits the scalability of the FOV. Here, we developed DeepLeMiN, a lensless microscope with a custom designed optical mask and a multi-stage physics-informed deep learning model. This not only enables the reconstruction of localized FOVs, but also significantly reduces the computational resource demands and facilitates real-time reconstruction. Our deep learning algorithm can reconstruct object volumes over 4x6x0.6 mm3, achieving lateral and axial resolution of ~10 m and ~50 m respectively. We demonstrated significant improvement in both reconstruction quality and speed compared to traditional methods, across various fluorescent samples with dense structures. Notably, we achieved high-quality reconstruction of 3D motion of hydra and the neuronal activity with cellular resolution in awake mouse cortex. DeepLeMiN holds great promise for scalable, large FOV, real-time, 3D imaging applications with compact device footprint.

">A Deep Learning-Based Segmentation of Cells and Analysis (DL-SCAN)</a></h4>

              
                With the recent surge in the development of highly selective probes, fluorescence microscopy has become one of the most widely used approaches to study cellular properties and signaling in living cells and tissues. Traditionally, microscopy image analysis heavily relies on manufacturer-supplied software, which often demands extensive training and lacks automation capabilities for handling diverse datasets. A critical challenge arises, if fluorophores employed exhibit low brightness and low Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR). As a consequence, manual intervention may become a necessity, introducing variability in the analysis outcomes even for identical samples when analyzed by different users. This leads to the incorporation of blinded analysis which ensures that the outcome is free from user bias to a certain extent but is extremely time-consuming. To overcome these issues, we have developed a tool called DL-SCAN that automatically segments and analyzes fluorophore-stained regions of interest such as cell bodies in fluorescence microscopy images using a Deep Learning algorithm called Stardist. We demonstrate its ability to automate cell identification and study cellular ion dynamics using synthetic image stacks with varying SNR. This is followed by its application to experimental Na+ and Ca2+ imaging data from neurons and astrocytes in mouse brain tissue slices exposed to transient chemical ischemia. The results from DL-SCAN are consistent, reproducible, and free from user bias, allowing efficient and rapid analysis of experimental data in an objective manner. The open-source nature of the tool also provides room for modification and extension to analyze other forms of microscopy images specific to the dynamics of different ions in other cell types.

	<p>This study assessed suicidal risk in patients suffering from non-psychotic depressive disorders within various clinical and nosological forms (F31&amp;amp;ndash;F34 mood disorders and F60.31&amp;amp;mdash;emotionally unstable personality disorder). Clinical and psychological features were presented, as well as predictors of suicidal risk in patients of these groups. We performed a comparative analysis of the anxiety and depression level, the level of mental pain, fear of death and the severity of anti-suicidal motives in patients with affective disorders and borderline personality disorder (BPD). Based on the results, 100% of patients in these clinical nosological groups were found to have a high level of suicidal risk. Patients with affective disorders have weak anti-suicidal motives and are not fully aware of the consequences of their own death. Patients with BPD have a higher suicidal risk than patients with affective disorders; they are characterized by less pronounced social orientation, demonstrativeness, self-centeredness, less pronounced levels of anxiety and fear of death.</p>

">Perceptual consequences of retinal stabilization with a high-frequency LCD display</a></h4>

              
                Several recent studies have shown decreased sensitivity when stimuli are immobilized on the retina, a procedure known as retinal stabilization. Because of the technical challenges inherent in this procedure, studies have either used fast-phosphor CRT displays or directly updated the stimulus on the retina by means of adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopes. Both display systems provide brief pulses to the retina, raising the question of whether this flicker contributed to perceptual effects. Here we report the results of retinal stabilization experiments conducted with LCD monitors at high refresh rates. Results replicate previous findings of high-frequency impairments under retinal stabilization. These data provide further support for a functional role of small eye movements during visual fixation.

">Improving Predictability, Test-Retest Reliability and Generalisability of Brain-Wide Associations for Cognitive Abilities via Multimodal Stacking</a></h4>

              
                Brain-wide association studies (BWASs) have attempted to relate cognitive abilities with brain phenotypes, but have been challenged by issues such as predictability, test-retest reliability, and cross-cohort generalisability. To tackle these challenges, we proposed stacking that combines brain magnetic resonance imaging of different modalities, from task-fMRI contrasts and functional connectivity during tasks and rest to structural measures, into one prediction model. We benchmarked the benefits of stacking, using the Human Connectome Projects: Young Adults and Aging and the Dunedin Study. For predictability, stacked models led to out-of-sample r~.5-.6 when predicting cognitive abilities at the time of scanning and 36 years earlier. For test-retest reliability, stacked models reached an excellent level of reliability (ICC>.75), even when we stacked only task-fMRI contrasts together. For generalisability, a stacked model with non-task MRI built from one dataset significantly predicted cognitive abilities in other datasets. Altogether, stacking is a viable approach to undertake the three challenges of BWAS for cognitive abilities.

">Protection of savings by reducing the salience of opposing errors</a></h4>

              
                When humans encounter the same disturbance twice, they adapt to it faster during the second exposure. To examine how subconscious learning systems contribute to this savings process, previous studies have suppressed explicit awareness of the perturbation by gradually increasing its magnitude during initial learning. This has produced mixed effects, with some studies demonstrating faster relearning, and others observing no acceleration during relearning. Here we examined whether these differences might be due to the nature of a de-adaptation period that separates two learning periods. To test this idea, we manipulated the magnitude of washout errors by de-adapting participants abruptly, gradually, or by removing feedback entirely. Empirical analyses indicated that the different classes of washout errors had a profound effect on savings: large washout errors nullified the ability to save, whereas small errors or the absence of error protected savings. Model-based analyses suggested that changes in learning rates were mediated by an increase in sensitivity to error that could be reversed by experience with oppositely-oriented washout errors. This suggests that the experience of error produces both a facilitation of learning for similar errors and a reduction in learning for dissimilar errors. The latter can abolish the expression of savings following gradual adaptation.

                <p>Elicited upon violation of regularity in stimulus presentation, mismatch negativity (MMN) reflects the brain's ability to perform automatic comparisons between consecutive stimuli and provides an electrophysiological index of sensory error detection whereas P300 is associated with cognitive processes such as updating of the working memory. To date, there has been extensive research on the roles of MMN and P300 individually, because of their potential to be used as clinical markers of consciousness and attention, respectively. Here, we intend to explore with an unsupervised and rigorous source estimation approach, the underlying cortical generators of MMN and P300, in the context of prediction error propagation along the hierarchies of brain information processing in healthy human participants. The existing methods of characterizing the two ERPs involve only approximate estimations of their amplitudes and latencies based on specific sensors of interest. Our objective is twofold: first, we introduce a novel data-driven unsupervised approach to compute latencies and amplitude of ERP components accurately on an individual-subject basis and reconfirm earlier findings. Second, we demonstrate that in multisensory environments, MMN generators seem to reflect a significant overlap of "modality-specific" and "modality-independent" information processing while P300 generators mark a shift toward completely "modality-independent" processing. Advancing earlier understanding that multisensory contexts speed up early sensory processing, our study reveals that temporal facilitation extends to even the later components of prediction error processing, using EEG experiments. Such knowledge can be of value to clinical research for characterizing the key developmental stages of lifespan aging, schizophrenia, and depression.</p>

                <p>Canonically, action potentials of most mammalian neurons initiate at the axon initial segment (AIS) and propagate bidirectionally: orthodromically along the distal axon and retrogradely into the soma and dendrites. Under some circumstances, action potentials may initiate ectopically, at sites distal to the AIS, and propagate antidromically along the axon. These "ectopic action potentials" (EAPs) have been observed in experimental models of seizures and chronic pain, and more rarely in nonpathological forebrain neurons. Here we report that a large majority of parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons in the upper layers of mouse neocortex, from both orbitofrontal and primary somatosensory areas, fire EAPs after sufficient activation of their somata. Somatostatin-expressing interneurons also fire EAPs, though less robustly. Ectopic firing in PV+ cells occurs in varying temporal patterns and can persist for several seconds. PV+ cells evoke strong synaptic inhibition in pyramidal neurons and interneurons and play critical roles in cortical function. Our results suggest that ectopic spiking of PV+ interneurons is common and may contribute to both normal and pathological network functions of the neocortex.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-448/v1?src=rss">Interplay of age, gender, education, and heart rate in dementia among older adults in Wakiso, Uganda: a cross sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background In this cross-sectional study conducted in Wakiso, Uganda, from May to July 2023, we investigated the interactions among age, sex, education, and heart rate in relation to dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) among individuals aged 65 years and older. Methods We purposively sampled 106 participants, focusing on those with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, leveraging collaborations with local health teams. Data collection involved comprehensive questionnaires covering sociodemographic details and health parameters, and employed the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Tool for dementia screening. Results Our findings highlight a nuanced landscape of risk factors; each additional year of age was associated with a 1.19- and 1.22-times increased risk of MCI and dementia, respectively. Gender analysis revealed a protective effect against MCI in males, but no significant impact on dementia risk. Education emerged as a protective factor, with each additional year associated with a 28% reduction in MCI risk, although its effect on dementia risk remains ambiguous. Significantly, an elevated heart rate was strongly linked to an increased risk of both MCI and dementia, underscoring the potential cardiovascular dimension in cognitive health. Conclusions This study contributes to the understanding of the complex interplay of risk factors for dementia, emphasizing the need for further research to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and interventions for healthy cognitive aging in the older adult population.

                A 56-year-old female with a medical history of unspecified hyperthyroidism and a recent thyroid storm presented to the ED with tachycardia, hypertension, and bilateral enlarged parotid glands. During a previous hospitalization, she was diagnosed with unspecified hyperthyroidism and started on methimazole. During hospitalization, laboratory findings suggested Graves’ disease with an acute thyroid storm. The patient also complained of enlarged parotid glands bilaterally. CT tomography of the neck revealed no calculi of the parotid glands but showed extensive fatty replacement, possibly related to methimazole use. Treatment with propranolol and IV hydrocortisone improved thyroid function. Due to the suspicion of methimazole-induced parotitis, she was transitioned to a reduced methimazole dosage for treatment of Graves’ disease, which subsequently improved her parotitis. Methimazole, the standard initial treatment for Graves’ disease, is generally well-tolerated. It can cause adverse reactions; however, parotitis is very rare and has been documented in only a few case reports. Owing to the limited number of reports, its incidence is currently unknown. Here, we present a case of methimazole-induced parotitis as an unusual presentation of thyroid storm. Drug-induced reactions can only be considered once common causes of parotitis such as viral infection, obstruction, and autoimmune diseases are ruled out. Treatment involves dosage adjustments and supportive care. Methimazole-induced parotitis is often misdiagnosed and overlooked because of the lack of reported cases. This necessitates future research into the reaction mechanisms and optimal treatment.

                Background This bibliometric analysis examines the top 50 most-cited articles on COVID-19 complications, offering insights into the multifaceted impact of the virus. Since its emergence in Wuhan in December 2019, COVID-19 has evolved into a global health crisis, with over 770 million confirmed cases and 6.9 million deaths as of September 2023. Initially recognized as a respiratory illness causing pneumonia and ARDS, its diverse complications extend to cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, renal, hematological, neurological, endocrinological, ophthalmological, hepatobiliary, and dermatological systems. Methods Identifying the top 50 articles from a pool of 5940 in Scopus, the analysis spans November 2019 to July 2021, employing terms related to COVID-19 and complications. Rigorous review criteria excluded non-relevant studies, basic science research, and animal models. The authors independently reviewed articles, considering factors like title, citations, publication year, journal, impact factor, authors, study details, and patient demographics. Results The focus is primarily on 2020 publications (96%), with all articles being open access. Leading journals include The Lancet, NEJM, and JAMA, with prominent contributions from Internal Medicine (46.9%) and Pulmonary Medicine (14.5%). China played a major role (34.9%), followed by France and Belgium. Clinical features were the primary study topic (68%), often utilizing retrospective designs (24%). Among 22,477 patients analyzed, 54.8% were male, with the most common age group being 26-65 years (63.2%). Complications of COVID-19 affected 13.9% of patients, with a recovery rate of 57.8%. Conclusion Analyzing these top-cited articles offers clinicians and researchers a comprehensive, timely understanding of influential COVID-19 literature. This approach uncovers attributes contributing to high citations and provides authors with valuable insights for crafting impactful research. As a strategic tool, this analysis facilitates staying updated and making meaningful contributions to the dynamic field of COVID-19 research.

                Background This study investigated the utility of platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in patients with COVID-19 with respect to age, early (a week) vs. delayed recovery (> a week) and mortality. Methods This was a retrospective study including 1,016 COVID-19 patients. The discriminatory power and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed. Results The mean age of patients was 45 (± 13.9), and 75.7% were males. Older patients had elevated NLR, PLR, D-dimer, CRP, and Interleukin-6 levels and longer hospital stay than the younger group (p < 0.001). In-hospital mortality was higher in older adults (26.9% vs. 6.6%, p =0.001). On-admission NLR (5.8 vs. 3.2; P= 0.001) and PLR (253.9±221.1 vs. 192.2±158.5; p = 0.004) were higher in the non-survivors than survivors. Both PLR and NLR displayed significant discriminatory ability for mortality. NLR had a higher AUC and specificity, while PLR exhibited slightly higher sensitivity. In individuals aged ≤55, NLR showed superior discrimination (AUC=0.717) compared to PLR (AUC=0.620). Conversely, for older adults, PLR displayed enhanced discrimination (AUC=0.710), while NLR showed AUC=0.693. Conclusion Higher admission NLR and PLR levels were associated with delayed recovery, whereas an enhanced NLR was associated with considerably higher mortality in older COVID-19 patients.

                Background Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) are a group of structural abnormalities affecting these vital organs, frequently leading to chronic kidney disease in children. This study aims to comprehensively understand the clinical profile of CAKUT in children in Central India, an area with unique socio-demographic characteristics and limited prior research on this topic. Methods A prospective observational study will be conducted over three years in the pediatric department of AVBRH, a tertiary healthcare center in Central India. Data were collected through interviews with parents or guardians of children up to 18 admitted to the hospital. Clinical symptoms, prenatal history, physical examinations, and diagnostic investigations were meticulously documented. Expected outcome The study is expected to reveal the prevalence and clinical profile of CAKUT in Central Indian children. Anticipated outcomes include insights into anomalies, clinical symptoms, and potential correlations with factors like prenatal care and consanguineous marriages. Diagnostic investigations will help assess the severity of renal impairment. The results may also uncover regional variations and have implications for public health initiatives aimed at early intervention and improved patient care. However, these are preliminary expectations that are subject to confirmation through the completion of the study.

                <p>by Phoebe Asplin, Matt J. Keeling, Rebecca Mancy, Edward M. Hill</p>
Background <p>Respiratory pathogens inflict a substantial burden on public health and the economy. Although the severity of symptoms caused by these pathogens can vary from asymptomatic to fatal, the factors that determine symptom severity are not fully understood. Correlations in symptoms between infector-infectee pairs, for which evidence is accumulating, can generate large-scale clusters of severe infections that could be devastating to those most at risk, whilst also conceivably leading to chains of mild or asymptomatic infections that generate widespread immunity with minimal cost to public health. Although this effect could be harnessed to amplify the impact of interventions that reduce symptom severity, the mechanistic representation of symptom propagation within mathematical and health economic modelling of respiratory diseases is understudied.</p> Methods and findings <p>We propose a novel framework for incorporating different levels of symptom propagation into models of infectious disease transmission via a single parameter, <i>α</i>. Varying <i>α</i> tunes the model from having no symptom propagation (<i>α</i> = 0, as typically assumed) to one where symptoms always propagate (<i>α</i> = 1). For parameters corresponding to three respiratory pathogens—seasonal influenza, pandemic influenza and SARS-CoV-2—we explored how symptom propagation impacted the relative epidemiological and health-economic performance of three interventions, conceptualised as vaccines with different actions: symptom-attenuating (labelled SA), infection-blocking (IB) and infection-blocking admitting only mild breakthrough infections (IB_MB).In the absence of interventions, with fixed underlying epidemiological parameters, stronger symptom propagation increased the proportion of cases that were severe. For SA and IB_MB, interventions were more effective at reducing prevalence (all infections and severe cases) for higher strengths of symptom propagation. For IB, symptom propagation had no impact on effectiveness, and for seasonal influenza this intervention type was more effective than SA at reducing severe infections for all strengths of symptom propagation. For pandemic influenza and SARS-CoV-2, at low intervention uptake, SA was more effective than IB for all levels of symptom propagation; for high uptake, SA only became more effective under strong symptom propagation. Health economic assessments found that, for SA-type interventions, the amount one could spend on control whilst maintaining a cost-effective intervention (termed threshold unit intervention cost) was very sensitive to the strength of symptom propagation.</p> Conclusions <p>Overall, the preferred intervention type depended on the combination of the strength of symptom propagation and uptake. Given the importance of determining robust public health responses, we highlight the need to gather further data on symptom propagation, with our modelling framework acting as a template for future analysis.</p>

                <p>by Sebastien Benzekry, Michalis Mastri, Chiara Nicolò, John M. L. Ebos</p>

Clinical trials involving systemic neoadjuvant treatments in breast cancer aim to shrink tumors before surgery while simultaneously allowing for controlled evaluation of biomarkers, toxicity, and suppression of distant (occult) metastatic disease. Yet neoadjuvant clinical trials are rarely preceded by preclinical testing involving neoadjuvant treatment, surgery, and post-surgery monitoring of the disease. Here we used a mouse model of spontaneous metastasis occurring after surgical removal of orthotopically implanted primary tumors to develop a predictive mathematical model of neoadjuvant treatment response to sunitinib, a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RTKI). Treatment outcomes were used to validate a novel mathematical kinetics-pharmacodynamics model predictive of perioperative disease progression. Longitudinal measurements of presurgical primary tumor size and postsurgical metastatic burden were compiled using 128 mice receiving variable neoadjuvant treatment doses and schedules (released publicly at https://zenodo.org/records/10607753). A non-linear mixed-effects modeling approach quantified inter-animal variabilities in metastatic dynamics and survival, and machine-learning algorithms were applied to investigate the significance of several biomarkers at resection as predictors of individual kinetics. Biomarkers included circulating tumor- and immune-based cells (i.e., circulating tumor cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells) as well as immunohistochemical tumor proteins (i.e., CD31 and Ki67). Our computational simulations show that neoadjuvant RTKI treatment inhibits primary tumor growth but has little efficacy in preventing (micro)-metastatic disease progression after surgery and treatment cessation. Machine learning algorithms that included support vector machines, random forests, and artificial neural networks, confirmed a lack of definitive biomarkers, which shows the value of preclinical modeling studies to identify potential failures that should be avoided clinically.

                <p>by David Mezey, Dominik Deffner, Ralf H. J. M. Kurvers, Pawel Romanczuk</p>

Collective dynamics emerge from individual-level decisions, yet we still poorly understand the link between individual-level decision-making processes and collective outcomes in realistic physical systems. Using collective foraging to study the key trade-off between personal and social information use, we present a mechanistic, spatially-explicit agent-based model that combines individual-level evidence accumulation of personal and (visual) social cues with particle-based movement. Under idealized conditions without physical constraints, our mechanistic framework reproduces findings from established probabilistic models, but explains how individual-level decision processes generate collective outcomes in a bottom-up way. In clustered environments, groups performed best if agents reacted strongly to social information, while in uniform environments, individualistic search was most beneficial. Incorporating different real-world physical and perceptual constraints profoundly shaped collective performance, and could even buffer maladaptive herding by facilitating self-organized exploration. Our study uncovers the mechanisms linking individual cognition to collective outcomes in human and animal foraging and paves the way for decentralized robotic applications.

Many self-motivated and goal-directed behaviours display highly flexible, approximately 4 hour ultradian (shorter than a day) oscillations. Despite lacking direct correspondence to physical cycles in the environment, these ultradian rhythms may be involved in optimizing functional interactions with the environment and reflect intrinsic neural dynamics. Current evidence supports a role of mesostriatal dopamine (DA) in the expression and propagation of ultradian rhythmicity, however, the biochemical processes underpinning these oscillations remain to be identified. Here, we use a mathematical model to investigate D2 autoreceptor-dependent DA self-regulation as the source of ultradian behavioural rhythms. DA concentration at the midbrain-striatal synapses is governed through a dual-negative feedback-loop structure, which naturally gives rise to rhythmicity. This model shows the propensity of striatal DA to produce an ultradian oscillation characterized by a flexible period that is highly sensitive to parameter variations. Circadian (approximately 24 hour) regulation consolidates the ultradian oscillations and alters their response to the phase-dependent, rapid-resetting effect of a transient excitatory stimulus. Within a circadian framework, the ultradian rhythm orchestrates behavioural activity and enhances responsiveness to an external stimulus. This suggests a role for the circadian-ultradian timekeeping hierarchy in governing organized behaviour and shaping daily experience through coordinating the motivation to engage in recurring, albeit not highly predictable events, such as social interactions.

To optimize proteins for particular traits holds great promise for industrial and pharmaceutical purposes. Machine Learning is increasingly applied in this field to <i>predict</i> properties of proteins, thereby guiding the experimental optimization process. A natural question is: How much progress are we making with such predictions, and how important is the choice of regressor and representation? In this paper, we demonstrate that different assessment criteria for regressor performance can lead to dramatically different conclusions, depending on the choice of metric, and how one defines generalization. We highlight the fundamental issues of sample bias in typical regression scenarios and how this can lead to misleading conclusions about regressor performance. Finally, we make the case for the importance of calibrated uncertainty in this domain.

                <p>by Paulina Clara Dagnino, Anira Escrichs, Ane López-González, Olivia Gosseries, Jitka Annen, Yonatan Sanz Perl, Morten L. Kringelbach, Steven Laureys, Gustavo Deco</p>

A fundamental challenge in neuroscience is accurately defining brain states and predicting how and where to perturb the brain to force a transition. Here, we investigated resting-state fMRI data of patients suffering from disorders of consciousness (DoC) after coma (minimally conscious and unresponsive wakefulness states) and healthy controls. We applied model-free and model-based approaches to help elucidate the underlying brain mechanisms of patients with DoC. The model-free approach allowed us to characterize brain states in DoC and healthy controls as a probabilistic metastable substate (PMS) space. The PMS of each group was defined by a repertoire of unique patterns (i.e., metastable substates) with different probabilities of occurrence. In the model-based approach, we adjusted the PMS of each DoC group to a causal whole-brain model. This allowed us to explore optimal strategies for promoting transitions by applying off-line <i>in silico</i> probing. Furthermore, this approach enabled us to evaluate the impact of local perturbations in terms of their global effects and sensitivity to stimulation, which is a model-based biomarker providing a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying DoC. Our results show that transitions were obtained in a synchronous protocol, in which the somatomotor network, thalamus, precuneus and insula were the most sensitive areas to perturbation. This motivates further work to continue understanding brain function and treatments of disorders of consciousness.

                Background Prosthetic joint infection is a serious complication that can arise after total joint replacement surgery. When bacteria colonise an orthopaedic implant, they form biofilms that protect them from their environment, making them difficult to remove. Treatment is further complicated by a global rise of antimicrobial resistance. These protective mechanisms make treatment of prosthetic joint infection increasingly complex. Non-contact induction heating is an upcoming technology that uses heat to eradicate bacteria that are present on the surface of metallic implants. This study aims to provide insight into the feasibility of using non-contact induction heating on metallic implants that are in direct contact with other biomaterials, such as coatings composed of hydroxyapatite and bone cement composed of poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). Methods Characterisation of hydroxyapatite coatings and adhesion strength tests were conducted according to standards set by the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO 13779-2). The fixation strength of acrylic bone cement was tested according to an adapted method from ISO. Results It was found that non-contact induction heating did not significantly affect the adhesion strength of hydroxyapatite coatings (p=0.697). In contrast to hydroxyapatite coatings, acrylic bone cement softened temporarily as the temperature exceeded the glass transition temperature (83.38 ± 10.88°C). However, the induction heating temperature had no significant effect on the fixation strength after the cement was allowed to cool down (p=0.535). Conclusion This study shows the feasibility of using non-contact induction heating up to 80°C when bone cement or ceramic coatings are present in contact with infected metallic implants.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Recent work has identified a critical role for the hippocampus in reward-sensitive behaviors, including motivated memory, reinforcement learning, and decision-making. Animal histology and human functional neuroimaging have shown that brain regions involved in reward processing and motivation are more interconnected with the ventral/anterior hippocampus. However, direct evidence examining gradients of structural connectivity between reward regions and the hippocampus in humans is lacking. The present study used diffusion MRI (dMRI) and probabilistic tractography to quantify the structural connectivity of the hippocampus with key reward processing regions in vivo. Using a large sample of subjects (<i>N</i> = 628) from the human connectome dMRI data release, we found that connectivity profiles with the hippocampus varied widely between different regions of the reward circuit. While the dopaminergic midbrain (ventral tegmental area) showed stronger connectivity with the anterior versus posterior hippocampus, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex showed stronger connectivity with the posterior hippocampus. The limbic (ventral) striatum demonstrated a more homogeneous connectivity profile along the hippocampal long axis. This is the first study to generate a probabilistic atlas of the hippocampal structural connectivity with reward-related networks, which is essential to investigating how these circuits contribute to normative adaptive behavior and maladaptive behaviors in psychiatric illness. These findings describe nuanced structural connectivity that sets the foundation to better understand how the hippocampus influences reward-guided behavior in humans.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-442/v1?src=rss">Cognitive dysfunction and its relationship with psychopathology and quality of life in patients with schizophrenia: a protocol for a cross sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background One central characteristic of schizophrenia is cognitive dysfunction, which typically has modest to severe effects on a variety of cognitive areas. Evidence suggests that cognitive impairment may occur far sooner than the clinical symptoms. The connection between cognitive deficiencies and functional outcome indicators has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Cognitive deficits are widely known to affect overall functioning, In India, few studies have been conducted to determine the profile of cognitive abnormalities in individuals in the chronic phase of schizophrenia as well as those in remission. Research from developing nations is crucial because schizophrenia prevalence in these nations is thought to be lower than that in industrialized nations. The aim of this study will be to assess the prevalence of cognitive dysfunction in individuals with schizophrenia and examine the relationship between cognitive dysfunction with psychopathology and quality of life in individuals with schizophrenia. Protocol This will be a cross sectional hospital-based study. After ethical clearance, all patients in the Psychiatry Department meeting the criteria of Schizophrenia, according to the ICD-10, will be part of the study. The expected number of participants is 228. All participants within the age group of 18 to 65 years who are clinically diagnosed to have schizophrenia using ICD-10 and who are able to give written informed consent will be included in the study. The patient’s sociodemographic data will be collected in Outpatient or inpatient basis and then the following questionnaires will be applied to them: i) Socio-demographic Proforma; ii) The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS); iii) The World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF scale (WHOQOL-BREF); and iv) Addenbrooke’s cognitive examination III (ACE). Once the aforementioned questionnaires are completed, the prevalence of cognitive dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia will be assessed, and its relationship with psychopathology and quality of life will be studied.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89967">The MODY-associated KCNK16 L114P mutation increases islet glucagon secretion and limits insulin secretion resulting in transient neonatal diabetes and glucose dyshomeostasis in adults</a></h4>

              
                The gain-of-function mutation in the TALK-1 K<sup>+</sup> channel (p.L114P) is associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). TALK-1 is a key regulator of β-cell electrical activity and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The <i>KCNK16</i> gene encoding TALK-1 is the most abundant and β-cell-restricted K<sup>+</sup> channel transcript. To investigate the impact of <i>KCNK16</i> L114P on glucose homeostasis and confirm its association with MODY, a mouse model containing the <i>Kcnk16</i> L114P mutation was generated. Heterozygous and homozygous <i>Kcnk16</i> L114P mice exhibit increased neonatal lethality in the C57BL/6J and the CD-1 (ICR) genetic background, respectively. Lethality is likely a result of severe hyperglycemia observed in the homozygous <i>Kcnk16</i> L114P neonates due to lack of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and can be reduced with insulin treatment. <i>Kcnk16</i> L114P increased whole-cell β-cell K<sup>+</sup> currents resulting in blunted glucose-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and loss of glucose-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations. Thus, adult <i>Kcnk16</i> L114P mice have reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and plasma insulin levels, which significantly impairs glucose homeostasis. Taken together, this study shows that the MODY-associated <i>Kcnk16</i> L114P mutation disrupts glucose homeostasis in adult mice resembling a MODY phenotype and causes neonatal lethality by inhibiting islet insulin secretion during development. These data suggest that TALK-1 is an islet-restricted target for the treatment for diabetes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91034">A dynamic neural resource model bridges sensory and working memory</a></h4>

              
                Probing memory of a complex visual image within a few hundred milliseconds after its disappearance reveals significantly greater fidelity of recall than if the probe is delayed by as little as a second. Classically interpreted, the former taps into a detailed but rapidly decaying visual sensory or ‘iconic’ memory (IM), while the latter relies on capacity-limited but comparatively stable visual working memory (VWM). While iconic decay and VWM capacity have been extensively studied independently, currently no single framework quantitatively accounts for the dynamics of memory fidelity over these time scales. Here, we extend a stationary neural population model of VWM with a temporal dimension, incorporating rapid sensory-driven accumulation of activity encoding each visual feature in memory, and a slower accumulation of internal error that causes memorized features to randomly drift over time. Instead of facilitating read-out from an independent sensory store, an early cue benefits recall by lifting the effective limit on VWM signal strength imposed when multiple items compete for representation, allowing memory for the cued item to be supplemented with information from the decaying sensory trace. Empirical measurements of human recall dynamics validate these predictions while excluding alternative model architectures. A key conclusion is that differences in capacity classically thought to distinguish IM and VWM are in fact contingent upon a single resource-limited WM store.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83897">Cholecystokinin facilitates motor skill learning by modulating neuroplasticity in the motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                Cholecystokinin (CCK) is an essential modulator for neuroplasticity in sensory and emotional domains. Here, we investigated the role of CCK in motor learning using a single pellet reaching task in mice. Mice with a knockout of <i>Cck</i> gene (<i>Cck<sup>−/−</sup></i>) or blockade of CCK-B receptor (CCKBR) showed defective motor learning ability; the success rate of retrieving reward remained at the baseline level compared to the wildtype mice with significantly increased success rate. We observed no long-term potentiation upon high-frequency stimulation in the motor cortex of <i>Cck<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice, indicating a possible association between motor learning deficiency and neuroplasticity in the motor cortex. In vivo calcium imaging demonstrated that the deficiency of CCK signaling disrupted the refinement of population neuronal activity in the motor cortex during motor skill training. Anatomical tracing revealed direct projections from CCK-expressing neurons in the rhinal cortex to the motor cortex. Inactivation of the CCK neurons in the rhinal cortex that project to the motor cortex bilaterally using chemogenetic methods significantly suppressed motor learning, and intraperitoneal application of CCK4, a tetrapeptide CCK agonist, rescued the motor learning deficits of <i>Cck<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice. In summary, our results suggest that CCK, which could be provided from the rhinal cortex, may surpport motor skill learning by modulating neuroplasticity in the motor cortex.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87529">Therapeutic doses of ketamine acutely attenuate the aversive effect of losses during decision-making</a></h4>

              
                The discovery of rapid-acting antidepressant, ketamine has opened a pathway to a new generation of treatments for depression, and inspired neuroscientific investigation based on a new perspective that non-adaptive changes in the intrinsic excitatory and inhibitory circuitry might underlie the pathophysiology of depression. Nevertheless, it still remains largely unknown how the hypothesized molecular and synaptic levels of changes in the circuitry might mediate behavioral and neuropsychological changes underlying depression, and how ketamine might restore adaptive behavior. Here, we used computational models to analyze behavioral changes induced by therapeutic doses of ketamine, while rhesus macaques were iteratively making decisions based on gains and losses of tokens. When administered intramuscularly or intranasally, ketamine reduced the aversiveness of undesirable outcomes such as losses of tokens without significantly affecting the evaluation of gains, behavioral perseveration, motivation, and other cognitive aspects of learning such as temporal credit assignment and time scales of choice and outcome memory. Ketamine’s potentially antidepressant effect was separable from other side effects such as fixation errors, which unlike outcome evaluation, was readily countered with strong motivation to avoid errors. We discuss how the acute effect of ketamine to reduce the initial impact of negative events could potentially mediate longer-term antidepressant effects through mitigating the cumulative effect of those events produced by slowly decaying memory, and how the disruption-resistant affective memory might pose challenges in treating depression. Our study also invites future investigations on ketamine’s antidepressant action over diverse mood states and with affective events exerting their impacts at diverse time scales.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88510">Metabolic and neurobehavioral disturbances induced by purine recycling deficiency in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) are two structurally related enzymes involved in purine recycling in humans. Inherited mutations that suppress HGPRT activity are associated with Lesch–Nyhan disease (LND), a rare X-linked metabolic and neurological disorder in children, characterized by hyperuricemia, dystonia, and compulsive self-injury. To date, no treatment is available for these neurological defects and no animal model recapitulates all symptoms of LND patients. Here, we studied LND-related mechanisms in the fruit fly. By combining enzymatic assays and phylogenetic analysis, we confirm that no HGPRT activity is expressed in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, making the APRT homolog (Aprt) the only purine-recycling enzyme in this organism. Whereas APRT deficiency does not trigger neurological defects in humans, we observed that <i>Drosophila Aprt</i> mutants show both metabolic and neurobehavioral disturbances, including increased uric acid levels, locomotor impairments, sleep alterations, seizure-like behavior, reduced lifespan, and reduction of adenosine signaling and content. Locomotor defects could be rescued by Aprt re-expression in neurons and reproduced by knocking down <i>Aprt</i> selectively in the protocerebral anterior medial (PAM) dopaminergic neurons, the mushroom bodies, or glia subsets. Ingestion of allopurinol rescued uric acid levels in <i>Aprt</i>-deficient mutants but not neurological defects, as is the case in LND patients, while feeding adenosine or <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) during development fully rescued the epileptic behavior. Intriguingly, pan-neuronal expression of an LND-associated mutant form of human HGPRT (I42T), but not the wild-type enzyme, resulted in early locomotor defects and seizure in flies, similar to <i>Aprt</i> deficiency. Overall, our results suggest that <i>Drosophila</i> could be used in different ways to better understand LND and seek a cure for this dramatic disease.

	<p>Electroencephalography (EEG) is effectively employed to describe cognitive patterns corresponding to different tasks of motor functions for brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interface (BCI) implementation. Explicit information processing is necessary to reduce the computational complexity of practical BCI systems. This paper presents an entropy-based approach to select effective EEG channels for motor imagery (MI) classification in brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interface (BCI) systems. The method identifies channels with higher entropy scores, which is an indication of greater information content. It discards redundant or noisy channels leading to reduced computational complexity and improved classification accuracy. High entropy means a more disordered pattern, whereas low entropy means a less disordered pattern with less information. The entropy of each channel for individual trials is calculated. The weight of each channel is represented by the mean entropy of the channel over all the trials. A set of channels with higher mean entropy are selected as effective channels for MI classification. A limited number of sub-band signals are created by decomposing the selected channels. To extract the spatial features, the common spatial pattern (CSP) is applied to each sub-band space of EEG signals. The CSP-based features are used to classify the right-hand and right-foot MI tasks using a support vector machine (SVM). The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated using two publicly available EEG datasets, known as BCI competition III&amp;amp;ndash;IV(A) and BCI competition IV&amp;amp;ndash;I. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach surpasses cutting-edge techniques.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-440/v1?src=rss">Systematic review of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and hesitancy: global perspectives and implications. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The acceptance rate towards COVID-19 vaccination among the global population could be higher due to the need for more education or awareness of prevention strategies to control the COVID-19 outbreak. Thus, there is a dire need to reduce the population’s reluctance towards COVID-19 vaccination across the globe, which will ultimately lead to the implementation of prevention and control strategies against the COVID-19 virus and improving health outcomes across the globe. The following study intends to conduct a systematic review of the literature to evaluate the relationship between COVID-19 vaccination and the current trends related to COVID-19 vaccination faced by the global population. The methodology employed in this study primarily focused on assessing secondary data by conducting a systematic literature review. Internet and electronic databases were used to select research articles to obtain secondary sources. Six articles were selected from ScienceDirect and Google Scholar for a systematic literature review. The keywords used for the selection of articles were “COVID-19,” “Global trends,” Reluctance, “and “vaccination.” The selected articles that were most suitable for the topic consisted of global trends related to COVID-19 vaccination. Six articles relevant to the topic were selected and reviewed. The selected articles showed data collection results from different research journals. The findings of the six research articles depicted common themes, such as each vaccine having a different level of access attitude towards the regional existence, which primarily depends on the variability to determine the vaccine’s effectiveness. Further studies are required to evaluate the factors and strategies that help healthcare organizations and governments reduce the reluctance to use the COVID-19 vaccine among populations worldwide.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-439/v1?src=rss">There is no easy fix to peer review but paying referees and regulating the number of submissions might help [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The exponential increase in the number of submissions, further accelerated by generative AI, and the decline in the availability of experts are burdening the peer review process. This has led to high unethical desk rejection rates, a growing appeal for the publication of unreviewed preprints, and a worrying proliferation of predatory journals. The idea of monetarily compensating peer reviewers has been around for many years; maybe, it is time to take it seriously as one way to save the peer review process. Here, I argue that paying reviewers, when done in a fair and transparent way, is a viable solution. Like the case of professional language editors, part-time or full-time professional reviewers, managed by universities or for-profit companies, can be an integral part of modern peer review. Being a professional reviewer could be financially attractive to retired senior researchers and to researchers who enjoy evaluating papers but are not motivated to do so for free. Moreover, not all produced research needs to go through peer review, and thus persuading researchers to limit submissions to their most novel and useful research could also help bring submission volumes to manageable levels. Overall, this paper reckons that the problem is not the peer review process per se but rather its function within an academic ecosystem dominated by an unhealthy culture of ‘publish or perish’. Instead of reforming the peer review process, academia has to look for better science dissemination schemes that promote collaboration over competition, engagement over judgement, and research quality and sustainability over quantity.

                Background Dentocraniofacial asymmetry is a common condition that affects many individuals. Accurate diagnosis of this condition is essential for effective treatment planning. Aim This study aimed to compare the diagnosis of dentocraniofacial asymmetry using two-dimensional and three-dimensional methods. Methods A cross-sectional, observational study was conducted at the Orthodontic Specialist Clinic of the Dental Hospital Faculty of Dentistry, University of Indonesia from March to April 2023. The study included 15 patients who had not undergone orthodontic treatment and were diagnosed with dentocraniofacial asymmetry. The study compared the results of diagnosing asymmetry in 15 different facial features, including the anterior nasal spine, upper and lower first incisors, pterygomaxillary fissure, orbita, menton, porion, upper and lower first molars, coronoid process, gonion, zygoma, latero nasale, and jugulare. Results The study found that there was no significant difference in the diagnosis of dentocraniofacial symmetry between the two- and three-dimensional methods across all 15 parameters measured. The researchers used Fisher's Exact Test to compare the proportion between dependent variables and found that the p-value was greater than 0.05, indicating that there was no significant difference in the diagnosis of dentocraniofacial symmetry between the two methods. The study also used Kappa Cohen analysis to measure the strength of agreement between the diagnosis of dentocraniofacial symmetry of the two-dimensional and three-dimensional methods on each parameter. Conclusion The findings of this study suggest that both two-dimensional and three-dimensional methods are equally effective in diagnosing dentocraniofacial asymmetry. This information may be useful for orthodontists in deciding which method to use when diagnosing dentocraniofacial asymmetry.

                Introduction It is essential to improve global public health and to achieve sustainable developmental goals. Mental health problems are common during menstruation in adolescent girls. Menstrual problems affect academic performance, personal lives, and social lives. Menstrual problems are both affective and somatic. This study is undertaken to study the Impact of Menstruation on the Mental Health of young adolescent girls. The participants ‘ ages range from 15 to 19 years. Adolescent coping method ds Mental health, psychological well-being, and spiritual well-being were assessed. Menstrual-phase respondents exhibited increased psychological traits as a measure of adolescent girls’ coping with mental difficulties. Objectives To evaluate menstruation-related knowledge, attitude, sources of information, and psychological well-being To determine the mental health problems during the menstrual cycle. To find out the association between sociodemographic variables and mental health problems during menstrual cycle Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in a rural area of the Wardha district. This study used a descriptive cross-sectional research design. A sample of 364 individuals was selected using random sampling. The inclusion criteria were adolescent girls aged 15–19 years who attained menstruation. Exclusion criteria: Girls younger than 15 years and above 19 years, as well as those who were hesitant and uncomfortable asking for information to participate in the study, were excluded. Outcomes Adolescent girls experienced menstruation-related psychosocial issues that are not uncommon. Menstrual distress, burden, stigma, lack of counselling services, lack of preparation menarche, lack of easy access to clean resources, vacy concerns when changing pads are necessary, lack of facilities for disposing sanitary napkins, and inadequate psychological and social support. Most girls experienced stress, mood swings, and restlessness during their menstrual cycle. These findings are consistent with past studies that found that the majority of girls were agitated during menstruation. Approximately 25% of them felt ashamed and guilty about their pubertal changes, and experienced menarche in fear, shyness, and sadness. On the first day of menstruation, girls report psychological problems such as anxiety, trouble concentrating, sadness, irritability, and excitement7. Approximately two-thirds of teenagers in the current study were unaware that menarche occurred earlier.

                Background The primary goal of this research is to underscore the significance of molecular docking in the context of malaria drug discovery. Molecular docking plays a crucial role in comprehending the interactions between prospective drugs and the target proteins found in Plasmodium parasites. The study delves into the docking interactions of various compounds, emphasizing the necessity of stabilizing the active site to formulate potent and selective drugs. Methods The research focuses on highlighting compound-specific interactions with residues, stressing the importance of stabilizing the active site to design drugs tailored to specific target proteins. Inhibiting the function of these target proteins disrupts the life cycle of the malaria parasite. Quantum Similarity Analysis, utilizing Overlap and Coulomb operators, is employed to identify electronic similarities. The resulting quantum similarity values guide subsequent chemical reactivity analysis. Global reactivity indices such as chemical potential, hardness, softness, and electrophilicity contribute to drug design by showcasing compound-specific indices that underscore the significance of stability and electrophilicity. Fukui functions are utilized to visualize regions for stabilization, providing insights crucial for potential malaria treatment. Results The enhancement of drug-target binding affinity is observed through stabilizing interactions in the active site. Understanding electrophilicity at the active site emerges as a critical factor in drug design and selectivity. The rational manipulation of electrophilic interactions holds promise for developing potent and selective drugs against malaria. Consequently, the integration of molecular docking, quantum similarity analysis, and chemical reactivity indices offers a comprehensive approach to malaria drug discovery. Conclusions The study identifies potential lead compounds, emphasizing the crucial role of stabilizing the active site. Additionally, it sheds light on electronic considerations vital for the design of effective and resistance-resistant drugs. The insights provided by Fukui functions into regions susceptible to -H bond formation make these compounds promising candidates for malaria treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012074">The quality and complexity of pairwise maximum entropy models for large cortical populations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Valdemar Kargård Olsen, Jonathan R. Whitlock, Yasser Roudi</p>

We investigate the ability of the pairwise maximum entropy (PME) model to describe the spiking activity of large populations of neurons recorded from the visual, auditory, motor, and somatosensory cortices. To quantify this performance, we use (1) Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences, (2) the extent to which the pairwise model predicts third-order correlations, and (3) its ability to predict the probability that multiple neurons are simultaneously active. We compare these with the performance of a model with independent neurons and study the relationship between the different performance measures, while varying the population size, mean firing rate of the chosen population, and the bin size used for binarizing the data. We confirm the previously reported excellent performance of the PME model for small population sizes <i>N</i> < 20. But we also find that larger mean firing rates and bin sizes generally decreases performance. The performance for larger populations were generally not as good. For large populations, pairwise models may be good in terms of predicting third-order correlations and the probability of multiple neurons being active, but still significantly worse than small populations in terms of their improvement over the independent model in KL-divergence. We show that these results are independent of the cortical area and of whether approximate methods or Boltzmann learning are used for inferring the pairwise couplings. We compared the scaling of the inferred couplings with <i>N</i> and find it to be well explained by the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model, whose strong coupling regime shows a complex phase with many metastable states. We find that, up to the maximum population size studied here, the fitted PME model remains outside its complex phase. However, the standard deviation of the couplings compared to their mean increases, and the model gets closer to the boundary of the complex phase as the population size grows.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002617">Key residues in the VDAC2-BAK complex can be targeted to modulate apoptosis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Zheng Yuan, Mark F. van Delft, Mark Xiang Li, Fransisca Sumardy, Brian J. Smith, David C. S. Huang, Guillaume Lessene, Yelena Khakam, Ruitao Jin, Sitong He, Nicholas A. Smith, Richard W. Birkinshaw, Peter E. Czabotar, Grant Dewson</p>

BAK and BAX execute intrinsic apoptosis by permeabilising the mitochondrial outer membrane. Their activity is regulated through interactions with pro-survival BCL-2 family proteins and with non-BCL-2 proteins including the mitochondrial porin VDAC2. VDAC2 is important for bringing both BAK and BAX to mitochondria where they execute their apoptotic function. Despite this important function in apoptosis, while interactions with pro-survival family members are well characterised and have culminated in the development of drugs that target these interfaces to induce cancer cell apoptosis, the interaction between BAK and VDAC2 remains largely undefined. Deep scanning mutagenesis coupled with cysteine linkage identified key residues in the interaction between BAK and VDAC2. Obstructive labelling of specific residues in the BH3 domain or hydrophobic groove of BAK disrupted this interaction. Conversely, mutating specific residues in a cytosol-exposed region of VDAC2 stabilised the interaction with BAK and inhibited BAK apoptotic activity. Thus, this VDAC2–BAK interaction site can potentially be targeted to either inhibit BAK-mediated apoptosis in scenarios where excessive apoptosis contributes to disease or to promote BAK-mediated apoptosis for cancer therapy.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/10-628/v3?src=rss">Screening for antifolate and artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum dried-blood spots from three hospitals of Eritrea [version 3; peer review: 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Antimalarial drug resistance is a major challenge hampering malaria control and elimination. About three-quarters of Eritrea’s population resides in the malaria-endemic western lowlands of the country. Plasmodium falciparum, the leading causative parasite species, has developed resistance to basically all antimalarials. Continued surveillance of drug resistance using genetic markers provides important molecular data for treatment policies which complements clinical studies, and strengthens control efforts. This study sought to genotype point mutations associated with P. falciparum resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and artemisinin, in dried-blood spots from three hospitals in the western lowlands of Eritrea. Methods Dried-blood spot samples were collected from patients visiting Adi Quala, Keren and Gash Barka Hospitals, between July and October, 2014. The patients were followed up after treatment with first line artesunate-amodiaquine, and dried-blood spots were collected on day three after treatment. Nested polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing techniques were employed to genotype point mutations in the Pfdhfr (PF3D7_0417200), Pfdhps (PF3D7_0810800) and PfK13 (PF3D7_1343700) partial gene regions. Results Sequence data analyses of PCR-positive isolates found wild-type artemisinin haplotypes associated with resistance (Y493Y, R539R, I543I) in three isolates, whereas four mutant antifolate haplotypes associated with resistance were observed in six isolates. These included the triple-mutant Pfdhfr (S108N, C59R, N51I) haplotype, the double-mutant Pfdhfr (N51I, S108N) haplotype, the single-mutant Pfdhfr (K540E) haplotype, and the mixed-mutant Pfdhfr-Pfdhps (S108N, N51I + K540E) haplotype. Other findings observed were, a rare non-synonymous Pfdhfr V45A mutation in four isolates, and a synonymous Pfdhps R449R in one isolate. Conclusions The mutant antifolate haplotypes observed indicate a likely existence of full SP resistance. Further studies can be carried out to estimate the prevalence of SP resistance. The wild-type artemisinin haplotypes observed suggest artemisinin is still an effective treatment. Continuous monitoring of point mutations associated with delayed parasite clearance in ART clinical studies is recommended.
