              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07783">Swin fMRI Transformer Predicts Early Neurodevelopmental Outcomes from Neonatal fMRI</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.07783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain development in the first few months of human life is a critical phase characterized by rapid structural growth and functional organization. Accurately predicting developmental outcomes during this time is crucial for identifying delays and enabling timely interventions. This study introduces the SwiFT (Swin 4D fMRI Transformer) model, designed to predict Bayley-III composite scores using neonatal fMRI data from the Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP). To enhance predictive accuracy, we apply dimensionality reduction via group independent component analysis (ICA) and pretrain SwiFT on large adult fMRI datasets to address the challenges of limited neonatal data. Our analysis shows that SwiFT significantly outperforms baseline models in predicting cognitive, motor, and language outcomes, leveraging both single-label and multi-label prediction strategies. The model's attention-based architecture processes spatiotemporal data end-to-end, delivering superior predictive performance. Additionally, we use Integrated Gradients with Smoothgrad sQuare (IG-SQ) to interpret predictions, identifying neural spatial representations linked to early cognitive and behavioral development. These findings underscore the potential of Transformer models to advance neurodevelopmental research and clinical practice.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07919">Identifying Quantum Mechanical Statistics in Italian Corpora</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.07919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical and empirical investigation of the statistical behaviour of the words in a text produced by human language. To this aim, we analyse the word distribution of various texts of Italian language selected from a specific literary corpus. We firstly generalise a theoretical framework elaborated by ourselves to identify 'quantum mechanical statistics' in large-size texts. Then, we show that, in all analysed texts, words distribute according to 'Bose--Einstein statistics' and show significant deviations from 'Maxwell--Boltzmann statistics'. Next, we introduce an effect of 'word randomization' which instead indicates that the difference between the two statistical models is not as pronounced as in the original cases. These results confirm the empirical patterns obtained in texts of English language and strongly indicate that identical words tend to 'clump together' as a consequence of their meaning, which can be explained as an effect of 'quantum entanglement' produced through a phenomenon of 'contextual updating'. More, word randomization can be seen as the linguistic-conceptual equivalent of an increase of temperature which destroys 'coherence' and makes classical statistics prevail over quantum statistics. Some insights into the origin of quantum statistics in physics are finally provided.

                arXiv:2412.07878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classification of harmful brain activities, such as seizures and periodic discharges, play a vital role in neurocritical care, enabling timely diagnosis and intervention. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive method for monitoring brain activity, but the manual interpretation of EEG signals are time-consuming and rely heavily on expert judgment. This study presents a comparative analysis of deep learning architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViTs), and EEGNet, applied to the classification of harmful brain activities using both raw EEG data and time-frequency representations generated through Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT). We evaluate the performance of these models use multimodal data representations, including high-resolution spectrograms and waveform data, and introduce a multi-stage training strategy to improve model robustness. Our results show that training strategies, data preprocessing, and augmentation techniques are as critical to model success as architecture choice, with multi-stage TinyViT and EfficientNet demonstrating superior performance. The findings underscore the importance of robust training regimes in achieving accurate and efficient EEG classification, providing valuable insights for deploying AI models in clinical practice.

                arXiv:2407.13196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well established that the brain spontaneously traverses through a very large number of states. Nevertheless, despite its relevance to understanding brain function, a formal description of this phenomenon is still lacking. To this end, we introduce a machine learning based method allowing for the determination of the probabilities of all possible states at a given coarse-graining, from which all the thermodynamics can be derived. This is a challenge not unique to the brain, since similar problems are at the heart of the statistical mechanics of complex systems. This paper uncovers a linear scaling of the entropies and energies of the brain states, a behaviour first conjectured by Hagedorn to be typical at the limiting temperature in which ordinary matter disintegrates into quark matter. Equivalently, this establishes the existence of a Zipf law scaling underlying the appearance of a wide range of brain states. Based on our estimation of the density of states for large scale functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) human brain recordings, we observe that the brain operates asymptotically at the Hagedorn temperature. The presented approach is not only relevant to brain function but should be applicable for a wide variety of complex systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07779">Evolution of Thought: Diverse and High-Quality Reasoning via Multi-Objective Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.07779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied to complex reasoning tasks, the diversity and quality of reasoning paths become crucial factors affecting their performance. Although current methods aim to enhance reasoning quality through path expansion, they often neglect the diversity of reasoning paths and effective information sharing, leading to local optima and inefficiency. To address these challenges, we propose Evolution of Thought (EoT), a multi-objective framework designed to improve reasoning by fostering both high-quality and diverse reasoning paths. Specifically, we introduce the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II for multi-objective optimization, utilizing crossover and mutation operators to promote greater diversity in reasoning solutions. Additionally, we propose a Condensation-Aggregation mechanism to cluster and eliminate redundant paths, facilitate improved information sharing among parent nodes, and ultimately enhance both the efficiency and quality of the reasoning process. Validation experiments on various vision-language and language reasoning tasks demonstrate that EoT achieves superior reasoning performance and efficiency compared to other competitive baselines. Our study provides a novel perspective on the design of heuristic reasoning frameworks for MLLMs.

                arXiv:2412.08370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs) in active distribution networks (ADNs) leads to complex and uncertain operation scenarios, resulting in significant deviations and risks for the ADN operation. In this study, a collaborative capacity planning of the distributed energy resources in an ADN is proposed to enhance the RES accommodation capability. The variability of RESs, characteristics of adjustable demand response resources, ADN bi-directional power flow, and security operation limitations are considered in the proposed model. To address the noise term caused by the inevitable deviation between the operation simulation and real-world environments, an improved noise-aware Bayesian optimization algorithm with the probabilistic surrogate model is proposed to overcome the interference from the environmental noise and sample-efficiently optimize the capacity planning model under noisy circumstances. Numerical simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed approach in coping with environmental noise and achieving lower annual cost and higher computation efficiency.

                arXiv:2412.08466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reliability of Neural Networks has gained significant attention, prompting efforts to develop SW-based hardening techniques for safety-critical scenarios. However, evaluating hardening techniques using application-level fault injection (FI) strategies, which are commonly hardware-agnostic, may yield misleading results. This study for the first time compares two FI approaches (at the application level (APP) and instruction level (ISA)) to evaluate deep neural network SW hardening strategies. Results show that injecting permanent faults at ISA (a more detailed abstraction level than APP) changes completely the ranking of SW hardening techniques, in terms of both reliability and accuracy. These results highlight the relevance of using an adequate analysis abstraction for evaluating such techniques.

                arXiv:2401.08117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bio-inspired event cameras or dynamic vision sensors are capable of asynchronously capturing per-pixel brightness changes (called event-streams) in high temporal resolution and high dynamic range. However, the non-structural spatial-temporal event-streams make it challenging for providing intuitive visualization with rich semantic information for human vision. It calls for events-to-video (E2V) solutions which take event-streams as input and generate high quality video frames for intuitive visualization. However, current solutions are predominantly data-driven without considering the prior knowledge of the underlying statistics relating event-streams and video frames. It highly relies on the non-linearity and generalization capability of the deep neural networks, thus, is struggling on reconstructing detailed textures when the scenes are complex. In this work, we propose \textbf{E2HQV}, a novel E2V paradigm designed to produce high-quality video frames from events. This approach leverages a model-aided deep learning framework, underpinned by a theory-inspired E2V model, which is meticulously derived from the fundamental imaging principles of event cameras. To deal with the issue of state-reset in the recurrent components of E2HQV, we also design a temporal shift embedding module to further improve the quality of the video frames. Comprehensive evaluations on the real world event camera datasets validate our approach, with E2HQV, notably outperforming state-of-the-art approaches, e.g., surpassing the second best by over 40\% for some evaluation metrics.

                arXiv:2412.08286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bolted joints are critical in engineering for maintaining structural integrity and reliability. Accurate prediction of parameters influencing their function and behavior is essential for optimal performance. Traditional methods often fail to capture the non-linear behavior of bolted joints or require significant computational resources, limiting accuracy and efficiency. This study addresses these limitations by combining empirical data with a feed-forward neural network to predict load capacity and friction coefficients. Leveraging experimental data and systematic preprocessing, the model effectively captures nonlinear relationships, including rescaling output variables to address scale discrepancies, achieving 95.24% predictive accuracy. While limited dataset size and diversity restrict generalizability, the findings demonstrate the potential of neural networks as a reliable, efficient alternative for bolted joint design. Future work will focus on expanding datasets and exploring hybrid modeling techniques to enhance applicability.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05305">A Robust Clustering Framework Combining Minimum Description Length and Genetic Optimization</a></h4>

Abstract: Clustering algorithms are fundamental in data analysis, enabling the organization of data into meaningful groups. However, individual clustering methods often face limitations and biases, making it challenging to develop a universal solution for diverse datasets. To address this, we propose a novel clustering framework that combines the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle with a genetic optimization algorithm. This approach begins with an ensemble clustering solution as a baseline, which is refined using MDL-based evaluation functions and optimized with a genetic algorithm. By leveraging the MDL principle, the method adapts to the intrinsic properties of datasets, minimizing dependence on input clusters and ensuring a data-driven process. The proposed method was evaluated on thirteen benchmark datasets using four validation metrics: accuracy, normalized mutual information (NMI), Fisher score, and adjusted Rand index (ARI). Results show that the method consistently outperforms traditional clustering algorithms, achieving higher accuracy, greater stability, and reduced biases. Its adaptability makes it a reliable tool for clustering complex and varied datasets. This study demonstrates the potential of combining MDL and genetic optimization to create a robust and versatile clustering framework, advancing the field of data analysis and offering a scalable solution for diverse applications.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06909">Graph Agent Network: Empowering Nodes with Inference Capabilities for Adversarial Resilience</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2306.06909v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: End-to-end training with global optimization have popularized graph neural networks (GNNs) for node classification, yet inadvertently introduced vulnerabilities to adversarial edge-perturbing attacks. Adversaries can exploit the inherent opened interfaces of GNNs' input and output, perturbing critical edges and thus manipulating the classification results. Current defenses, due to their persistent utilization of global-optimization-based end-to-end training schemes, inherently encapsulate the vulnerabilities of GNNs. This is specifically evidenced in their inability to defend against targeted secondary attacks. In this paper, we propose the Graph Agent Network (GAgN) to address the aforementioned vulnerabilities of GNNs. GAgN is a graph-structured agent network in which each node is designed as an 1-hop-view agent. Through the decentralized interactions between agents, they can learn to infer global perceptions to perform tasks including inferring embeddings, degrees and neighbor relationships for given nodes. This empowers nodes to filtering adversarial edges while carrying out classification tasks. Furthermore, agents' limited view prevents malicious messages from propagating globally in GAgN, thereby resisting global-optimization-based secondary attacks. We prove that single-hidden-layer multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are theoretically sufficient to achieve these functionalities. Experimental results show that GAgN effectively implements all its intended capabilities and, compared to state-of-the-art defenses, achieves optimal classification accuracy on the perturbed datasets.

The resulting framework, when combined with an efficient method for factorizing high-dimensional vectors, can represent and operate on numerical values over a large dynamic range using resources that scale only logarithmically with the range, a vast improvement over previous methods. It also exhibits impressive robustness to noise. We demonstrate the potential for this framework to solve computationally difficult problems in visual perception and combinatorial optimization, showing improvement over baseline methods.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In this study, we investigate the quantification of the statistical reliability of detected change points (CPs) in time series using a recurrent neural network (RNN). Thanks to its flexibility, RNN holds the potential to effectively identify CPs in time series characterized by complex dynamics. However, there is an increased risk of erroneously detecting random noise fluctuations as CPs. The primary goal of this study is to rigorously control the risk of false detections by providing theoretically valid p-values to the CPs detected by RNN. To achieve this, we introduce a novel method based on the framework of selective inference (SI). SI enables valid inferences by conditioning on the event of hypothesis selection, thus mitigating bias from generating and testing hypotheses on the same data. In this study, we apply an SI framework to RNN-based CP detection, where characterizing the complex process of RNN selecting CPs is our main technical challenge. We demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method through artificial and real data experiments.</span>

Here, we consider a decision-theoretic approach to study networks of bounded rational decision makers that are allowed to specialize and communicate with each other. In contrast to previous work that has focused on feedforward communication between decision-making agents, we consider cyclical information processing paths allowing for back-and-forth communication. We adapt message-passing algorithms to suit this purpose, essentially allowing for local information flow between units and thus enabling circular dependency structures. We provide examples that show how repeated communication can increase performance given that each unit’s information processing capability is limited and that decision-making systems with too few or too many connections and feedback loops achieve suboptimal utility.</span>

Modern deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods perform a similar operation but in terms of scalar rewards. Despite this similarity, the relationship between action updates of deep RL and human error–based learning has yet to be investigated. Here, we systematically compare the three major families of deep RL algorithms to human error–based learning. We show that all three deep RL approaches are qualitatively different from human error–based learning, as assessed by a mirror-reversal perturbation experiment. To bridge this gap, we developed an alternative deep RL algorithm inspired by human error–based learning, model-based deterministic policy gradients (MB-DPG). We showed that MB-DPG captures human error–based learning under mirror-reversal and rotational perturbations and that MB-DPG learns faster than canonical model-free algorithms on complex arm-based reaching tasks, while being more robust to (forward) model misspecification than model-based RL.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Even as machine learning exceeds human-level performance on many applications, the generality, robustness, and rapidity of the brain’s learning capabilities remain unmatched. How cognition arises from neural activity is <span style="font-style:italic;">the</span> central open question in neuroscience, inextricable from the study of intelligence itself. A simple formal model of neural activity was proposed in Papadimitriou et al. (<a href="#bib37" class="reflinks">2020</a>) and has been subsequently shown, through both mathematical proofs and simulations, to be capable of implementing certain simple cognitive operations via the creation and manipulation of assemblies of neurons. However, many intelligent behaviors rely on the ability to recognize, store, and manipulate temporal sequences of stimuli (planning, language, navigation, to list a few). Here we show that in the same model, sequential precedence can be captured naturally through synaptic weights and plasticity, and, as a result, a range of computations on sequences of assemblies can be carried out. In particular, repeated presentation of a sequence of stimuli leads to the memorization of the sequence through corresponding neural assemblies: upon future presentation of any stimulus in the sequence, the corresponding assembly and its subsequent ones will be activated, one after the other, until the end of the sequence. If the stimulus sequence is presented to two brain areas simultaneously, a scaffolded representation is created, resulting in more efficient memorization and recall, in agreement with cognitive experiments. Finally, we show that any finite state machine can be learned in a similar way, through the presentation of appropriate patterns of sequences. Through an extension of this mechanism, the model can be shown to be capable of universal computation. Taken together, these results provide a concrete hypothesis for the basis of the brain’s remarkable abilities to compute and learn, with sequences playing a vital role.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The free energy principle (FEP) describes (biological) agents as minimizing a variational free energy (FE) with respect to a generative model of their environment. Active inference (AIF) is a corollary of the FEP that describes how agents explore and exploit their environment by minimizing an expected FE objective. In two related papers, we describe a scalable, epistemic approach to synthetic AIF by message passing on free-form Forney-style factor graphs (FFGs). A companion paper (part I of this article; Koudahl et al., <a href="#bib18" class="reflinks">2023</a>) introduces a constrained FFG (CFFG) notation that visually represents (generalized) FE objectives for AIF. This article (part II) derives message-passing algorithms that minimize (generalized) FE objectives on a CFFG by variational calculus. A comparison between simulated Bethe and generalized FE agents illustrates how the message-passing approach to synthetic AIF induces epistemic behavior on a T-maze navigation task. Extension of the T-maze simulation to learning goal statistics and a multiagent bargaining setting illustrate how this approach encourages reuse of nodes and updates in alternative settings. With a full message-passing account of synthetic AIF agents, it becomes possible to derive and reuse message updates across models and move closer to industrial applications of synthetic AIF.</span>

	<p>Background and objective: Staging Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) with a novel simple classification called MNCD, based on four axes (Motor; Non-motor; Cognition; Dependency) and five stages, correlated with disease severity, patients&amp;amp;rsquo; quality of life and caregivers&amp;amp;rsquo; strain and burden. Our aim was to apply the MNCD classification in advanced PD patients treated with device-aided therapy (DAT). Patients and Methods: A multicenter observational retrospective study of the first patients to start the levodopa-entacapone-carbidopa intestinal gel (LECIG) in Spain was performed (LECIPARK study). The MNCD total score (from 0 to 12) and MNCD stages (from 1 to 5) were collected by the neurologist at V0 (before starting LECIG) and V2 (follow-up visit). Wilcoxon&amp;amp;rsquo;s signed rank and Marginal Homogeneity tests were applied to compare changes from V0 to V2. Results: Sixty-seven PD patients (58.2% males; 69.9 &amp;amp;plusmn; 9.3 years old) with a mean disease duration of 14.4 &amp;amp;plusmn; 6.5 years were included. The mean treatment duration (V2) was 172.9 &amp;amp;plusmn; 105.2 days. At V0, patients were classified as in stage 2 (35.8%), 3 (46.3%) or 4 (17.9%). The frequency of patients in stage 4 decreased to 9% at V2 (p = 0.001). The MNCD total score decreased from 6.27 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.94 at V0 to 5.21 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.23 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). From V0 to V2, the motor (M; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) and non-motor symptom (N; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) burden decreased, and autonomy for the activities of daily living (D; p = 0.005) improved. Conclusions: The MNCD classification could be useful to classify advanced PD patients and to monitor the response to a DAT.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/50/e0166242024?rss=1">The Relationship between White Matter Architecture and Language Lateralization in the Healthy Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Interhemispheric anatomical differences have long been thought to be related to language lateralization. Previous studies have explored whether asymmetries in the diffusion characteristics of white matter language tracts are consistent with language lateralization. These studies, typically with smaller cohorts, yielded mixed results. This study investigated whether connectomic analysis of quantitative anisotropy (QA) and shape features of white matter tracts across the whole brain are associated with language lateralization. We analyzed 1,040 healthy individuals (562 females) from the Human Connectome Project database. Hemispheric language dominance for each participant was quantified using a laterality quotient (LQ) derived from fMRI activation in regions of interest (ROIs) associated with a language comprehension task compared against a math task. A linear regression model was used to examine the relationship between structural asymmetry and functional lateralization. Connectometry revealed a significant negative correlation between LQs and QA of corpus callosum tracts, indicating that higher QA in these regions is associated with bilateral and right hemisphere language representation in frontal and temporal regions. Left language laterality in the temporal lobe was significantly associated with longer right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) and forceps minor tracts. These results suggest that diffusion measures of microstructural architecture as well as geometrical features of reconstructed white matter tracts play a role in language lateralization. People with increased dependence on the right or both frontal hemispheres for language processing may have more developed commissural fibers, which may support more efficient interhemispheric communication.</p>

                <p>Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with no cure, characterized by significant neurodegeneration of striatal GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs). Early stages of the disease are characterized by the loss of dopamine 2 receptor&ndash;expressing MSNs (D2 MSNs) followed by degeneration of dopamine 1 receptor&ndash;expressing MSNs (D1 MSNs), leading to aberrant basal ganglia signaling. While the early degeneration of D2 MSNs and impaired GABAergic transmission are well-documented, potassium chloride cotransporter 2 (KCC2), a key regulator of intracellular chloride (Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>), and therefore GABAergic signaling, has not been characterized in D1 and D2 MSNs in HD. We aimed to investigate whether Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> regulation was differentially altered in D1 and D2 MSNs and may contribute to the early degeneration of D2 MSNs in male and female symptomatic R6/2 mice. We used electrophysiology to record the reversal potential for GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors (<I>E</I><SUB>GABA</SUB>), a read-out for the efficacy of Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> regulation, in striatal D1 and D2 MSNs and their corresponding output structures. During the early symptomatic phase (P55&ndash;P65), Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> impairments were observed in D2 MSNs in R6/2 mice, with no change in D1 MSNs. Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> regulation was also dysfunctional in the globus pallidus externa, resulting in GABA-mediated excitation. When we overexpressed KCC2 in D2 MSNs using AAV-mediated delivery, we delayed the onset of motor impairments in R6/2 mice. We demonstrate that Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> homeostasis is differentially altered in D1 and D2 MSNs and may contribute to the enhanced susceptibility of D2 MSNs during HD progression.</p>

                <p>NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated calcium influx triggers the induction and initial expression of long-term potentiation (LTP). Here we report that in male rodents, ion flux-independent (metabotropic) NMDAR signaling is critical for a third step in the production of enduring LTP, i.e., cytoskeletal changes that stabilize the activity-induced synaptic modifications. Surprisingly, females rely upon estrogen receptor alpha (ER&alpha;) for the metabotropic NMDAR operations used by males. Blocking NMDAR channels with MK-801 eliminated LTP expression in hippocampal field CA1 of both sexes but left intact theta burst stimulation (TBS)-induced actin polymerization within dendritic spines. A selective antagonist (Ro25-6981) of the NMDAR GluN2B subunit had minimal effects on synaptic responses but blocked actin polymerization and LTP consolidation in males only. Conversely, an ER&alpha; antagonist thoroughly disrupted TBS-induced actin polymerization and LTP in females while having no evident effect in males. In an episodic memory paradigm, Ro25-6981 prevented acquisition of spatial locations by males but not females, whereas an ER&alpha; antagonist blocked acquisition in females but not males. Sex differences in LTP consolidation were accompanied by pronounced differences in episodic memory in tasks involving minimal (for learning) cue sampling. Males did better on acquisition of spatial information whereas females had much higher scores than males on tests for acquisition of the identity of cues (episodic "what") and the order in which the cues were sampled (episodic "when"). We propose that sex differences in synaptic processes used to stabilize LTP result in differential encoding of the basic elements of episodic memory.</p>

                <p>Protocadherins, a family of adhesion molecules with a crucial role in cell&ndash;cell interactions, have emerged as key players in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. In particular, growing evidence links genetic alterations in the protocadherin 9 (<I>PCDH9</I>) gene with autism spectrum disorder and major depressive disorder. Furthermore, <I>Pcdh9</I> deletion induces neuronal defects in the mouse somatosensory cortex, accompanied by sensorimotor and memory impairment. However, the synaptic and molecular mechanisms of <I>PCDH9</I> in the brain remain largely unknown, particularly concerning its impact on brain pathology. To address this question, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of PCDH9&rsquo;s role in the male mouse hippocampus at the ultrastructural, biochemical, transcriptomic, electrophysiological, and network levels. We show that PCDH9 mainly localizes at glutamatergic synapses and its expression peaks in the first week after birth, a crucial time window for synaptogenesis. Strikingly, <I>Pcdh9</I> KO neurons exhibit oversized presynaptic terminal and postsynaptic density in the CA1. Synapse overgrowth is sustained by the widespread upregulation of synaptic genes, as revealed by single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq), and the dysregulation of key drivers of synapse morphogenesis, including the SHANK2/CORTACTIN pathway. At the functional level, these structural and transcriptional abnormalities result in increased excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSC) and reduced network activity in the CA1 of <I>Pcdh9</I> KO mice. In conclusion, our work uncovers <I>Pcdh9</I>&rsquo;s pivotal role in shaping the morphology and function of CA1 excitatory synapses, thereby modulating glutamatergic transmission within hippocampal circuits.</p>

                <p>While previous works established the inhibitory role of alpha oscillations during working memory maintenance, it remains an open question whether such an inhibitory control is a top-down process. Here, we attempted to disentangle this issue by considering the spatiotemporal component of waves in the alpha band, i.e., alpha traveling waves. We reanalyzed two pre-existing and open-access EEG datasets (<I>N</I> = 180, 90 males, 80 females, 10 unknown) where participants performed lateralized, visual delayed match-to-sample working memory tasks. In the first dataset, the distractor load was manipulated (2, 4, or 6), whereas in the second dataset, the memory span varied between 1, 3, and 6 items. We focused on the propagation of alpha waves on the anterior-posterior axis during the retention period. Our results reveal an increase in alpha-band forward waves as the distractor load increased, but also an increase in forward waves and a decrease in backward waves as the memory set size increased. Our results also showed a lateralization effect: alpha forward waves exhibited a more pronounced increase in the hemisphere contralateral to the distractors, whereas the reduction in backward waves was stronger in the hemisphere contralateral to the targets. In short, the forward waves were regulated by distractors, whereas targets inversely modulated backward waves. Such a dissociation of goal-related and goal-irrelevant physiological signals suggests the coexistence of bottom-up and top-down inhibitory processes: alpha forward waves might convey a gating effect driven by distractor load, while backward waves may represent direct top-down gain control of downstream visual areas.</p>

                <p>Mutations in human <I>VPS4A</I> are associated with neurodevelopmental defects, including motor delays and defective muscle tone. <I>VPS4A</I> encodes a AAA-ATPase required for membrane scission, but how mutations in <I>VPS4A</I> lead to impaired control of motor function is not known. Here we identified a mutation in zebrafish <I>vps4a</I>, T248I, that affects sensorimotor transformation. Biochemical analyses indicate that the T248I mutation reduces the ATPase activity of Vps4a and disassembly of ESCRT filaments, which mediate membrane scission. Consistent with the role for Vps4a in exosome biogenesis, <I>vps4a<sup>T248I</sup></I> larvae have enlarged endosomal compartments in the CNS and decreased numbers of circulating exosomes in brain ventricles. Resembling the central form of hypotonia in <I>VPS4A</I> patients, motor neurons and muscle cells are functional in mutant zebrafish. Both somatosensory and vestibular inputs robustly evoke tail and eye movements, respectively. In contrast, optomotor responses, vestibulospinal, and acoustic startle reflexes are absent or strongly impaired in <I>vps4a<sup>T248I</sup></I> larvae, indicating a greater sensitivity of these circuits to the T248I mutation. ERG recordings revealed intensity-dependent deficits in the retina, and in vivo calcium imaging of the auditory pathway identified a moderate reduction in afferent neuron activity, partially accounting for the severe motor impairments in mutant larvae. Further investigation of central pathways in <I>vps4a<sup>T248I</sup></I> mutants showed that activation of descending vestibulospinal and midbrain motor command neurons by sensory cues is strongly reduced. Our results suggest that defects in sensorimotor transformation underlie the profound yet selective effects on motor reflexes resulting from the loss of membrane scission mediated by Vps4a.</p>

                <p>Cognitive control is engaged by working memory processes and high-demand situations like antisaccade, where one must suppress a prepotent response. While it is known to be supported by the frontoparietal control network, how intra- and interareal dynamics contribute to cognitive control processes remains unclear. <I>N</I>-Methyl-<scp>d</scp>-aspartate glutamate receptors (NMDARs) play a key role in prefrontal dynamics that support cognitive control. NMDAR antagonists, such as ketamine, are known to alter task-related prefrontal activities and impair cognitive performance. However, the role of NMDAR in cognitive control-related frontoparietal dynamics remains underexplored. Here, we simultaneously recorded local field potentials and single-unit activities from the lateral prefrontal (lPFC) and posterior parietal cortices (PPC) in two male macaque monkeys during a rule-based antisaccade task, with both rule-visible (RV) and rule-memorized (RM) conditions. In addition to altering the E/I balance in both areas, ketamine had a negative impact on rule coding in true oscillatory activities. It also reduced frontoparietal coherence in a frequency- and rule-dependent manner. Granger prediction analysis revealed that ketamine induced an overall reduction in bidirectional connectivity. Among antisaccade trials, a greater reduction in lPFC&ndash;PPC connectivity during the delay period preceded a greater delay in saccadic onset under the RM condition and a greater deficit in performance under the RV condition. Lastly, ketamine compromised rule coding in lPFC neurons in both RV and RM conditions and in PPC neurons only in the RV condition. Our findings demonstrate the utility of acute NMDAR antagonists in understanding the mechanisms through which frontoparietal dynamics support cognitive control processes.</p>

                <p>Barn owls enable investigation of neural mechanisms underlying stimulus selection of concurrent stimuli. The audiovisual space map in the optic tectum (OT), avian homolog of the superior colliculus, encodes relative strength of concurrent auditory stimuli through spike response rate and interneuronal spike train synchrony (STS). Open questions remain regarding stimulus selection in downstream forebrain regions lacking topographic coding of auditory space, including the functional consequences of interneuronal STS on interregional signaling. To this end, we presented concurrent stimuli at different locations and manipulated relative strength while simultaneously recording neural responses from OT and its downstream thalamic target, nucleus rotundus (nRt), in awake barn owls of both sexes. Results demonstrated that broadly spatially tuned nRt units exhibit different spike response patterns to competition depending on spatial tuning preferences. Modeling suggests nRt units integrate convergent inputs from distant locations across midbrain map regions. Additionally, STS within nRt reflects the temporal properties of the strongest stimulus. Furthermore, interregional STS between OT and nRt was strongest when spatial tuning overlap between units across regions was large and when the strongest stimulus location during competition was favorable for units in both regions. Additionally, though gamma oscillations synthesized within OT are weakly propagated within nRt, average gamma power across regions correlates with strength of interregional STS. Overall, we demonstrate that nRt integrates inputs across distant areas of OT, retains spatial information through differences in strength of inputs from various locations of the midbrain map across neurons, and prioritizes coding of identity features to the strongest sound.</p>

                <p>Impairments in synaptic dynamics and stability are observed both in neurodegenerative disorders and in the healthy aging cortex, which exhibits elevated dendritic spine turnover and decreased long-term stability of excitatory connections at baseline, as well as an altered response to plasticity induction. In addition to the discrete gain and loss of synapses, spines also change in size and strength both during learning and in the absence of neural activity, and synaptic volume has been associated with stability and incorporation into memory traces. Furthermore, intrinsic dynamics, an apparently stochastic component of spine volume changes, may serve as a homeostatic mechanism to prevent stabilization of superfluous connections. However, the effects of age on modulation of synaptic weights remain unknown. Using two-photon excitation (2PE) microscopy of spines during chemical plasticity induction in vitro and analyzing longitudinal in vivo 2PE images after a plasticity-inducing manipulation, we characterize the effects of age on volumetric changes of spines of the apical tuft of layer 5 pyramidal neurons of mouse primary somatosensory cortex. Aged mice exhibit decreased volumetric volatility and delayed rearrangement of synaptic weights of persistent connections, as well as greater susceptibility to spine shrinkage in response to chemical long-term depression. These results suggest a deficit in the aging brain&rsquo;s ability to fine-tune synaptic weights to properly incorporate and retain novel memories. This research provides the first evidence of alterations in spine volumetric dynamics in healthy aging and may support a model of impaired processing and learning in the aged somatosensory system.</p>

                <p>Hostility often co-occurs in parents and associates with increased aggression and inattention problems in children. In this population-based cohort of 484 mother&ndash;father&ndash;child neuroimaging trios, we investigated the degree to which associations of prenatal and childhood parental hostility would be associated with maternal, paternal, and child brain structural differences. Also, we examined whether hippocampal volumes of the parents or child mediate the association of prenatal parental hostility with child externalizing behaviors. Maternal and paternal hostility was assessed with the hostility subscale of the Brief Symptom Inventory at three time points: prenatally at 30&nbsp;weeks&rsquo; gestation and when the child was 3 and 10&nbsp;years old. During adolescence assessment wave (age 14), maternal, paternal, and offspring assessment included a magnetic resonance imaging. Child externalizing problems were assessed with Youth Self-Report Child Behavior Checklist. Our findings suggest that maternal and paternal hostility were each associated with smaller gray matter, white matter, and hippocampal volumes of their own and their partner's brain. Prenatal maternal but not paternal hostility was associated with smaller total gray matter, white matter, and hippocampal volumes in the offspring. The child's hippocampal volumes partially mediated the associations of prenatal parental hostility (latent construct) with adolescent externalizing behavior, even after adjusting for prior child externalizing problems. Moreover, parental psychopathology may have long-lasting neurodevelopmental correlates in children that underlie the intergenerational transmission of behavioral problems. The behavior of family members results from a system of interdependent dyadic relationships over time that associate with specific brain structural differences.</p>

                Background We conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the clinical outcomes of the two procedures using a pooled analysis of multiple scales, as there has been dispute among the research on the use of autografts or allografts. Methods We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases for articles that fulfilled our aim. The search strategy was based on three main keywords: “Autograft”, “Allograft”, and “Anterior Cruciate Ligament. The resulting articles were collected and uploaded to Rayyan. All statistical procedures were performed using Review Manager software version 5.4. We conducted a pooled analysis of continuous variables using mean difference (MD), while for dichotomous variables, we used the pooled analysis of odds ratio (OR) by extraction of event and total. Results Autograft showed better outcomes regarding IKDC score compared to allograft with MD of 1.89 (95%CI: 0.37, 3.42. p=0.02), and I2=66%, p=0.002. It was also associated with better Lysholm and Tegner scores with MD of 1.48 (95%CI: 0.19, 2.77, p=0.02), and 0.32 (0.15, 0.49, p=0.0003), respectively, with no significant heterogeneity in both. Autografts were associated with a higher OR of grade 0 in the Lachmann score with an OR of 2.6 (95%CI: 1.26, 5.38, p=0.01), while allografts had higher odds of having grades 2 and 3 (OR, 0.53 (95%CI, 0.31, 0.93; p=0.03), and 0.48 (95%CI: 0.27, 0.84, p=0.01), respectively Conclusion Compared to allografts, the use of autografts in ACL reconstruction is associated with better functional, structural, stability, and satisfaction outcomes, as observed by statistically significant differences in IKDC, Tegner, Lachmann, Pivot shift test, and Lysholm. However, no differences were observed in ROM, Daniel’s one-leg hop test, or Harner’s vertical jump.

                <p>by George E. Kapellos, Hermann J. Eberl, Nicolas Kalogerakis, Patrick S. Doyle, Christakis A. Paraskeva</p>

Multifaceted interactions between marine bacteria and particulate matter exert a major control over the biogeochemical cycles in the oceans. At the microbial scale, free-living bacteria benefit from encountering and harnessing the plumes around nutrient-releasing particles, like phyto-plankton and organic aggregates. However, our understanding of the bacterial potential to reshape these eutrophic microhabitats remains poor, in part because of the traditional focus on fast-moving particles that generate ephemeral plumes with lifetime shorter than the uptake timescale. Here we develop a novel hybrid model to assess the impacts of nutrient uptake by clustered free-living bacteria on the nutrient field around slow-moving particles. We integrate a physics-based nutrient transport model with data-derived bacterial distributions at the single-particle level. We inferred the functional form of the bacterial distribution and extracted parameters from published datasets of <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in silico</i> microscale experiments. Based on available data, we find that exponential radial distribution functions properly represent bacterial microzones, but also capture the trend and variation for the exposure of bacteria to nutrients around sinking particles. Our computational analysis provides fundamental insight into the conditions under which free-living bacteria may significantly reshape plumes around marine aggregates in terms of the particle size and sinking velocity, the nutrient diffusivity, and the bacterial trophic lifestyle (oligotrophs < mesotrophs < copiotrophs). A high potential is predicted for chemotactic copiotrophs like Vibrio sp. that achieve fast uptake and strong clustering. This microscale phenomenon can be critical for the microbiome and nutrient cycling in marine ecosystems, especially during particulate blooms.

Experiments comparing diploids with polyploids and in single grassland sites show that nitrogen and/or phosphorus availability influences plant growth and community composition dependent on genome size; specifically, plants with larger genomes grow faster under nutrient enrichments relative to those with smaller genomes. However, it is unknown if these effects are specific to particular site localities with speciifc plant assemblages, climates, and historical contingencies. To determine the generality of genome size-dependent growth responses to nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization, we combined genome size and species abundance data from 27 coordinated grassland nutrient addition experiments in the Nutrient Network that occur in the Northern Hemisphere across a range of climates and grassland communities. We found that after nitrogen treatment, species with larger genomes generally increased more in cover compared to those with smaller genomes, potentially due to a release from nutrient limitation. Responses were strongest for C<sub>3</sub> grasses and in less seasonal, low precipitation environments, indicating that genome size effects on water-use-efficiency modulates genome size–nutrient interactions. Cumulatively, the data suggest that genome size is informative and improves predictions of species’ success in grassland communities.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>My most important contribution to research on the hippocampus was the discovery that certain phylogenetically ancient subcortical nuclei that carry information about motivation, emotions and autonomic state exert their profound effects on hippocampal functions by selectively innervating interneurons. Diverse effects on network activity patterns and plasticity can be achieved via activating or inhibiting these functionally distinct interneuron types. In the following, I will present the series of serendipitous events that prompted me to shift my research interest from the visual cortex and the basal ganglia to the hippocampus and its subcortical control.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In 1978, Mort Mishkin published a landmark paper describing a monkey model of H.M.'s dense, global amnesia. It depended on a combined removal of the amygdala and hippocampus (the A + H lesion) and a memory test called delayed nonmatching-to-sample (DNMS). My first project examined whether the impairment Mishkin had found in visual memory generalized to tactual stimuli. However, to gain access to the hippocampus and amygdala with 1980s surgical methods, we had to remove the underlying cortex. When we were able to test the effects of bilateral removal of that underlying cortex (the entorhinal and perirhinal cortex, or “rhinal cortex” for short) we obtained a dramatic result. This so-called “control” lesion caused a profound impairment on the DNMS task. A few years later, excitotoxic A + H lesions, which left the rhinal cortex intact, confirmed that removal of the cortical “impediments” had caused the entire memory impairment that Mishkin had observed. These results: (1) forced a reconsideration of the monkey model of global anterograde amnesia; (2) spurred study of the independent contributions of the amygdala, hippocampus, and perirhinal cortex to cognition; and (3) led to the realization that the DNMS task did not test the kinds of memory that H.M. lost after his surgery.</p>

<p>The central complex is a group of interconnected neuropils spanning the midline of the insect brain. In the Madeira cockroach, we identified 27 types of tangential neuron providing input from various brain areas to different compartments of the central complex. The study complements our analysis of neuronal cell types of the cockroach central complex and sheds further light on species-specific modifications of circuitries underlying goal-directed navigation.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Navigating in diverse environments to find food, shelter, or mating partners is an important ability for nearly all animals. Insects have evolved diverse navigational strategies to survive in challenging and unknown environments. In the insect brain, the central complex (CX) plays an important role in spatial orientation and directed locomotion. It consists of the protocerebral bridge (PB), the central body with upper (CBU) and lower division (CBL), and the paired noduli (NO). As shown in various insect species, the CX integrates multisensory cues, including sky compass signals, wind direction, and ego-motion to provide goal-directed vector output used for steering locomotion and flight. While most of these data originate from studies on day-active insects, less is known about night-active species such as cockroaches. Following our analysis of columnar and pontine neurons, the present study complements our investigation of the cellular architecture of the CX of the Madeira cockroach by analyzing tangential neurons. Based on single-cell tracer injections, we provide further details on the internal organization of the CX and distinguished 27 types of tangential neuron, including three types of neuron innervating the PB, six types of the CBL, and 18 types of the CBU. The anterior lip, a brain area unknown in flies and highly reduced in bees, and the crepine are strongly connected to the cockroach CBU in contrast to other insect species. One tangential neuron of the CBU revealed a direct connection between the mushroom bodies and the CBU.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102912">Novel class IIb microcins show activity against Gram-negative ESKAPE and plant pathogens</a></h4>

              
                Interspecies interactions involving direct competition <i>via</i> bacteriocin production play a vital role in shaping ecological dynamics within microbial ecosystems. For instance, the ribosomally produced siderophore bacteriocins, known as class IIb microcins, affect the colonization of host-associated pathogenic <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> species. Notably, to date, only five of these antimicrobials have been identified, all derived from specific <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> strains. We hypothesized that class IIb microcin production extends beyond these specific compounds and organisms. With a customized informatics-driven approach, screening bacterial genomes in public databases with BLAST and manual curation, we have discovered 12 previously unknown class IIb microcins in seven additional <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> species, encompassing phytopathogens and environmental isolates. We introduce three novel clades of microcins (MccW, MccX, and MccZ), while also identifying eight new variants of the five known class IIb microcins. To validate their antimicrobial potential, we heterologously expressed these microcins in <i>E. coli</i> and demonstrated efficacy against a variety of bacterial isolates, including plant pathogens from the genera <i>Brenneria</i>, <i>Gibbsiella,</i> and <i>Rahnella</i>. Two newly discovered microcins exhibit activity against Gram-negative ESKAPE pathogens, <i>i.e., Acinetobacter baumannii</i> or <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa,</i> providing the first evidence that class IIb microcins can target bacteria outside of the <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> family. This study underscores that class IIb microcin genes are more prevalent in the microbial world than previously recognized and that synthetic hybrid microcins can be a viable tool to target clinically relevant drug-resistant pathogens. Our findings hold significant promise for the development of innovative engineered live biotherapeutic products tailored to combat these resilient bacteria.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94778">Hypersensitive intercellular responses of endometrial stromal cells drive invasion in Endometriosis</a></h4>

              
                Endometriosis is a debilitating disease affecting 190 million women worldwide and the greatest single contributor to infertility. The most broadly accepted etiology is that uterine endometrial cells retrogradely enter the peritoneum during menses, implant and form invasive lesions in a process analogous to cancer metastasis. However, over 90% of women suffer retrograde menstruation, but only 10% develop endometriosis, and debate continues as to whether the underlying defect is endometrial or peritoneal. Processes implicated in invasion include: enhanced motility; adhesion to, and formation of gap junctions with, the target tissue. Endometrial stromal (ESCs) from 22 endometriosis patients at different disease stages show much greater invasiveness across mesothelial (or endothelial) monolayers than ESCs from 22 control subjects, which is further enhanced by the presence of EECs. This is due to enhanced responsiveness of endometriosis ESCs to the mesothelium, which induces migration and gap junction coupling. ESC-PMC gap junction coupling is shown to be required for invasion, while coupling between PMCs enhances mesothelial barrier breakdown.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99951">Emergence of power-law distributions in protein-protein interaction networks through study bias</a></h4>

              
                Degree distributions in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks are believed to follow a power law (PL). However, technical and study bias affect the experimental procedures for detecting PPIs. For instance, cancer-associated proteins have received disproportional attention. Moreover, bait proteins in large-scale experiments tend to have many false-positive interaction partners. Studying the degree distributions of thousands of PPI networks of controlled provenance, we address the question if PL distributions in observed PPI networks could be explained by these biases alone. Our findings are supported by mathematical models and extensive simulations and indicate that study bias and technical bias suffice to produce the observed PL distribution. It is, hence, problematic to derive hypotheses about the topology of the true biological interactome from the PL distributions in observed PPI networks. Our study casts doubt on the use of the PL property of biological networks as a modeling assumption or quality criterion in network biology.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100256">Malaria parasites require a divergent heme oxygenase for apicoplast gene expression and biogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Malaria parasites have evolved unusual metabolic adaptations that specialize them for growth within heme-rich human erythrocytes. During blood-stage infection, <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> parasites internalize and digest abundant host hemoglobin within the digestive vacuole. This massive catabolic process generates copious free heme, most of which is biomineralized into inert hemozoin. Parasites also express a divergent heme oxygenase (HO)-like protein (PfHO) that lacks key active-site residues and has lost canonical HO activity. The cellular role of this unusual protein that underpins its retention by parasites has been unknown. To unravel PfHO function, we first determined a 2.8 Å-resolution X-ray structure that revealed a highly α-helical fold indicative of distant HO homology. Localization studies unveiled PfHO targeting to the apicoplast organelle, where it is imported and undergoes N-terminal processing but retains most of the electropositive transit peptide. We observed that conditional knockdown of PfHO was lethal to parasites, which died from defective apicoplast biogenesis and impaired isoprenoid-precursor synthesis. Complementation and molecular-interaction studies revealed an essential role for the electropositive N-terminus of PfHO, which selectively associates with the apicoplast genome and enzymes involved in nucleic acid metabolism and gene expression. PfHO knockdown resulted in a specific deficiency in levels of apicoplast-encoded RNA but not DNA. These studies reveal an essential function for PfHO in apicoplast maintenance and suggest that <i>Plasmodium</i> repurposed the conserved HO scaffold from its canonical heme-degrading function in the ancestral chloroplast to fulfill a critical adaptive role in organelle gene expression.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99040">Recurrent disruption of tumour suppressor genes in cancer by somatic mutations in cleavage and polyadenylation signals</a></h4>

              
                The expression of eukaryotic genes relies on the precise 3'-terminal cleavage and polyadenylation of newly synthesized pre-mRNA transcripts. Defects in these processes have been associated with various diseases, including cancer. While cancer-focused sequencing studies have identified numerous driver mutations in protein-coding sequences, noncoding drivers – particularly those affecting the cis-elements required for pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation – have received less attention. Here, we systematically analysed somatic mutations affecting 3'UTR polyadenylation signals in human cancers using the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) dataset. We found a striking enrichment of cancer-specific somatic mutations that disrupt strong and evolutionarily conserved cleavage and polyadenylation signals within tumour suppressor genes. Further bioinformatics and experimental analyses conducted as a part of our study suggest that these mutations have a profound capacity to downregulate the expression of tumour suppressor genes. Thus, this work uncovers a novel class of noncoding somatic mutations with significant potential to drive cancer progression.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101439">Pharyngeal neuronal mechanisms governing sour taste perception in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                Sour taste, which is elicited by low pH, may serve to help animals distinguish appetitive from potentially harmful food sources. In all species studied to date, the attractiveness of oral acids is contingent on concentration. Many carboxylic acids are attractive at ecologically relevant concentrations but become aversive beyond some maximal concentration. Recent work found that <i>Drosophila</i> ionotropic receptors IR25a and IR76b expressed by sweet-responsive gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) in the labellum, a peripheral gustatory organ, mediate appetitive feeding behaviors toward dilute carboxylic acids. Here, we disclose the existence of pharyngeal sensors in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> that detect ingested carboxylic acids and are also involved in the appetitive responses to carboxylic acids. These pharyngeal sensors rely on IR51b, IR94a, and IR94h, together with IR25a and IR76b, to drive responses to carboxylic acids. We then demonstrate that optogenetic activation of either <i>Ir94a</i><sup>+</sup> or <i>Ir94h</i><sup>+</sup> GRNs promotes an appetitive feeding response, confirming their contributions to appetitive feeding behavior. Our discovery of internal pharyngeal sour taste receptors opens up new avenues for investigating the internal sensation of tastants in insects.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96140">Associative plasticity of granule cell inputs to cerebellar Purkinje cells</a></h4>

              
                Granule cells of the cerebellum make up to 175,000 excitatory synapses on a single Purkinje cell, encoding the wide variety of information from the mossy fibre inputs into the cerebellar cortex. The granule cell axon is made of an ascending portion and a long parallel fibre extending at right angles, an architecture suggesting that synapses formed by the two segments of the axon could encode different information. There are controversial indications that ascending axon (AA) and parallel fibre (PF) synapse properties and modalities of plasticity are different. We tested the hypothesis that AA and PF synapses encode different information, and that the association of these distinct inputs to Purkinje cells might be relevant to the circuit and trigger plasticity, similar to the coincident activation of PF and climbing fibre inputs. Here, by recording synaptic currents in Purkinje cells from either proximal or distal granule cells (mostly AA and PF synapses, respectively), we describe a new form of associative plasticity between these two distinct granule cell inputs. We show for the first time that synchronous AA and PF repetitive train stimulation, with inhibition intact, triggers long-term potentiation (LTP) at AA synapses specifically. Furthermore, the timing of the presentation of the two inputs controls the outcome of plasticity and induction requires NMDAR and mGluR1 activation. The long length of the PFs allows us to preferentially activate the two inputs independently, and despite a lack of morphological reconstruction of the connections, these observations reinforce the suggestion that AA and PF synapses have different coding capabilities and plasticity that is associative, enabling effective association of information transmitted via granule cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96603">Stable sequential dynamics in prefrontal cortex represents subjective estimation of time</a></h4>

              
                Time estimation is an essential prerequisite underlying various cognitive functions. Previous studies identified ‘sequential firing’ and ‘activity ramps’ as the primary neuron activity patterns in the medial frontal cortex (mPFC) that could convey information regarding time. However, the relationship between these patterns and the timing behavior has not been fully understood. In this study, we utilized in vivo calcium imaging of mPFC in rats performing a timing task. We observed cells that showed selective activation at trial start, end, or during the timing interval. By aligning long-term time-lapse datasets, we discovered that sequential patterns of time coding were stable over weeks, while cells coding for trial start or end showed constant dynamism. Furthermore, with a novel behavior design that allowed the animal to determine individual trial interval, we were able to demonstrate that real-time adjustment in the sequence procession speed closely tracked the trial-to-trial interval variations. And errors in the rats’ timing behavior can be primarily attributed to the premature ending of the time sequence. Together, our data suggest that sequential activity maybe a stable neural substrate that represents time under physiological conditions. Furthermore, our results imply the existence of a unique cell type in the mPFC that participates in the time-related sequences. Future characterization of this cell type could provide important insights in the neural mechanism of timing and related cognitive functions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94425">Impaired myofibroblast proliferation is a central feature of pathologic post-natal alveolar simplification</a></h4>

              
                Premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have impaired alveolar gas exchange due to alveolar simplification and dysmorphic pulmonary vasculature. Advances in clinical care have improved survival for infants with BPD, but the overall incidence of BPD remains unchanged because we lack specific therapies to prevent this disease. Recent work has suggested a role for increased transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) signaling and myofibroblast populations in BPD pathogenesis, but the functional significance of each remains unclear. Here, we utilize multiple murine models of alveolar simplification and comparative single-cell RNA sequencing to identify shared mechanisms that could contribute to BPD pathogenesis. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals a profound loss of myofibroblasts in two models of BPD and identifies gene expression signatures of increased TGFβ signaling, cell cycle arrest, and impaired proliferation in myofibroblasts. Using pharmacologic and genetic approaches, we find no evidence that increased TGFβ signaling in the lung mesenchyme contributes to alveolar simplification. In contrast, this is likely a failed compensatory response, since none of our approaches to inhibit TGFβ signaling protect mice from alveolar simplification due to hyperoxia while several make simplification worse. In contrast, we find that impaired myofibroblast proliferation is a central feature in several murine models of BPD, and we show that inhibiting myofibroblast proliferation is sufficient to cause pathologic alveolar simplification. Our results underscore the importance of impaired myofibroblast proliferation as a central feature of alveolar simplification and suggest that efforts to reverse this process could have therapeutic value in BPD.

">Frequency-specific theta states in the hippocampus modulate population activity with respect to behavioural context</a></h4>

              
                Neural activity reflects both external stimuli and the brain's internal state, which shapes how information is processed and perceived. An example of modulation of neural responses by network states is phase-precession in the hippocampus, where the phase of theta oscillations affects the firing of single neurons (place cells) and its relation to the external world. Here, we examine a different form of oscillation-to-neuron modulation, where frequency and power of the oscillation, instead of phase, modulate neural firing patterns at the population level. We refer to this as ensemble pattern modulation. To study this effect, we use electrophysiological recordings of rats performing an odour-memory (non-spatial) task. Using a data-driven model, we identified two distinct theta states: low-power-lower-theta (LPLT) and high-power-higher-theta (HPHT). Through decoding analyses, we found that these states differentially modulate hippocampal neural ensemble activity, in this case reflective of the trial outcome. This suggests that amplitude and frequency variations within theta oscillations may reconfigure neural firing at the network level to support distinct cognitive functions.

">Mapping neuropeptide sigaling in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Neuropeptides are functionally diverse signaling molecules in the brain, regulating a wide range of basal bodily and cognitive processes. Despite their importance, the distribution and function of neuropeptides in the human brain remains underexplored. Here we comprehensively map the organization of human whole-brain neuropeptide receptors across multiple levels of description; from molecular and cellular embedding to mesoscale connectivity and macroscale cognitive specialization. Using gene transcription as a proxy, we reconstruct a topographic cortical and subcortical atlas of neuropeptide receptors for 38 neuropeptide receptors, across 14 different neuropeptide families. We find that most neuropeptide receptors are highly expressed either in cortex or subcortex, delineating an anatomical cortical-subcortical gradient. Neuropeptides preferentially co-localize with metabotropic neurotransmitters, suggesting a system-wide correspondence between slow-acting molecular signaling mechanisms. Mapping neuropeptide receptors and their cognate ligands onto white-matter connectomes, we demonstrate that specific neuropeptides families shape electrophysiological and haemodynamic inter-regional connectivity. To investigate the behavioural consequences of distributed neuropeptide systems, we apply meta-analytic decoding to neuropeptide maps and show a gradient of functions, from sensory-cognitive to reward and bodily functions. Finally, evolutionary analysis indicates extended positive selection for neuropeptides in early mammals, suggesting that refinement of neuropeptides coincides with the emergence of neocortex and higher cognitive function. Collectively, these results show that the neuropeptide receptors are highly organized across the human brain and closely intertwined with multiple features of brain structure and function.

">Sex-Specific Regulation of Behavioral Responses to Single Prolonged Stress: Role of PACAP</a></h4>

              
                Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating condition in which a traumatic experience triggers symptoms related to re-experiencing, avoidance, arousal, and mood dysregulation. PTSD negatively impacts 6% of people during their lifetime, with women being disproportionally affected and exhibiting different, more severe symptoms than men. Despite this widespread impact, the molecular mechanisms underlying PTSD and its sex differences remain poorly understood. Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide (PACAP) is a neuropeptide which participates in fine-tuning circuitry throughout the brain and has been associated with PTSD in humans, especially in women. Here, we use Single Prolonged Stress (SPS), an animal model of PTSD, to explore the roles of PACAP and sex in PTSD-like behaviors. Specifically, a PACAP agonist or antagonist was infused into the infralimbic (IL) prefrontal cortex, a region key to regulating fear- and anxiety-related behaviors, prior to SPS in male and female rats. One week later, rats were tested in open field/novel object, elevated plus maze, and social interaction. Utilizing a behavioral indexing method, we were able to uncover SPS effects in PTSD-related behavioral domains that were differentially impacted by PACAP manipulations in males and females. While both sexes exhibited increased threat avoidance and decreased threat assessment following SPS, females increased sociability while males decreased sociability. Males also appeared to be protected by IL PACAP antagonism while female SPS phenotypes were exacerbated by IL PACAP agonism. Furthermore, RNAscope revealed that PACAP in the prefrontal cortex responds differently to SPS in males and females. Together, these findings suggest complex relationships between SPS, sex, and IL PACAP which may have important implications for treating PTSD in men and women.

">Serotonin system development and adult function are regulated by GDNF</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive functions, neuropsychiatric disorders and behaviors from feeding to mood relate to the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) system. We report that expression of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), a known potent stimulator of the brain dopamine system, correlates with serotonergic markers in humans, and increased GDNF defines a subset of psychiatric patients with a characteristic 5-HT-related gene expression pattern. A similar ~1.5- to 2-fold upregulation of endogenous GDNF expression in mice increases brain 5-HT levels and function, both developmentally and during adulthood, and modulates response to fluoxetine. Notably, increasing GDNF more than approximately 2-fold does not increase 5-HT further and instead produces an inverted U- shaped curve of 5-HT levels, suggesting why the GDNF/5-HT correlation has remained controversial. Collectively, our data indicate that GDNF levels fine-tune 5-HT system development and adult function while excess GDNF exclusively associates with neuropsychiatric illness, making it an important target for future research.

">Triggered Temptations: A New Procedure to Compare Reward-Seeking Behaviour Induced by Discriminative and Conditioned Stimuli in Rats</a></h4>

              
                Rationale: Environmental cues guide animals towards resources vital for survival but can also drive maladaptive reward-seeking behaviours, as in gambling and eating disorders. While conditioned stimuli (CSs) are paired with reward delivery after reward-seeking actions, discriminative stimuli (DSs) signal reward availability independent of behaviour. Objective: We introduce a procedure to compare CS and DS effects on reward-seeking behaviour, in the same subjects within a single session. Methods: Female and male Sprague-Dawley rats learned to self-administer sucrose. During each session, DS+ trials signaled that lever pressing would produce sucrose paired with a CS+, and DS- trials signaled no sucrose and a CS-. Next, in the absence of sucrose, we assessed the ability of the cues to i) reinforce lever pressing and ii) increase sucrose seeking when presented response-independently. We also assessed the effects of the mGlu2/3 receptor agonist LY379268 and d-amphetamine on cue-induced sucrose seeking. Results: By the end of self-administration training, lever pressing peaked during DS+ trials and dropped during DS- trials. The DS+ was a conditioned reinforcer of sucrose seeking in both sexes, whereas the CS+ was more effective in males. Response-independent presentations of the DS+ invigorated sucrose seeking in both sexes, whereas the CS+ was effective only in males. LY379268 suppressed DS+-triggered sucrose seeking in females, with no effect in males. D-amphetamine enhanced sucrose seeking non-specifically across cue conditions in males, with no effect in females. Conclusions: Our new trial-based procedure can be used to identify unique and similar mechanisms underlying DS and CS influences on appetitive behaviour.

">Stimulus-repetition effects on macaque V1 and V4 microcircuits explain gamma-synchronization increase</a></h4>

              
                Under natural conditions, animals repeatedly encounter the same visual scenes, objects or patterns repeatedly. These repetitions constitute statistical regularities, which the brain captures in an internal model through learning. A signature of such learning in primate visual areas V1 and V4 is the gradual strengthening of gamma synchronization. We used a V1-V4 Dynamic Causal Model (DCM) to explain visually induced responses in early and late epochs from a sequence of several hundred grating presentations. The DCM reproduced the empirical increase in local and inter-areal gamma synchronization, revealing specific intrinsic connectivity effects that could explain the phenomenon. In a sensitivity analysis, the isolated modulation of several connection strengths induced increased gamma. Comparison of alternative models showed that empirical gamma increases are better explained by (1) repetition effects in both V1 and V4 intrinsic connectivity (alone or together with extrinsic) than in extrinsic connectivity alone, and (2) repetition effects on V1 and V4 population input rather than output gain. The best input gain model included effects in V1 granular and superficial excitatory populations and in V4 granular and deep excitatory populations. Our findings are consistent with gamma reflecting bottom-up signal precision, which increases with repetition and, therefore, with predictability and learning.

">Microglia from patients with multiple sclerosis display a cell-autonomous immune activation state</a></h4>

              
                Aberrant and sustained activation of microglia is implicated in the progression and severity of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, whether intrinsic alterations in microglial function impact the pathogenesis of this disease remains unclear. We conducted transcriptomic and functional analyses of microglia-like cells (iMGLs) differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with MS (pwMS) to answer this question. We generated iPSCs from six pwMS showing increased microglial activity via translocator protein (TSPO)-PET imaging. We demonstrated that the differentiated iMGL transcriptional profile resembled the microglial signature found in MS lesions. Importantly, compared with healthy controls, MS iMGLs presented cell-autonomous differences in their regulation of inflammation, both in the basal state and following inflammatory lipopolysaccharide challenge. Through transcriptomic profiling, we showed that MS iMGLs display increased expression of genes known to be upregulated in MS microglia. Furthermore, upregulated genes in MS iMGLs were associated with immune receptor activation, antigen presentation, and the complement system, with known MS implications. Finally, functional analyses indicated that the transcriptional changes in MS iMGLs corresponded with alterations in the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and increased phagocytosis. Together, our results provide evidence of putative cell-autonomous microglial activation in pwMS and identify transcriptomic and functional changes that recapitulate the phenotypes observed in vivo in microglia from pwMS. These findings indicate that MS disease-specific iPSCs are valuable tools for studying disease-specific microglial activation in vitro and highlight microglia as potential therapeutic targets in MS.

">ATF5-Dependent GDF15 Expression Mediates Anesthesia-Induced Neuroprotection Against Stroke</a></h4>

              
                The incidence of perioperative stroke, a rare but severe complication, is increasing in aging populations. Although anesthetics such as sevoflurane may provide protective preconditioning against ischemic injury, clinical outcomes have been inconsistent. In this study, we demonstrated that sevoflurane-induced neuroprotection is associated with the upregulation of genes involved in the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) and mitochondrial bioenergetic metabolism. Our findings emphasize the critical role of ATF5, a key transcription factor, in mediating these protective effects. Specifically, we observed that sevoflurane preconditioning significantly upregulates ATF5 and its downstream target GDF15 (a regulator of mitochondrial function) in the cerebral cortex. Notably, we found that this mechanistic pathway was not activated in the brain of aged mice, suggesting that age-specific strategies may be necessary for reducing the risk of perioperative stroke. Considering the steadily increasing age of patients, therapeutic approaches that enhance mitochondrial function in the aged brain may provide additional protection against perioperative stroke.

">The intersection of inflammation and DNA damage as a novel axis underlying the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorders</a></h4>

              
                Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) affects 1 in 36 children and is characterized by repetitive behaviors and difficulties in social interactions and social communication. The etiology of ASD is extremely heterogeneous, with a large number of ASD cases that are of unknown or complex etiology, which suggests the potential contribution of epigenetic risk factors. In particular, epidemiological and animal model studies suggest that inflammation during pregnancy could lead to an increased risk of ASD in the offspring. However, the molecular mechanisms that contribute to ASD pathogenesis in relation to maternal inflammation during pregnancy in humans are underexplored. Several pro-inflammatory cytokines have been associated with increased autistic-like behaviors in animal models of maternal immune activation, including IL-17A. Using a combination of ASD patient lymphocytes and stem cell-derived human neurons exposed to IL-17A we discovered a shared molecular signature that highlights a metabolic and translational node that could lead to altered neuronal excitability. Further, our work on human neurons brings forward the possibility that defects in the DNA damage response could be underlying the effect of IL-17A on human excitatory neurons, linking exacerbated unrepaired DNA damage to the pathogenicity of maternal inflammation in connection to ASD.

                Cell types are fundamental to the functional organization of the human brain, yet the specific cell clusters contributing to functional connectomes remain unclear. Using human whole-brain single-cell RNA sequencing data, we investigated the relationship between cortical cell cluster distribution and functional connectomes. Our analysis identified dozens of cell clusters significantly associated with resting-state network connectivity, with excitatory neurons predominantly driving positive correlations and inhibitory neurons driving negative correlations. Many of these cell clusters are also conserved in macaques. Notably, functional network connectivity is predicted by cellular communication among these clusters. We further identified cell clusters linked to various neuropsychiatric disorders, with several clusters implicated in multiple conditions. Comparative analysis of schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder revealed distinct expression patterns, highlighting disease-specific cellular mechanisms. These findings underscore the critical role of specific cell clusters in shaping functional connectomes and their implications for neuropsychiatric diseases.

">Reduced and Redundant: Information Processing of Prediction Errors during Sleep</a></h4>

              
                During sleep, the human brain transitions to a 'sentinel processing mode', enabling the continued processing of environmental stimuli despite the absence of consciousness. Going beyond prior research, we employed advanced information-theoretic analyses, including mutual information (MI) and co-information (co-I), alongside event-related potential (ERP) and temporal generalization analyses (TGA), to characterize auditory prediction error processing across wakefulness and sleep. We hypothesized that a shared neural code would be present across sleep stages, with deeper sleep being associated with reduced information content and increased information redundancy. To investigate this, twenty-nine young healthy participants were exposed to an auditory 'local-global' oddball paradigm during wakefulness and continued during an 8-hour sleep opportunity monitored via polysomnography. We focused on 'local' mismatch responses to a deviating fifth tone following four standard tones. ERP analyses showed that prediction error processing continued throughout all sleep stages (N1-N3, REM). Mutual information analyses revealed a substantial reduction in the amount of encoded prediction error information during sleep, although ERP amplitudes increased with deeper NREM sleep. In addition, co-information analyses showed that neural dynamics became increasingly redundant with increasing sleep depth. Temporal generalisation analyses revealed a largely shared neural code between N2 and N3 sleep, although it differed between wakefulness and sleep. Here, we showed how the neural code of the 'sentinel processing mode' changes from wake to light to deep sleep and REM, characterised by more redundant and less rich neural information in the human cortex as consciousness wanes. This altered stimulus processing reveals how neural information changes with the changes of consciousness states as we traverse the night.

">Muscle length modulates recurrent inhibition and post-activation depression differently according to contraction type</a></h4>

              
                It is well documented that, in soleus, motoneuron output and the effectiveness of activated Ia afferents to discharge alpha-motoneurons both decrease during eccentric contractions. Evidence suggests that these regulations can be explained by (1) recurrent inhibition and (2) greater post-activation depression by primary afferent depolarization. However, the influence of muscle length on the regulation of the effectiveness of Ia afferents to discharge alpha-motoneurons observed during eccentric contractions remains unclear. We conducted a study on 16 healthy young individuals. We used simple and conditioned Hoffmann reflex with different conditioning techniques such as paired H reflex, D1 method and heteronymous Ia facilitation coupled with electromyography during eccentric, isometric and concentric contractions at long, intermediate and short soleus muscle lengths. Our results confirm that during eccentric contraction the effectiveness of Ia afferents to discharge alpha-motoneurons decreases only at intermediate and short muscle lengths but is similar between all contraction types at long muscle length. Findings are similar for recurrent inhibition. Post-activation depression is significantly more pronounced during eccentric contractions compared with isometric and concentric contractions at long muscle length. Our analysis also shows that recurrent inhibition and post-activation depression are greater at long muscle length compared with short muscle length, whatever the contraction type. These new findings demonstrate an important influence of muscle length on the activity of spinal regulatory mechanisms and the effectiveness of activated Ia afferents to discharge alpha-motoneurons during eccentric contractions.

">Default mode and motor networks facilitate early learning of implicit motor sequences: a multimodal MR spectroscopy and fMRI study</a></h4>

              
                Learning new motor skills is a fundamental process that involves the sequencing of actions. Skill develops with practice and time, and manifests as performance that is fast and accurate. Although we know that learning can occur through an implicit process in the absence of conscious awareness, and across multiple temporal scales, however, the precise neural mechanisms mediating implicit motor sequence learning remain poorly understood. Similarly, the capacity for interventions with known influence on learning and memory, such as cardiovascular exercise, to facilitate implicit learning is yet to be clearly established. Here, we investigated the neuroplasticity of implicit motor sequence learning and the effect of acute exercise priming. Healthy adults (39.5% female) aged 22.55 +- 2.69 years were allocated to either a high-intensity exercise (HIIT) group (n = 16) or to a very low-intensity control group (n = 17). Following exercise, participants performed a serial reaction time task. MR spectroscopy estimates of sensorimotor gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were acquired before and after exercise, and during task performance, and resting-state fMRI was acquired at the end of the protocol. We show that early stages of learning are linked to default mode network connectivity, while the overall degree of learning following sustained practice is associated with motor network connectivity. Sensorimotor GABA concentration was linked to the early stages of learning, and GABA concentration was modulated following HIIT, although the two were not related. Overall, via integration of multiple neuroimaging modalities we demonstrate that interactions between hippocampal and motor networks underlie implicit motor sequence learning.

">Neural mechanisms underlying the effects of cognitive fatigue on physical effort-based decision-making</a></h4>

              
                Fatigue is a state of exhaustion that influences our willingness to engage in effortful tasks. While both physical and cognitive exertion can cause fatigue, there is a limited understanding of how fatigue in one exertion domain (e.g., cognitive) affects decisions to exert in another (e.g., physical). We use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity while human participants make decisions to exert prospective physical effort before and after engaging in a cognitively fatiguing working memory task. Using computational modeling of choice behavior, we show that fatiguing cognitive exertion increases participants' subjective costs of physical effort compared to a baseline rested state. We describe how signals related to fatiguing cognitive exertion in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex influence physical effort value computations instantiated by the insula, thereby increasing an individual's subjective valuation of prospective physical effort while cognitively fatigued. Our results support the idea of a general fatigue signal that integrates exertion-specific information to guide effort-based choice.

">Complex opioid driven modulation of glutamatergic and cholinergic neurotransmission in a GABAergic brain nucleus associated with emotion, reward and addiction.</a></h4>

              
                The medial habenula (mHb)/interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) circuitry is resident to divergent molecular, neurochemical and cellular components which, in concert, perform computations to drive emotion, reward and addiction behaviors. Although housing one of the most prominent mu opioid receptor (mOR) expression levels in the brain, remarkably little is known as to how they impact mHb/IPN circuit function at the granular level. In this study, our systematic functional and pharmacogenetic analyses demonstrate that mOR activation attenuates glutamatergic signaling whilst producing an opposing potentiation of glutamatergic/cholinergic co-transmission mediated by mHb substance P and cholinergic neurons, respectively. Intriguingly, this latter non-canonical augmentation is developmentally regulated only emerging during later postnatal stages. Further, specific potassium channels act as a molecular brake on nicotinic receptor signaling in the IPN with the opioid mediated potentiation of this arm of neurotransmission being operational only following attenuation of Kv1 function. Thus, we reveal a remarkable complex role that mORs play in modulating the salience of distinct afferent inputs and transmitter modalities that ultimately influence synaptic recruitment of common downstream GABAergic IPN neurons. Together, these observations provide a framework for future investigations aimed at identifying the neural underpinnings of maladaptive behaviors that can emerge when endogenous or exogenous opioids, including potent synthetic analogs such as fentanyl, modulate or hijack this circuitry during the vulnerable stages of adolescence and in adulthood.

                Vascular dementia (VaD) refers to a variety of dementias driven by cerebrovascular disease and is the second leading cause of dementia globally. VaD may be caused by ischemic strokes, intracerebral hemorrhage, and/or cerebral small vessel disease, commonly identified as white matter hyperintensities on MRI. The mechanisms underlying these white matter lesions in the periventricular brain are poorly understood. In this study we perform an extensive transcriptomic analysis on human postmortem periventricular white matter lesions in patients with VaD with the goal of identifying molecular pathways in the disease. We find increased cellular stress responses in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and oligodendrocyte precursor cells as well as transcriptional and translational repression in microglia in our dataset. We show that several genes identified by GWAS as being associated with white matter disease are differentially expressed in cells in VaD. Finally, we compare our dataset to an independent snRNAseq dataset of PVWM in VaD and a scRNAseq dataset on human iPSC-derived microglia exposed to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD). We identify the increase of the heat shock protein response as a conserved feature of VaD across celltypes and show that this increase is not linked to OGD exposure. Overall, our study is the first to show that increased heat shock protein responses are a common feature of lesioned PVWM in VaD and may represent a potential therapeutic target.

">The Functional Connectome Mediating Circadian Synchrony in the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus</a></h4>

              
                Circadian rhythms in mammals arise from the spatiotemporal synchronization of ~20,000 neuronal clocks in the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN). While anatomical, molecular, and genetic approaches have revealed diverse cell types and signaling mechanisms, the network wiring that enables SCN cells to communicate and synchronize remains unclear. To overcome the challenges of revealing functional connectivity from fixed tissue, we developed MITE (Mutual Information & Transfer Entropy), an information theory approach that infers directed cell-cell connections with high fidelity. By analyzing 3447 hours of continuously recorded clock gene expression from 9011 cells in 17 mice, we found that the functional connectome of SCN was highly conserved bilaterally and across mice, sparse, and organized into a dorsomedial and a ventrolateral module. While most connections were local, we discovered long-range connections from ventral cells to cells in both the ventral and dorsal SCN. Based on their functional connectivity, SCN cells can be characterized as circadian signal generators, broadcasters, sinks, or bridges. For example, a subset of VIP neurons acts as hubs that generate circadian signals critical to synchronize daily rhythms across the SCN neural network. Simulations of the experimentally inferred SCN networks recapitulated the stereotypical dorsal-to-ventral wave of daily PER2 expression and ability to spontaneously synchronize, revealing that SCN emergent dynamics are sculpted by cell-cell connectivity. We conclude that MITE provides a powerful method to infer functional connectomes, and that the conserved architecture of cell-cell connections mediates circadian synchrony across space and time in the mammalian SCN.

">LC3-associated endocytosis facilitates extracellular Tau aggregate internalization and degradation in microglia</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundMicroglia, which are resident phagocytic cells in the brain, are involved in the active clearance of microbes, misfolded proteins, and cell debris, among others. In Alzheimers disease, microglia play a pivotal role in clearing extracellular amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) plaques and intracellular Tau aggregates from the brain. Microglial cells have several mechanisms for Tau internalization, including macropinocytosis, heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), dynamin- dependent endocytosis, and receptor-mediated endocytosis. Internalized Tau seeds either undergo proteasomal or lysosomal degradation or are exocytosed into the extracellular space via exosomes. Microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)-associated endocytosis (LANDO) is a recently discovered microglial mechanism for an effective clearance of A{beta} aggregates and alleviates neurodegeneration in murine Alzheimers disease. Several microglial receptors are reported to be involved in misfolded A{beta} and Tau aggregate internalization such as triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cell 2 (TREM-2), P2Y purinoceptor 12 (P2Y12R), C- X3-C motif chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1), etc.

MethodsIn this study, we report the LANDO of Tau monomers and aggregates by murine microglial cells, which are further degraded by lysosomal fusion. LANDO of extracellular Tau is demonstrated by several biochemical and cell-biology studies including western blotting, fluorescence and confocal imaging of microglial cells.

ResultsWe analyzed microglial activation by measuring the upregulation of Ionized Calcium- binding Adapter Molecule 1 (Iba-1) expression. Later, we demonstrated the LANDO of human full-length Tau species, where LC3 colocalizes with internalized Tau, followed by lysosomal degradation by microglia. The accumulation of internalized Tau in the perinuclear region of the cell in the presence of chloroquine supports phagolysosomal fusion and degradation.

ConclusionHence, we concluded that microglia internalize extracellular Tau species via LANDO, which further undergoes degradation via the lysosomal pathway.

">Storage and transport of labile iron is mediated by lysosomes in axons and dendrites of hippocampal neurons</a></h4>

              
                Iron dyshomeostasis in neurons, involving iron accumulation and abnormal redox balance, is implicated in neurodegeneration. In particular, labile iron, a highly reactive pool of intracellular iron, plays a prominent role in iron-induced neurological damage. However, the mechanisms governing the detoxification and transport of labile iron within neurons are not fully understood. This study investigates the storage and transport of labile ferrous iron Fe(II) in cultured primary rat hippocampal neurons. Iron distribution was studied using live cell confocal microscopy with a selective labile Fe(II) fluorescent dye, and synchrotron X-ray fluorescence microscopy (SXRF) for total iron distribution. Fluorescent labelling of the axon initial segment and of lysosomes allowed iron distribution to be correlated with these subcellular compartments. The results show that labile Fe(II) is stored in lysosomes within somas, axons and dendrites and that lysosomal labile Fe(II) is transported retrogradely and anterogradely along axons and dendrites. In addition, we have developed a methodological workflow to quantify labile Fe(II) relative to total iron in neurites. This method is based on correlative imaging of fluorescence microscopy of labile Fe(II) combined with quantitative elemental mapping of total iron by SXRF. Quantitative analysis revealed that after Fe(II) exposure, lysosomal Fe(II) accounts for a small but significant percentage of the total iron content in neurites. These result suggest that after exposure to labile Fe(II), iron is mainly present in a non-reactive form in neurons, while the smaller fraction of reactive labile Fe(II) is stored in lysosomes and can be transported along dendrites and axons.

">Deep predictive coding networks partly capture neural signatures of short-term temporal adaptation in human visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Predictive coding is a leading theory of cortical function which posits that the brain continually makes predictions of incoming sensory stimuli using a hierarchical network of top-down and bottom-up connections. This theory is supported by prior work showing that PredNet, a deep learning network designed according to predictive coding principles, exhibits several characteristics of neural responses commonly observed in primate visual cortex. However, one ubiquitous neural phenomenon that has not yet been investigated is short-term visual adaptation: the adjustment of neural responses over time when exposed to static visual inputs that are either prolonged or directly repeated. Here, we examine whether PredNet exhibits two neural signatures of temporal adaptation previously observed in intracranial recordings of human participants viewing prolonged and repeated stimuli (Brands et al., 2024). We find that, like human visual cortex, PredNet adapts to static images, evidenced by subadditive temporal response summation: a non-linear accumulation of response magnitudes when prolonging stimulus durations, which results from neurally plausible transient-sustained dynamics in the unit activation time courses. However, PredNet activations also show a systematic response to stimulus offsets, which is absent in the human neural data. For repeated stimuli, PredNet shows slight response suppression for any two images presented in quick succession, but no repetition suppression, a comparatively stronger response reduction for identical than for non-identical image pairs that is robustly observed throughout human visual cortex. We show that these results are stable across multiple training datasets and two different types of loss computation. Lastly, in both PredNet and the neural data, we find a relationship between temporal adaptation and visual input properties, showing that temporally sustained activity is enhanced for more complex scenes containing clutter. All together, these results suggest that the emergent temporal dynamics in the PredNet only partly align with neural data and are linked to low-level properties of the visual input rather than high-level predictions arising from top-down processes.

">Comparison of Transcriptional Activation by Corticosteroids of Human MR (Ile-180) and Human MR Haplotype (Ile180Val)</a></h4>

              
                While the classical function of human mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is to regulate sodium and potassium homeostasis through aldosterone activation of the kidney MR, the MR also is highly expressed in the brain, where the MR is activated by cortisol in response to stress. Here, we report the half-maximal response (EC50) and fold-activation by cortisol, aldosterone and other corticosteroids of human MR rs5522, a haplotype containing valine at codon 180 instead of isoleucine found in the wild-type MR (Ile-180). MR rs5522 (Val-180) has been studied for its actions in the human brain involving coping with stress and depression. We compared the EC50 and fold-activation by corticosteroids of MR rs5522 and wild-type MR transfected into HEK293 cells with either the TAT3 promoter or the MMTV promoter. Parallel studies investigated the binding of MR antagonists, spironolactone and progesterone, to MR rs5522. In HEK293 cells with the MMTV promotor, MR rs5522 had a slightly higher EC50 compared to wild-type MR and a similar level of fold-activation for all corticosteroids. In contrast, in HEK293 cells with the TAT3 promoter, MR 5522 had a higher EC50 (lower affinity) and higher fold-activation for cortisol compared to wild-type MR (Ile-180), while compared to wild-type MR, the EC50s of MR rs5522 for aldosterone and corticosterone were slightly lower and fold-activation was higher. Spironolactone and progesterone had similar antagonist activity for MR rs5522 and MR (Ile-180) in the presence of MMTV and TAT3 promoters in HEK293 cells.

">The effect of speech masking on the human subcortical response to continuous speech</a></h4>

              
                Auditory masking--the interference of the encoding and processing of an acoustic stimulus imposed by one or more competing stimuli--is nearly omnipresent in daily life, and presents a critical barrier to many listeners, including people with hearing loss, users of hearing aids and cochlear implants, and people with auditory processing disorders. The perceptual aspects of masking have been actively studied for several decades, and particular emphasis has been placed on masking of speech by other speech sounds. The neural effects of such masking, especially at the subcortical level, have been much less studied, in large part due to the technical limitations of making such measurements. Recent work has allowed estimation of the auditory brainstem response (ABR), whose characteristic waves are linked to specific subcortical areas, to naturalistic speech. In this study, we used those techniques to measure the encoding of speech stimuli that were masked by one or more simultaneous other speech stimuli. We presented listeners with simultaneous speech from one, two, three, or five simultaneous talkers, corresponding to a range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNR; Clean, 0, -3, and -6 dB), and derived the ABR to each talker in the mixture. Each talker in a mixture was treated in turn as a target sound masked by other talkers, making the response quicker to acquire. We found consistently across listeners that ABR wave V amplitudes decreased and latencies increased as the number of competing talkers increased.

">Anti-obesity compounds, Semaglutide and LiPR, do not change the proportion of human and mouse POMC+ neurons</a></h4>

              
                Anti-obesity medications (AOMs) have become one of the most prescribed drugs in human medicine. While AOMs are known to impact adult neurogenesis in the hypothalamus, their effects on the functional maturation of hypothalamic neurons remain unexplored. Given that AOMs target neurons in the Medial Basal Hypothalamus (MBH), which play a crucial role in regulating energy homeostasis, we hypothesized that AOMs might influence the functional maturation of these neurons, potentially rewiring the MBH. To investigate this, we exposed hypothalamic neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to Semaglutide and lipidized prolactin-releasing peptide (LiPR), two anti-obesity compounds. Contrary to our expectations, treatment with Semaglutide or LiPR during neuronal maturation did not affect the proportion of anorexigenic, Pro-opiomelanocortin-expressing (POMC+) neurons. Additionally, LiPR did not alter the morphology of POMC+ neurons or the expression of selected genes critical for the metabolism or development of anorexigenic neurons. Furthermore, LiPR did not impact the proportion of adult-generated POMC+ neurons in the mouse MBH. Taken together, these results suggest that AOMs do not influence the functional maturation of anorexigenic hypothalamic neurons.

">SegCSR: Weakly-Supervised Cortical Surfaces Reconstruction from Brain Ribbon Segmentations</a></h4>

              
                Deep learning-based cortical surface reconstruction (CSR) methods heavily rely on pseudo ground truth (pGT) generated by conventional CSR pipelines as supervision, leading to dataset-specific challenges and lengthy training data preparation. We propose a new approach for reconstructing multiple cortical surfaces using weak supervision from brain MRI ribbon segmentations. Our approach initializes a midthickness surface and then deforms it inward and outward to form the inner (white matter) and outer (pial) cortical surfaces, respectively, by jointly learning diffeomorphic flows to align the surfaces with the boundaries of the cortical ribbon segmentation maps. Specifically, a boundary surface loss drives the initialization surface to the target inner and outer boundaries, and an inter-surface normal consistency loss regularizes the pial surface in challenging deep cortical sulci. Additional regularization terms are utilized to enforce surface smoothness and topology. Evaluated on two large-scale brain MRI datasets, our weakly-supervised method achieves comparable or superior CSR accuracy and regularity to existing supervised deep learning alternatives.

">A decision-theoretic model of multistability: perceptual switches as internal actions</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual multistability has been studied for centuries using a diverse collection of approaches. Insights derived from this phenomenon range from core principles of information processing, such as perceptual inference, to high-level concerns, such as visual awareness. The dominant computational explanations of perceptual multistability are based on the Helmholtzian view of perception as inverse inference. However, these approaches struggle to account for the crucial role played by value, e.g., with percepts paired with reward dominating for longer periods than unpaired ones. In this study, we formulate perceptual multistability in terms of dynamic, value-based, choice, employing the formalism of a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We use binocular rivalry as an example, considering different explicit and implicit sources of reward (and punishment) for each percept. The resulting values are time-dependent and influenced by novelty as a form of exploration. The solution of the POMDP is the optimal perceptual policy, and we show that this can replicate and explain several characteristics of binocular rivalry, ranging from classic hallmarks such as apparently spontaneous random switches with approximately gamma-distributed dominance periods to more subtle aspects such as the rich temporal dynamics of perceptual switching rates. Overall, our decision-theoretic perspective on perceptual multistability not only accounts for a wealth of unexplained data, but also opens up modern conceptions of internal reinforcement learning in service of understanding perceptual phenomena, and sensory processing more generally.

	<p>Background/objectives: Among the developmental sciences, discovery in neuroscience has underpinned research innovations and made a significant contribution to knowledge translation. With the growth of neuroscience discovery, policymakers and practitioner workforces have adopted &amp;amp;lsquo;neuro-informed&amp;amp;rsquo; in decisions targeting the delivery of human, social, and economic wellbeing. Methods: In this scoping review, we examined the use and conceptualization of neuro-informed policy and practice (NPP) over the last two decades. We aim to establish a working definition of NPP and identify the key knowledge bases underpinning the application of NPP, with a specific focus on children and young people. Results: A total of 116 publications related to NPP were identified across academic and policy sources. Publications derived from diverse fields (e.g., psychology, social policy, medicine, urban planning). Health and Education were the most common target areas for NPP; however, applications of NPP to social services, law, and physical environments were also identified. Despite the growth in NPP, concept definitions of NPP were limited and primarily tautological. A four-stage process of concept definition was used to develop a working definition of NPP applicable to different systems, workforces, and contexts. By applying content analysis, 12 distinct knowledge bases underpinning NPP were identified. Conclusion: Our scoping review highlights the importance of defining the concept of neuro-informed policy and practice, extending beyond the brain or individual in isolation to include consideration of the brain in context.</p>

	<p>Background/objectives: Cerebrospinal infusion studies indicate that cerebrospinal fluid outflow resistance (Rout) is elevated in normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). These studies assume that the cerebrospinal formation rate (CSFfr) does not vary during the infusion. If the CSFfr were to increase during the infusion then the Rout would be overestimated. Previous estimates of the CSFfr in NPH have suggested a low figure. More recent estimates of the CSFfr suggest that it is increased, indicating it probably varies with measurement technique. This would bring the estimation of Rout into doubt. A previous paper using a lumped parameter model suggested the CSFfr could vary with the capillary transmural pressure (TMP) in this disease, suggesting a possible solution to this problem. The current study investigates the possibility that the intracranial pressure manipulation occurring during an infusion study may vary the capillary TMP and CSFfr. Methods: A lumped parameter model previously developed to describe the hydrodynamics of NPH was modified to investigate the effect of CSF pressure manipulation during infusion studies and to describe how the CSFfr could vary depending on the technique used. Results: The model indicates the capillary transmural pressure is normal in NPH and increases during an infusion study. CSF drainage at the end of an infusion study similarly increases the capillary TMP and, presumably, the CSFfr by increasing the interstitial fluid production. Conclusions: The model suggests that infusion studies and draining CSF increases the CSFfr in NPH compared to earlier techniques. Allowing for an increase in the CSFfr suggests that infusion overestimates the Rout by between 23 and 33%. This study indicates that further research may be required into the utility and accuracy of infusion studies and their ability to diagnose NPH.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Those with the genetic disorder Down syndrome are at high risk of developing Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. Previous work shows group differences in magnetic resonance spectroscopy metabolite measures in adults with Down syndrome who have Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease-related dementia compared to those who do not. In this pilot study, we assess relationships between metabolites and measures related to dementia status in a sample of adults with Down syndrome. Methods: Seventeen adults with Down syndrome were scanned using a 3 tesla MRI scanner. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy scans focused on the hippocampus and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex. Metabolites of interest, including myo-inositol and N-acetyl-aspartate, were correlated with scores on the Dementia Questionnaire for People with Learning Disabilities, cortical thickness, and a measure of cognitive ability. In addition, cortical thickness was compared to an age- and sex-matched cohort of 17 previously scanned adults without Down syndrome. Results: Metabolite measures were not significantly related to cognitive/behavioral measures or to cortical thickness in this small cohort. Participants with Down syndrome showed widespread increases in cortical thickness compared to controls, even after accounting for potential differences in grey matter/white matter contrast. Conclusions: Metabolite values were not related to two continuous measures that have previously been associated with dementia status in those with Down syndrome.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The present pilot study tested and reports the Italian adaptation of the Reading the Mind in Film test (RMF), an ecological test for assessing, in Italian adults with and without Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC), complex emotion and mental state recognition in natural settings and everyday situations. Method: A sample of young adults with Autism Spectrum Condition (with ASC; n = 22), attending a filmmaking course at a post-diploma school (Scuola Futuro Lavoro) took part in the study and was compared with a control group of neurotypical university students (without ASC; n = 22). All participants underwent individual testing and completed the Italian version of the Autism Questionnaire before performing the Italian version of both the RMF task and the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET). The latter, widely used to evaluate the ability to detect what someone else is thinking or feeling from the eye region. Results: The findings of the control group were in line with the original study, demonstrating the validity and reliability of the translation and the dubbing procedure of the RMF test. However, no main significant differences in performance were found between the two groups. Conclusions: Such results suggest that taking a course in film and video making may have helped the autistic students learn how to recognize mental states.</p>

                <p>Neuropathic pain (NP) caused by sciatic nerve injury can significantly impact the quality of life of patients. The M1 phenotype of microglia has been reported to promote the progression of NP. Procaine is a lipid-soluble local anesthetic drug that exerts narcotic analgesic effects. Nevertheless, the detailed effect of procaine in NP is not clear. In order to explore the role of procaine in the polarization of NP microglia, HAPI cells were exposed to LPS to polarize into M1 type. In addition, the number of the M1 phenotype of HAPI cells was assessed using flow cytometry. The binding site between CCL5 and STAT3 was explored using the dual luciferase assay. Furthermore, in vivo experiments were applied for testing the impact of procaine on NP. LPS significantly inhibited HAPI cell viability, which was reversed by procaine. Consistently, procaine alleviated LPS-induced upregulation of inflammatory factors. Additionally, it significantly inhibited HAPI cell M1 polarization induced by LPS. Meanwhile, overexpression of STAT3 was able to promote HAPI cells M1 polarization through binding with the CCL5 promoter region and activating the PI3K/Akt signaling. Procaine could alleviate the painful behavior of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) rats by modulating the STAT3/CCL5 axis and inhibiting microglia M1 polarization. In conclusion, procaine alleviated the painful behavior of CFA rats via regulating the STAT3/CCL5 axis and inhibiting microglia M1 polarization. Hence, the research might provide a novel agent for NP treatment.</p>

                <p>Overexpression of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (<I>eIF4E</I>) gene has been associated with excessive stereotypic behaviors and reduced sociability, which manifest as autism-like social cognitive deficits. However, the precise mechanisms by which <I>eIF4E</I> overexpression insufficiently induces these autism-like behaviors and the specific brain regions implicated remain insufficiently understood. Oxytocin (OXT), a neurotransmitter known for its role in social behavior, has been proposed to modulate certain autism-related symptoms by influencing microglial function and attenuating neuroinflammation. Nonetheless, the contributions of the hippocampus and oxytocin in the content of <I>eIF4E</I> overexpression-induced autistic behaviors remain elucidated. To investigate this issue, researchers utilized the three-chamber social interaction test, the open-field test, and the Morris water maze to evaluate the social cognitive behaviors of the two groups of mice. Additionally, ELISA, immunofluorescence, Western blotting, and qRT-PCR were employed to quantify oxytocin levels and assess hippocampal microglial activation. The results indicate that overexpression of <I>eIF4E</I> in mice is associated with significant impairments in social cognition, alongside pronounced marked hyperactivation of hippocampal microglia.</p>

                Background Bacterial infections in the Intensive Care Units are a threat to the lives of critically ill patients. Their vulnerable immunity predisposes them to developing bacteria-associated sepsis, deteriorating their already fragile health. In the face of increasing antibiotics resistance, the problem of bacterial infection in ICU is worsening. Surveillance of bacterial infections in ICUs and drug resistance will help to understand the magnitude of the problem it poses and inform response strategies. We assessed bacterial infections in ICU setting by identifying prevalent Gram-negative bacterial species and characterized their antibiotic susceptibility patterns. Methods Cross-sectional samples collected from Kenyatta National Hospital ICU between January and June 2021 were cultured and phenotypic identification of culture-positive samples performed using VITEK 2. Antibiotic susceptibility patterns were determined based on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (AST) results. Cephalosporin-resistant Gram-negative bacteria were assessed by PCR to detect the presence of ESBL genes including ( bla CTX-M, bla SHV, bla TEM, bla OXA) Results and discussion Out of the 168 Gram-negative isolates, Acinetobacter baumanii was the most abundant (35%). Other isolates that were present at frequencies more than 15% are Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia. coli. A. baumaniii is known to be a notorious bacterium in ICU due to its multidrug resistance nature. Indeed, A. baumanii isolates from Kenyatta National Hospital showed significantly high level of phenotypic resistance. Concordant with the high level of phenotypic resistance, we found high carriage of the ESBL genes among the isolates analysed in this study. Moreover, majority of isolates harboured all the four ESBL genes. Conclusion A high rate of phenotypic and genetic resistance was detected among the tested isolates. Resistance to cephalosporins was primarily driven by acquisition of the ESBL genes. The high prevalence rate of ESBL genes in ICU bacterial isolates shown in this study has a important implication for ICU patient management and general antibiotics use.

                Background This article investigates how people invoked the concept of dignity on Twitter (X) during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a secondary focus on mentions of dignity in the context of older adults and ageing. Methods We report the results of a study that combines text analytic and interpretive approaches to analyze word clusters and dignity-based themes in a cross-national sample of 1,946 original Twitter (X) messages posted in 2020. Results The study finds that dignity discourse on Twitter advances five major themes: (a) recognizing dignity as a fundamental right, (b) upholding the dignity of essential workers, (c) preserving the dignity of at-risk populations, (d) preventing cascading disasters that exacerbate dignity’s decline, and (e) attending to death, dignity, and the sanctity of life. Conclusions Within the discourse, dignity emerged as a right and a policy target (improving or maximizing dignity in various groups). Further, the posts focusing on older adults and dignity demonstrated that the impacts of COVID-19 disproportionately impacted older adults, particularly those with greater care needs and financial insecurity or lower socioeconomic status.

                Background Partner violence is a significant issue affecting women’s health, particularly their breastfeeding practices in healthcare settings. Despite a considerable body of research on this topic, there is a need for a systematic overview of the existing literature to explore its thematic and structural developments. Methods This scientometric analysis covers a period of 45 years (1977-2022) and identifies 415 peer-reviewed articles published in English before 2023 from the Scopus database. The articles were included if they engaged with themes related to partner violence, healthcare settings, breastfeeding, and mothers, using predefined search terms and filters. Bibliometric data were decoded and visualized using VOSviewer and RStudio to analyze and visualize the scientific dialogue, trends, patterns, and networks in the literature regarding partner violence and its impact on breastfeeding mothers in healthcare settings. Results A total of 415 articles were identified, revealing key trends in research on partner violence and breastfeeding in healthcare settings. Seven pivotal clusters emerged: domestic violence and screening, nursing and substance abuse, pregnancy and depression, breastfeeding and HIV, childbirth and quality of care during the COVID-19 pandemic, nurses’ role in women’s Health, and Women’s Health and Violence. These clusters reflect key thematic areas, emphasizing the multifaceted nature of the research, with a particular focus on mental health, reproductive health, and the role of healthcare providers. Emerging themes, such as the impact of COVID-19 and HIV on breastfeeding practices, further highlight the evolving research priorities. Conclusions This analysis provides a panoramic overview of the existing literature, revealing intricate thematic structures and collaboration networks within the research on partner violence and breastfeeding mothers in healthcare settings. The study not only sheds light on the historical and current states of research but also pinpoints potential future directions, thereby assisting scholars and policymakers in navigating and prioritizing subsequent investigative endeavors.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Circuit influences on the midbrain dopamine system are crucial to adaptive behavior and cognition. Recent developments in the study of neuropeptide systems have enabled high-resolution investigations of the intersection of neuromodulatory signals with basal ganglia circuitry, identifying the nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) endogenous opioid peptide system as a prospective regulator of striatal dopamine signaling. Using a prepronociceptin-Cre reporter mouse line, we characterized highly selective striosomal patterning of <i>Pnoc</i> mRNA expression in mouse dorsal striatum, reflecting the early developmental expression of <i>Pnoc</i>. In the ventral striatum, <i>Pnoc</i> expression in the nucleus accumbens core was grouped in clusters akin to the distribution found in striosomes. We found that Pnoc<sup>tdTomato</sup> reporter cells largely comprise a population of dopamine receptor D1 (<i>Drd1</i>) expressing medium spiny projection neurons localized in dorsal striosomes, known to be unique among striatal projection neurons for their direct innervation of midbrain dopamine neurons. These findings provide a new understanding of the intersection of the N/OFQ system among basal ganglia circuits with particular implications for developmental regulation or wiring of striato-nigral circuits.</p>

<p>Deletion mutant of <i>Irx3</i>/<i>5</i> shows the cochlear base fused with the saccule, whereas in wild-type mice, the saccule is separated from the base by the ductus reuniens. <i>Irx3</i> and <i>Irx5</i> are potential evolutionary branch-point genes necessary for balance-sound segregation.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>A gene cadre orchestrates the normal development of sensory and non-sensory cells in the inner ear, segregating the cochlea with a distinct tonotopic sound frequency map, similar brain projection, and five vestibular end-organs. However, the role of genes driving the ear development is largely unknown. Here, we show double deletion of the Iroquois homeobox 3 and 5 transcription factors (<i>Irx3/5</i> DKO) leads to the fusion of the saccule and the cochlear base. The overlying otoconia and tectorial membranes are absent in the <i>Irx3/5</i> DKO inner ear, and the primary auditory neurons project fibers to both the saccule and cochlear hair cells. The central neuronal projections from the cochlear apex-base contour are not fully segregated into a dorsal and ventral innervation in the <i>Irx3/5</i> DKO cochlear nucleus, obliterating the characteristic tonotopic auditory map. Additionally, <i>Irx3/5</i> deletion reveals a pronounced cochlear-apex-vestibular “vestibular-cochlear” nerve (VCN) bilateral connection that is less noticeable in wild-type control mice. Moreover, the incomplete segregation of apex and base projections that expands fibers to connect with vestibular nuclei. The results suggest the mammalian cochlear apex is a derived lagena reminiscent of sarcopterygians. Thus, <i>Irx3 and 5</i> are potential evolutionary branch-point genes necessary for balance-sound segregation, which fused into a saccule-cochlea organization.</p>

                Background Muscle injuries are the most frequent in football and may lead to the end of a player’s career. Many studies have evaluated the effectiveness of prevention programs for all injury types. Few studies have evaluated the effects of exercise on muscle injuries. The aim of this study is to report, through a systematic review of research of high level of proof (randomized controlled trial) the efficacy of preventive programs for muscle injuries for football players. Methods A documentary search was conducted in October 2022 from three databases: Medline via its PubMed interface, Google Scholar, and COCHRANE databases. We only included original articles published between October 2012 and October 2022 with a high level of evidence. The research was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses criteria. The target population consisted of professional and semi-professional footballers. The intervention in question was structured injury preventive protocols, including specific training or pre-established protocols such as the FIFA 11+ program, compared to each other or with regular training sessions. The main outcomes were the incidence rates of muscle injuries and severe injury in each group, as well as the time loss to injury. Results Seven randomized controlled trials with a high level of evidence confirmed using the PEDRO scale were included. There were 3815 male professional football players. There was heterogeneity in the age, hours of exposure, and duration of the intervention. The prevention protocols used were FIFA 11+, bounding exercises, NHE, and stretching exercises. Structured exercises significantly reduce the severity of muscle injury and, consequently, time loss to injury. Discussion Despite the diversity of prevention programs, teams still lack standardized programs. Structured exercises, such as FIFA 11+ and bounding exercises, which combine strengthening, body kinesthesic awareness, and neuromuscular control, reduce the incidence and severity of muscle injury. FIFA 11+ is the first and most complete structured program, but lacks some exercises, such as adductor strengthening. Conclusion This review showed the interest in structured exercises in reducing severity and time loss to injury in professional football players. It shows that effective MI prevention program should combine variable structured programs taking into consideration risk evaluation. Registration This review was registered on 8/17/2023 in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews under the reference code CRD42023452202.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/10-645/v4?src=rss">Preliminary Evidence of Human Plasmodium in Domestic Animals from a Malaria-Endemic Region in Indonesia [version 4; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background In Indonesia, malaria incidence is at a high rate despite maximum preventive efforts. Therefore, this study aims to determine the possibility of a Plasmodium reservoir among domestic animals in malaria-endemic areas. Methods Animal blood was collected using EDTA tubes, then smeared and stained with Giemsa for Plasmodium microscopic identification. About 10 μl of blood was dropped on to a filter paper to capture Plasmodium DNA. Nested PCR was used for parasite molecular detection, while Plasmodium species were identified using the sequenced DNA. Results A total of 208 and 62 animal blood samples were collected from Gaura village, West Sumba and Fakfak village, West Papua, Indonesia respectively. In total, 32 samples from Gaura contained P. falciparum or P. vivax, while the Plasmodium percentage in buffalo, horse, goat, and dogs were 20.7%, 14.3%, 5.8%, 16.7%, respectively. P. knowlesi was not found in any of the samples, and no other species were detected in 18 pig blood samples. Conclusion The human Plasmodium DNA in domestic animals within malaria-endemic regions suggests a potential link to the persistence and high prevalence of malaria in these areas. While the findings suggest a potential role of domestic animals in malaria transmission, they remain preliminary and do not definitively establish domestic animals as reservoirs. Further research is necessary to confirm these findings and to better understand the contribution of domestic animals to the transmission dynamics of malaria.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is a serious neurologic condition associated with death or neurodevelopmental impairments. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is routinely used for neuroprognostication, but there is substantial subjectivity and uncertainty about neurodevelopmental outcome prediction. We sought to develop an objective and automated approach for the analysis of newborn brain MRI to improve the accuracy of prognostication.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We created an anatomic MRI template from a sample of 286 infants treated with therapeutic hypothermia, and labeled the deep gray-matter structures. We extracted quantitative information, including shape-related information, and information represented by complex patterns (radiomic measures), from each of these structures in all infants. We then trained an elastic net model to use either only these measures, only the infants’ demographic and laboratory data, or both, to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes, as measured by the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development at 18 months of age.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among those infants for whom Bayley scores were available for cognitive, language, and motor outcomes, we found sets of MRI-based measures that could predict their Bayley scores with correlations that were greater than the correlations based on only the demographic and laboratory data, explained more of the variance in the observed scores, and generated a smaller error; predictions based on the combination of the demographic-laboratory and MRI-based measures were similar or marginally better.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings show that machine learning models using MRI-based measures can predict neurodevelopmental outcomes in neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy across all neurodevelopmental domains and across the full spectrum of outcomes. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

     alt="Supraspinal Plasticity of Axonal Projections From the Motor Cortex After Spinal Cord Injury in Macaques"/>
<p>We investigated the reorganization of motor circuits in macaque monkeys following spinal cord injury. Our results showed that projections from the contralesional (affected) motor cortex (M1) to the putamen (Pu), lateral reticular nucleus (LRN), and pontine nucleus (Pn) on the normally nondominant side increased compared to those from the ipsilesional (unaffected) M1. Such reorganization of the corticofugal fibers might be used for the recruitment of the cortico-basal ganglia loop and cortico-cerebellar loop involving the M1 on the ipsilesional side.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>During recovery following spinal cord injury in the macaque, the sensorimotor cortex on the same side as the injury (ipsilesional, unaffected) becomes activated and plays a role in guiding movements of the affected hand. Effective regulation of these movements by the ipsilesional sensorimotor cortex would depend not only on its ability to send motor commands directly to target muscles but also on coordinated functioning with higher-level motor planning systems such as the cortico-basal ganglia and cortico-cerebellar loops. In this study, using anterograde viral tracers, we analyzed the axonal trajectories of corticofugal fibers from the contralesional (affected) primary motor cortex (M1) at the brainstem level in two macaque monkeys with sub-hemisection spinal cord injury at the mid-cervical level. They showed considerable recovery of grasping movements after injury. We found an increase in axonal projections from the contralesional M1 to the contralateral putamen, ipsilateral lateral reticular nucleus, and contralateral pontine nucleus compared to projections from the ipsilesional (unaffected) M1. We propose that these increased projections from the contralesional M1 to the striatum and precerebellar nuclei on the nondominant side may function to recruit the ipsilesional M1 through the cortico-basal ganglia and cortico-cerebellar loops to control hand movements on the affected side during recovery.</p>

     alt="Anxiety-Like Behaviors in Mice Unmasked: Revealing Sex Differences in Anxiety Using a Novel Light-Heat Conflict Test"/>
<p>Tests for mouse anxiety-related behavior do not reliably recapitulate sex differences in human anxiety. The TIDAL conflict test comprises one dark plate that heats to uncomfortable temperatures, and one illuminated-isothermic plate. Female mice persist on the dark-heated plate longer than males; thus, TIDAL reveals clinically relevant sex differences in anxiety-related behavior.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Anxiety and chronic pain afflict hundreds of millions worldwide. Anxiety and pain are more prevalent in females compared to males. Unfortunately, robust sex differences in human anxiety are not recapitulated in rodent tests, and results from rodent pain studies frequently fail to translate clinically. Therefore, there is a need to develop tests that reflect the differential salience of anxiety or pain-related stimuli between the sexes. Accordingly, here we introduce the Thermal Increments Dark–Light (TIDAL) conflict test. The TIDAL test places an anxiety-relevant stimulus (dark vs. illuminated chamber) in conflict with a heat-related stimulus (incrementally heated vs. isothermic chamber); mice freely explore both apparatus chambers. Here, we aim to determine whether the TIDAL conflict test reveals in mice underappreciated sex differences in anxiety and/or heat sensitivity. We establish in four distinct experiments that females on the TIDAL conflict test persist substantially longer on the dark-heated plate, suggesting that female mice exhibit elevated anxiety-like behavior. Mice more strongly prefer the heated-dark plate on the TIDAL conflict test compared to control thermal place preference with both chambers illuminated. We also reveal that an anxiety-relieving drug, paroxetine, reduces mouse preference for the heating dark plate, supporting the validity of the TIDAL test. Therefore, our new TIDAL conflict test reliably unmasks the relative salience of anxiety (vs. heat sensitivity): mice that are female exhibit robust anxiety-like behaviors not consistently observed in classical tests. Future studies should incorporate TIDAL and other conflict tests to better understand rodent behavior and to identify mechanisms underlying anxiety and pain.</p>

                The Cell Reports team recently attended the Keystone Symposia on Biological Condensates. The meeting was a great opportunity to learn about the latest developments in this exciting area. In this Voices piece, we asked three researchers in the field how the landscape of biomolecular condensate research is evolving. They emphasize the need for new theoretical frameworks and experimental approaches. They discuss the complex nature of biomolecular condensates formed via phase separation, their emergent properties, and the implications for cellular function and disease.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88810">Male rats emit aversive 44-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations during prolonged Pavlovian fear conditioning</a></h4>

              
                Rats are believed to communicate their emotional state by emitting two distinct types of ultrasonic vocalizations. The first is long ‘22-kHz’ vocalizations (&gt;300 ms, &lt;32-kHz) with constant frequency, signaling aversive states, and the second is short ‘50-kHz’ calls (&lt;150 ms, &gt;32 kHz), often frequency-modulated, in appetitive situations. Here, we describe aversive vocalizations emitted at a higher pitch by male Wistar and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) in an intensified aversive state – prolonged fear conditioning. These calls, which we named ‘44-kHz’ vocalizations, are long (&gt;150 ms), generally at a constant frequency (usually within 35–50-kHz range) and have an overall spectrographic image similar to 22-kHz calls. Some 44-kHz vocalizations are comprised of both 22-kHz-like and 44-kHz-like elements. Furthermore, two separate clustering methods confirmed that these 44-kHz calls can be separated from other vocalizations. We observed 44-kHz calls to be associated with freezing behavior during fear conditioning training, during which they constituted up to 19.4% of all calls and most of them appeared next to each other forming uniform groups of vocalizations (bouts). We also show that some of rats’ responses to the playback of 44-kHz calls were more akin to that of aversive calls, for example, heart rate changes, whereas other responses were at an intermediate level between aversive and appetitive calls. Our results suggest that rats have a wider vocal repertoire than previously believed, and current definitions of major call types may require reevaluation. We hope that future investigations of 44-kHz calls in rat models of human diseases will contribute to expanding our understanding and therapeutic strategies related to human psychiatric conditions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92672">Tissue-resident natural killer cells support survival in pancreatic cancer through promotion of cDC1-CD8 T activity</a></h4>

              
                The immunosuppressive microenvironment in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) prevents tumor control and strategies to restore anti-cancer immunity (i.e. by increasing CD8 T-cell activity) have had limited success. Here, we demonstrate how inducing localized physical damage using ionizing radiation (IR) unmasks the benefit of immunotherapy by increasing tissue-resident natural killer (trNK) cells that support CD8 T activity. Our data confirms that targeting mouse orthotopic PDAC tumors with IR together with CCR5 inhibition and PD1 blockade reduces E-cadherin positive tumor cells by recruiting a hypoactive NKG2D<sup>-ve</sup> NK population, phenotypically reminiscent of trNK cells, that supports CD8 T-cell involvement. We show an equivalent population in human single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) PDAC cohorts that represents immunomodulatory trNK cells that could similarly support CD8 T-cell levels in a cDC1-dependent manner. Importantly, a trNK signature associates with survival in PDAC and other solid malignancies revealing a potential beneficial role for trNK in improving adaptive anti-tumor responses and supporting CCR5 inhibitor (CCR5i)/αPD1 and IR-induced damage as a novel therapeutic approach.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99854">Ligand-coupled conformational changes in a cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel revealed by time-resolved transition metal ion FRET</a></h4>

              
                Cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (CNBD) ion channels play crucial roles in cellular-signaling and excitability and are regulated by the direct binding of cyclic adenosine- or guanosine-monophosphate (cAMP, cGMP). However, the precise allosteric mechanism governing channel activation upon ligand binding, particularly the energetic changes within domains, remains poorly understood. The prokaryotic CNBD channel SthK offers a valuable model for investigating this allosteric mechanism. In this study, we investigated the conformational dynamics and energetics of the SthK C-terminal region using a combination of steady-state and time-resolved transition metal ion Förster resonance energy transfer (tmFRET) experiments. We engineered donor-acceptor pairs at specific sites within a SthK C-terminal fragment by incorporating a fluorescent noncanonical amino acid donor and metal ion acceptors. Measuring tmFRET with fluorescence lifetimes, we determined intramolecular distance distributions in the absence and presence of cAMP or cGMP. The probability distributions between conformational states without and with ligand were used to calculate the changes in free energy (ΔG) and differences in free energy change (ΔΔG) in the context of a simple four-state model. Our findings reveal that cAMP binding produces large structural changes, with a very favorable ΔΔG. In contrast to cAMP, cGMP behaved as a partial agonist and only weakly promoted the active state. Furthermore, we assessed the impact of protein oligomerization and ionic strength on the structure and energetics of the conformational states. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of time-resolved tmFRET in determining the conformational states and the ligand-dependent energetics of the SthK C-terminal region.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89361">A novel image segmentation method based on spatial autocorrelation identifies A-type potassium channel clusters in the thalamus</a></h4>

              
                Unsupervised segmentation in biological and non-biological images is only partially resolved. Segmentation either requires arbitrary thresholds or large teaching datasets. Here, we propose a spatial autocorrelation method based on Local Moran’s <i>I</i> coefficient to differentiate signal, background, and noise in any type of image. The method, originally described for geoinformatics, does not require a predefined intensity threshold or teaching algorithm for image segmentation and allows quantitative comparison of samples obtained in different conditions. It utilizes relative intensity as well as spatial information of neighboring elements to select spatially contiguous groups of pixels. We demonstrate that Moran’s method outperforms threshold-based method in both artificially generated as well as in natural images especially when background noise is substantial. This superior performance can be attributed to the exclusion of false positive pixels resulting from isolated, high intensity pixels in high noise conditions. To test the method’s power in real situation, we used high power confocal images of the somatosensory thalamus immunostained for Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 (A-type) voltage-gated potassium channels in mice. Moran’s method identified high-intensity Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 ion channel clusters in the thalamic neuropil. Spatial distribution of these clusters displayed strong correlation with large sensory axon terminals of subcortical origin. The unique association of the special presynaptic terminals and a postsynaptic voltage-gated ion channel cluster was confirmed with electron microscopy. These data demonstrate that Moran’s method is a rapid, simple image segmentation method optimal for variable and high noise conditions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102592">Paracrine rescue of MYR1-deficient Toxoplasma gondii mutants reveals limitations of pooled in vivo CRISPR screens</a></h4>

              
                <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> is an intracellular parasite that subverts host cell functions via secreted virulence factors. Up to 70% of parasite-controlled changes in the host transcriptome rely on the MYR1 protein, which is required for the translocation of secreted proteins into the host cell. Mice infected with MYR1 knock-out (KO) strains survive infection, supporting a paramount function of MYR1-dependent secreted proteins in <i>Toxoplasma</i> virulence and proliferation. However, we have previously shown that MYR1 mutants have no growth defect in pooled <i>in vivo</i> CRISPR-Cas9 screens in mice, suggesting that the presence of parasites that are wild-type at the <i>myr1</i> locus in pooled screens can rescue the phenotype. Here, we demonstrate that MYR1 is not required for the survival in IFN-γ-activated murine macrophages, and that parasites lacking MYR1 are able to expand during the onset of infection. While ΔMYR1 parasites have restricted growth in single-strain murine infections, we show that the phenotype is rescued by co-infection with wild-type (WT) parasites <i>in vivo</i>, independent of host functional adaptive immunity or key pro-inflammatory cytokines. These data show that the major function of MYR1-dependent secreted proteins is not to protect the parasite from clearance within infected cells. Instead, MYR-dependent proteins generate a permissive niche in a paracrine manner, which rescues ΔMYR1 parasites within a pool of CRISPR mutants in mice. Our results highlight an important limitation of otherwise powerful <i>in vivo</i> CRISPR screens and point towards key functions for MYR1-dependent <i>Toxoplasma</i>-host interactions beyond the infected cell.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97356">Molecular, cellular, and developmental organization of the mouse vomeronasal organ at single cell resolution</a></h4>

              
                We have generated single cell transcriptomic atlases of vomeronasal organs (VNO) from juvenile and adult mice. Combined with spatial molecular imaging, we uncover a distinct, previously unidentified class of cells that express the vomeronasal receptors (VRs) and a population of canonical olfactory sensory neurons in the VNO. High-resolution trajectory and cluster analyses reveal the lineage relationship, spatial distribution of cell types, and a putative cascade of molecular events that specify the V1r, V2r, and OR lineages from a common stem cell population. The expression of vomeronasal and olfactory receptors follow power law distributions, but there is high variability in average expression levels between individual receptor and cell types. Substantial co-expression is found between receptors across clades, from different classes, and between olfactory and VRs, with nearly half from pairs located on the same chromosome. Interestingly, the expression of V2r, but not V1r, genes is associated with various transcription factors, suggesting distinct mechanisms of receptor choice associated with the two cell types. We identify association between transcription factors, surface axon guidance molecules, and individual VRs, thereby uncovering a molecular code that guides the specification of the vomeronasal circuitry. Our study provides a wealth of data on the development and organization of the accessory olfactory system at both cellular and molecular levels to enable a deeper understanding of vomeronasal system function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94929">Lipid discovery enabled by sequence statistics and machine learning</a></h4>

              
                Bacterial membranes are complex and dynamic, arising from an array of evolutionary pressures. One enzyme that alters membrane compositions through covalent lipid modification is MprF. We recently identified that <i>Streptococcus agalactiae</i> MprF synthesizes lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol (Lys-PG) from anionic PG, and a novel cationic lipid, lysyl-glucosyl-diacylglycerol (Lys-Glc-DAG), from neutral glycolipid Glc-DAG. This unexpected result prompted us to investigate whether Lys-Glc-DAG occurs in other MprF-containing bacteria, and whether other novel MprF products exist. Here, we studied protein sequence features determining MprF substrate specificity. First, pairwise analyses identified several streptococcal MprFs synthesizing Lys-Glc-DAG. Second, a restricted Boltzmann machine-guided approach led us to discover an entirely new substrate for MprF in <i>Enterococcus</i>, diglucosyl-diacylglycerol (Glc<sub>2</sub>-DAG), and an expanded set of organisms that modify glycolipid substrates using MprF. Overall, we combined the wealth of available sequence data with machine learning to model evolutionary constraints on MprF sequences across the bacterial domain, thereby identifying a novel cationic lipid.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96997">Value construction through sequential sampling explains serial dependencies in decision making</a></h4>

              
                Deciding between a pair of familiar items is thought to rely on a comparison of their subjective values. When the values are similar, decisions take longer, and the choice may be inconsistent with stated value. These regularities are thought to be explained by the same mechanism of noisy evidence accumulation that leads to perceptual errors under conditions of low signal to noise. However, unlike perceptual decisions, subjective values may vary with internal states (e.g. desires, priorities) that change over time. This raises the possibility that the apparent stochasticity of choice reflects changes in value rather than mere noise. We hypothesized that these changes would manifest in serial dependencies across decision sequences. We analyzed data from a task in which participants chose between snack items. We developed an algorithm, <i>Reval</i>, that revealed significant fluctuations of the subjective values of items within an experimental session. The dynamic values predicted choices and response times more accurately than stated values. The dynamic values also furnished a superior account of the BOLD signal in ventromedial prefrontal cortex. A novel bounded-evidence accumulation model with temporally correlated evidence samples supports the idea that revaluation reflects the dynamic construction of subjective value during deliberation, which in turn influences subsequent decisions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95480">Semantic relatedness proactively benefits learning, memory, and interdependence across episodes</a></h4>

              
                Over the past century of memory research, the interplay between initial and later-learned information in determining long-term memory retention has been of central interest. A likely factor for determining whether initial and later memories interfere with or strengthen each other is semantic relatedness. Relatedness has been shown to <i>retroactively</i> boost initial memory and increase the interdependence between earlier and more recent experiences in memory. Here, we investigated the converse relationship of how relatedness <i>proactively</i> affects later memory for paired associates. In five experiments (N=1000 total), we varied the relatedness between initial and later cues, initial and later targets, or both. Across experiments and conditions, relatedness profoundly benefited later-learned memories – in some conditions, low relatedness reliably produced proactive interference (versus a control condition) while high relatedness produced proactive facilitation within the same experiment. Additionally, relatedness also accelerated learning and increased interdependence between initial and later-learned pairs. In sum, we demonstrate the robust effects of relatedness in scaffolding memory for recently learned information and creating strong integrative links with prior experiences.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97229">SLAM/SAP signaling regulates discrete γδ T cell developmental checkpoints and shapes the innate-like γδ TCR repertoire</a></h4>

              
                During thymic development, most γδ T cells acquire innate-like characteristics that are critical for their function in tumor surveillance, infectious disease, and tissue repair. The mechanisms, however, that regulate γδ T cell developmental programming remain unclear. Recently, we demonstrated that the SLAM/SAP signaling pathway regulates the development and function of multiple innate-like γδ T cell subsets. Here, we used a single-cell proteogenomics approach to identify SAP-dependent developmental checkpoints and to define the SAP-dependent γδ TCR repertoire in mice. SAP deficiency resulted in both a significant loss of an immature <i>Gzma</i><sup>+</sup><i>Blk<sup>+</sup>Etv5<sup>+</sup>Tox2<sup>+</sup></i> γδT17 precursor population and a significant increase in <i>Cd4<sup>+</sup>Cd8<sup>+</sup>Rorc<sup>+</sup>Ptcra<sup>+</sup>Rag1<sup>+</sup></i> thymic γδ T cells. SAP-dependent diversion of embryonic day 17 thymic γδ T cell clonotypes into the αβ T cell developmental pathway was associated with a decreased frequency of mature clonotypes in neonatal thymus, and an altered γδ TCR repertoire in the periphery. Finally, we identify TRGV4/TRAV13-4(DV7)-expressing T cells as a novel, SAP-dependent Vγ4 γδT1 subset. Together, the data support a model in which SAP-dependent γδ/αβ T cell lineage commitment regulates γδ T cell developmental programming and shapes the γδ TCR repertoire.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94334">Prolonged cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage in yeast requires the maintenance of DNA damage signaling and the spindle assembly checkpoint</a></h4>

              
                Cells evoke the DNA damage checkpoint (DDC) to inhibit mitosis in the presence of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) to allow more time for DNA repair. In budding yeast, a single irreparable DSB is sufficient to activate the DDC and induce cell cycle arrest prior to anaphase for about 12–15 hr, after which cells ‘adapt’ to the damage by extinguishing the DDC and resuming the cell cycle. While activation of the DNA damage-dependent cell cycle arrest is well understood, how it is maintained remains unclear. To address this, we conditionally depleted key DDC proteins after the DDC was fully activated and monitored changes in the maintenance of cell cycle arrest. Degradation of Ddc2<sup>ATRIP</sup>, Rad9, Rad24, or Rad53<sup>CHK2</sup> results in premature resumption of the cell cycle, indicating that these DDC factors are required both to establish and maintain the arrest. Dun1 is required for the establishment, but not the maintenance, of arrest, whereas Chk1 is required for prolonged maintenance but not for initial establishment of the mitotic arrest. When the cells are challenged with two persistent DSBs, they remain permanently arrested. This permanent arrest is initially dependent on the continuous presence of Ddc2, Rad9, and Rad53; however, after 15 hr these proteins become dispensable. Instead, the continued mitotic arrest is sustained by spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) proteins Mad1, Mad2, and Bub2 but not by Bub2’s binding partner Bfa1. These data suggest that prolonged cell cycle arrest in response to 2 DSBs is achieved by a handoff from the DDC to specific components of the SAC. Furthermore, the establishment and maintenance of DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest require overlapping but different sets of factors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93117">UGGT1-mediated reglucosylation of N-glycan competes with ER-associated degradation of unstable and misfolded glycoproteins</a></h4>

              
                How the fate (folding versus degradation) of glycoproteins is determined in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an intriguing question. Monoglucosylated glycoproteins are recognized by lectin chaperones to facilitate their folding, whereas glycoproteins exposing well-trimmed mannoses are subjected to glycoprotein ER-associated degradation (gpERAD); we have elucidated how mannoses are sequentially trimmed by EDEM family members (George et al., 2020; 2021 eLife). Although reglucosylation by UGGT was previously reported to have no effect on substrate degradation, here we directly tested this notion using cells with genetically disrupted UGGT1/2. Strikingly, the results showed that UGGT1 delayed the degradation of misfolded substrates and unstable glycoproteins including ATF6α. An experiment with a point mutant of UGGT1 indicated that the glucosylation activity of UGGT1 was required for the inhibition of early glycoprotein degradation. These and overexpression-based competition experiments suggested that the fate of glycoproteins is determined by a tug-of-war between structure formation by UGGT1 and degradation by EDEMs. We further demonstrated the physiological importance of UGGT1, since ATF6α cannot function properly without UGGT1. Thus, our work strongly suggests that UGGT1 is a central factor in ER protein quality control via the regulation of both glycoprotein folding and degradation.

                Aims: This study aims to develop a quantitative method for assessing collagen VI expression in cell cultures, which is crucial for the diagnosis and treatment of collagen VI-related dystrophies. Methods: We developed a combined in-cell western (ICW) and on-cell western (OCW) assay, that we have called 'collablot' to quantify collagen VI and its organisation in the extracellular matrix of cell cultures from patients and healthy controls. To optimise it, we optimised cell density and the protocols to induce collagen expression in cultures, as well as the cell fixation and permeabilisation methods. This was completed with a thorough selection of collagen antibodies and a collagen hybridising peptide (CHP). We then used collablots to compare cultures from patients and controls and evaluate therapeutic interventions in the cultures. Results: Collablots enabled the quantification of collagen VI expression in both control and patient cells, aligning with immunocytochemistry findings and detecting variations in collagen VI expression following treatment of the cultures. Additionally, CHP analysis revealed a marked increase in collagen network disruption in patients compared to the controls. Conclusions: The collablot assay represents an optimal method for quantifying collagen VI expression and its organisation in culture and assessing the effect of therapies.

                The choroid plexus (ChP) plays an important role in the glymphatic system of the human brain as the primary source of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production. Development of a non-invasive imaging technique is crucial for studying its function and age-related neurofluid dynamics. This study developed a relaxation-selective intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) technique to assess tissue and fluid compartments in the ChP in a prospective cross-sectional study involving 83 middle-aged to elderly participants (age: 61.5{+/-}17.1 years old) and 15 young controls (age: 30.7{+/-}2.9 years old). Using a 3T MRI scanner, IVIM, FLAIR-IVIM, LongTE-IVIM, and VASO-LongTE-IVIM were employed to measure diffusivity and volume fractions of fluid compartments and evaluate aging effects on microvascular perfusion and interstitial fluid (ISF). FLAIR-IVIM identified an additional ISF compartment with free-water-like diffusivity (2.4{+/-}0.9 x10-3 mm2/s). Older adults exhibited increased ChP volume (2320{+/-} 812 mm3 vs 1470{+/-}403 mm3, p=0.0017), reduced perfusion (6.5 {+/-}4.7 vs 3.6{+/-}2.9 x10-3 mm2/s, p=0.0088), decreased ISF volume fraction (0.58{+/-}0.09 vs 0.67 {+/-}0.06, p=0.0042), and lower tissue diffusivity (1.16{+/-}0.14 vs 1.29{+/-} 0.17x10-3 mm2/s, p=0.031) compared to younger adults. Relaxation-selective IVIM may offers enhanced specificity for characterizing age-related changes in ChP structure and fluid dynamics.

">Comparable neural and behavioural performance in dominant and non-dominant hands during grasping tasks</a></h4>

              
                Hand dominance has long been associated with differences in neural control and motor performance, with the dominant hand typically exhibiting better coordination in reaching tasks. However, the extent to which this dominance influences performance in finger force control remains unclear. This study aimed to examine the behavioural and neural features of the dominant and non dominant hands during grasping and lifting tasks in healthy young adults, focusing on the synergy index, EEG band power, and EEG EMG coherence as key measures. Twenty right handed adults (mean age = 26.95, STD = 2.68) participated in this study. Participants engaged in an experimental task where they grasped a handle for the initial five seconds, followed by lifting and holding it for an additional five seconds. There were two task conditions: fixed (thumb platform secured) and free (thumb platform movable). They performed 25 trials with both the dominant and non-dominant hands in the two task conditions, with the order of trials and hands block randomized to eliminate potential order effects. Contrary to the dynamic dominance hypothesis, we found statistical equivalence in the synergy index, EEG band power, and EEG EMG coherence between the dominant and non-dominant hands across both fixed and free task conditions. These findings suggest that both hands are capable of achieving similar levels of performance in tasks emphasizing steady state force maintenance, despite the typical advantages of the dominant hand in other motor tasks. While task-dependent modulations in behavioural and neural features were observed due to changes in friction, these adjustments were non different between the dominant and non dominant hands.

">Accelerated amyloid deposition in SARS-CoV-2 infected mouse models of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Familial Alzheimers disease (AD) involving known AD causing genes accounts for a small fraction of cases, the vast majority are sporadic. Neuroinflammation, secondary to viral infection, has been suggested as an initiating or accelerating factor. In this work we tested the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 (SCV2) viral infection accelerates the development of AD pathology in mouse models of AD. We profiled transcriptomic changes using transgenic APP/PSEN1 and P301S mouse models that develop AD pathology and k18hACE2 mice that express the humanized ACE2 receptor used by SCV2 to enter cells. This study identified the interferon and chemokine responses constituting key shared pathways between SCV2 infection and the development of AD pathology. Two transgenic mouse models of AD: APP/PSEN1 (develops amyloid pathology) and 3xTg AD (develops both amyloid and tau pathology) were crossed with k18-hACE2 mice to generate hybrid hACE2-3xTg and hACE2-APP/PSEN1 mice. Neuroinflammation and amyloid deposition in the brain of infected mice were imaged in vivo using molecular MRI (mMRI) probes and confirmed postmortem by histopathology. Results show that 11-14-month-old SCV2 infected hACE2-3xTg mice exhibit neuroinflammation 10 days post infection and 4-5-month-old hACE2-APP/PS1 hybrid mice develop amyloid deposits, while age-matched uninfected mice exhibit neither phenotype. This suggests that SCV2 infection could induce or accelerate AD when risk factors are present.

">Emergence of Sparse Coding, Balance and Decorrelation from a Biologically-Grounded Spiking Neural Network Model of Learning in the Primary Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Many computational studies attempt to address the question of information representation in biological neural networks using an explicit optimization based on an objective function. These approaches begin with principles of information representation that are expected to be found in the network and from which learning rules can be derived. This study approaches the question from the opposite direction; beginning with a model built upon the experimentally observed properties of neural responses, homeostasis, and synaptic plasticity. The known properties of information representation are then expected to emerge from this substrate. A spiking neural model of the primary visual cortex (V1) was investigated. Populations of both inhibitory and excitatory leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with recurrent connections were provided with spiking input from simulated ON and OFF neurons of the lateral geniculate nucleus. This network was provided with natural image stimuli as input. All synapses underwent learning using spike-timing-dependent plasticity learning rules. A homeostatic rule adjusted the weights and thresholds of each neuron based on target homeostatic spiking rates and mean synaptic input values. These experimentally grounded rules resulted in a number of the expected properties of information representation. The network showed a temporally sparse spike response to inputs and this was associated with a sparse code with Gabor-like receptive fields. The network was balanced at both slow and fast time scales; increased excitatory input was balanced by increased inhibition. This balance was associated with decorrelated firing that was observed as population sparseness. This population sparseness was both the cause and result of the decorrelation of receptive fields. These observed emergent properties (balance, temporal sparseness, population sparseness, and decorrelation) indicate that the network is implementing expected principles of information processing: efficient coding, information maximization ('infomax'), and a lateral or single-layer form of predictive coding. These emergent features of the network were shown to be robust to randomized jitter of the values of key simulation parameters.

We conducted intersubject similarity of functional connectivity analysis on a month-long randomized controlled trial dataset. Subjects in the training group, together with an additional 66 subjects undergoing the same training, were included to examine the correlations between intersubject similarity of functional connectivity and the intersubject similarity of single nucleotide polymorphisms related to mental disorders (schizophrenia, attention-deficient hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorder). We also used the Allen Human Brain Atlas to investigate genetic correlations at the gene expression level. Training increased the intersubject similarity of functional connectivity of some brain networks (especially the limbic network–frontoparietal network) across the resting and task states. Furthermore, the change in the intersubject similarity of functional connectivity of the limbic network–frontoparietal network after training seems to have a different genetic basis from its intersubject similarity of functional connectivity at baseline. Allen Human Brain Atlas analysis on the limbic network–frontoparietal network indicated correlations at baseline functional connectivity weights functional connectivity. Working memory training resulted in specific brain changes that differed among individuals, which may be partially due to genetics, especially concerning single nucleotide polymorphisms related to schizophrenia. Our findings emphasize the need to consider individual genetic backgrounds in personalized cognitive training.</span>

	<p>Astrocytes, vital support cells in the central nervous system (CNS), are crucial for maintaining neuronal health. In neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), astrocytes play a key role in clearing toxic amyloid-&amp;amp;beta; (A&amp;amp;beta;) peptides. A&amp;amp;beta;, a potent neuroinflammatory trigger, stimulates astrocytes to release excessive glutamate and inflammatory factors, exacerbating neuronal dysfunction and death. Recent studies underscore the role of Rho GTPases&amp;amp;mdash;particularly RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42&amp;amp;mdash;in regulating A&amp;amp;beta; clearance and neuroinflammation. These key regulators of cytoskeletal dynamics and intracellular signaling pathways function independently through distinct mechanisms but may converge to modulate inflammatory responses. Their influence on astrocyte structure and function extends to regulating endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE) activity, which modulates vasoactive peptides such as endothelin-1 (ET-1). Through these processes, Rho GTPases impact vascular permeability and neuroinflammation, contributing to AD pathogenesis by affecting both A&amp;amp;beta; clearance and cerebrovascular interactions. Understanding the interplay between Rho GTPases and the cerebrovascular system provides fresh insights into AD pathogenesis. Targeting Rho GTPase signaling pathways in astrocytes could offer a promising therapeutic approach to mitigate neuroinflammation, enhance A&amp;amp;beta; clearance, and slow disease progression, ultimately improving cognitive outcomes in AD patients.</p>

                <p>Unique microglial states have been identified in Alzheimer's disease (AD) model mice and postmortem AD brains. Although it has been well documented that amyloid-&beta; accumulation induces the alteration of microglial states, the relationship between tau pathology and microglial states remains incompletely understood because of a lack of suitable AD models. In the present study, we generated a novel AD model mouse by the intracerebral administration of tau purified from human brains with primary age-related tauopathy into <I>App</I> knock-in mice with humanized tau. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that Dectin-1-positive disease-associated microglia were increased in the AD model mice after tau accumulation in the brain. We then performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing on the AD model mice to evaluate the differences in microglial states with and without tau propagation and accumulation. By taking advantage of spatial transcriptomics and existing single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, we showed for the first time that tau propagation and accumulation induce a disease-associated microglial phenotype at the expense of an age-related nonhomeostatic counterpart (namely, white matter-associated microglia) in an AD model mouse brain. Future work using spatial transcriptomics at single-cell resolution will pave the way for a more appropriate interpretation of microglial alterations in response to tau pathology in the AD brain.</p>

                <p>When making perceptual decisions, humans combine information across sensory modalities dependent on their respective uncertainties. However, it remains unknown how the brain integrates multisensory feedback during movement and which factors besides sensory uncertainty influence sensory contributions. We performed two reaching experiments on healthy adults to investigate whether movement corrections to combined visual and mechanical perturbations scale with visual uncertainty. To describe the dynamics of multimodal feedback responses, we further varied movement time and visual feedback duration during the movement. The results of our first experiment show that the contribution of visual feedback decreased with uncertainty. Additionally, we observed a transient phase during which visual feedback responses were stronger during faster movements. In a follow-up experiment, we found that the contribution of vision increased more quickly during slow movements when we presented the visual feedback for a longer time. Muscle activity corresponding to these visual responses exhibited modulations with sensory uncertainty and movement speed ca. 100&nbsp;ms following the onset of the visual feedback. Using an optimal feedback control model, we show that the increased response to visual feedback during fast movements can be explained by an urgency-dependent increase in control gains. Further, the fact that a longer viewing duration increased the visual contributions suggests that the brain accumulates sensory information over time to estimate the state of the arm during reaching. Our results provide additional evidence concerning the link between reaching control and decision-making, both of which appear to be influenced by sensory evidence accumulation and response urgency.</p>

                Complexities in obturation and difficulties in disinfection represent significant issues that render endodontic treatment notably time-consuming. A new perspective is essential to reduce both working time and address these two challenges. To date, none of the established techniques for root canal obturation can assure a perfect seal. Solid materials are not easily manipulated to hermetically fill the intricate branches of the root canal system. Concurrently, anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria, particularly Enterococcus faecalis, are predominant in discussions surrounding endodontic infections. Numerous studies have demonstrated that achieving complete disinfection of Enterococcus faecalis is exceedingly difficult, even with the use of irrigating solutions that possess strong antibacterial properties. Under anaerobic conditions, the invasion efficiency of facultative anaerobes is heightened. If irrigation and disinfection fail to entirely eliminate anaerobes and facultative anaerobes, a novel strategy is required to address the bacteria that persist within the root canal. Oxygen can easily permeate the root canal system, eradicate anaerobes, and inhibit facultative anaerobes from becoming pathogenic. Therefore, employing oxygen as a biomaterial for obturation following appropriate cleaning and shaping procedures is anticipated to address the two primary endodontic issues. This article aims to explore a new potential concept for a dental restoration system that utilizes an oxygen-permeable membrane to reduce the time required for endodontic treatment. The membrane is positioned at the orifice of a duct designed to connect the entire root canal system with ambient air outside the restoration. The function of the membrane is somewhat analogous to the masks used during the COVID-19 pandemic, as it allows for the circulation of oxygen while preventing the passage of fluids, debris, and microorganisms. We hypothesize that the oxygen circulating within the root canal system will also function as a continuously renewing antimicrobial agent.

                This study proposes an approach for developing or improving performance management and measurement systems (PMMSs) for healthcare organisations. First, data is collected to analyse and understand the current organisation’s performance management system. Second, the SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) method is used to identify the main aspects of the performance management system to be improved. Third, based on the scientific literature and SWOT analysis, BSC principles are integrated to this performance management system to better align the organisation’s performance objectives and indicators with its strategy. Finally, we develop a performance indicator structure and select indicators to be used as well as how these indicators could be integrated and shared with higher hierarchical levels in the organisation by using AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process). Our approach is applied to the CIUSSS du Centre-Sud-de-l’île-de-Montreal (CCSMTL), a large healthcare network, in the province of Québec, Canada.

Pangenomes are becoming a powerful framework to perform many bioinformatics analyses taking into account the genetic variability of a population, thus reducing the bias introduced by a single reference genome. With the wider diffusion of pangenomes, integrating genetic variability with transcriptome diversity is becoming a natural extension that demands specific methods for its exploration. In this work, we extend the notion of spliced pangenomes to that of <i>annotated spliced pangenomes</i>; this allows us to introduce a formal definition of Alternative Splicing (AS) events on a graph structure. To investigate the usage of graph pangenomes for the quantification of AS events across conditions, we developed pantas, the first pangenomic method for the detection and differential analysis of AS events from short RNA-Seq reads. A comparison with state-of-the-art linear reference-based approaches proves that pantas achieves competitive accuracy, making spliced pangenomes effective for conducting AS events quantification and opening future directions for the analysis of population-based transcriptomes.

                <p>by Lucille Calmon, Elisabetta Colosi, Giulia Bassignana, Alain Barrat, Vittoria Colizza</p>

High-resolution temporal data on contacts between hosts provide crucial information on the mixing patterns underlying infectious disease transmission. Publicly available data sets of contact data are however typically recorded over short time windows with respect to the duration of an epidemic. To inform models of disease transmission, data are thus often repeated several times, yielding synthetic data covering long enough timescales. Looping over short term data to approximate contact patterns on longer timescales can lead to unrealistic transmission chains because of the deterministic repetition of all contacts, without any renewal of the contact partners of each individual between successive periods. Real contacts indeed include a combination of regularly repeated contacts (e.g., due to friendship relations) and of more casual ones. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to longitudinally extend contact data recorded in a school setting, taking into account this dual aspect of contacts and in particular the presence of repeated contacts due to friendships. To illustrate the interest of such an algorithm, we then simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 on our synthetic contacts using an agent-based model specific to the school setting. We compare the results with simulations performed on synthetic data extended with simpler algorithms to determine the impact of preserving friendships in the data extension method. Notably, the preservation of friendships does not strongly affect transmission routes between classes in the school but leads to different infection pathways between individual students. Our results moreover indicate that gathering contact data during two days in a population is sufficient to generate realistic synthetic contact sequences between individuals in that population on longer timescales. The proposed tool will allow modellers to leverage existing contact data, and contributes to the design of optimal future field data collection.

The importance of maintaining data privacy and complying with regulatory requirements is highlighted especially when sharing omic data between different research centers. This challenge is even more pronounced in the scenario where a multi-center effort for collaborative omics studies is necessary. OmicSHIELD is introduced as an open-source tool aimed at overcoming these challenges by enabling privacy-protected federated analysis of sensitive omic data. In order to ensure this, multiple security mechanisms have been included in the software. This innovative tool is capable of managing a wide range of omic data analyses specifically tailored to biomedical research. These include genome and epigenome wide association studies and differential gene expression analyses. OmicSHIELD is designed to support both meta- and mega-analysis, so that it offers a wide range of capabilities for different analysis designs. We present a series of use cases illustrating some examples of how the software addresses real-world analyses of omic data.

Small GTPases of the Rho family play a central role in the regulation of cell motility by controlling the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. In the amoeboid cells of <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>, the active form of the Rho GTPase Rac1 regulates actin polymerases at the leading edge and actin filament bundling proteins at the posterior cortex of polarized cells. We monitored the spatiotemporal dynamics of Rac1 and its effector DGAP1 in vegetative amoebae using specific fluorescent probes. We observed that plasma membrane domains enriched in active Rac1 not only exhibited stable polarization, but also showed rotations and oscillations, whereas DGAP1 was depleted from these regions. To simulate the observed dynamics of the two proteins, we developed a mass-conserving reaction-diffusion model based on the circulation of Rac1 between the membrane and the cytoplasm coupled with its activation by GEFs, deactivation by GAPs and interaction with DGAP1. Our theoretical model accurately reproduced the experimentally observed dynamic patterns, including the predominant anti-correlation between active Rac1 and DGAP1. Significantly, the model predicted a new colocalization regime of these two proteins in polarized cells, which we confirmed experimentally. In summary, our results improve the understanding of Rac1 dynamics and reveal how the occurrence and transitions between different regimes depend on biochemical reaction rates, protein levels and cell size. This study not only expands our knowledge of the behavior of Rac1 GTPases in <i>D</i>. <i>discoideum</i> amoebae but also demonstrates how specific modes of interaction between Rac1 and its effector DGAP1 lead to their counterintuitively anti-correlated dynamics.

                <p>by Nelio T. L. Rodrigues, Tom Bland, KangBo Ng, Nisha Hirani, Nathan W. Goehring</p>

A key challenge in the development of an organism is to maintain robust phenotypic outcomes in the face of perturbation. Yet, it is often unclear how such robust outcomes are encoded by developmental networks. Here, we use the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> zygote as a model to understand sources of developmental robustness during PAR polarity-dependent asymmetric cell division. By quantitatively linking alterations in protein dosage to phenotype in individual embryos, we show that spatial information in the zygote is read out in a highly nonlinear fashion and, as a result, phenotypes are highly canalized against substantial variation in input signals. Our data point towards robustness of the conserved PAR polarity network that renders polarity axis specification resistant to variations in both the strength of upstream symmetry-breaking cues and PAR protein dosage. Analogously, downstream pathways involved in cell size and fate asymmetry are robust to dosage-dependent changes in the local concentrations of PAR proteins, implying nontrivial complexity in translating PAR concentration profiles into pathway outputs. We propose that these nonlinear signal-response dynamics between symmetry-breaking, PAR polarity, and asymmetric division modules effectively insulate each individual module from variation arising in others. This decoupling helps maintain the embryo along the correct developmental trajectory, thereby ensuring that asymmetric division is robust to perturbation. Such modular organization of developmental networks is likely to be a general mechanism to achieve robust developmental outcomes.

                Background Universal access to maternal, newborn, and child healthcare is essential for achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3, but the effectiveness of various incentive-based programs for pregnant mothers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remains uncertain. Objective of this systematic review was to determine if incentive-based interventions influenced maternal and neonatal health outcomes. Methods We conducted a search in various databases from inception. All incentive-based interventional studies conducted on pregnant women in LMICs were included. Evidence from the included trials was synthesized using risk ratios (RRs) to compare the outcomes between groups receiving incentives and not receiving incentives. The meta-analysis was conducted using random-effects model. We assessed the quality of the included studies using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool and reviewed the collected data to determine its suitability for meta-analysis. This study is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021247681). Results Of the 3,897 records that were identified, 11 met eligibility criteria, all of which exhibited varying degrees of risk of bias, ranging from high to some concerns. Analysis of maternal outcomes across studies revealed no significant differences in the likelihood of delivering at a healthcare facility (RR 1.13, 95% CI: 0.86 to 1.47) and in frequency of prenatal care (RR 0.99, 95% CI: 0.88 to 1.12) between intervention and control groups. However, high levels of statistical heterogeneity were observed for both outcomes indicating variability among study results. Similarly, analysis of tetanus vaccine coverage showed no significant difference between groups (RR 1.00, 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.08), with moderate statistical heterogeneity observed. Conclusion The maternal and neonatal outcomes examined in this review did not have any significant differences in intervention group when compared to the control group. The interventions to address maternal health concerns need to follow a multifactorial approach. There is a need for extensive primary research studies in the future.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27151?af=R">Critical Care Decisions After Large Core Cerebral Infarctions: A Secondary Analysis From the SELECT2 Trial</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Among patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO) and large ischemic cores, critical decisions often need to be made about decompressive hemicraniectomy (DHC) or early withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy (WLST). In this study, we aimed to evaluate utilization of DHC and early WLST and factors associated with them in patients with large strokes from the SELECT2 trial.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed the entire SELECT2 trial population, which randomized 352 patients with stroke due to LVO and large ischemic cores to endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) or medical management. We used the as-treated principle to compare the use of DHC and early WLST within 7 days after randomization. We further assessed functional outcomes (modified Rankin Score) after these decisions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 352 patients enrolled in this study, 55 received DHC and 81 transitioned to early WLST. Patients treated with EVT were as likely to undergo DHC (16% vs 15%, adjusted relative risk [aRR] = 1.19, 95% CI:0.75–1.88, <i>p</i> = 0.46) or WLST (22% vs 24%, aRR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.66–1.34, <i>p</i> = 0.72) as those given medical management. DHC was used more frequently in younger patients and WLST more in older patients. EVT efficacy was maintained after adjusting for DHC (adjusted generalized odds ratio [aGenOR] = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.24–2.11, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), with no interaction between DHC and treatment (p-interaction = 0.93). At 1 year, 21% of DHC-treated patients were ambulatory; the outcomes were universally poor after early WLST.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In the SELECT2 trial of patients with large ischemic core, DHC was performed in ~1 of 6 patients and early WLST in ~1 of 5 patients, without differences based on treatment with EVT or medical management, nor successful reperfusion. DHC or WLST did not detract from thrombectomy treatment benefit. Additionally, ~20% of patients achieved independent ambulation despite receiving DHC by the 1-year follow-up. The similar distribution of these critical care decisions provides reassurance that the overall trial outcomes were not biased by open-label treatment allocation. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

[version 6; peer review: 1 approve</a></h4>

              
                The haemorrhagic features of viral haemorrhagic fevers may be caused by common patterns of metabolic disturbances of the glucose and ascorbate homeostasis. Haemorrhages and vasculature disfunctions are a clinical feature not only of viral haemorrhagic fevers, but also in scurvy, diabetes and thrombotic microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia. Interestingly, the expression of glucose and ascorbate transporter Glut-1 on the erythrocyte membrane is associated with the inability to synthesize ascorbate and is restricted to that very species that are susceptible to filoviruses (primates, humans and fruit bats). Glut-1 may play a pivotal role in haemorrhagic fever pathogenesis. TIM-1 and TAM receptors have been recognized to enhance entry of Ebola, Lassa and Dengue viruses and viral interferences with TIM-1 could disturb its function, disturbing the expression of Glut-1. In those species not able to synthesize ascorbate and expressing Glut-1 on erythrocytes virus could interact with Glut-1 or other functionally related protein, and the influx of glucose into the cells would be severely impaired. As a consequence, transient hyperglycemia and a marked oxidative stress coupled with the high levels of glucose in plasma would be established, and then promote the activation of NF–κB transcription, exacerbating a pro-inflammatory response mediated by cytokines and chemokines: The inability to synthesize ascorbate is an Achilles Heel when trying to counteract the oxidative stress.

                Introduction OOPE for healthcare services is a major concern within the Indian healthcare system. 30% of the population remains uninsured despite increasing health insurance coverage. For obstetrics and gynaecology (OBG) patients financial obstacles like OOPE can delay access to health care, evaluating spending patterns can inform policies to enhance accessibility, affordability and equitable health. Methodology A retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary care teaching hospital in Karnataka state of India to analyze OOPE for 905 OBG patients who underwent Cesarean Section(C-Section), Laparoscopic Hysterectomy, Laparoscopic Cystectomy, Laparoscopic Myomectomy and Laparoscopic Assisted Vaginal Hysterectomy (LAVH). These were the top five most performed obstetrics and gynecology surgeries in the tertiary care teaching hospital between January 2023 and July 2023. Data was collected across AB-PMJAY, private health insurance, uninsured patients and analyzed using descriptive statistics (mean, median) and the Shapiro-Wilk test for data normality. Results The study analyzed OOPE across 905 OBG patients. Findings show AB-PMJAY provided full coverage with zero OOPE for all surgeries. Though private health insurance reduced OOPE compared to uninsured patients under private health insurance still faced significant financial burden. Variations existed in minimum and maximum OOPE and percentage of OOPE across different private insurances. All the uninsured patients incurred 100% OOPE, with a median OOPE of Rs. 33,257 (405.67 USD) to Rs. 57,053 (695.76 USD) and a mean OOPE of Rs. 39,848 (485.95 USD) to Rs. 60,687 (740 USD) across the surgeries. Discussion Findings of the study show that AB-PMJAY is highly effective in reducing OOPE and enhancing financial risk protection for OBG patients. Patients covered by private health insurance incurred less OOPE, yet the burden remained considerable. High OOPE rates for uninsured patients (100%) and private health insurance (38.15%) compared to 0% OOPE in AB-PMJAY emphasizes the need for the continued expansion of AB-PMJAY.

                Introduction The increasing number of older people and their vulnerability to disaster and medication preparedness as the primary elements of disaster mitigation are necessary to reduce the impact of a disaster. Nevertheless, research on natural disasters and medication preparedness in the elderly population is still lacking. This review aimed to explore all reported research and publications related to natural disasters and medication preparedness among the elderly. Methods A scoping review was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). A literature search was conducted using the following four databases: Scopus, PubMed, Sage, and Google Scholar. Screening was conducted using the following criteria: articles written in English, open access, and published between 2020 and 2024. Articles must discuss natural disasters and medication preparedness. In the data search, we input several keywords that include “elderly,” “natural disaster,” “preparedness,” and “medication.” Snowballing was then conducted to find articles on preparedness interventions. Data extraction and analysis were then performed. Results and conclusion The findings from this literature review are the majority of studies showing that most elderly people are not well prepared in facing disasters; however, through various programs that have been implemented by either the government or community, the elderly show more preparation when they encounter any natural disaster.

                Background One of the most common strabismus types in children is intermittent exotropia, which predominantly occurs in children between the ages of 2 to 4 years. It may affect visual development and often coexists with refractive errors. Unlike esotropia, which usually links to hyperopia, intermittent exotropia might have a different relationship with refractive errors and thus lead to myopia. Methods In this cross-sectional retrospective study from August 2021 to December 2023, 179 patients diagnosed with intermittent exotropia were recruited via an outpatient clinic of Najah Al-Quraishi, Baghdad, Iraq. The refractive errors were compared by autorefractometry and retinoscopy after cycloplegic dilation. Data analysis was constructed under the use of IBM SPSS V.26 for the determination of emmetropia, myopia, and hyperopia prevalence. Results Among the 179 patients, emmetropia was the most commonly observed refractive status, present in 68 patients (38%). Low hyperopia and low myopia were also common, with 64 and 40, respectively. A limited number of patients had moderate/high myopia and moderate/high hyperopia; in detail, the prevalence was following: 5% of patients had moderate myopia, while 0.5% of patients suffered from high myopia; symmetrically, 5% were moderate to high hyperopia. From the data collected, a trend emerged for a low refractive error and symmetric refractive error in both eyes. Conclusion Contrasted to prior conventional wisdom about refractive error in strabismus, it established the greater incidence of emmetropia in patients with intermittent exotropia. The findings call for specific management strategies to be applied in this population.

                Traditional educational frameworks in Saudi Arabia have historically adopted a deficit-based approach to special education, potentially overlooking the benefits of neurodiversity. As global educational paradigms shift toward inclusive practices, examining the alignment of Saudi special education laws with neurodiversity principles becomes crucial. This content analysis study aimed to explore the existing literature on special education in Saudi Arabia to ascertain whether the laws and policies support or hinder the practice of neurodiversity, a concept that is gaining international recognition but remains nascent in Saudi Arabia. A systematic literature search was performed in Web of Science and Scopus, yielding 21 relevant studies after screening and application of inclusion criteria. A content analysis was conducted, focusing on the categorization of data relevant to special education laws and their implications for neurodiversity. The analysis identified seven key categories, including Implementation of Inclusive education and transition services, that reflect the current state of special education laws in relation to neurodiversity. A conceptual model was developed, illustrating the potential of special education laws to both support and impede neurodiversity in Saudi Arabia and potentially worldwide.

                Background The evolving landscape of the African higher education sector necessitated by global higher education reforms and the need for research informed responses to address contextual challenges is partly dependent on effective postgraduate research supervision. A wide range of postgraduate research supervision models and practices are documented globally. In the African context, the experiences of postgraduate research supervision are not clearly understood from the experiences of all stakeholders. Aim The proposed scoping review aims to map evidence on the range of postgraduate research supervision experiences at higher education institutions in Africa. Methods The methodological framework proposed by Arksey and O’Malley will be used to conduct the review. Relevant articles will be sourced from different electronic data bases namely; ERIC, Web of Science, EbscoHost and Scopus. A combination of search terms and Boolean operators will be used to obtain the relevant articles based on the inclusion criteria stipulated within the Population, Context and Concept (PCC) framework of study identification for this review. Results Studies reporting on postgraduate research supervision experiences from the perspective of academics, students and support staff in the African higher education context will be included. The results may also provide insights postgraduate supervision experiences from varying postgraduate research disciplines. Conclusion The findings will provide consolidated empirical evidence on experiences of postgraduate supervision in the African higher education context, thereby providing holistic insight on postgraduate research supervision practices, models currently used, implementation challenges and highlight research gaps. This may inform recommendations that advance knowledge within this field, particularly in the African higher education context.

                Abstract Background Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy, is known for its regenerative properties. PRP may be able to help with cystocele cases. This review aims to explore how it might be applied to urogynecological cases, particularly those involving cystocele. Methods The present systematic review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guideline 2020, Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guideline. The present systematic review was registered with PROSPERO with the registered number CRD42023414366. PubMed, Science Direct, Epistemonikos, COCHRANE, Google Scholar, and ProQuest were among the databases we searched. “(PRP OR Platelet-Rich Plasma) AND (Cystocele OR Anterior Pelvic Organ Prolapse)” from January 2007 to December 2022. Based on the PICO framework (Population = Patients with Cystocele; Intervention = Reconstruction with platelet-rich plasma injection; Compare = Reconstruction only; Outcome: Recurrency of Cystocele), four investigators (AMS, PMA, EAU, RSD, and AH) independently assessed eligibility by titles and abstracts. Using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal tool, each author evaluated full-text articles based on the kind of articles they had received. When consensus could not be obtained, disagreements were settled by involving the supervisors (EF, EMK, and BS). Results A total of 8,924 studies were identified. After removing duplicates and applying eligibility criteria, two articles were included, encompassing 65 patients. In two studies, PRP injections were found and administered post-anterior colporrhaphy at the pubovesical fascia. According to these two trials, women who had anterior colporrhaphy and PRP injections required fewer reoperations. Conclusion PRP has the potential to be a good alternative treatment to prevent cystocele recurrence. However, it cannot be generalized to large populations due to the small number of findings. Further studies with large samples examining the efficacy and safety of the therapy are needed to prove it.

                Background Maxillofacial fractures, frequently arising from road traffic incidents, falls, and acts of interpersonal aggression, are a considerable public health issue, exhibiting diverse epidemiological patterns according to demographic factors. The application of miniplates for fracture stabilization is a recognized technique, with innovative methods such as 3D plate systems emerging. Nonetheless, consequences including infections and hardware malfunctions persist. This systematic review seeks to present current evidence regarding the complications linked to miniplate placement in maxillofacial fractures over the last ten years. Methods A systematic review was performed in accordance with PRISMA principles. Databases such as the Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Scopus were examined from September 2014 to September 2024. Studies documenting problems related to miniplate placement were included, without language constraints. The ROBINS-I tool was utilized for non-randomized studies, whereas the Cochrane risk of bias tool was applied to randomized controlled trials. Results From 2,289 initially found studies, 56 satisfied the inclusion criteria. Among these, 28 employed interventional designs, whilst the remaining 28 were observational research. The predominant problems documented in several investigations encompassed infection, wound dehiscence, malocclusion, paraesthesia, malunion/non-union, segment movement, hardware failure, and palpable hardware. Advanced methodologies such as 3D plate systems and locking mechanisms were linked to diminished complication rates. Conclusion This systematic analysis presents a decade of updated research about problems associated with miniplate placement in maxillofacial fractures. Novel methodologies such as 3D plate systems and locking mechanisms demonstrate promise in mitigating problems relative to conventional techniques. These findings can facilitate informed decision-making in clinical practice. Additional study utilizing standardized outcomes and prospective designs is essential to enhance comprehension of the long-term effects of miniplate utilization.

                Introduction The social media landscape has undergone radical changes and has revolutionized consumer perspectives, purchasing habits, and behaviours. Amidst this emerging trend is the rise of influencer marketing and its impact on the purchase intentions of followers. The objective is to explore the characteristics of influencers that contribute to their credibility. This research aims to explore the role of consumers’ attitude toward brands on their intention to adopt brands endorsed by influencers. Methods This cross-sectional research was undertaken among GenZ in the urban landscape of India. Data collected was analyzed using SmartPLS4 software. Findings Trust, expertise, and similarity were the significant antecedents of the formation of influencer credibility. Attractiveness did not have a significant influence on influencer credibility. A complementary partial mediation of Attitude towards a brand is observed in the association between influencer credibility and the purchase intention of followers. Attitude towards the video also had a significant positive influence on purchase intention. Conclusion The study found that Gen Z places little importance on an influencer’s attractiveness, as it has no significant impact on credibility. However, attitude toward the brand strongly influenced purchase intention and partially mediated the relationship between influencer credibility and purchase intention.

                Servant leadership delivers important reforms to the increasingly complex public utility system. This systematic review seeks to incorporate the latest six years of articles on geographic divisions, conceptual definitions, measuring techniques, theoretical frameworks, and nomological networks (antecedents, mediators, outcomes, and moderators) in the public sector. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and ROBINS-I, and employing automated techniques such as Rayyan for screening. Using PRISMA’s review approach, this comprehensive synthesis of 51 relevant public sector-specific conceptual and empirical studies across six academic electronic databases (Taylor & Francis, Sage, Scopus, Springer Link, Web of Science, and Wiley) shows that servant leadership is critical for establishing a prosocial workforce. This review discovered that the global construct of servant leadership (SL-7) scale has been the most often utilised measure of servant leadership in public sector-specific studies recently. Social exchange theory remains the predominant explanation for the impact of servant leadership on specific variables. The findings also illustrate a generally positive influence of servant leadership. Moreover, this review provides limitations and suggestions for future studies by summarising elements that have received less attention.

                In the Americas, the expansion in incidence of arboviral infections including Mayaro virus (MAYV) has drawn attention to the resurgence of viruses associated with understudied arthropods. Mosquitoes belonging to the genus Haemagogus are generally geographically restricted to the forests of Central and South America and the Caribbean and are the known sylvan vectors for yellow fever virus and emerging MAYV. With an established population in Jamaica, Haemagogus equinus has been reported to be well-adapted to oviposition in artificial containers close to human populations. Its role in arboviral transmission however is not fully understood. Given the dearth of genetic information and the difficulty in morphologically identifying cryptic features in species belonging to this genus, we report the first mitochondrial genome of Hg. equinus. Using a genome skimming approach, two Hg. equinus mosquito specimens were sequenced using the Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform. A representative mitogenome of 16,471 bp, 80.7% AT and 37 genes was assembled using NOVOplasty. Phylogenetic analysis placed Hg. equinus in the Albomaculatus section of the Haemagogus subgenus supporting previously described taxonomic studies.

                Background Microalgae-based products offer a sustainable solution for food, fuel, and agricultural inputs, presenting environmental benefits and economic opportunities. A comprehensive assessment is needed to understand their potential in supporting sustainability goals, considering the complex interplay between production methods, energy sources, and environmental impacts. Methods This study evaluated the environmental impacts of three microalgae-derived products – biodiesel, fish feed, and biofertilizer – through a comprehensive life cycle assessment. Nine scenarios were explored comparing three electricity profiles (current Thai mix, 50% renewable/50% current mix hybrid, 100% renewable) across the three products. The assessment evaluated environmental impacts and potential economic benefits of transitioning to these microalgae-based alternatives. Results and discussion All products demonstrated potential for significant environmental benefits under increased renewable energy scenarios. Fish feed consistently exhibited the lowest environmental impacts across all categories examined, showing substantial improvements with increased renewable energy use. With an annual demand of 0.4 million tonnes, fish feed could generate USD 560 million in revenue and reduce CO2 emissions by 1.1 million tonnes. Fulfilling the projected biodiesel demand of 4,015 million liters per year through microalgae production could yield approximately USD 3.5 billion in revenue and reduce CO2 emissions by 30 million tonnes compared to conventional fossil-based diesel. Additionally, algal biofertilizer production could meet a 5 million tonnes annual demand, offering USD 2 billion in revenue while reducing CO2 emissions by 6 million tonnes yearly. Collectively, these products could offset 37 million tonnes of CO2, representing about 14% of Thailand’s total CO2 emissions, contributing significantly to the country’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) target of 20-30% greenhouse gas emissions reduction. Conclusion Transitioning to microalgae-based products could transform the aquaculture, energy, and agricultural sectors, potentially supporting the national climate change mitigation goals, if implemented.

                Background Breast cancer has become the most prevalent disease and its incidence has almost doubled in the Indian population. This increased burden demands new targeted therapies with novel compounds either synthetically produced or derived from indigenous plants, which could be a promising approach for the development of drugs. Euphorbia thymifolia L is a widely growing tropical herb that has been reported to have various ethnopharmacological properties. Although Euphorbia genus is reported to have anticancer properties, E. thymifolia is not reported to have anticancer properties to date. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to screen the phytoconstituents and identify the active compounds present in the methanolic extract of E. thymifolia (ME.ET) as ligands to inhibit human cancer cell lines with special reference to potential protein targets implicated in breast cancer using an In-silico approach. Methods ME.ET was subjected to GC-MS analysis to screen the phytoconstituents, and the identified compounds were docked with protein targets such as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1), a serine/threonine kinase-1(AKT1), human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2), estrogen receptor (ER), maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK), polo-like kinase-1(PLK1), and protein tyrosine kinase (PTK6). Compounds with good docking scores were further subjected to dynamic studies to understand the protein ligand binding stability, ligand pathway calculation, and molecular mechanics energies combined with Poisson-Boltzmann (MM/PBSA) calculations using the Schrodinger suite. Results GC-MS analysis revealed the presence of 245 phytoconstituents, 219 of which were unique. When subjected to docking, these phytocompounds, namely 3,6,9,12-tetraoxatetradecane-1,14-diyl dibenzoate (TTDB) and succinic acid, 2-(dimethylamino) ethyl 4-isopropylphenyl ester (SADPE), showed good docking scores. Molecular dynamics studies showed a high affinity and low binding energy for TTDB with HER2, ERK1, and SADPE with ER. Conclusions Hence, in this study, we identified two lead compounds in E.thymifolia linn. Further invitro and invivo anticancer studies can be performed to confirm these results and to understand the molecular mechanism by which they exhibit anticancer activity against breast cancer.

                Background Hybrid and gold open-access (OA) are the most common publishing models. The latter requires fees to allow full-text visibility upon publishing, whereas hybrid journals offer the option to publish gold OA or for free (subscription-based) where only users with access can get the full-text. We aimed to evaluate the impact of the publishing model and other factors on medical journals’ impact. Methods A sample of hybrid and gold OA medical journals indexed in Web of Science (WOS) and Scopus were included. The effect of the publishing model and other factors on journals’ impact factor (IF), CiteScore, quartile, and number of citations was assessed. Results 402 journals were included, 201 in each group. Hybrid and gold OA journals had a median age of 32 and 21 years, respectively (P<0.001). The median publishing cost in gold OA journals was $2,690, and 46.3% of them publish continuously. Publishing model, journal’s age, being of an organization/society, and EMBASE indexation didn’t affect IF, CiteScore, number of citations, and WOS quartile (P>0.05). However, gold OA model wasn’t significantly associated with Q1 ranking in Scopus (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.25-0.94; P=0.032), which indicates that hybrid journals were more likely to have such ranking. Conclusion These findings indicate that gold OA publishing doesn’t necessarily result in higher impact, which contradicts the claim that such model enhances citations. Therefore, authors can continue to publish in hybrid journals without being concerned about getting cited. Gold OA journals are encouraged to reduce their fees to facilitate global research access.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23664?af=R">Long‐Term Potentiation: The Accidental Discovery</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Long-term potentiation (LTP), is a type of synaptic plasticity now considered essential for learning and memory. Here I tell the story of how I accidentally discovered in 1966 in the laboratory of Per Andersen in Oslo, Norway, because I was not looking for it. It just emerged. I recount how I came to work with Per and why my result was not immediately followed up. Then, in 1968 Tim Bliss joined the lab and, on his urging, from 1968 to 1969 we did the experiments that resulted in Bliss and Lømo, 1973. I explain why I think the experiments later failed in Oslo, and for a few years also in Tim's lab in London, before it became a readily observable phenomenon. I also describe how Tony Gardner-Medwin and I in 1971 failed to reproduce the results that Tim and I had obtained 2 years earlier in the same lab and the same type of anesthetized rabbit preparation. I tell how this failure caused me to leave the LTP field and, instead, continue exploring mechanisms of nerve–muscle interactions, which I had studied with much success during my postdoc period in London from 1969 to 1971. I reflect on Donald Hebb's influence on LTP studies and on my experience when after many years of neglect, I became interested in LTP and the hippocampus anew and started to write about it, though without doing lab experiments. Finally, I report briefly on the experiments I am doing now in retirement, studying how the nervous system regulates body temperature through varying amounts of muscle tone.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23655?af=R">Adult Neurogenesis in the Human Dentate Gyrus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In the adult dentate gyrus of the hippocampus there are neuronal stem cells that give rise to immature neurons and subsequently to mature functional granule neurons. The rate of proliferation, differentiation, and survival is regulated intrinsically and extrinsically. For example, Wnt, BMP, TLX, and BDNF all regulate adult neurogenesis intrinsically, while exercise, environmental enrichment, stress, and epilepsy are some of the extrinsic factors that regulate adult neurogenesis. A clearer picture is emerging for the functional role of these newly born neurons in behavior, demonstrating that adult neurogenesis plays a role in recognizing events, places, objects, or people as unique when comparing options that are very similar, but that these newly born cells play little role in recognition when differences are greater. Most of the research on adult neurogenesis is conducted in experimental mammals, including mice and rats. The first evidence for adult neurogenesis in humans was reported in 1998, when postmortem brains from cancer patients injected with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) were examined and cells were found that had divided and differentiated into mature neurons. Subsequently, additional evidence using other techniques has confirmed human adult neurogenesis. Additional in vivo live reports will be needed to monitor the effects of changes in human adult neurogenesis with age and disease.</p>

                Cardiomyocytes exhibit characteristic prominent spatial organizations of heterochromatin (SOH). Fujiwara et al. found that the replacement of endogenous H2B with H2B-mCherry disrupts SOH, leading to extreme elongation of ventricular cardiomyocyte nuclei, resulting in severe heart failure, demonstrating that SOH play a structural role in maintaining nuclear shape against mechanical stress.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88671">Unified bursting strategies in ectopic and endogenous even-skipped expression patterns</a></h4>

              
                Transcription often occurs in bursts as gene promoters switch stochastically between active and inactive states. Enhancers can dictate transcriptional activity in animal development through the modulation of burst frequency, duration, or amplitude. Previous studies observed that different enhancers can achieve a wide range of transcriptional outputs through the same strategies of bursting control. For example, in Berrocal et al., 2020, we showed that despite responding to different transcription factors, all <i>even-skipped</i> enhancers increase transcription by upregulating burst frequency and amplitude while burst duration remains largely constant. These shared bursting strategies suggest that a unified molecular mechanism constraints how enhancers modulate transcriptional output. Alternatively, different enhancers could have converged on the same bursting control strategy because of natural selection favoring one of these particular strategies. To distinguish between these two scenarios, we compared transcriptional bursting between endogenous and ectopic gene expression patterns. Because enhancers act under different regulatory inputs in ectopic patterns, dissimilar bursting control strategies between endogenous and ectopic patterns would suggest that enhancers adapted their bursting strategies to their <i>trans</i>-regulatory environment. Here, we generated ectopic <i>even-skipped</i> transcription patterns in fruit fly embryos and discovered that bursting strategies remain consistent in endogenous and ectopic <i>even-skipped</i> expression. These results provide evidence for a unified molecular mechanism shaping <i>even-skipped</i> bursting strategies and serve as a starting point to uncover the realm of strategies employed by other enhancers.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/80979">Efficient value synthesis in the orbitofrontal cortex explains how loss aversion adapts to the ranges of gain and loss prospects</a></h4>

              
                Is irrational behavior the incidental outcome of biological constraints imposed on neural information processing? In this work, we consider the paradigmatic case of gamble decisions, where gamble values integrate prospective gains and losses. Under the assumption that neurons have a limited firing response range, we show that mitigating the ensuing information loss within artificial neural networks that synthetize value involves a specific form of self-organized plasticity. We demonstrate that the ensuing efficient value synthesis mechanism induces value range adaptation. We also reveal how the ranges of prospective gains and/or losses eventually determine both the behavioral sensitivity to gains and losses and the information content of the network. We test these predictions on two fMRI datasets from the OpenNeuro.org initiative that probe gamble decision-making but differ in terms of the range of gain prospects. First, we show that peoples' loss aversion eventually adapts to the range of gain prospects they are exposed to. Second, we show that the strength with which the orbitofrontal cortex (in particular: Brodmann area 11) encodes gains and expected value also depends upon the range of gain prospects. Third, we show that, when fitted to participant’s gambling choices, self-organizing artificial neural networks generalize across gain range contexts and predict the geometry of information content within the orbitofrontal cortex. Our results demonstrate how self-organizing plasticity aiming at mitigating information loss induced by neurons’ limited response range may result in value range adaptation, eventually yielding irrational behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94296">Decoding contextual influences on auditory perception from primary auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Perception can be highly dependent on stimulus context, but whether and how sensory areas encode the context remains uncertain. We used an ambiguous auditory stimulus – a tritone pair – to investigate the neural activity associated with a preceding contextual stimulus that strongly influenced the tritone pair’s perception: either as an ascending or a descending step in pitch. We recorded single-unit responses from a population of auditory cortical cells in awake ferrets listening to the tritone pairs preceded by the contextual stimulus. We find that the responses adapt locally to the contextual stimulus, consistent with human MEG recordings from the auditory cortex under the same conditions. Decoding the population responses demonstrates that cells responding to pitch-changes are able to predict well the context-sensitive percept of the tritone pairs. Conversely, decoding the individual pitch representations and taking their distance in the circular Shepard tone space predicts the <i>opposite</i> of the percept. The various percepts can be readily captured and explained by a neural model of cortical activity based on populations of adapting, pitch and pitch-direction cells, aligned with the neurophysiological responses. Together, these decoding and model results suggest that contextual influences on perception may well be already encoded at the level of the primary sensory cortices, reflecting basic neural response properties commonly found in these areas.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93405">Pharmacologically inducing regenerative cardiac cells by small molecule drugs</a></h4>

              
                Adult mammals, unlike some lower organisms, lack the ability to regenerate damaged hearts through cardiomyocytes (CMs) dedifferentiation into cells with regenerative capacity. Developing conditions to induce such naturally unavailable cells with potential to proliferate and differentiate into CMs, that is, regenerative cardiac cells (RCCs), in mammals will provide new insights and tools for heart regeneration research. In this study, we demonstrate that a two-compound combination, CHIR99021 and A-485 (2C), effectively induces RCCs from human embryonic stem cell-derived TNNT2<sup>+</sup> CMs in vitro, as evidenced by lineage tracing experiments. Functional analysis shows that these RCCs express a broad spectrum of cardiogenesis genes and have the potential to differentiate into functional CMs, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. Importantly, similar results were observed in neonatal rat CMs both in vitro and in vivo. Remarkably, administering 2C in adult mouse hearts significantly enhances survival and improves heart function post-myocardial infarction. Mechanistically, CHIR99021 is crucial for the transcriptional and epigenetic activation of genes essential for RCC development, while A-485 primarily suppresses H3K27Ac and particularly H3K9Ac in CMs. Their synergistic effect enhances these modifications on RCC genes, facilitating the transition from CMs to RCCs. Therefore, our findings demonstrate the feasibility and reveal the mechanisms of pharmacological induction of RCCs from endogenous CMs, which could offer a promising regenerative strategy to repair injured hearts.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91243">Analysis of foothold selection during locomotion using terrain reconstruction</a></h4>

              
                Relatively little is known about the way vision is used to guide locomotion in the natural world. What visual features are used to choose paths in natural complex terrain? To answer this question, we measured eye and body movements while participants walked in natural outdoor environments. We incorporated measurements of the three-dimensional (3D) terrain structure into our analyses and reconstructed the terrain along the walker’s path, applying photogrammetry techniques to the eye tracker’s scene camera videos. Combining these reconstructions with the walker’s body movements, we demonstrate that walkers take terrain structure into account when selecting paths through an environment. We find that they change direction to avoid taking steeper steps that involve large height changes, instead of choosing more circuitous, relatively flat paths. Our data suggest walkers plan the location of individual footholds and plan ahead to select flatter paths. These results provide evidence that locomotor behavior in natural environments is controlled by decision mechanisms that account for multiple factors, including sensory and motor information, costs, and path planning.

	<p>Introduction: Randomized clinical trials should be complemented with data from real-world studies. We report our long-term experience with safinamide in a movement disorders unit. Methods: This retrospective study included patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) treated with safinamide in our unit from February 2016 to May 2022 under routine clinical practice. Assessments included the Hoehn and Yahr (HY) stage, unified Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease rating scale (UPDRS) part III score, levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD), LEDD for dopamine agonists, and safinamide treatment discontinuation. Results: We included 180 patients with a median age of 74 years (IQR 11), and the majority (90.6%) had an HY stage of &amp;amp;le;2. After a median follow-up of 40 months (IQR 34), 14 patients discontinued treatment with safinamide (7.8%, 95% CI 4.7 to 12.6). Among the 166 patients who remained on safinamide, the UPDRS III score was stable (10 (IQR 9) vs. 9 (IQR 13), p = 0.455). The LEDD significantly increased from a median of 300 mg to 500 mg (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), whereas the LEDD for dopamine agonists did not significantly increase. A subgroup of 89 patients who did not require dopamine agonists during follow-up showed stable UPDRS III score (10 (IQR 7) vs. 9 (IQR 14); p = 0.923), with a significant LEDD increase (300 mg to 400 mg, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Our results support the long-term effectiveness and tolerability of safinamide in patients with PD in clinical practice.</p>
