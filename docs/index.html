<p>Spinal A<sub>3</sub> adenosine receptor (A<sub>3</sub>AR) activation by MRS5698 transiently restores morphine antinociception in opioid-tolerant rats. Intrathecal injection of MRS5698 (“on”) on days 8, 9, 12, and 13 reinstates morphine antinociception. This response is blocked by A<sub>3</sub>AR antagonist MRS1523 and absent when intrathecal vehicle (“off”) is administered on days 10 and 11.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Opioids are potent analgesics, but their pain-relieving effects diminish with repeated use. The reduction in analgesic potency is a hallmark of opioid analgesic tolerance, which hampers opioid pain therapy. In the central nervous system, opioid analgesia is critically modulated by adenosine, a purine nucleoside implicated in the beneficial and detrimental actions of opioid medications. Here, we focus on the A<sub>3</sub> adenosine receptor (A<sub>3</sub>AR) in opioid analgesic tolerance. Intrathecal administration of the A<sub>3</sub>AR agonist MRS5698 with daily systemic morphine in male rats attenuated the reduction in morphine antinociception over 7 days. In rats with established morphine tolerance, intrathecal MRS5698 partially restored the antinociceptive effects of morphine. However, when MRS5698 was discontinued, these animals displayed a reduced antinociceptive response to morphine. Our results suggest that MRS5698 acutely and transiently potentiates morphine antinociception in tolerant rats. By contrast, in morphine-naïve rats MRS5698 treatment did not impact thermal nociceptive threshold or affect antinociceptive response to a single injection of morphine. Furthermore, we found that morphine-induced adenosine release in cerebrospinal fluid was blunted in tolerant animals, but total spinal A<sub>3</sub>AR expression was not affected. Collectively, our findings indicate that spinal A<sub>3</sub>AR activation acutely potentiates morphine antinociception in the opioid tolerant state.</p>

     alt="Endogenous µ-opioid receptor activity in the lateral and capsular subdivisions of the right central nucleus of the amygdala prevents chronic postoperative pain"/>
<p>Incision causes neuronal sensitization and acute postoperative pain. After injury resolves, endogenous µ-opioid receptor (MOR) signaling in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) suppresses latent pain sensitization. Inhibiting MOR signaling, either systemically or within the CeA, unmasks latent sensitization, leading to reinstatement of hypersensitivity.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Tissue injury induces a long-lasting latent sensitization (LS) of spinal nociceptive signaling that is kept in remission by an opposing µ-opioid receptor (MOR) constitutive activity. To test the hypothesis that supraspinal sites become engaged, we induced hindpaw inflammation, waited 3 weeks for mechanical hypersensitivity to resolve, and then injected the opioid receptor inhibitors naltrexone, CTOP or β-funaltrexamine subcutaneously, and/or into the cerebral ventricles. Intracerebroventricular injection of each inhibitor reinstated hypersensitivity and produced somatic signs of withdrawal, indicative of LS and endogenous opioid dependence, respectively. In naïve or sham controls, systemic naloxone (3 mg/kg) produced conditioned place aversion, and systemic naltrexone (3 mg/kg) increased Fos expression in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). In LS animals tested 3 weeks after plantar incision, systemic naltrexone reinstated mechanical hypersensitivity and produced an even greater increase in Fos than in sham controls, particularly in the capsular subdivision of the right CeA. One third of Fos+ profiles co-expressed protein kinase C delta (PKCδ), and 35% of PKCδ neurons co-expressed tdTomato+ in <i>Oprm1<sup>Cre</sup>
</i>::tdTomato transgenic mice. CeA microinjection of naltrexone (1 µg) reinstated mechanical hypersensitivity only in male mice and did not produce signs of somatic withdrawal. Intra-CeA injection of the MOR-selective inhibitor CTAP (300 ng) reinstated hypersensitivity in both male and female mice. We conclude that MORs in the capsular subdivision of the right CeA prevent the transition from acute to chronic postoperative pain.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Opioids are potent analgesics used to manage pain in both young and old, but the increased use in the pregnant population has significant individual and societal implications. Infants dependent on opioids, either through maternal or iatrogenic exposure, undergo neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS), where they may experience withdrawal symptoms ranging from mild to severe. We present a detailed and original review of NOWS caused by maternal opioid exposure (mNOWS) and iatrogenic opioid intake (iNOWS). While these two entities have been assessed entirely separately, recognition and treatment of the clinical manifestations of NOWS overlap. Neonatal risk factors such as age, genetic predisposition, drug type, and clinical factors like type of opioid, cumulative dose of opioid exposure, and disease status affect the incidence of both mNOWS and iNOWS, as well as their severity. Recognition of withdrawal is dependent on clinical assessment of symptoms, and the use of clinical assessment tools designed to determine the need for pharmacotherapy. Treatment of NOWS relies on a combination of non-pharmacological therapies and pharmacological options. Long-term consequences of opioids and NOWS continue to generate controversy, with some evidence of anatomic brain changes, but conflicting animal and human clinical evidence of significant cognitive or behavioral impacts on school-age children. We highlight the current knowledge on clinically relevant recognition, treatment, and consequences of NOWS, and identify new advances in clinical management of the neonate. This review brings a unique clinical perspective and critically analyzes gaps between the clinical problem and our preclinical understanding of NOWS.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The brain's endogenous opioid and endocannabinoid systems are neuromodulatory of synaptic transmission, and play key roles in pain, memory, reward, and addiction. Recent clinical and pre-clinical evidence suggests that opioid use may be reduced with cannabinoid intake. This suggests the presence of a functional interaction between these two systems. Emerging research indicates that cannabinoids and opioids can functionally interact at different levels. At the cellular level, opioid and cannabinoids can have direct receptor associations, alterations in endogenous opioid peptide or cannabinoid release, or post-receptor activation interactions via shared signal transduction pathways. At the systems level, the nature of cannabinoid and opioid interaction might differ in brain circuits underlying different behavioral phenomenon, including reward-seeking or antinociception. Given the rising use of opioid and cannabinoid drugs, a better understanding of how these endogenous signaling systems interact in the brain is of significant interest. This review focuses on the potential relationship of these neural systems in addiction-related processes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Engaging endogenous opioid circuits in pain affective processes</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The pervasive use of opioid compounds for pain relief is rooted in their utility as one of the most effective therapeutic strategies for providing analgesia. While the detrimental side effects of these compounds have significantly contributed to the current opioid epidemic, opioids still provide millions of patients with reprieve from the relentless and agonizing experience of pain. The human experience of pain has long recognized the perceived unpleasantness entangled with a unique sensation that is immediate and identifiable from the first-person subjective vantage point as “painful.” From this phenomenological perspective, how is it that opioids interfere with pain perception? Evidence from human lesion, neuroimaging, and preclinical functional neuroanatomy approaches is sculpting the view that opioids predominately alleviate the affective or inferential appraisal of nociceptive neural information. Thus, opioids weaken pain-associated unpleasantness rather than modulate perceived sensory qualities. Here, we discuss the historical theories of pain to demonstrate how modern neuroscience is revisiting these ideas to deconstruct the brain mechanisms driving the emergence of aversive pain perceptions. We further detail how targeting opioidergic signaling within affective or emotional brain circuits remains a strong avenue for developing targeted pharmacological and gene-therapy analgesic treatments that might reduce the dependence on current clinical opioid options.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Genetic implications in quality palliative care and preventing opioid crisis in cancer‐related pain management</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The prevalence of cancer-related pain is 64% among patients with metastatic, advanced, or terminal cancer, 59% among patients undergoing anticancer treatment, and 33% among patients who completed curative treatment. According to the World Health Organization cancer pain relief guidelines, opioid analgesics are the mainstay analgesic therapy in addition to conventional first-step analgesics, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen. The indications for strong opioids have recently been expanded to include mild-to-moderate pain in addition to moderate-to-severe pain. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines emphasize that realistic expectations should be weighed against potential serious harm from opioids, rather than relying on the unrealized long-term benefits of these drugs. Therefore, treatment strategies for both cancer-related chronic or acute pain have been unfortunately deviated from opioid analgesics. The barriers hindering adequate cancer-related pain management with opioid analgesics are related to the inadequate knowledge of opioid analgesics (e.g., effective dose, adverse effects, and likelihood of addiction or tolerance). To achieve adequate opioid availability, these barriers should be overcome in a clinically suitable manner. Genetic assessments could play an important role in overcoming challenges in opioid management. To balance the improvement in opioid availability and the prevention of opioid misuse and addiction, the following two considerations concerning opioids and genetic polymorphisms warrant attention: (A) pain severity, opioid sensitivity, and opioid tolerance; and (B) vulnerability to opioid dependence and addiction.</p>

<p>Morphine, morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) activate human astrocytes via mitogen-activated protein kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathways. Morphine but especially prolonged exposure to M3G perturbed cellular pathways in astrocytes, which among others, are important for their interaction with neurons and leukocytes. </p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Tolerance and hyperalgesia associated with chronic exposure to morphine are major limitations in the clinical management of chronic pain. At a cellular level, neuronal signaling can in part account for these undesired side effects, but unknown mechanisms mediated by central nervous system glial cells are likely also involved. Here we applied data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry to perform a deep proteome and phosphoproteome analysis of how human astrocytes responds to opioid stimulation. We unveil time- and dose-dependent effects induced by morphine and its major active metabolites morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide that converging on activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathways. We also find that especially longer exposure to M3G leads to significant dysregulation of biological pathways linked to extracellular matrix organization, antigen presentation, cell adhesion, and glutamate homeostasis, which are crucial for neuron– and leukocyte–astrocyte interactions.</p>

<p>5-Fluorouracil-induced gut toxicity resulted in a main neuroimmunological effect in the thoracic region with carprofen ameliorating this effect. Buprenorphine and tramadol increased astrocyte reactivity marker expression, yet decreased thoracic IL-1beta expression. Understanding the peripheral-to-central complications arising in chemotherapy-induced toxicities and analgesic treatments may elucidate potential mechanisms contributing to the central complications arising from chemotherapy.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cancer patients may experience symptom clusters, including chemotherapy-induced (CI) gut toxicity (CIGT) and cognitive impairment. Analgesic selection for pain associated with CIGT is difficult as opioids induce glial reactivity and unwanted side effects. This study quantified central glial reactivity and proinflammatory effects in rats with CIGT using three mechanistically different analgesics. Regional adaptations were indicative of immune-to-brain signaling routes. Utilizing a 5-fluorouracil-induced GT (5IGT) rat model and analgesic intervention (carprofen (CAR), buprenorphine (BUP), and tramadol (TRAM)), spinal and brain neuroimmune modulation was examined via microglial, astrocyte, and proinflammatory (cluster of differentiation molecule 11b; CD11b, glial fibrillary associated protein; GFAP, and interleukin-1 beta; IL1β) reactivity marker expression changes by western blot analysis. 5IGT significantly increased thoracic GFAP (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and IL-1β (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) expression, CAR and BUP ameliorated these effects. BUP and TRAM with 5-FU synergistically increased hippocampal GFAP expression. CAR administered with 5IGT significantly elevated hippocampal and thoracic CD11b expression levels (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The neuroimmune responses observed in this study suggest activation of peripheral-to-central immune signaling pathways. We speculate that the opioid-induced hippocampal changes inferred a humorally mediated mechanism, whereas thoracic neuroimmune modifications indicated activation of an indirect neural route. Although TRAM ameliorated 5IGT-intestinal inflammation, this opioid presents complications relating to bodyweight and regional glial dysregulation (neuroinflammation) and may not be optimal in the management of pain associated with 5IGT. The chemotherapy-induced gut-derived neuroimmune consequences observed suggest a potential mechanistic contribution to central components of the cancer symptom cluster experience, while the opioid-related glial changes have implications for optimal pain management in this setting warranting further investigation.</p>

<p>Subanalgesic morphine augmentsfentanyl analgesia via MOP and DOP interactions that increase G proteinactivation unrelated to MOP receptor internalization.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Opioids are commonly used for the treatment of postoperative and post-traumatic pain; however, their therapeutic effectiveness is limited by undesirable and life-threatening side effects. Researchers have long attempted to develop opioid co-administration therapies that enhance analgesia, but the complexity of opioid analgesia and our incomplete mechanistic understanding has made this a daunting task. We discovered that subanalgesic morphine doses (100 ng/kg–10 µg/kg) augmented the acute analgesic effect of fentanyl (20 µg/kg) following subcutaneous drug co-administration to male rats. In addition, administration of equivalent drug ratios to naïve rat spinal cord membranes induced a twofold increase in G protein activation. The rate of GTP hydrolysis remained unchanged. We demonstrated that these behavioral and biochemical effects were mediated by the delta opioid receptor (DOP). Subanalgesic doses of the DOP-selective agonist SNC80 also augmented the acute analgesic effect of fentanyl. Furthermore, co-administration of the DOP antagonist naltrindole with both fentanyl-morphine and fentanyl-SNC80 combinations prevented augmentation of both analgesia and G protein activation. The mu opioid receptor (MOP) antagonist cyprodime did not block augmentation. Confocal microscopy of the substantia gelatinosa of rats treated with fentanyl, subanalgesic morphine, or this combination showed that changes in MOP internalization did not account for augmentation effects. Together, these findings suggest that augmentation of fentanyl analgesia by subanalgesic morphine is mediated by increased G protein activation resulting from a synergistic interaction between or heterodimerization of MOPs and DOPs. This finding is of great therapeutic significance because it suggests a strategy for the development of DOP-selective ligands that can enhance the therapeutic index of clinically used MOP drugs.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Over the past several years, studies have highlighted the δ-opioid receptor (DOPr) as a promising therapeutic target for chronic pain management. While exhibiting milder undesired effects than most currently prescribed opioids, its specific agonists elicit effective analgesic responses in numerous animal models of chronic pain, including inflammatory, neuropathic, diabetic, and cancer-related pain. However, as compared with the extensively studied μ-opioid receptor, the molecular mechanisms governing its trafficking remain elusive. Recent advances have denoted several significant particularities in the regulation of DOPr intracellular routing, setting it apart from the other members of the opioid receptor family. Although they share high homology, each opioid receptor subtype displays specific amino acid patterns potentially involved in the regulation of its trafficking. These precise motifs or “barcodes” are selectively recognized by regulatory proteins and therefore dictate several aspects of the itinerary of a receptor, including its anterograde transport, internalization, recycling, and degradation. With a specific focus on the regulation of DOPr trafficking, this review will discuss previously reported, as well as potential novel trafficking barcodes within the opioid and nociceptin/orphanin FQ opioid peptide receptors, and their impact in determining distinct interactomes and physiological responses.</p>

<p>Cartoon depicting evolution of endogenous opioid systems. Our findings in this paper show the identification of an authentic mammalian-like endogenous opioid system in the Pacific Hagfish with no evidence for opioid systems in invertebrate genomes</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The actions of endogenous opioids and nociceptin/orphanin FQ are mediated by four homologous G protein-coupled receptors that constitute the opioid receptor family. However, little is known about opioid systems in cyclostomes (living jawless fish) and how opioid systems might have evolved from invertebrates. Here, we leveraged de novo transcriptome and low-coverage whole-genome assembly in the Pacific hagfish (<i>Eptatretus stoutii</i>) to identify and characterize the first full-length coding sequence for a functional opioid receptor in a cyclostome. Additionally, we define two novel endogenous opioid precursors in this species that predict several novel opioid peptides. Bioinformatic analysis shows no closely related opioid receptor genes in invertebrates with regard either to the genomic organization or to conserved opioid receptor-specific sequences that are common in all vertebrates. Furthermore, no proteins analogous to vertebrate opioid precursors could be identified by genomic searches despite previous claims of protein or RNA-derived sequences in several invertebrate species. The presence of an expressed orthologous receptor and opioid precursors in the Pacific hagfish confirms that a functional opioid system was likely present in the common ancestor of all extant vertebrates some 550 million years ago, earlier than all previous authenticated accounts. We discuss the premise that the cyclostome and vertebrate opioid systems evolved from invertebrate systems concerned with antimicrobial defense and speculate that the high concentrations of opioid precursors in tissues such as the testes, gut, and activated immune cells are key remnants of this evolutionary role.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Thousands of individuals die each year from opioid-related overdoses. While naloxone (Narcan®) is currently the most widely employed treatment to reverse opioid toxicity, high or repeated doses of this antidote often lead to precipitated opioid withdrawal (POW). We hypothesized that a slow linear release of naloxone from a nanoparticle would induce fewer POW symptoms compared to high-dose free naloxone. First, we measured the acute impact of covalent naloxone nanoparticles (Nal-<i>c</i>NPs) on morphine-induced antinociception in the hotplate test. We found that Nal-<i>c</i>NP treatment blocked the antinociceptive effect of morphine within 15 min of administration. Next, we tested the impact of Nal-<i>c</i>NPs on POW symptoms in male morphine-dependent mice. To induce morphine dependence, mice were treated with 5 mg/kg morphine (or saline) twice-daily for six consecutive days. On day 7 mice received 5 mg/kg morphine (or saline) injections 2 hr prior to receiving treatment of either unmodified free naloxone, a high or low dose of Nal-<i>c</i>NP, empty nanoparticle (<i>c</i>NP-empty), or saline. Behavior was analyzed for 0–6 hr followed by 24 and 48 hr time points after treatment. As expected, free naloxone induced a significant increase in POW behavior in morphine-dependent mice compared to saline-treated mice upon free naloxone administration. In comparison, reduced POW behavior was observed with both doses of Nal-<i>c</i>NP. Side effects of Nal-<i>c</i>NP on locomotion and fecal boli production were measured and no significant side-effects were observed. Overall, our data show that sustained release of naloxone from a covalent nanoparticle does not induce severe POW symptoms in morphine-dependent mice.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Latest studies have revealed that pain negatively impacts on reward processing and motivation leading to negative affective states and stress. These states not only reduce quality of life of patients by increasing the appearance of psychiatric comorbidities, but also have an important impact on vulnerability to drug abuse, including alcohol. In fact, clinical, epidemiological but also preclinical studies have revealed that the presence of pain is closely related to alcohol use disorders (AUDs). All this evidence suggests that pain is a factor that increases the risk of suffering AUD, predicting heavy drinking behavior and relapse drinking in those patients with a previous history of AUD. The negative consequences of chronic pain and its impact on stress and AUD are likely mediated by alterations in the central nervous system, especially in the stress and reward systems. Therefore, pain and stress impact on dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway can lead to an increase in drug abuse liability. In this mini review we analyze the interaction between pain, stress, and alcohol addiction, and how dynamic changes in the kappa opioid system might play a crucial role in the development of compulsive alcohol drinking in chronic pain patients.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Given the ubiquitous nature of opioids in the treatment of pain, it is an interesting paradox that this class of medications also represents one of the least understood components of clinical pain medicine. For many years, there has been intense interest in the mechanisms of opioid activity, but this has not resulted in a corresponding increase in convincing clinical data. This review focuses primarily on the evidence surrounding the long-term use of opioids in chronic pain, but discussions of this research are often conflated with the very different data governing acute and cancer-related pain, where evidence of efficacy is clearer. It is therefore important to clarify the evidence-based indications for opioid therapy. There remains very little evidence that opioids improve function or quality of life beyond 3 months in people with chronic pain conditions. In all three patient populations, the development of tolerance, dependence, hyperalgesia and withdrawal are key phenomena that affect the patient experience, and in particular the decision to remain on opioids in the long term. This is a common thread that connects the opioid literature in all of these spheres, and justifies the burgeoning interest in these phenomena in the basic science literature. There is an urgent need to address these negative consequences of opioid use, in order to maximize the therapeutic benefit that opioids can offer.</p>

<p>The kappa opioid receptor (KOR) is notable for its robust sex difference, with females being less responsive to KOR agonists than males. In this study, we use two genetic mouse models (four core genotype and XY*) to isolate the sex chromosome and gonadal hormone contribution to this observed sex difference.

This study determines that genes on the X chromosome contribute to the sex difference in KOR function.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Kappa opioid receptor (KOR) agonists produce robust analgesia with minimal abuse liability and are considered promising pharmacological agents to manage chronic pain and itch. The KOR system is also notable for robust differences between the sexes, with females exhibiting lower analgesic response than males. Sexually dimorphic traits can be due to either the influence of gonadal hormones during development or adulthood, or due to the complement of genes expressed on the X or Y chromosome. Previous studies examining sex differences in KOR antinociception have relied on surgical or pharmacological manipulation of the gonads to determine whether sex hormones influence KOR function. While there are conflicting reports whether gonadal hormones influence KOR function, no study has examined these effects in context with sex chromosomes. Here, we use two genetic mouse models, the four core genotypes and XY*, to isolate the chromosomal and hormonal contributions to sex differences in KOR analgesia. Mice were treated with systemic KOR agonist (U50,488H) and thermal analgesia measured in the tail withdrawal assay. We found that KOR antinociception was influenced predominantly by the number of the X chromosomes. These data suggest that the dose and/or parental imprint on X gene(s) contribute significantly to the sexually dimorphism in KOR analgesia.</p>

     alt="The CRF1 receptor mediates social behavior deficits induced by opiate withdrawal"/>
<p>Sociability deficits and aggressive behavior are common clinical features of opioid use disorders. Herein, genetic inactivation of the corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 (CRF<sub>1</sub>) eliminated social approach deficits or hostility-linked social approach in morphine-withdrawn female or male mice, respectively. Thus, reduction of CRF<sub>1</sub> receptor activity might ameliorate sociability of opiate-dependent patients.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Poor sociability and aggressive behavior are key clinical features of opioid use disorders. The corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system may mediate behavioral effects of substances of abuse <i>but</i> its implication in substance-induced social behavior deficits and outward-directed hostility remains largely unknown. CRF signaling is mediated by two receptor types, termed CRF<sub>1</sub> and CRF<sub>2</sub>. The present study aimed at understanding the role for the CRF<sub>1</sub> receptor in social and aggressive behavior induced by withdrawal from repeated opiate administration. Thus, wild-type (CRF<sub>1</sub>+/+), CRF<sub>1</sub> receptor heterozygous (CRF<sub>1</sub>+/−), and null mutant (CRF<sub>1</sub>−/−) female and male mice were treated with saline or escalating doses of morphine (20-100 mg/kg, i.p.) during six consecutive days and tested in the three-chamber task for sociability (i.e., preference for an unfamiliar same-sex conspecific vs. an object) 7 days after the last administration. Moreover, aggressive biting behavior toward the unfamiliar conspecific was assessed during the three-chamber test. Opiate withdrawal disrupted sociability in CRF<sub>1</sub>+/+ and CRF<sub>1</sub>+/−, <i>but not</i> in CRF<sub>1</sub>−/−, female mice, without affecting aggressive biting behavior in any genotype. In contrast, opiate withdrawal did not affect sociability <i>but</i> increased aggressive biting behavior in male mice, independently of CRF<sub>1</sub> receptor-deficiency. Nevertheless, in opiate-withdrawn CRF<sub>1</sub>+/+, <i>but not</i> CRF<sub>1</sub>+/− and CRF<sub>1</sub>−/−, male mice, sociability directly correlated with aggressive biting behavior, suggesting a role for the CRF<sub>1</sub> receptor in hostility-linked social approach. These findings demonstrate the implication of the CRF<sub>1</sub> receptor in social behavior deficits associated with repeated opiate administration and withdrawal, revealing a new potential target for the treatment of opioid use disorders.</p>

<p>In mice with Cx3cr1-Cre-mediated conditional deletion of mu opioid receptor (MOR) in microglia, morphine analgesic tolerance was delayed, opioid-induced hyperalgesia was abolished in males, and physical dependence was attenuated in females. This sex-specific role of microglial MOR provides a crucial information for developing opiate analgesia without adverse effects.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A major challenge in medicine is developing potent pain therapies without the adverse effects of opiates. Neuroinflammation and in particular microglial activation have been shown to contribute to these effects. However, the implication of the microglial mu opioid receptor (MOR) is not known. We developed a novel conditional knockout (cKO) mouse line, wherein MOR is deleted in microglia. Morphine analgesic tolerance was delayed in both sexes in cKO mice in the hot plate assay. Opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) as measured in the tail immersion assay was abolished in male cKO mice, and physical dependence to morphine as assessed by naloxone-induced withdrawal was attenuated in female cKO mice. Our results show a sex-dependent contribution of microglial MOR in morphine analgesic tolerance, OIH, and physical dependence. In conclusion, our data suggest that blockade of microglial MOR could represent a therapeutic target for opiate analgesia without the opiate adverse effects.</p>

<p>Dysregulated expression of several <i>OPRM1</i> splice variant mRNAs in the medial prefrontal cortex of male human heroin abusers was recaptured in heroin self-administering male rats, suggesting potential roles of the <i>OPRM1</i> splice variants in heroin addiction that could be mechanistically explored using the rat heroin self-administration model.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Heroin, a mu agonist, acts through the mu opioid receptor. The mu opioid receptor gene, <i>OPRM1,</i> undergoes extensive alternative splicing, creating an array of splice variants that are conserved from rodent to humans. Increasing evidence suggests that these <i>OPRM1</i> splice variants are pharmacologically important in mediating various actions of mu opioids, including analgesia, tolerance, physical dependence, rewarding behavior, as well as addiction. In the present study, we examine expression of the <i>OPRM1</i> splice variant mRNAs in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), one of the major brain regions involved in decision-making and drug-seeking behaviors, of male human heroin abusers and male rats that developed stable heroin-seeking behavior using an intravenous heroin self-administration (SA) model. The results show similar expression profiles among multiple <i>OPRM1</i> splice variants in both human control subjects and saline control rats, illustrating conservation of <i>OPRM1</i> alternative splicing from rodent to humans. Moreover, the expressions of several <i>OPRM1</i> splice variant mRNAs were dysregulated in the postmortem mPFCs from heroin abusers compared to the control subjects. Similar patterns were observed in the rat heroin SA model. These findings suggest potential roles of the <i>OPRM1</i> splice variants in heroin addiction that could be mechanistically explored using the rat heroin SA model.</p>

<p>Voluntary wheel running was assessed after peripheral nerve injury. Active phase running distance and speed are also measured in response to morphine alone, or in combination with antagonists of either P2X7R or TLR4.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The present series of studies examine the impact of systemically administered therapeutics on peripheral nerve injury (males; unilateral sciatic chronic constriction injury [CCI])-induced suppression of voluntary wheel running, across weeks after dosing cessation. Following CCI, active phase running distance and speed are suppressed throughout the 7-week observation period. A brief course of morphine, however, increased active phase running distance and speed throughout this same period, an effect apparent only in sham rats. For CCI rats, systemic co-administration of morphine with antagonists of either P2X7 (A438079) or TLR4 ((+)-naloxone) (receptors critical to the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes and consequent inflammatory cascades) returned running behavior of CCI rats to that of shams through 5+ weeks after dosing ceased. This is a striking difference in effect compared to our prior CCI allodynia results using systemic morphine plus intrathecal delivery of these same antagonists, wherein a sustained albeit partial suppression of neuropathic pain was observed. This may point to actions of the systemic drugs at multiple sites along the neuraxis, modulating injury-induced, inflammasome-mediated effects at the injured sciatic nerve and/or dorsal root ganglia, spinal cord, and potentially higher levels. Given that our data to date point to morphine amplifying neuroinflammatory processes put into motion by nerve injury, it is intriguing to speculate that co-administration of TLR4 and/or P2X7 antagonists can intervene in these inflammatory processes in a beneficial way. That is, that systemic administration of such compounds may suppress inflammatory damage at multiple sites, rapidly and persistently returning neuropathic animals to sham levels of response.</p>

<p>Subjective effects of initial opioid misuse were assessed in two samples of opioid misusers that included low-level users who never met criteria for opioid use disorder (OUD) and heavier users with OUD. In both samples, OUD+ individuals reported greater euphoria, activation, pruritus, and internalizing symptoms (replication sample data are displayed).</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Attempts to identify opioid users with increased risk of escalating to opioid use disorder (OUD) have had limited success. Retrospectively assessed subjective effects of initial opioid misuse were compared in a pilot sample of opioid misusers (nonmedical use ≤60 times lifetime) who had never met criteria for OUD (<i>N</i> = 14) and heroin-addicted individuals in treatment for OUD (<i>N</i> = 15). Relative to opioid misusers without a lifetime OUD diagnosis, individuals with OUD reported greater euphoria and other positive emotions, activation, pruritus, and internalizing symptoms. Consistent with these findings, proxy Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI) Amphetamine Group, and Morphine Benzedrine Group scale mean item scores were significantly higher in those with OUD. Replication was attempted in opioid misusers with (<i>N</i> = 25) and without OUD (<i>N</i> = 25) who were assessed as part of an ongoing genetic study. We observed similar significant between-group differences in individual subjective effect items and ARCI scale mean item scores in the replication sample. We, thus confirm findings from prior reports that retrospectively assessed subjective responses to initial opioid exposure differ significantly between opioid users who do, and do not, progress to OUD. Our report extends these findings in comparisons limited to opioid misusers. Additional research will be necessary to examine prospectively whether the assessment of subjective effects after initial use has predictive utility in the identification of individuals more likely to progress to OUD.</p>

     alt="Delta opioid receptor activation modulates affective pain and modality-specific pain hypersensitivity associated with chronic neuropathic pain"/>
<p>Delta opioid receptor agonist potency and efficacy are enhanced chronic neuropathic pain states. Activation of these receptors produces negative reinforcement in pain animals, demonstrating the importance of this receptor in its ability to modulate the tonic aversive component of pain. Neuropathic pain engages enkephalin circuits that when blocked exaggerates the affective component of pain. One of the underlying mechanisms responsible for the increased activity of delta opioid receptors is trafficking of receptors to cell membranes of deep dorsal horn spinal neurons. Finally, presynaptic and postsynaptic delta opioid receptors modulate thermal and mechanical nociception, respectively.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Delta opioid receptor (DOR) agonists alleviate nociceptive behaviors in various chronic pain models, including neuropathic pain, while having minimal effect on sensory thresholds in the absence of injury. The mechanisms underlying nerve injury-induced enhancement of DOR function are unclear. We used a peripheral nerve injury (PNI) model of neuropathic pain to assess changes in the function and localization of DORs in mice and rats. Intrathecal administration of DOR agonists reversed mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. The dose-dependent thermal antinociceptive effects of DOR agonists were shifted to the left in PNI rats. Administration of DOR agonists produced a conditioned place preference in PNI, but not in sham, animals, whereas the DOR antagonist naltrindole produced a place aversion in PNI, but not in sham, mice, suggesting the engagement of endogenous DOR activity in suppressing pain associated with the injury. GTPγS autoradiography revealed an increase in DOR function in the dorsal spinal cord, ipsilateral to PNI. Immunogold electron microscopy and <i>in vivo</i> fluorescent agonist assays were used to assess changes in the ultrastructural localization of DORs in the spinal dorsal horn. In shams, DORs were primarily localized within intracellular compartments. PNI significantly increased the cell surface expression of DORs within lamina IV-V dendritic profiles. Using neonatal capsaicin treatment, we identified that DOR agonist-induced thermal antinociception was mediated via receptors expressed on primary afferent sensory neurons but did not alter mechanical thresholds. These data reveal that the regulation of DORs following PNI and suggest the importance of endogenous activation of DORs in regulating chronic pain states.</p>

<p>Blockade of peripheral opioid receptors with the peripherally restricted antagonist, methylnaltrexone (MNTX), had no effect on acute morphine antinociception or development of tolerance. The results do not support the use of MNTX for preventing opioid tolerance and also suggest that morphine tolerance is mediated by central rather than peripheral opioid receptors in the rat.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Opioids are effective analgesics in the management of severe pain. However, tolerance, leading to dose escalation and adverse effects are significant limiting factors in their use. The role of peripheral opioid receptors in analgesia has been discussed especially under inflammatory conditions. The results from pharmacological and conditional knockout studies together do not provide a clear picture of the contribution of peripheral opioid receptors on antinociceptive tolerance and this needs to be evaluated. Therefore, we studied whether the peripherally restricted opioid receptor antagonist, methylnaltrexone (MNTX), could prevent morphine tolerance without attenuating the antinociceptive effect of morphine. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated for 7 days with increasing subcutaneous doses of morphine (5–30 mg/kg) and were coadministered saline, MNTX (0.5 or 2 mg/kg), or naltrexone (NTX; 2 mg/kg). Nociception was assessed with tail-flick, hotplate, and von Frey tests. Morphine, MNTX, and NTX concentrations in the plasma, brain, and spinal cord were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In acute coadministration, NTX, but not MNTX, abolished the acute antinociceptive effects of morphine in all nociceptive tests. The antinociceptive tolerance after repeated morphine administration was also prevented by NTX but not by MNTX. MNTX penetrated to the spinal cord and the brain to some extent after repeated administration. The results do not support the use of MNTX for preventing opioid tolerance and also suggest that morphine tolerance is mediated by central rather than peripheral opioid receptors in the rat.</p>

     alt="Blockade of dopamine D1 receptors in male rats disrupts morphine reward in pain naïve but not in chronic pain states"/>
<p>We tested the hypothesis that the neural mechanism of opiate reward are dissociable in pain-naïve and chronic pain states. Using the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain, both CCI and sham rats displayed a CPP to morphine. The effect was blocked by dopamine D1 receptor antagonism but only in pain-naïve rats, adding to evidence that chronic pain modifies brain reward circuits.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The rewarding effect of opiates is mediated through dissociable neural systems in drug naïve and drug-dependent states. Neuroadaptations associated with chronic drug use are similar to those produced by chronic pain, suggesting that opiate reward could also involve distinct mechanisms in chronic pain and pain-naïve states. We tested this hypothesis by examining the effect of dopamine (DA) antagonism on morphine reward in a rat model of neuropathic pain.Neuropathic pain was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats through chronic constriction (CCI) of the sciatic nerve; reward was assessed in the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm in separate groups at early (4-8 days post-surgery) and late (11-15 days post-surgery) phases of neuropathic pain. Minimal effective doses of morphine that produced a CPP in early and late phases of neuropathic pain were 6 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg respectively. The DA D1 receptor antagonist, SCH23390, blocked a morphine CPP in sham, but not CCI, rats at a higher dose (0.5 mg/kg), but had no effect at a lower dose (0.1 mg/kg). The DA D2 receptor antagonist, eticlopride (0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg), had no effect on a morphine CPP in sham or CCI rats, either in early or late phases of neuropathic pain. In the CPP paradigm, morphine reward involves DA D1 mechanisms in pain-naïve but not chronic pain states. This could reflect increased sensitivity to drug effects in pain versus no pain conditions and/or differential mediation of opiate reward in these two states.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Clinical and basic research investigations into the long‐term effects of prenatal opioid exposure on brain development</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Coincident with the opioid epidemic in the United States has been a dramatic increase in the number of children born with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), a form of withdrawal resulting from opioid exposure during pregnancy. Many research efforts on NAS have focused on short-term care, including acute symptom treatment and weaning of the infants off their drug dependency prior to authorizing their release. However, investigations into the long-term effects of prenatal opioid exposure (POE) on brain development, from the cellular to the behavioral level, have not been as frequent. Given the importance of the perinatal period for human brain development, opioid-induced disturbances in the formation and function of nascent synaptic networks and glia have the potential to impact brain connectivity and cognition long after the drug supply is cutoff shortly after birth. In this review, we will summarize the current state of NAS research, bringing together findings from human studies and preclinical animal models to highlight what is known about how POE can induce significant, prolonged deficits in brain structure and function. With rates of NAS continuing to rise, particularly in regions that already face substantial socioeconomic challenges, we speculate as to the most promising avenues for future research to alleviate this growing multigenerational threat.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Therapeutic potentials of NOP and MOP receptor coactivation for the treatment of pain and opioid abuse</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Following the identification of the nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) peptide (NOP) as an endogenous ligand for the NOP receptor, ample evidence has revealed unique functional profiles of the N/OFQ-NOP receptor system. NOP receptors are expressed in key neural substrates involved in pain and reward modulation. In nonhuman primates (NHPs), NOP receptor activation effectively exerts antinociception and anti-hypersensitivity at the spinal and supraspinal levels. Moreover, NOP receptor activation inhibits dopaminergic transmission and synergistically enhances mu-opioid peptide (MOP) receptor-mediated analgesia. In this article, we have discussed the functional profiles of ligands with dual NOP and MOP receptor agonist activities and highlight their optimal functional efficacy for pain relief and drug abuse treatment. Through coactivation of NOP and MOP receptors, bifunctional NOP/MOP receptor “partial” agonists (e.g., AT-121, BU08028, and BU10038) reveal a wider therapeutic window with fewer side effects. These newly developed ligands potently induce antinociception without MOP receptor agonist-associated side effects such as abuse potential, respiratory depression, itching sensation, and physical dependence. In addition, in both rodent and NHP models, bifunctional NOP/MOP receptor agonists can attenuate reward processing and/or the reinforcing effects of opioids and other abused drugs. While a mixed NOP/opioid receptor “full” agonist cebranopadol is undergoing clinical trials, bifunctional NOP/MOP “partial” agonists exhibit promising therapeutic profiles in translational NHP models for the treatment of pain and opioid abuse. This class of drugs demonstrates the therapeutic advantage of NOP and MOP receptor coactivation, indicating a greater potential for future development.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This mini-review presents the view that contemporary approaches to stem the tide of opioid overdose deaths are insufficient to make a significant impact. Instead, a focus on the opioid receptor as the ultimate molecular target to directly abolish opioid overdose death is explored. After identifying the key brainstem neurons that control respiration which are inhibited by opioid drugs, genetic techniques targeting the <i>mu</i> opioid receptor are detailed which prevent opioid overdose. This receptor-centric solution for the opioid overdose epidemic can be realized with existing technology and, with sufficient effort, could enter clinical trials within 5 to 10 years.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Time-adaptive Unsupervised Auditory Attention Decoding Using EEG-based Stimulus Reconstruction</a></h4>

              
                The goal of auditory attention decoding (AAD) is to determine to which speaker out of multiple competing speakers a listener is attending based on the brain signals recorded via, e.g., electroencephalography (EEG). AAD algorithms are a fundamental building block of so-called neuro-steered hearing devices that would allow identifying the speaker that should be amplified based on the brain activity. A common approach is to train a subject-specific decoder that reconstructs the amplitude envelope of the attended speech signal. However, training this decoder requires a dedicated 'ground-truth' EEG recording of the subject under test, during which the attended speaker is known. Furthermore, this decoder remains fixed during operation and can thus not adapt to changing conditions and situations. Therefore, we propose an online time-adaptive unsupervised stimulus reconstruction method that continuously and automatically adapts over time when new EEG and audio data are streaming in. The adaptive decoder does not require ground-truth attention labels obtained from a training session with the end-user, and instead can be initialized with a generic subject-independent decoder or even completely random values. We propose two different implementations: a sliding window and recursive implementation, which we extensively validate based on multiple performance metrics on three independent datasets. We show that the proposed time-adaptive unsupervised decoder outperforms a time-invariant supervised decoder, representing an important step towards practically applicable AAD algorithms for neuro-steered hearing devices.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Frequency Effects on Spelling Error Recognition: An ERP Study</a></h4>

              
                Spelling errors are ubiquitous in all writing systems. Most studies exploring spelling errors focused on the phonological plausibility of errors. However, unlike typical pseudohomophones, spelling errors occur in naturally produced written language with variable frequencies. We investigated the time course of recognition of the most frequent orthographic errors in Russian (error in an unstressed vowel at the root) and the effect of word frequency on this process. During ERP recording, 26 native Russian speakers silently read high-frequency correctly spelled words, low-frequency correctly spelled words, high-frequency words with errors, and low-frequency words with errors. The amplitude of P200 was more positive for correctly spelled words than for misspelled words and did not depend on the frequency of the words. Word frequency affected spelling recognition in the later stages of word processing (350-700 ms): high-frequency misspelled words elicited a greater P300 than high-frequency correctly spelled words, and low-frequency misspelled words elicited a greater N400 than low-frequency correctly spelled words. We observe spelling effects in the same time window for both the P300 and N400, which may reflect temporal overlap between mainly categorization processes based on orthographic properties for high-frequency words and phonological processes for low-frequency words. We concluded that two independent pathways can be active simultaneously during spelling recognition: one reflects mainly orthographic processing of high-frequency words and the other is the phonological processing of low-frequency words. Our findings suggest that these pathways are associated with different ERP components. Therefore, our results complement existing reading models and demonstrate that the neuronal underpinnings of spelling error recognition during reading depend on word frequency.

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Noise introduced in the human nervous system from cellular to systems levels can have a major impact on signal processing. Using transcranial stimulation, electrical noise can be added to cortical circuits to modulate neuronal activity and enhance function in the healthy brain and in neurologic patients. Transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) is a promising technique that is less well understood than other non-invasive neuromodulatory methods. The aim of the present scoping review is to collate published evidence on the effects of electrical noise at the cellular, systems, and behavioral levels, and discuss how this emerging method might be harnessed to augment perceptual and motor functioning of the human nervous system. Online databases were used to identify papers published in 2008&ndash;2021 using tRNS in humans, from which we identified 70 publications focusing on sensory and motor function. Additionally, we interpret the existing evidence by referring to articles investigating the effects of noise stimulation in animal and subcellular models. We review physiological and behavioral findings of tRNS-induced offline after-effects and acute online benefits which manifest immediately when tRNS is applied to sensory or motor cortices. We link these results to evidence showing that activity of voltage-gated sodium ion channels might be an important cellular substrate for mediating these tRNS effects. We argue that tRNS might make neural signal transmission and processing within neuronal populations more efficient, which could contribute to both (1) offline after-effects in the form of a prolonged increase in cortical excitability and (2) acute online noise benefits when computations rely on weak inputs.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Our eyes are constantly in motion and the various kinds of eye movements are closely linked to many aspects of human cognitive processing. Measuring all possible eye movements unobtrusively is not achievable with current methods. Video-based eye-trackers only measure rotational but not translational motion of the eye, require a calibration process relying on the participant&rsquo;s self-report of accurate fixation, and do not work if vision of the eyeball is blocked. Scleral search coils attach physical weight on the eyeball and also do not measure translation. Here, we describe a novel and fully automated method to use real-time magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for eye tracking. We achieved a temporal resolution sufficient to measure eye rotations and translations as short as those that occur within a blink and behind a closed eyelid. To demonstrate this method, we measured the full extent of the blink-related eye movement for two individuals, suggesting that the eye approaches a holding position during lid closure and can move by as much as 35&deg; in rotation and 2 mm in translation. We also investigated the coordination of gaze shifts with blinks. We found that the gaze shift is tightly coupled in time to the translational blink movement and that blinks can induce significant temporal shifts of the gaze trajectory between left and right eye. Our MR-based Eye Tracking (MREyeTrack) method allows measurement of eye movements in terms of both translation and rotation and enables new opportunities for studying ocular motility and its disorders.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The superior parietal lobule (SPL) integrates somatosensory, motor, and visual signals to dynamically control arm movements. During reaching, visual and gaze signals are used to guide the hand to the desired target location, while proprioceptive signals allow to correct arm trajectory, and keep the limb in the final position at the end of the movement. Three SPL areas are particularly involved in this process: V6A, PEc, PE. Here, we evaluated the influence of eye and arm position on single neuron activity of these areas during the holding period at the end of arm reaching movements, when the arm is motionless and gaze and hand positions are aligned. Two male macaques (<I>Macaca fascicularis</I>) performed a foveal reaching task while single unit activity was recorded from areas V6A, PEc, and PE. We found that at the end of reaching movements the neurons of all these areas were modulated by both eye position and static position of the arm. V6A and PEc showed a prevalent combination of gaze and proprioceptive input, while PE seemed to encode these signals more independently. Our results demonstrate that all these SPL areas combine gaze and proprioceptive input to provide an accurate monitoring of arm movements.</p>

                The Internet of Things (IoT) is leading the physical and digital world of technology to converge. Real-time and massive scale connections produce a large amount of versatile data, where Big Data comes into the picture. Big Data refers to large, diverse sets of information with dimensions that go beyond the capabilities of widely used database management systems, or standard data processing software tools to manage within a given limit. Almost every big dataset is dirty and may contain missing data, mistyping, inaccuracies, and many more issues that impact Big Data analytics performances. One of the biggest challenges in Big Data analytics is to discover and repair dirty data; failure to do this can lead to inaccurate analytics results and unpredictable conclusions. We experimented with different missing value imputation techniques and compared machine learning (ML) model performances with different imputation methods. We propose a hybrid model for missing value imputation combining ML and sample-based statistical techniques. Furthermore, we continued with the best missing value inputted dataset, chosen based on ML model performance for feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning. We used k-means clustering and principal component analysis. Accuracy, the evaluated outcome, improved dramatically and proved that the XGBoost model gives very high accuracy at around 0.125 root mean squared logarithmic error (RMSLE). To overcome overfitting, we used K-fold cross-validation.

                <p>by Nathan C. L. Kong, Eshed Margalit, Justin L. Gardner, Anthony M. Norcia</p>

Task-optimized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show striking similarities to the ventral visual stream. However, human-imperceptible image perturbations can cause a CNN to make incorrect predictions. Here we provide insight into this brittleness by investigating the representations of models that are either robust or not robust to image perturbations. Theory suggests that the robustness of a system to these perturbations could be related to the power law exponent of the eigenspectrum of its set of neural responses, where power law exponents closer to and larger than one would indicate a system that is less susceptible to input perturbations. We show that neural responses in mouse and macaque primary visual cortex (V1) obey the predictions of this theory, where their eigenspectra have power law exponents of at least one. We also find that the eigenspectra of model representations decay slowly relative to those observed in neurophysiology and that robust models have eigenspectra that decay slightly faster and have higher power law exponents than those of non-robust models. The slow decay of the eigenspectra suggests that substantial variance in the model responses is related to the encoding of fine stimulus features. We therefore investigated the spatial frequency tuning of artificial neurons and found that a large proportion of them preferred high spatial frequencies and that robust models had preferred spatial frequency distributions more aligned with the measured spatial frequency distribution of macaque V1 cells. Furthermore, robust models were quantitatively better models of V1 than non-robust models. Our results are consistent with other findings that there is a misalignment between human and machine perception. They also suggest that it may be useful to penalize slow-decaying eigenspectra or to bias models to extract features of lower spatial frequencies during task-optimization in order to improve robustness and V1 neural response predictivity.

Hydrogels are categorized based on their foundation: synthetic, natural, and combination. The objective of this study was to compare the properties and efficacy of commonly used hydrogels, like collagen, and other natural peptides with synthetic self-assembling peptide hydrogels in the treatment of SCI.  Methods: Articles were searched in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase. All studies from 1985 until January 2020 were included in the primary search. Eligible articles were included based on the following criteria: administering hydrogels (both natural and synthetic) for SCI treatment, solely focusing on spinal cord injury treatment, and published in a peer-reviewed journal. Data on axonal regeneration, revascularization, elasticity, drug delivery efficacy, and porosity were extracted. Results: A total of 24 articles were included for full-text review and data extraction. There was only one experimental study comparing collagen I (natural hydrogel) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) in an in vitro setting. The included study suggested the behavior of cells with PEG is more expectable in the injury site, which makes it a more reliable scaffold for neurites. Conclusions: There is limited research comparing and evaluating both types of natural and self-assembling peptides (SAPs) in the same animal or in vitro study, despite its importance. Although we assume that the remodeling of natural scaffolds may lead to a stable hydrogel, there was not a definitive conclusion that synthetic hydrogels are more beneficial than natural hydrogels in neuronal regeneration.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Incidence of and Risk Factors for Perioperative Cardiovascular Complications in Spine Surgery [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: An increasing number of patients are opting for spine surgery despite the associated risk of cardiovascular complications. The evidence regarding the incidence and risk factors of cardiovascular complications in spine surgery is insufficient. Therefore, we aimed to determine the incidence and risk factors for cardiovascular complications that occur perioperatively in spine surgery. Methods: This retrospective study included all patients who underwent spine surgery between January 2018 and December 2019 at a single center. Demographic, clinical, and operative data were collected from electronic medical records. The incidence of perioperative cardiac complications was determined. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify risk factors for the development of perioperative cardiovascular complications in the participants. Results: Of the 1,002 eligible patients enrolled in the study, six developed cardiac complications. Acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, and congestive heart failure occurred in one, two, and three patients, respectively. Risk factors for cardiovascular complications included scoliosis surgery (relative risk: RR, 18.61; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.346-257.35) and a history of congestive heart failure (RR, 120.97; 95% CI: 2.12-6898.80). Conclusion: The incidence of perioperative cardiovascular complications in patients who underwent spine surgery was 0.6%. High-risk patients should be closely monitored optimally managed throughout the perioperative period.

                Background: This study determined the levels of organochlorine (OCPs) and organophosphate (OPPs) pesticide residues in cow milk from Kiambu and camel milk from Isiolo and Laikipia. The human dietary intake and the potential consumer health risks were also evaluated. Methods: In total, 90 cow and 82 camel milk samples were collected and analyzed using gas chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy to determine the levels of OCPs and OPPs. The levels were compared to the maximum residue limits (MRLs) established by the Codex Alimentarius (CA), EU Pesticides Database (EUPD), and the United States Department of Agriculture. The estimated daily intake and chronic hazard quotient (cHQ) of the milk were also calculated. Results: Cow milk from Kiambu was contaminated with 11/18 of the evaluated OCPs and 13/14 of the evaluated OPPs while camel milk from Isiolo was contaminated with 9/18 of the evaluated OCPs and 9/14 of the evaluated OPPs. Camel milk from Laikipia was contaminated with 11/18 of the evaluated OCPs and 11/14 of the evaluated OPPs. The mean heptachlor value in camel milk from Isiolo was above the EUPD MRLs. The mean value of heptachlor in Camel milk from Laikipia was above the CA and EUPD MRLs. The cHQs for Disulfoton, Fenamiphos, and Methacrifos in Cow milk were above 1 for adults and children. The cHQs for Fenchlorphous and Profenofos in Camel milk were above 1 for adults and children. The cHQs for α-endosulphan, β-endosulphan, dieldrin, and heptachlor in cow milk was above 1 for adults and children while the cHQs for heptachlor in camel milk was above 1 for adults and children. Conclusions: The potential health risks from chronic dietary intake of cow and camel milk in Kenya cannot be excluded. The routine monitoring of organophosphate and organochlorine pesticide levels in milk is recommended to minimize risks to human health.

                Background: Lack of reproducibility in preclinical research poses ethical and economic challenges for biomedical science. Various institutional activities by society stakeholders of leading industrialised nations are currently underway with the aim of improving the situation. Such initiatives are usually concerned with high-level organisational issues and typically do not focus on improving experimental approaches per se. Addressing these is necessary in order to increase consistency and success rates of lab-to-lab repetitions. Methods: In this project, we statistically evaluated repetitive data of a very basic and widely applied lab procedure, namely quantifying the number of viable cells. The purpose of this was to assess the impact of different parameters and instrumentations which may constitute sources of variance in this procedure. Conclusion: By comparing the variability of data acquired under two different procedures, featuring improved stringency of protocol adherence, our project attempts to identify the sources and propose guidelines on how to reduce such fluctuations. We believe our work can contribute to tackling the repeatability crisis in biomedical research.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Proactive measures to eradicate Malaysia’s poverty in IR4.0 era: a shared prosperity vision [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In the country’s shared prosperity vision, Malaysia aspires to uplift the bottom 40% household income group (B40) by addressing wealth and income disparities. By 2030, the nation seeks to eradicate poverty through the provision of employment opportunities and career progression plans. A grey area between the nation’s aspirations and actions in practice can be observed because the goals have not been achieved despite numerous efforts aimed at the upliftment of the B40 group. The nation is still way behind its targeted outcomes despite various policies being implemented, which could be attributed to the mismatch between government policies and that of organisational practice. Thus, this study explores the rationale of strategic government intervention in managing B40 talent in the IR4.0 era. Methods: A general qualitative inquiry method that used 11 semi-structured interviews was carried out with representatives of Malaysia’s policy makers’, training providers, and trainees. All Interview questions centred around measures, importance and outcomes of B40 youth training from a multi-stakeholder perspective. Data were thematically analysed in five stages using NVivo. Results: Training, which includes IR4.0 era digital skills, is the key to uplifting the B40 youth to eradicate poverty. Proactive measures are imperative in the success of B40 youth training towards poverty eradication. Conclusions: This study contributes to the existing literature and helps practitioners by addressing the current gap in Malaysia’s aspirations versus organisational practice. Stakeholders should formulate proactive strategies to ensure that the right trainees are matched with the right training providers and government policies. A linkage between government policies and industry requirements needs to be established as opposed to the present discontinuity. A structured training needs analysis should be applied through a collaboration between industries and governments. Then, B40 individuals commonly found in lower-level positions can be pooled into the career pathway towards a shift into M40.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A novel method for measuring sublingual temperature using conventional non-contact forehead thermometer [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Sublingual temperature measurement is a quick and accurate representation of oral temperature and corresponds closely with core temperature. Sub-lingual temperature measurement using non-contact infrared thermometers has not been studied for this purpose and if accurate they would be a reliable and convenient way of recording temperature of a patient very quickly. The aim of the study was to evaluate the utility of recording sublingual temperature using an infrared non-contact thermometer and establish its accuracy by comparing the readings with tympanic thermometer recordings. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in 29 patients (328 paired recordings from sublingual and tympanic sites simultaneously). Subjects were requested to keep their mouth closed for five minutes before recording the temperature. Sublingual recordings were performed for each patient at different times of the day using an infrared thermometer. The infrared thermometer was quickly brought 1cm away from the sublingual part of the tongue and the recordings were then done immediately. Readings were compared with the corresponding tympanic temperature. Results: The non-contact sublingual temperature correlated very closely with tympanic temperature (r=0.86, p<0.001). The mean difference between the infrared sublingual and tympanic temperature was 0.21°C (standard deviation [SD]:0.48°C, 95% confidence interval [CI] of 0.16-0.27). The intra-class correlation co-efficient (ICC) between core and sublingual temperatures was 0.830 (95% CI: 0.794 to 0.861) p<0.001. The sensitivity of sublingual IR (infrared) temperature of 37.65°C was 90% and specificity was 89% for core temperature >38°C. Conclusions: This innovative modification of using the forehead infrared thermometer to measure the sublingual temperature offers an accurate, rapid and non-contact estimation of core temperature.

                With the ongoing cost decrease of genotyping and sequencing technologies, accurate and fast phenotyping remains the bottleneck in the utilizing of plant genetic resources for breeding and breeding research. Although cost-efficient high-throughput phenotyping platforms are emerging for specific traits and/or species, manual phenotyping is still widely used and is a time- and money-consuming step. Approaches that improve data recording, processing or handling are pivotal steps towards the efficient use of genetic resources and are demanded by the research community. Therefore, we developed PhenoApp, an open-source Android app for tablets and smartphones to facilitate the digital recording of phenotypical data in the field and in greenhouses. It is a versatile tool that offers the possibility to fully customize the descriptors/scales for any possible scenario, also in accordance with international information standards such as MIAPPE (Minimum Information About a Plant Phenotyping Experiment) and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles. Furthermore, PhenoApp enables the use of pre-integrated ready-to-use BBCH (Biologische Bundesanstalt für Land- und Forstwirtschaft, Bundessortenamt und CHemische Industrie) scales for apple, cereals, grapevine, maize, potato, rapeseed and rice. Additional BBCH scales can easily be added. The simple and adaptable structure of input and output files enables an easy data handling by either spreadsheet software or even the integration in the workflow of laboratory information management systems (LIMS). PhenoApp is therefore a decisive contribution to increase efficiency of digital data acquisition in genebank management but also contributes to breeding and breeding research by accelerating the labour intensive and time-consuming acquisition of phenotyping data.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structural basis for cytoplasmic dynein-1 regulation by Lis1</a></h4>

              
                The lissencephaly 1 gene, <i>LIS1</i>, is mutated in patients with the neurodevelopmental disease lissencephaly. The Lis1 protein is conserved from fungi to mammals and is a key regulator of cytoplasmic dynein-1, the major minus-end-directed microtubule motor in many eukaryotes. Lis1 is the only dynein regulator known to bind directly to dynein's motor domain, and by doing so alters dynein's mechanochemistry. Lis1 is required for the formation of fully active dynein complexes, which also contain essential cofactors: dynactin and an activating adaptor. Here, we report the first high-resolution structure of the yeast dynein–Lis1 complex. Our 3.1Å structure reveals, in molecular detail, the major contacts between dynein and Lis1 and between Lis1's ß-propellers. Structure-guided mutations in Lis1 and dynein show that these contacts are required for Lis1's ability to form fully active human dynein complexes and to regulate yeast dynein's mechanochemistry and in vivo function.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An intestinally secreted host factor promotes microsporidia invasion of C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Microsporidia are ubiquitous obligate intracellular pathogens of animals. These parasites often infect hosts through an oral route, but little is known about the function of host intestinal proteins that facilitate microsporidia invasion. To identify such factors necessary for infection by <i>Nematocida parisii</i>, a natural microsporidian pathogen of <i>Caenorhabditis</i> <i>elegans</i>, we performed a forward genetic screen to identify mutant animals that have a Fitness Advantage with <i>Nematocida</i> (Fawn). We isolated four <i>fawn</i> mutants that are resistant to <i>Nematocida</i> infection and contain mutations in <i>T14E8.4</i>, which we renamed <i>aaim-1 </i>(Antibacterial and Aids invasion by Microsporidia). Expression of AAIM-1 in the intestine of <i>aaim-1</i> animals restores <i>N. parisii</i> infectivity and this rescue of infectivity is dependent upon AAIM-1 secretion. <i>N. parisii </i>spores in <i>aaim-1</i> animals are improperly oriented in the intestinal lumen, leading to reduced levels of parasite invasion. Conversely, <i>aaim-1</i> mutants display both increased colonization and susceptibility to the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and overexpression of <i>AAIM-1</i> reduces <i>P. aeruginosa</i> colonization. Competitive fitness assays show that <i>aaim-1 </i>mutants are favoured in the presence of<i> N. parisii </i>but disadvantaged on<i> P. aeruginosa </i>compared to wild type animals<i>. </i>Together, this work demonstrates how microsporidia exploits a secreted protein to promote host invasion. Our results also suggest evolutionary trade-offs may exist to optimizing host defense against multiple classes of pathogens.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Context-dependent relationships between locus coeruleus firing patterns and coordinated neural activity in the anterior cingulate cortex</a></h4>

              
                Ascending neuromodulatory projections from the locus coeruleus (LC) affect cortical neural networks via the release of norepinephrine (NE). However, the exact nature of these neuromodulatory effects on neural activity patterns <i>in vivo</i> is not well understood. Here we show that in awake monkeys, LC activation is associated with changes in coordinated activity patterns in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). These relationships, which are largely independent of changes in firing rates of individual ACC neurons, depend on the type of LC activation: ACC pairwise correlations tend to be reduced when ongoing (baseline) LC activity increases but enhanced when external events evoke transient LC responses. Both relationships covary with pupil changes that reflect LC activation and arousal. These results suggest that modulations of information processing that reflect changes in coordinated activity patterns in cortical networks can result partly from ongoing, context-dependent, arousal-related changes in activation of the LC-NE system.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Stress conditions promote Leishmania hybridization in vitro marked by expression of the ancestral gamete fusogen HAP2 as revealed by single-cell RNAseq</a></h4>

              
                <i>Leishmania</i> are protozoan parasites transmitted by the bite of sand fly vectors producing a wide spectrum of diseases in their mammalian hosts. These diverse clinical outcomes are directly associated with parasite strain and species diversity. Although <i>Leishmania</i> reproduction is mainly clonal, a cryptic sexual cycle capable of producing hybrid genotypes has been inferred from population genetic studies, and directly demonstrated by laboratory crosses. Experimentally, mating competence has been largely confined to promastigotes developing in the sand fly midgut. The ability to hybridize culture promastigotes <i>in vitro</i> has been limited so far to low efficiency crosses between two <i>L. tropica</i> strains, L747 and MA37, that mate with high efficiency in flies. Here, we show that exposure of promastigote cultures to DNA damage stress produces a remarkably enhanced efficiency of <i>in vitro</i> hybridization of the <i>L. tropica</i> strains, and extends to other species, including <i>L. donovani, L. infantum,</i> and <i>L. braziliensis</i>, a capacity to generate intra- and interspecific hybrids. Whole genome sequencing and total DNA content analyses indicate that the hybrids are in each case full genome, mostly tetraploid hybrids. Single-cell RNA sequencing of the L747 and MA37 parental lines highlights the transcriptome heterogeneity of culture promastigotes and reveals discrete clusters that emerge post-irradiation in which genes potentially involved in genetic exchange are expressed, including the ancestral gamete fusogen <i>HAP2</i>. By generating reporter constructs for HAP2, we could select for promastigotes that could either hybridize or not <i>in vitro</i>. Overall, this work reveals that there are specific populations involved in <i>Leishmania</i> hybridization associated with a discernible transcriptomic signature, and that stress facilitated <i>in vitro</i> hybridization can be a transformative approach to generate large numbers of hybrid genotypes between diverse species and strains.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">PRC1 sustains the integrity of neural fate in the absence of PRC2 function</a></h4>

              
                Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) 1 and 2 maintain stable cellular memories of early fate decisions by establishing heritable patterns of gene repression. PRCs repress transcription through histone modifications and chromatin compaction, but their roles in neuronal subtype diversification are poorly defined. We found that PRC1 is essential for the specification of segmentally-restricted spinal motor neuron (MN) subtypes, while PRC2 activity is dispensable to maintain MN positional identities during terminal differentiation. Mutation of the core PRC1 component <i>Ring1</i> in mice leads to increased chromatin accessibility and ectopic expression of a broad variety of fates determinants, including <i>Hox</i> transcription factors, while neuronal class-specific features are maintained. Loss of MN subtype identities in <i>Ring1</i> mutants is due to the suppression of Hox-dependent specification programs by derepressed<i> Hox13</i> paralogs (<i>Hoxa13</i>, <i>Hoxb13</i>, <i>Hoxc13</i>, <i>Hoxd13</i>). These results indicate that PRC1 can function in the absence of <i>de novo</i> PRC2-dependent histone methylation to maintain chromatin topology and postmitotic neuronal fate.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Characterization of ultrapotent chemogenetic ligands for research applications in non-human primates</a></h4>

              
                Chemogenetics is a technique for obtaining selective pharmacological control over a cell population by expressing an engineered receptor that is selectively activated by an exogenously administered ligand. A promising approach for neuronal modulation involves the use of Pharmacologically Selective Actuator Modules (PSAMs); these chemogenetic receptors are selectively activated by ultrapotent Pharmacologically Selective Effector Molecules (uPSEMs). To extend the use of PSAM/PSEMs to studies in nonhuman primates it is necessary to thoroughly characterize the efficacy and safety of these tools. We describe the time course and brain penetrance in rhesus monkeys of two compounds with promising binding specificity and efficacy profiles in in vitro studies, uPSEM792 and uPSEM817, after systemic administration. Rhesus macaques received subcutaneous (s.c.) or intravenous (i.v.) administration of uPSEM817(0.064 mg/kg) or uPSEM792 (0.87 mg/kg) and plasma and CSF samples were collected over the course of 48 hours. Both compounds exhibited good brain penetrance, relatively slow washout and negligible conversion to potential metabolites - varenicline or hydroxyvarenicline. In addition, we found that neither of these uPSEMs significantly altered heart rate or sleep. Our results indicate that both compounds are suitable candidates for neuroscience studies using PSAMs in nonhuman primates.

                Identifying causative gene(s) within disease-associated large genomic regions of copy number variants (CNVs) is challenging. Here, by targeted sequencing of genes within schizophrenia (SZ)-associated CNVs in 1,779 SZ cases and 1,418 controls, we identified three rare putative loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in OTU deubiquitinase 7A (OTUD7A) within the 15q13.3 deletion in cases, but none in controls. To tie OTUD7A LoF with any SZ-relevant cellular phenotypes, we modeled the OTUD7A LoF mutation, rs757148409, in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived induced excitatory neurons (iNs) by CRISPR/Cas9 engineering. The mutant iNs showed a ~50% decrease in OTUD7A expression without undergoing nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The mutant iNs also exhibited marked reduction of dendritic complexity, density of synaptic proteins GluA1 and PSD-95, and neuronal network activity. Congruent with the neuronal phenotypes in mutant iNs, our transcriptomic analysis showed that the set of OTUD7A LoF-downregulated genes was enriched for those relating to synapse development and function, and was associated with SZ and other neuropsychiatric disorders. These results suggest that OTUD7A LoF impairs synapse development and neuronal function in human neurons, providing mechanistic insight into the possible role of OTUD7A in driving neuropsychiatric phenotypes associated with the 15q13.3 deletion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Impact of adolescent intermittent ethanol exposure on interneurons and their surrounding perineuronal nets in adulthood.</a></h4>

              
                Background: Binge alcohol exposure during adolescence results in long-lasting alterations in brain and behavior. For example, adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure in rodents results in long-term loss of functional connectivity among prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatal regions as well as a variety of neurochemical, molecular, and epigenetic alterations. Interneurons in the PFC and striatum play critical roles in behavioral flexibility and functional connectivity. For example, parvalbumin (PV) interneurons are known to contribute to neural synchrony, and cholinergic interneurons contribute to strategy selection. Furthermore, extracellular perineuronal nets (PNNs) surround some interneurons, particularly PV+ interneurons, to further regulate cellular plasticity. The effect of AIE exposure on expression of these markers within the PFC is not well understood. Methods: The present study tested the hypothesis that AIE exposure reduces expression of PV+ and ChAT+ interneurons in the adult PFC and striatum and increases related expression of PNNs (marked by binding of Wisteria Floribunda agglutinin lectin; WFA) in adulthood. Male rats were exposed to AIE (5 g/kg/day, 2-days-on/2-days-off, i.g., P25-P54) or water (CON), and brain tissue was harvested in adulthood (> P80). Immunohistochemistry and co-immunofluorescence were used to assess expression of ChAT, PV, and WFA labeling within the adult PFC and striatum following AIE exposure. Results: ChAT and PV interneuron numbers in the striatum and PFC were unchanged after AIE exposure. However, WFA labeling in the PFC of AIE-exposed rats was increased compared to CON rats. Moreover, significantly more PV neurons were surrounded by WFA labeling in AIE-exposed subjects relative to controls in both PFC subregions assessed: the orbitofrontal cortex (CON = 34%; AIE = 40%) and the medial PFC (CON = 10%; AIE = 14%). Conclusions: These findings indicate that while PV interneuron expression in the adult PFC and striatum is unaltered following AIE exposure, PNNs surrounding these neurons (indicated by extracellular WFA binding) are increased. This increase in PNNs may restrict plasticity of the ensheathed neurons, thus contributing to impaired microcircuitry in frontostriatal connectivity and related behavioral impairments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Relapse-like behavior and nAChR sensitization following intermittent access nicotine self-administration</a></h4>

              
                Many tobacco smokers consume nicotine intermittently, but the underlying mechanisms and neurobiological changes associated with intermittent nicotine intake are unclear. Understanding intermittent nicotine intake is a high priority, as it could promote therapeutic strategies to attenuate tobacco consumption. We examined nicotine intake behavior and neurobiological changes in male rats that were trained to self-administer nicotine during brief (5 min) trials interspersed with longer (15 min) drug-free periods. Rats readily adapted to intermittent access (IntA) SA following acquisition on a continuous access (ContA) schedule. Probabilistic analysis of IntA nicotine SA suggested reduced nicotine loading behavior compared to ContA, and nicotine pharmacokinetic modeling revealed that rats taking nicotine intermittently may have increased intake to maintain blood levels of nicotine that are comparable to ContA SA. After IntA nicotine SA, rats exhibited an increase in unreinforced responses for nicotine-associated cues (incubation of craving) and specific alterations in the striatal proteome after 7 days without nicotine. IntA nicotine SA also induced nAChR functional upregulation in the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN), and it enhanced nicotine binding in the brain as determined via [11C]nicotine positron emission tomography. Reducing the saliency of the cue conditions during the 5 min access periods attenuated nicotine intake, but incubation of craving was preserved. Together, these results indicate that IntA conditions promote nicotine SA and nicotine seeking after a nicotine-free period.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sustained upregulation of widespread hippocampal-neocortical coupling following memory encoding</a></h4>

              
                Systems consolidation of new experiences into lasting episodic memories involves interactions between hippocampus and the neocortex. Evidence of this process is seen already during early awake post-encoding rest periods. Functional MRI (fMRI) studies have demonstrated increased hippocampal coupling with task-relevant perceptual regions and reactivation of stimulus-specific encoding patterns following intensive encoding tasks. Here we investigate the spatial and temporal characteristics of these hippocampally anchored post-encoding neocortical modulations. Eighty-nine adults participated in an experiment consisting of interleaved memory task- and resting-state periods. As expected, we observed increased post-encoding functional connectivity between hippocampus and individually localized neocortical regions responsive to stimulus categories encountered during memory encoding. Post-encoding modulations were however not restricted to stimulus-selective cortex, but manifested as a nearly system-wide upregulation in hippocampal coupling with all major functional networks. The spatial configuration of these extensive modulations resembled hippocampal-neocortical interaction patterns estimated from active encoding operations, suggesting hippocampal post-encoding involvement by far exceeds reactivation of perceptual aspects. This reinstatement of encoding patterns during immediate post-encoding rest was not observed in resting-state scans collected 12 hours later, nor in control analyses estimating post-encoding neocortical modulations in functional connectivity using other candidate seed regions. The broad similarity in hippocampal functional coupling between online memory encoding and offline post-encoding rest suggests reactivation in humans may involve a spectrum of cognitive processes engaged during experience of an event.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Busy and confused? High risk of missed alerts in the cockpit: an electrophysiological study</a></h4>

              
                Of evolutionary importance, the ability to react to unexpected auditory stimuli remains critical today, especially in settings such as aircraft cockpits or air traffic control towers, characterized by high mental and auditory loads. Evidences show that both factors can negatively impact auditory attention and prevent appropriate reactions in hazardous situations. In the present study, sixty participants performed a simulated aviation task, varying in terms of mental load (no, low, high mental load), that was embedded with a concurrent tone detection paradigm, in which auditory load was manipulated by the number of different tones (1, 2 or 3). We measured both detection performance (miss, false alarm) and brain activity (event-related potentials) related to the target tone. Our results showed that both mental and auditory loads affected tone detection performance. Importantly, their combined effects had a massive impact on the percentage of missed target tones. While, in the no mental load condition, miss rate was very low with 1 (0.53%) and 2 tones (1.11%), it increased drastically with 3 tones (24.44%), and this effect was accentuated as mental load increased, yielding to the higher miss rate in the 3-tone paradigm under high mental load conditions (68.64%). Increased mental load, auditory load, and miss rate, were all associated with disrupted brain response to the target tone as showed by reductions of the P3b amplitude. In sum, our results highlight the importance of balancing mental and auditory loads to maintain or improve efficient reactions to alarms in complex environment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Common neural functions during children's naturalistic and controlled laboratory mathematics learning</a></h4>

              
                A major goal of human neuroscience is to understand how the brain functions in the real world, and to measure neural processes under conditions that are ecologically valid. A critical step toward this goal is understanding how brain activity during naturalistic tasks that mimic the real world, relates to brain activity in more traditional laboratory tasks. In the present study, we used intersubject correlations to locate reliable stimulus-driven cerebral processes among children and adults in a naturalistic video lesson and a laboratory forced-choice task that shared the same arithmetic concept. We show that relative to a control condition with grammatical content, naturalistic and laboratory arithmetic tasks evoked overlapping activation within brain regions previously associated with math semantics. The regions of specific functional overlap between the naturalistic mathematics lesson and laboratory mathematics task included bilateral intraparietal cortex, which confirms that this region processes mathematical content independently of differences in task mode. These findings suggest that regions of the intraparietal cortex process mathematical content when children are learning about mathematics in the real world.

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults is understudied, especially regarding neural mechanisms such as oscillatory control of attention sampling. We report an electroencephalography (EEG) study of such cortical mechanisms, in ADHD-diagnosed adults during administration of Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA), a gold-standard continuous performance test for ADHD that measures the ability to sustain attention and inhibit impulsivity. We recorded 53 adults (28 female, 25 male, aged 18&ndash;60), and 18 matched healthy controls, using 128-channel EEG. We analyzed sensor-space features established as neural correlates of attention: timing-sensitivity and phase-synchrony of response activations, and event-related (de)synchronization (ERS/D) of &alpha; and  frequency band activity; in frontal and parietal scalp regions. TOVA test performance significantly distinguished ADHD adults from neurotypical controls, in commission errors, response time variability (RTV) and d' (response sensitivity). The ADHD group showed significantly weaker target-locked and response-locked amplitudes, that were strongly right-lateralized at the N2 wave, and weaker phase synchrony (longer reset poststimulus). They also manifested significantly less parietal prestimulus 8-Hz  ERS, less frontal and parietal poststimulus 4-Hz  ERS, and more frontal and parietal prestimulus &alpha; ERS during correct trials. These differences may reflect excessive modulation of endogenous activity by strong entrainment to stimulus (&alpha;), combined with deficient modulation by neural entrainment to task (), which in TOVA involves monitoring stimulus spatial location (not predicted occurrence onset which is regular and task-irrelevant). Building on the hypotheses of  coding for relational structure and rhythmic attention sampling, our results suggest that ADHD adults have impaired attention sampling in relational categorization tasks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Sex Differences in BNST and Amygdala Activation by Contextual, Cued, and Unpredictable Threats</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Fear and anxiety can be described as emotional and physical responses to predictable and unpredictable threats. While the amygdala is necessary for context and cued fear conditioning, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is important for anxiety-like behavior and conditioned responses to diffuse and/or unpredictable threats. However, we still lack knowledge about how the BNST and amygdala nuclei act in coordination. Moreover, the incidence of anxiety disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is substantially higher in women than in men, but most studies of fear conditioning are conducted in male rodents. Here, we asked whether the BNST and the lateral, basal, and central nuclei of the amygdala are active during the expression of fear conditioning in male and female rats using FOS immunohistochemistry. We first show that the BNST is indeed involved in context fear expression in males, but not in females. The lateral amygdala was active in both sexes during context fear expression. We next trained animals using tone cues paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US), or tone cues which were unpaired with the US, and thus nonpredictive. Females displayed greater fear expression to these unpaired tones than males. FOS was upregulated in both the BNST and the basal amygdala during fear expression to unpaired tones in both sexes. The differential processing of fear responses by males and females highlights the need to acknowledge sex differences in conditioned fear memory.</p>

                Background: In 2019, the Namibian Ministry of Health introduced HIV self-testing (HIVST) as an additional strategy to increase uptake of HIV self-testing in traditionally hard-to-reach subpopulations, such as young adults and males. It is unclear how the utilisation of HIV self-testing iw optimised in young adults. The study objective is understanding knowledge, attitudes, and perception levels amongst college-going young adults in Namibia. Methods: This quantitative study utilised a sample of 97 young college students who received a pre-test structured questionnaire. One sample t-test was used to analyse the average score from the Likert scale. A cut-off p-value of 0.05 to determine statistical significance of variables was used. Logistic regression computation was used to identify independent variables significantly associated with the dependent variable. A univariate analysis was done on awareness and acceptability with statistical significance of p<0.05 to obtain preliminary insights into the association between independent and dependent variables. The net effect variables are assessed using multivariate analysis using STATA 13.1, taking into account confounding factors. Results: Out of the 97 participants, only 23.7% knew about HIV self-testing. The logistic regression had a significant association with awareness of HIV self-testing (p≤0.05): on condom use during a first sexual encounter; being with a single sexual partner in the last 12 months; not having a sexually transmitted infection. The univariate analysis revealed an association with the acceptability of HIV self-testing from females; those who live in urban settlements; having not had sexually transmitted infection in the last twelve months. Moreover, findings reveal there are low levels of awareness, yet participants had positive attitudes and levels of acceptability to HIV self-testing. Conclusion: This study shows promise if awareness through health education and promotion about HIV self-testing can be increased. This can form part of scaling up HIV testing in Namibia.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Contextual features in the developing hippocampus: A representational similarity analysis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Functional divisions of labor in support of memory have been reported along the anterior–posterior axis of the hippocampus. However, little is known about how the developing hippocampus represents associative memories along this axis. The present research employed representational similarity analysis to ask whether developmental differences exist in the extent to which the anterior versus the posterior hippocampus represent features of the context and associative memories. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected during the retrieval phase of an associative recognition task from 8-year-olds, 10-year-olds, and adults (<i>N</i> = 58). Participants were asked to retrieve pairs of items, which were presented either in the same location as during encoding or in a flipped location. In the anterior hippocampus and only for adults, pattern similarity between the two studied pair conditions was greater than pattern similarity between studied pairs presented in the same location and novel pairs. In contrast, this difference was not significant in the posterior hippocampus. Older, but not younger, children showed a similar, albeit attenuated, similarity pattern to that of adults, but measures of patterns similarity predicted associative recognition across ages. In addition, exploratory analyses showed that similarity patterns in the adult posterior, but not anterior, hippocampus tracked the order of the runs. Overall, the results suggest functional and developmental dissociations in processing different contextual features, with the anterior hippocampus responding to salient and rapid-changing features and the posterior hippocampus responding to slower-changing features of the context.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Assessment of risk perception and risk communication regarding COVID-19 among healthcare providers: An explanatory sequential mixed-method study in Bangladesh [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Any public health emergency demands adequate risk communication with the vulnerable population along with their optimized perception about the impending risk to ensure proper risk management and crisis control. Hence, we conducted this study to explore healthcare providers’ perceptions regarding risks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), as well as how they are being communicated to about the risk, and how they practice risk reduction measures. Methods: We conducted a two-phased explanatory sequential mixed-method study among physicians and nurses from randomly selected tertiary healthcare facilities in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. In the first phase, we assessed the general pattern and quantifiable measures of risk perception, risk communication, and infection prevention practices quantitatively. We performed multiple linear regression analyses to explore how much variability of risk perception was predicted by risk communication methods and contents. In the second phase, we collected qualitative data for in-depth understanding and exploration of participants’ experiences and insights regarding COVID-19 risk through interviews and document reviews. We manually performed thematic content analysis of the qualitative data. Finally, we triangulated findings from both phases to illustrate the research objectives. Discussion: Based on the psychometric dimensions of risk perception and psycho-social theory of the health belief model, perceptions of COVID-19 risk among healthcare providers were evaluated in this study. The relationship between risk perception and infection prevention and control practices among healthcare providers were also investigated. The explanatory sequential design of this study is expected to generate hypotheses on how risk perception is being shaped in a time of uncertainty and, thus, will help to build a proper risk communication strategy for the healthcare providers

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The characteristics of early-stage research into human genes are substantially different from subsequent research</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Thomas Stoeger, Luís A. Nunes Amaral</p>

Throughout the last 2 decades, several scholars observed that present day research into human genes rarely turns toward genes that had not already been extensively investigated in the past. Guided by hypotheses derived from studies of science and innovation, we present here a literature-wide data-driven meta-analysis to identify the specific scientific and organizational contexts that coincided with early-stage research into human genes throughout the past half century. We demonstrate that early-stage research into human genes differs in team size, citation impact, funding mechanisms, and publication outlet, but that generalized insights derived from studies of science and innovation only partially apply to early-stage research into human genes. Further, we demonstrate that, presently, genome biology accounts for most of the initial early-stage research, while subsequent early-stage research can engage other life sciences fields. We therefore anticipate that the specificity of our findings will enable scientists and policymakers to better promote early-stage research into human genes and increase overall innovation within the life sciences.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Fos regulates macrophage infiltration against surrounding tissue resistance by a cortical actin-based mechanism in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vera Belyaeva, Stephanie Wachner, Attila Gyoergy, Shamsi Emtenani, Igor Gridchyn, Maria Akhmanova, Markus Linder, Marko Roblek, Maria Sibilia, Daria Siekhaus</p>

The infiltration of immune cells into tissues underlies the establishment of tissue-resident macrophages and responses to infections and tumors. Yet the mechanisms immune cells utilize to negotiate tissue barriers in living organisms are not well understood, and a role for cortical actin has not been examined. Here, we find that the tissue invasion of <i>Drosophila</i> macrophages, also known as plasmatocytes or hemocytes, utilizes enhanced cortical F-actin levels stimulated by the <i>Drosophila</i> member of the fos proto oncogene transcription factor family (Dfos, Kayak). RNA sequencing analysis and live imaging show that Dfos enhances F-actin levels around the entire macrophage surface by increasing mRNA levels of the membrane spanning molecular scaffold tetraspanin TM4SF, and the actin cross-linking filamin Cheerio, which are themselves required for invasion. Both the filamin and the tetraspanin enhance the cortical activity of Rho1 and the formin Diaphanous and thus the assembly of cortical actin, which is a critical function since expressing a dominant active form of Diaphanous can rescue the <i>Dfos</i> macrophage invasion defect. In vivo imaging shows that Dfos enhances the efficiency of the initial phases of macrophage tissue entry. Genetic evidence argues that this Dfos-induced program in macrophages counteracts the constraint produced by the tension of surrounding tissues and buffers the properties of the macrophage nucleus from affecting tissue entry. We thus identify strengthening the cortical actin cytoskeleton through Dfos as a key process allowing efficient forward movement of an immune cell into surrounding tissues.

Among the risk factors associated with the severity of this disease is the presence of several metabolic disorders. For this reason, the aim of this research was to identify the comorbidities and laboratory parameters among COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), comparing the patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) with those who did not require IMV, in order to determine the clinical characteristics associated with the COVID-19 severity. Methods. We carried out a cross-sectional study among 152 patients who were admitted to the ICU from April 1st to July 31st, 2021, in whom the comorbidities and laboratory parameters associated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection severity were identified. The data of these patients was grouped into two main groups: “patients who required IMV” and “patients who did not require IMV”. The nonparametric Mann–Whitney U test for continuous data and the χ2 test for categorical data were used to compare the variables between both groups. Results. Of the 152 COVID-19 patients who were admitted to the ICU, 66 required IMV and 86 did not require IMV. Regarding the comorbidities found in these patients, a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension and obesity was observed among patients who required IMV vs. those who did not require IMV (p<0.05). Concerning laboratory parameters, only glucose, Interleukin 6 (IL-6), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly higher among patients who required IMV than in those who did not require IMV (p<0.05). Conclusion. This study performed in a Mexican population indicates that comorbidities such as: T2DM, hypertension and obesity, as well as elevated levels of glucose, IL-6, LDH and CRP are associated with the COVID-19 severity.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Male genital injuries treated at a tertiary hospital in the western region of Nepal: A two-year snapshot. [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Male genital injuries are urological emergencies which if not promptly treated with correct therapeutic intervention may lead to loss of fertility due to infections and anatomical disruption of normalcy. This study highlights the clinical scenarios, etiology and outcome of male genital injury cases that were managed at a tertiary care center in Nepal. Such injuries are not frequently encountered as patients are hesitant to report such injuries. The present study is the first from Nepal which depicts a comprehensive report on male genital injuries.   Methods: A retrospective analysis of discharge summaries of the cases of male genital injuries was reviewed during June 2020. All the treated cases during the two-year period from April 2018 to April 2020 at Lumbini Medical College, Nepal were included in the study.  Results: There were eight cases of genital trauma admitted and treated during the study period. All the patients were males and age ranged from six to 71 years with a mean age of 33 ± 21.45 years. Fall injury and road traffic accidents (RTA) were observed to be the primary cause in the majority of cases.  Conclusion: Superficial injuries to the penis and scrotum do not require surgical exploration and could be managed conservatively. However, deeper and complicated injuries, testicular preservation, the functionality of the part and cosmetic issues are taken into consideration which might require a multi-disciplinary approach. Apart from the medical issues pertaining to genital injuries, there are legal and psychological aspects of such events too which should not be ignored.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prediction of the Effects of Nonsynonymous Variants on SARS-CoV-2 Proteins [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: SARS-CoV-2 virus is a highly transmissible pathogen that causes COVID-19. The outbreak originated in Wuhan, China in December 2019. A number of nonsynonymous mutations located at different SARS-CoV-2 proteins have been reported by multiple studies. However, there are limited computational studies on the biological impacts of these mutations on the structure and function of the proteins.   Methods: In our study nonsynonymous mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and their frequencies were identified from 30,229 sequences. Subsequently, the effects of the top 10 nonsynonymous mutations of different SARS-CoV-2 proteins were analyzed using bioinformatics tools including co-mutation analysis, prediction of the protein structure stability and flexibility analysis, and prediction of the protein functions.   Results: A total of 231 nonsynonymous mutations were identified from 30,229 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. The top 10 nonsynonymous mutations affecting nine amino acid residues were ORF1a nsp5 P108S, ORF1b nsp12 P323L and A423V, S protein N501Y and D614G, ORF3a Q57H, N protein P151L, R203K and G204R. Many nonsynonymous mutations showed a high concurrence ratio, suggesting these mutations may evolve together and interact functionally. Our result showed that ORF1a nsp5 P108S, ORF3a Q57H and N protein P151L mutations may be deleterious to the function of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. In addition, ORF1a nsp5 P108S and S protein D614G may destabilize the protein structures while S protein D614G may have a more open conformation compared to the wild type.   Conclusion: The biological consequences of these nonsynonymous mutations of SARS-CoV-2 proteins should be further validated by in vivo and in vitro experimental studies in the future.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Synaptic mechanisms of top-down control in the non-lemniscal inferior colliculus</a></h4>

              
                Corticofugal projections to evolutionarily ancient, subcortical structures are ubiquitous across mammalian sensory systems. These ‘descending’ pathways enable the neocortex to control ascending sensory representations in a predictive or feedback manner, but the underlying cellular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we combine optogenetic approaches with in vivo and in vitro patch-clamp electrophysiology to study the projection from mouse auditory cortex to the inferior colliculus (IC), a major descending auditory pathway that controls IC neuron feature selectivity, plasticity, and auditory perceptual learning. Although individual auditory cortico-collicular synapses were generally weak, IC neurons often integrated inputs from multiple corticofugal axons that generated reliable, tonic depolarizations even during prolonged presynaptic activity. Latency measurements in vivo showed that descending signals reach the IC within 30 ms of sound onset, which in IC neurons corresponded to the peak of synaptic depolarizations evoked by short sounds. Activating ascending and descending pathways at latencies expected in vivo caused a NMDA receptor-dependent, supralinear excitatory postsynaptic potential summation, indicating that descending signals can nonlinearly amplify IC neurons’ moment-to-moment acoustic responses. Our results shed light upon the synaptic bases of descending sensory control and imply that heterosynaptic cooperativity contributes to the auditory cortico-collicular pathway’s role in plasticity and perceptual learning.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Unique structure and positive selection promote the rapid divergence of Drosophila Y chromosomes</a></h4>

              
                Y chromosomes across diverse species convergently evolve a gene-poor, heterochromatic organization enriched for duplicated genes, LTR retrotransposons, and satellite DNA. Sexual antagonism and a loss of recombination play major roles in the degeneration of young Y chromosomes. However, the processes shaping the evolution of mature, already degenerated Y chromosomes are less well-understood. Because Y chromosomes evolve rapidly, comparisons between closely related species are particularly useful. We generated de novo long read assemblies complemented with cytological validation to reveal Y chromosome organization in three closely related species of the <i>Drosophila simulans </i>complex, which diverged only 250,000 years ago and share &gt;98% sequence identity. We find these Y chromosomes are divergent in their organization and repetitive DNA composition and discover new Y-linked gene families whose evolution is driven by both positive selection and gene conversion. These Y chromosomes are also enriched for large deletions, suggesting that the repair of double-strand breaks on Y chromosomes may be biased toward microhomology-mediated end joining over canonical non-homologous end-joining. We propose that this repair mechanism contributes to the convergent evolution of Y chromosome organization across organisms.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Regulation of immune receptor kinase plasma membrane nanoscale organization by a plant peptide hormone and its receptors</a></h4>

              
                Spatial partitioning is a propensity of biological systems orchestrating cell activities in space and time. The dynamic regulation of plasma membrane nano-environments has recently emerged as a key fundamental aspect of plant signaling, but the molecular components governing it are still mostly unclear. The receptor kinase FERONIA (FER) controls ligand-induced complex formation of the immune receptor kinase FLAGELLIN SENSING 2 (FLS2) with its co-receptor BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1-ASSOCIATED KINASE 1 (BAK1), and perception of the endogenous peptide hormone RAPID ALKALANIZATION FACTOR 23 (RALF23) by FER inhibits immunity. Here, we show that FER regulates the plasma membrane nanoscale organization of FLS2 and BAK1. Our study demonstrates that akin to FER, leucine-rich repeat (LRR) extensin proteins (LRXs) contribute to RALF23 responsiveness, regulate BAK1 nanoscale organization and immune signaling. Furthermore, RALF23 perception leads to rapid modulation of FLS2 and BAK1 nanoscale organization, and its inhibitory activity on immune signaling relies on FER kinase activity. Our results suggest that perception of RALF peptides by FER and LRXs actively modulates plasma membrane nanoscale organization to regulate cell surface signaling by other ligand-binding receptor kinases.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Plant trans-golgi network/early endosome pH regulation requires cation chloride cotransporter (CCC1)</a></h4>

              
                Plant cells maintain a low luminal pH in the Trans-Golgi-Network/Early Endosome (TGN/EE), the organelle in which the secretory and endocytic pathways intersect. Impaired TGN/EE pH regulation translates into severe plant growth defects. The identity of the proton pump and proton/ion antiporters that regulate TGN/EE pH have been determined, but an essential component required to complete the TGN/EE membrane transport circuit remains unidentified - a pathway for cation and anion efflux. Here, we have used complementation, genetically encoded fluorescent sensors, and pharmacological treatments to demonstrate that Arabidopsis Cation Chloride Cotransporter (CCC1) is this missing component necessary for regulating TGN/EE pH and function. Loss of CCC1 function leads to alterations in TGN/EE-mediated processes including endocytic trafficking, exocytosis and response to abiotic stress, consistent with the multitude of phenotypic defects observed in <i>ccc1</i> knockout plants. This discovery places CCC1 as a central component of plant cellular function.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Tracking cell lineages in 3D by incremental deep learning</a></h4>

              
                Deep learning is emerging as a powerful approach for bioimage analysis. Its use in cell tracking is limited by the scarcity of annotated data for the training of deep-learning models. Moreover, annotation, training, prediction, and proofreading currently lack a unified user interface. We present ELEPHANT, an interactive platform for 3D cell tracking that addresses these challenges by taking an incremental approach to deep learning. ELEPHANT provides an interface that seamlessly integrates cell track annotation, deep learning, prediction, and proofreading. This enables users to implement cycles of incremental learning starting from a few annotated nuclei. Successive prediction-validation cycles enrich the training data, leading to rapid improvements in tracking performance. We test the software’s performance against state-of-the-art methods and track lineages spanning the entire course of leg regeneration in a crustacean over 1 week (504 timepoints). ELEPHANT yields accurate, fully-validated cell lineages with a modest investment in time and effort.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Increasing stimulus similarity drives nonmonotonic representational change in hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Studies of hippocampal learning have obtained seemingly contradictory results, with manipulations that increase coactivation of memories sometimes leading to differentiation of these memories, but sometimes not. These results could potentially be reconciled using the nonmonotonic plasticity hypothesis, which posits that representational change (memories moving apart or together) is a U-shaped function of the coactivation of these memories during learning. Testing this hypothesis requires manipulating coactivation over a wide enough range to reveal the full U-shape. To accomplish this, we used a novel neural network image synthesis procedure to create pairs of stimuli that varied parametrically in their similarity in high-level visual regions that provide input to the hippocampus. Sequences of these pairs were shown to human participants during high-resolution fMRI. As predicted, learning changed the representations of paired images in the dentate gyrus as a U-shaped function of image similarity, with neural differentiation occurring only for moderately similar images.

                Implant-associated <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> infections are difficult to treat because of biofilm formation. Bacteria in a biofilm are often insensitive to antibiotics and host immunity. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) could provide an alternative approach to improve the diagnosis and potential treatment of biofilm-related infections. Here, we show that mAbs targeting common surface components of <i>S. aureus</i> can recognize clinically relevant biofilm types. The mAbs were also shown to bind a collection of clinical isolates derived from different biofilm-associated infections (endocarditis, prosthetic joint, catheter). We identify two groups of antibodies: one group that uniquely binds <i>S. aureus</i> in biofilm state and one that recognizes <i>S. aureus</i> in both biofilm and planktonic state. Furthermore, we show that a mAb recognizing wall teichoic acid (clone 4497) specifically localizes to a subcutaneously implanted pre-colonized catheter in mice. In conclusion, we demonstrate the capacity of several human mAbs to detect <i>S. aureus</i> biofilms in vitro and in vivo.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Concurrent fMRI demonstrates propagation of TMS effects across task-related networks</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has become an important technique in both scientific and clinical practices, and yet our understanding of how the brain responds to TMS is still limited. Concurrent neuroimaging during TMS may bridge this gap, and emerging evidence suggests widespread that modulatory effects of TMS may be best captured through changes in functional connectivity between distributed networks, rather than local changes in cortical activity. However, the relationship between TMS stimulation parameters and evoked changes in functional connectivity is unknown. In this study, 24 healthy volunteers received concurrent TMS-fMRI while performing a dot-motion direction discrimination task. An MR-compatible coil was used to apply trains of three pulses at 10 Hz rTMS over the primary visual cortex (V1) at the onset of the dot stimuli with four levels of stimulation intensity (20%, 40%, 80%, and 120% of resting motor threshold, RMT). Behavioral results demonstrated impairment of motion discrimination at 80% RMT. FMRI results yielded three findings. First, functional connectivity between visual and non-visual areas increased as a function of rTMS intensity. Second, connectivity within the visual network was positively associated with motion accuracy, while the connectivity between visual and non-visual regions was negatively associated with motion accuracy. Lastly, we found that reductions in the similarity between functional and structural connectivity associated with increasing TMS intensity were constrained to the visual network. These findings demonstrate spatially dependent nonlinear effects of TMS intensity on brain functional connectivity that proceed beyond the site of stimulation and influence associated behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Exploring Functional Brain Network Modularity in Educational Contexts</a></h4>

              
                The brains modular functional organization facilitates adaptability. Modularity has been linked with a wide range of cognitive abilities such as intelligence, memory, and learning. However, much of this work has (1) considered modularity while a participant is at rest rather than during tasks conditions and/or (2) relied primarily on lab-based cognitive assessments. Thus, the extent to which modularity can provide information about real-word behavior remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated whether functional modularity during resting-state and task-based fMRI was associated with academic learning (measured by GPA) and ability (measured by PSAT) in a large sample of high school students. Additional questions concerned the extent to which modularity differs between rest and task conditions, and across spatial scales. Results indicated that whole-brain modularity during task conditions was significantly associated with academic learning. In contrast to prior work, no such associations were observed for resting-state modularity. We further showed that differences in modularity between task conditions and resting-state varied across spatial scales. Taken together, the present findings inform how functional brain network modularity - during task conditions and while at rest - relate to a range of cognitive abilities.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ramp-shaped neural tuning supports graded population-level representation of the object-to-scene continuum</a></h4>

              
                We can easily perceive the spatial scale depicted in a picture, regardless of whether it is a small space (e.g., a close-up view of a chair) or a much larger space (e.g., an entire class room). How does the human visual system encode this continuous dimension? Here, we investigated the underlying neural coding of depicted spatial scale, by examining the voxel tuning and topographic organization of brain responses. We created naturalistic yet carefully-controlled stimuli by constructing virtual indoor environments, and rendered a series of snapshots to smoothly sample between a close-up view of the central object and far-scale view of the full environment (object-to-scene continuum). Human brain responses were measured to each position using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We did not find evidence for a smooth topographic mapping for the object-to-scene continuum on the cortex. Instead, we observed large swaths of cortex with opposing ramp-shaped profiles, with highest responses to one end of the object-to-scene continuum or the other, and a small region showing a weak tuning to intermediate scale views. Importantly, when we considered the multi-voxel patterns of the entire ventral occipito-temporal cortex, we found smooth and linear representation of the object-to-scene continuum. Thus, our results together suggest that depicted spatial scale is coded parametrically in large-scale population codes across the entire ventral occipito-temporal cortex.

                Goal-directed behaviour is dependent upon the ability to detect errors and implement appropriate post-error adjustments. Accordingly, several studies have explored the neural activity underlying error-monitoring processes, identifying the insula cortex as crucial for error awareness and reporting mixed findings with respect to the anterior cingulate cortex. Variable patterns of activation have previously been attributed to insufficient statistical power. We therefore sought to clarify the neural correlates of error awareness in a large event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study. Four hundred and two healthy participants undertook the Error Awareness Task, a motor Go/No-Go response inhibition paradigm in which participants were required to indicate their awareness of commission errors. Compared to unaware errors, aware errors were accompanied by significantly greater activity in a network of regions including the insula cortex, supramarginal gyrus, and midline structures such as the anterior cingulate cortex and supplementary motor area. Error awareness activity was related to indices of task performance and dimensional measures of psychopathology in select regions including the insula, supramarginal gyrus and supplementary motor area. Taken together, we identified a robust and reliable neural network associated with error awareness.

                Imaging technologies are increasingly used to generate high-resolution reference maps of brain structure and function. Modern scientific discovery relies on making comparisons between new maps (e.g. task activations, group structural differences) and these reference maps. Although recent data sharing initiatives have increased the accessibility of such brain maps, data are often shared in disparate coordinate systems (or "spaces"), precluding systematic and accurate comparisons among them. Here we introduce the neuromaps toolbox, an open-access software package for accessing, transforming, and analyzing structural and functional brain annotations. We implement two registration frameworks to generate high-quality transformations between four standard coordinate systems commonly used in neuroimaging research. The initial release of the toolbox features >40 curated reference maps and biological ontologies of the human brain, including maps of gene expression, neurotransmitter receptors, metabolism, neurophysiological oscillations, developmental and evolutionary expansion, functional hierarchy, individual functional variability, and cognitive specialization. Robust quantitative assessment of map-to-map similarity is enabled via a suite of spatial autocorrelation-preserving null models. By combining open-access data with transparent functionality for standardizing and comparing brain maps, the neuromaps software package provides a systematic workflow for comprehensive structural and functional annotation enrichment analysis of the human brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Individual coactivation patterns improve the subject identification and their behavior association</a></h4>

              
                Brain states can be characterized by recurring coactivation patterns (CAPs). Traditional CAP analysis is performed at the group-level, while the human brain is individualized and the functional connectome has shown the uniqueness as fingerprints. Whether stable individual CAPs could be obtained from a single fMRI scan and could individual CAPs improve the identification is unclear. An open dataset, the midnight scan club was used in this study to answer these questions. Four CAP states were identified at three distinct levels (group-, subject- and scan-level) separately, and the CAPs were then reconstructed for each scan. Identification rate and differential identifiability were used to evaluate the subject identification performance. Our results demonstrated that the individual CAPs were unstable when using a single scan. By maintaining high intra-subject similarity and inter-subject differences, subject-level CAPs achieved the best identification performance. Particularly, brain regions that contributed to the identifiability were mainly located in higher-order networks (e.g., frontal-parietal network). Besides, head motion reduced the intra-subject similarity, while its impact on identification rate was non-significant. Finally, a pipeline was developed to depict brain-behavior associations in datasets with few samples and dense sampling, and individualized CAP dynamics showed an above-chance level correlation with IQ.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural correlate of reduced respiratory chemosensitivity during chronic epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                While central autonomic cardiorespiratory dysfunction underlies sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), the specific neural mechanisms that lead to SUDEP remain to be determined. Here we took an advantage of single cell neuronal Ca2+ imaging and intrahippocampal kainic acid (KA)-induced chronic epilepsy in mice to investigate progressive changes in key cardiorespiratory brainstem circuits during chronic epilepsy. Following induction of status epilepticus (SE), we observed that the adaptive ventilatory responses to hypercapnia were reduced in mice with chronic epilepsy for 5 weeks post-SE. These changes were paralleled by reduced chemosensitivity of neurons in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), an important centre for respiratory chemosensitivity. Over the same period, chemosensory responses of the presympathetic RVLM neurons showed a slower decrease. Mice with chronic epilepsy were more sensitive to chemoconvulsants and exhibited a greatly reduced latency to seizure induction compared to naive mice. This enhanced sensitivity to seizures, which invade the RTN, puts the chemosensory circuits at further risk and increases the chances of terminal apnoea. Our findings establish a dysfunctional breathing phenotype with its RTN neuronal correlate in mice with chronic epilepsy and suggests a functional non-invasive biomarker test, based on respiratory chemosensitivity, to identify people with epilepsy at risk of SUDEP.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Concomitant AD and DLB pathologies shape subfield microglia responses in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal alteration is at the centre of memory decline in the most common age-related neurodegenerative diseases: Alzheimers disease (AD) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). However, the subregional deterioration of the hippocampus differs between both diseases with more severe atrophy in the CA1 subfield of the AD patients. How AD and DLB-typical pathologies compose the various local microenvironment of the hippocampus across AD and DLB needs to be further explored to understand this process. Additionally, microglia responses could further impact the atrophy rate. Some studies suggest that microglia react differently according to the underlying neurodegenerative disorder. How microglia are transformed across hippocampal subfields in AD and DLB, and how their changes are associated with disease-typical pathologies remains to be determined. To these purposes, we performed a volumetric analysis of phospho-Tau (P-Tau), Amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}), and phospho--Synuclein (P-Syn) loads, quantified and classified microglia according to distinct morphological phenotypes using high-resolution confocal 3D microscopy of hippocampal CA1, CA3 and DG/CA4 subfields of late-onset AD (n=10) and DLB (n=8) as well as age-matched control samples (n=11).

We found that each of the Tau, A{beta} and Synuclein pathologies followed a specific subregional distribution, relatively preserved across AD and DLB. P-Tau, A{beta} and P-Syn burdens were significantly exacerbated in AD, with Tau pathology being particularly severe in the AD CA1. P-Tau and P-Syn burdens were highly correlated across subfields and conditions (R2Spear = 0.79; P < 0.001) and result from a local co-distribution of P-Tau and P-Syn inclusions in neighbouring neurons, with only a low proportion of double-positive cells.

In parallel, we assessed the changes of the microglia responses by measuring 16 morphological features of more than 35,000 individual microglial cells and classifying them into seven-distinct morphological clusters. We found microglia features- and clusters-variations subfield- and condition-dependent. Two of the seven morphological clusters, with more amoeboid and less branched forms, were identified as disease-enriched and found to be further increased in AD. Interestingly, some microglial features or clusters were associated with one but more often with a combination of two pathologies in a subfield-dependent manner.

In conclusion, our study shows a multimodal association of the hippocampal microglia responses with the co-occurrence, distribution and severity of AD and DLB pathologies. In DLB hippocampi, pathological imprint and microglia responses follow AD trends but with lesser severity. Our study suggests that the increased pathological burdens of P-Tau and P-Syn and associated microglia alterations are involved in a more severe deterioration of the CA1 in AD as compared to DLB.

                A rich repertoire of oscillatory signals is detected from human brains with electro- and magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG). However, the principles underwriting coherent oscillations and their link with neural activity remain unclear. Here, we hypothesise that the emergence of transient brain rhythms is a signature of weakly stable synchronization between spatially distributed brain areas, occurring at network-specific collective frequencies due to non-negligible conduction times. We test this hypothesis using a phenomenological network model to simulate interactions between neural mass potentials (resonating at 40Hz) in the structural connectome. Crucially, we identify a critical regime where metastable oscillatory modes emerge spontaneously in the delta (0.5-4Hz), theta (4-8Hz), alpha (8-13Hz) and beta (13-30Hz) frequency bands from weak synchronization of subsystems, closely approximating the MEG power spectra from 89 healthy individuals. Grounded in the physics of delay-coupled oscillators, these numerical analyses demonstrate the role of the spatiotemporal connectome in structuring brain activity in the frequency domain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An emergent temporal basis set robustly supports cerebellar time-series learning</a></h4>

              
                Learning plays a key role in the function of many neural circuits. The cerebellum is considered a  learning machine essential for time interval estimation underlying motor coordination and other behaviors. Theoretical work has proposed that the cerebellums input recipient structure, the granule cell layer (GCL), performs pattern separation of inputs that facilitates learning in Purkinje cells (P-cells). However, the relationship between input reformatting and learning outcomes has remained debated, with roles emphasized for pattern separation features from sparsification to decorrelation. We took a novel approach by training a minimalist model of the cerebellar cortex to learn complex time-series data from naturalistic inputs, in contrast to traditional classification tasks. The model robustly produced temporal basis sets from naturalistic inputs, and the resultant GCL output supported learning of temporally complex target functions. Learning favored surprisingly dense granule cell activity, yet the key statistical features in GCL population activity that drove learning differed from those seen previously for classification tasks. Moreover, different cerebellar tasks were supported by diverse pattern separation features that matched the demands of the tasks. These findings advance testable hypotheses for mechanisms of temporal basis set formation and predict that population statistics of granule cell activity may differ across cerebellar regions to support distinct behaviors.

                The majority of fMRI studies investigating somatotopic body representations in the human cortex have used either block or phase-encoding stimulation designs. Event-related (ER) designs allow for more natural and flexible stimulation sequences, while enabling the independent estimation of responses to different body parts in the same cortical location. Here we compared an efficiency-optimized fast ER design (2s inter stimulus interval, ISI) to a slow ER design (8s ISI) for mapping fingertip voxelwise tuning properties in the sensorimotor cortex of 6 participants at 7 Tesla. The fast ER design resulted in similar, but more robust, estimates compared to the slow ER design. Concatenating the fast and slow ER data, we demonstrate in each individual brain the existence of two separate somatotopically-organized representations of the fingertips, one in S1 on the post-central gyrus and the other at the border of the motor and pre-motor cortices on the pre-central gyrus. In both post-central and pre-central representations, fingertip tuning width increases progressively, from narrowly-tuned Brodmann areas 3b and 4a respectively, towards parietal and frontal regions responding equally to all fingertips.

                Classical models of efficient coding in neurons assume simple mean responses-- tuning curves--such as bellshaped or monotonic functions of a stimulus feature. Real neurons, however, can be more complex: grid cells, for example, exhibit periodic responses which impart the neural population code with high accuracy. But do highly accurate codes require fine tuning of the response properties? We address this question with the use of a benchmark model: a neural network with random synaptic weights which result in output cells with irregular tuning curves. Irregularity enhances the local resolution of the code but gives rise to catastrophic, global errors. For optimal smoothness of the tuning curves, when local and global errors balance out, the neural network compresses information from a high-dimensional representation to a low-dimensional one, and the resulting distributed code achieves exponential accuracy. An analysis of recordings from monkey motor cortex points to such  compressed efficient coding. Efficient codes do not require a finely tuned design--they emerge robustly from irregularity or randomness.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Resolution and b value dependent Structural Connectome in ex vivo Mouse Brain</a></h4>

              
                Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging has been widely used in both clinical and preclinical studies to characterize tissue microstructure and structural connectivity. The diffusion MRI protocol for the Human Connectome Project (HCP) has been developed and optimized to obtain high-quality, high-resolution diffusion MRI (dMRI) datasets. However, such efforts have not been fully explored in preclinical studies, especially for rodents. In this study, high quality dMRI datasets of mouse brains were acquired at 9.4T system from two vendors. In particular, we acquired a high-spatial resolution dMRI dataset (25 m isotropic with 126 diffusion encoding directions), which we believe to be the highest spatial resolution yet obtained; and a high-angular resolution dMRI dataset (50 m isotropic with 384 diffusion encoding directions), which we believe to be the highest angular resolution compared to the dMRI datasets at the microscopic resolution. We systematically investigated the effects of three important parameters that affect the final outcome of the connectome: b value (1000 s/mm2 to 8000 s/mm2), angular resolution (10 to 126), and spatial resolution (25 {micro}m to 200 {micro}m). The stability of tractography and connectome increase with the angular resolution, where more than 50 angles are necessary to achieve consistent results. The connectome and quantitative parameters derived from graph theory exhibit a linear relationship to the b value (R2 > 0.99); a single-shell acquisition with b value of 3000 s/mm2 shows comparable results to the multi-shell high angular resolution dataset. The dice coefficient decreases and both false positive rate and false negative rate gradually increase with coarser spatial resolution. Our study provides guidelines and foundations for exploration of tradeoffs among acquisition parameters for the structural connectome in ex vivo mouse brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Chronic Cognitive and Cerebrovascular Function Following Mild Traumatic Brain Injury in Rats</a></h4>

              
                Severe traumatic brain injury results in cognitive dysfunction in part due to vascular perturbations. In contrast, the long-term vasculo-cognitive pathophysiology of mild TBI (mTBI) remains unknown. We evaluated mTBI effects on chronic cognitive and cerebrovascular function and assessed their interrelationships. Sprague-Dawley rats received midline fluid percussion injury (N=20) or sham (N=21). Cognitive function was assessed (3- and 6-month novel object recognition (NOR), novel object location (NOL) and temporal order object recognition (TOR)). 6-month cerebral blood flow (CBF) and blood volume (CBV) using contrast MRI and ex vivo pial artery endothelial and smooth muscle-dependent function were measured. mTBI rats showed impaired NOR, with similar (non-significant) trends in NOL/TOR. Regional CBF and CBV were similar in sham and mTBI. NOR correlated with CBF in lateral hippocampus, medial hippocampus and primary somatosensory barrel cortex while inversely correlating with arterial smooth muscle-dependent dilation. 6-month baseline endothelial and smooth muscle-dependent arterial function were similar among mTBI and sham, but post-angiotensin II stimulation, mTBI showed no change in smooth muscle-dependent dilation from baseline response, unlike the reduction in sham. mTBI led to chronic cognitive dysfunction and altered angiotensin II-stimulated smooth muscle-dependent vasoreactivity, a paradigm that could advance understanding of the long-term sequelae of human mild TBI.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">scRNA-sequencing reveals subtype-specific transcriptomic perturbations in DRG neurons of Pirt-EGFPf mice in neuropathic pain condition</a></h4>

              
                Functionally distinct subtypes/clusters of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, which differ in soma size and neurochemical properties, may play different roles in nerve regeneration and pain. However, details about transcriptomic changes in different neuronal subtypes under maladaptive neuropathic pain conditions remain unclear. Chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve represents a well-established model of neuropathic pain that mimics the etiology of clinical conditions. Therefore, we conducted single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize subtype-specific perturbations of transcriptomes in lumbar DRG neurons 7 days after sciatic CCI. By using Pirt-EGFPf mice that selectively express enhanced green fluorescent protein in DRG neurons, we established a highly efficient purification process to enrich neurons for scRNA-seq. We observed a loss of marker genes in injured neurons of 12 standard neuronal clusters, and the emergence of four prominent CCI-induced clusters at this peak-maintenance phase of neuropathic pain. Importantly, a portion of injured neurons from a subset of the 12 standard clusters (NP1, PEP5, NF1, and NF2) were spared from injury-induced identity loss, suggesting subtype-specific transcriptomic changes in injured neurons. Moreover, uninjured neurons, which are necessary for mediating the evoked pain, also demonstrated subtype-specific transcriptomic perturbations in these clusters, but not others. Notably, male and female mice showed differential transcriptomic changes in multiple neuronal clusters after CCI, suggesting transcriptomic sexual dimorphism in primary sensory neurons after nerve injury. Collectively, these findings may contribute to the identification of new target genes and development of DRG neuron subtype-specific therapies for optimizing neuropathic pain treatment and nerve regeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A novel method for multi-scale recording of intracranial EEG through dynamic alteration of electrode surface area</a></h4>

              
                Intracranial EEG (iEEG) plays a critical role in the treatment of neurological diseases, such as epilepsy and Parkinsons disease, as well as the development of neural prostheses and brain computer interfaces. While electrode geometries vary widely across these applications, the impact of electrode size on iEEG features and morphology is not well understood. Some insight has been gained from computer simulation studies and experiments in which signals are recorded using electrodes of different sizes concurrently in different brain regions. Here, we introduce a novel method to record from electrodes of different sizes in the exact same location by changing the size of iEEG electrodes after implantation in the brain. We first present a theoretical model and an in vitro validation of the method. We then report the results of an in vivo implementation in three human subjects with refractory epilepsy. We recorded iEEG data from three different electrode sizes and compared the amplitudes, power spectra, inter-channel correlations, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of interictal epileptiform discharges, i.e., epileptic spikes. We found that iEEG amplitude and power decreased as electrode size increased, while inter-channel correlation increased with electrode size. The SNR of epileptic spikes was generally highest in the smallest electrodes, but 39% of spikes had maximal SNR in medium or large electrodes. This likely depends on the precise location and spatial spread of each spike. Overall, this new method enables multi-scale measurements of electrical activity in the human brain that facilitate our understanding of neurophysiology, treatment of neurological disease, and development of novel technologies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Resonant waves drive long-range correlations in fMRI signals</a></h4>

              
                The fundamental principles driving spontaneous long-range correlations between distant brain areas - known as intrinsic functional connectivity - remain unclear. To investigate this, we develop an ultrafast functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) approach with unprecedented temporal resolution (38 milliseconds) in the rat brain. We detect a repertoire of principal components exhibiting standing wave properties, i.e., with phase relationships varying gradually across space and oscillating in time, driving in- and anti-phase synchronization across distinct cortical and subcortical structures. The spatial configuration, stability and peak frequency of these standing waves is found to depend on the sedation/anaesthesia state, with medetomidine sedation revealing the most stable (i.e., less damped) standing waves, resonating at frequencies extending up to 0.25 Hz. Our findings show that the complex activity patterns observed in resting-state fMRI signals result from the superposition of standing waves, supporting the hypothesis that intrinsic functional connectivity is inherently associated to resonance phenomena.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuronal apoptosis drives remodeling states of microglia and shifts in survival pathway dependence</a></h4>

              
                Microglia serve critical remodeling roles that shape the developing nervous system, responding to the changing neural environment with phagocytosis or soluble factor secretion. Recent single-cell sequencing (scRNAseq) studies have revealed the context-dependent diversity in microglial properties and gene expression, but the cues promoting this diversity are not well defined. Here, we ask how interactions with apoptotic neurons shape microglial state, including lysosomal and lipid metabolism gene expression and independence from Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) for survival. Using early postnatal mouse retina, a CNS region undergoing significant developmental remodeling, we performed scRNAseq on microglia from mice that are wild-type, lack neuronal apoptosis (Bax KO), or are treated with CSF1R inhibitor (PLX3397). We find that interactions with apoptotic neurons drives multiple microglial remodeling states, subsets of which are resistant to CSF1R inhibition. We find that TAM receptor Mer and complement receptor 3 are required for clearance of apoptotic neurons, but that Mer does not drive expression of remodeling genes. We show TAM receptor Axl is negligible for phagocytosis or remodeling gene expression but is consequential for microglial survival in the absence of CSF1R signaling. Thus, interactions with apoptotic neurons shift microglia towards distinct remodeling states and through Axl, alters microglial dependence on survival pathway, CSF1R.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synaptic plasticity of inhibitory synapses onto medial olivocochlear efferent neurons</a></h4>

              
                The descending auditory system modulates the ascending system at every level. The final descending, or efferent stage, is comprised of lateral olivocochlear (LOC) and medial olivocochlear (MOC) neurons. MOC somata in the ventral brainstem project axons to the cochlea to synapse onto outer hair cells (OHC), inhibiting OHC-mediated cochlear amplification. MOC suppression of OHC function is implicated in cochlear gain control with changing sound intensity, detection of salient stimuli, attention, and protection against acoustic trauma. Thus, sound excites MOC neurons to provide negative feedback of the cochlea. Sound also inhibits MOC neurons via medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) neurons. However, MNTB-MOC synapses exhibit short-term depression, suggesting reduced MNTB-MOC inhibition during sustained stimuli. Further, due to high rates of both baseline and sound-evoked activity in MNTB neurons in vivo, MNTB-MOC synapses may be tonically depressed. To probe this, we characterized short-term plasticity of MNTB-MOC synapses in mouse brain slices. We mimicked in vivo-like temperature and extracellular calcium conditions, and in vivo-like activity patterns of fast synaptic activation rates, sustained activation, and prior tonic activity. Synaptic depression was sensitive to extracellular calcium concentration and temperature. During rapid MNTB axon stimulation, post-synaptic currents (PSCs) in MOC neurons summated but with concurrent depression, resulting in smaller, sustained currents, suggesting tonic inhibition of MOC neurons during rapid circuit activity. Low levels of baseline MNTB activity did not significantly reduce responses to subsequent rapid activity that mimics sound stimulation, indicating that, in vivo, MNTB inhibition of MOC neurons persists despite tonic synaptic depression.

Key points summaryO_LIInhibitory synapses from MNTB onto MOC neurons exhibit short-term plasticity that is sensitive to calcium and temperature, with enhanced synaptic depression occurring at higher calcium concentrations and at room temperature
C_LIO_LIHigh rates of background synaptic activity that mimic the upper limits of spontaneous MNTB activity cause tonic synaptic depression of MNTB-MOC synapses that limits further synaptic inhibition
C_LIO_LIHigh rates of activity at MNTB-MOC synapses cause synaptic summation concurrent depression to yield a response with an initial large amplitude that decays to a tonic inhibition

                Already before the onset of a saccadic eye movement, we preferentially process visual information at the upcoming eye fixation. This  presaccadic shift of attention is typically assessed via localized test items, which potentially bias the attention measurement. Here we show how presaccadic attention shapes perception from saccade origin to target when no scene-structuring items are presented. Participants made saccades into a 1/f ("pink") noise field, in which we embedded a brief orientation signal at various locations shortly before saccade onset. Local orientation discrimination performance served as a proxy for the allocation of attention. Results demonstrate that (1) saccades are preceded by shifts of attention to their goal location even if they are directed into an unstructured visual field, but the spread of attention, compared to target-directed saccades, is broad; (2) the presaccadic attention shift is accompanied by considerable attentional costs at the presaccadic eye fixation; (3) objects markedly shape the distribution of presaccadic attention - demonstrating the relevance of an item-free approach for measuring attentional dynamics across the visual field.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Serine 1283 in extracellular matrix glycoprotein Reelin is crucial for Reelin's function in brain development</a></h4>

              
                Deficiency in the extracellular matrix glycoprotein Reelin severely affects migration of neurons during development. The function of serine at position 1283 in Reelin has remained uncertain. To explore its relevance we generated rlnA/A mice that carry alanine instead of serine at position 1283, thereby disrupting the putative casein kinase 2 (CK2) phosphorylation site S1283DGD. Mutated mice displayed reeler-like locomotor behavior, abnormal brain anatomy and decrease of Reelin RNA and protein levels during development and in adulthood. Since serine 1283 was previously proposed to mediate proteolysis of adhesion molecules, we investigated proteolysis of cell adhesion molecule L1 and found it normal in rlnA/A mice. Neuronal migration in the embryonic rlnA/A cerebral cortex was impaired, but rescued by in utero electroporation of the Reelin fragment N-R6 containing the putative CK2 phosphorylation site. In rlnA/A mice migration of cerebellar granule cells in vitro was promoted by application of wild-type but not by mutated Reelin. In cerebellar neuron cultures, Reelin expression was decreased upon inhibition of ecto-phosphorylation by CK2. Biochemically purified wild-type, but not mutated Reelin was found phosphorylated. Altogether, the results indicate that ecto-phosphorylation at serine 1283 rather than proteolytic processing of adhesion molecules by Reelin plays an important role in Reelin functions.

                Originating from the brainstem raphe nuclei, serotonin is an important neuromodulator involved in a variety of physiological and pathological functions. Specific optogenetic stimulation of serotonergic neurons results in the divisive suppression of spontaneous, but not sensory evoked activity in the majority of neurons in the primary olfactory cortex and an increase in firing in a minority of neurons. To reveal the mechanisms involved in this dual serotonergic control of cortical activity we used a combination of in vitro electrophysiological recordings from identified neurons in the primary olfactory cortex, optogenetics and pharmacology and found that serotonin suppressed the activity of principal neurons, but excited local interneurons. The results have important implications in sensory information processing and other functions of the olfactory cortex and related brain areas.

                Electroencephalogram (EEG) based motor imagery (MI) classification is an important aspect in brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) which bridges between neural system and computer devices decoding brain signals into recognizable machine commands. However, the MI classification task is challenging due to inherent complex properties, inter-subject variability, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEG signals. To overcome the above-mentioned issues, the current work proposes an efficient multi-scale convolutional neural network (MS-CNN) which can extract the distinguishable features of several non-overlapping canonical frequency bands of EEG signals from multiple scales for MI-BCI classification. In the framework, discriminant user-specific features have been extracted and integrated to improve the accuracy and performance of the CNN classifier. Additionally, different data augmentation methods have been implemented to further improve the accuracy and robustness of the model. The model achieves an average classification accuracy of 93.74% and Cohen's kappa-coefficient of 0.92 on the BCI competition IV2b dataset outperforming several baseline and current state-of-the-art EEG-based MI classification models. The proposed algorithm effectively addresses the shortcoming of existing CNN-based EEG-MI classification models and significantly improves the classification accuracy. The current framework can provide a stimulus for designing efficient and robust real-time human-robot interaction.

                <p>Ankyrin scaffolding proteins are critical for membrane domain organization and protein stabilization in many different cell types including neurons. In the cerebellum, Ankyrin-R (AnkR) is highly enriched in Purkinje neurons, granule cells, and in the cerebellar nuclei (CN). Using male and female mice with a floxed allele for <I>Ank1</I> in combination with <I>Nestin-Cre</I> and <I>Pcp2-Cre</I> mice, we found that ablation of AnkR from Purkinje neurons caused ataxia, regional and progressive neurodegeneration, and altered cerebellar output. We show that AnkR interacts with the cytoskeletal protein &beta;3 spectrin and the potassium channel Kv3.3. Loss of AnkR reduced somatic membrane levels of &beta;3 spectrin and Kv3.3 in Purkinje neurons. Thus, AnkR links Kv3.3 channels to the &beta;3 spectrin-based cytoskeleton. Our results may help explain why mutations in &beta;3 spectrin and Kv3.3 both cause spinocerebellar ataxia.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Ankyrin scaffolding proteins localize and stabilize ion channels in the membrane by linking them to the spectrin-based cytoskeleton. Here, we show that Ankyrin-R (AnkR) links Kv3.3 K<sup>+</sup> channels to the &beta;3 spectrin-based cytoskeleton in Purkinje neurons. Loss of AnkR causes Purkinje neuron degeneration, altered cerebellar physiology, and ataxia, which is consistent with mutations in Kv3.3 and &beta;3 spectrin causing spinocerebellar ataxia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">MMP2 and MMP9 Activity Is Crucial for Adult Visual Cortex Plasticity in Healthy and Stroke-Affected Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>A fundamental regulator of neuronal network development and plasticity is the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the brain. The ECM provides a scaffold stabilizing synaptic circuits, while the proteolytic cleavage of its components and cell surface proteins are thought to have permissive roles in the regulation of plasticity. The enzymatic proteolysis is thought to be crucial for homeostasis between stability and reorganizational plasticity and facilitated largely by a family of proteinases named matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Here, we investigated whether MMP2 and MMP9 play a role in mediating adult primary visual cortex (V1) plasticity as well as stroke-induced impairments of visual cortex plasticity in mice. In healthy adult mice, selective inhibition of MMP2/9 for 7 d suppressed ocular dominance plasticity. In contrast, brief inhibition of MMP2/9 after a cortical stroke rescued compromised plasticity. Our data indicate that the proteolytic activity of MMP2 and MMP9 is critical and required to be within a narrow range to allow adult visual plasticity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Learning and recovery from injuries depend on the plasticity of neuronal connections. The brain's extracellular matrix (ECM) provides a scaffold for stabilizing synaptic circuits, while its enzymatic proteolysis is hypothesized to regulate homeostasis between stability and reorganizational plasticity. ECM digestion is facilitated by a family of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Here, we show that treatments that inhibit MMP2/9 can either inhibit or rescue cortical plasticity depending on cortical state: in the visual cortex of healthy adult mice, inhibition of MMP2/9 suppressed cortical plasticity. In contrast, brief inhibition of MMP2/9 after a stroke rescued compromised plasticity. Our data provide strong evidence that an optimal level of MMP2/9 proteolytic activity is crucial for adult visual plasticity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Economic Choices under Simultaneous or Sequential Offers Rely on the Same Neural Circuit</a></h4>

              
                <p>A series of studies in which monkeys chose between two juices offered in variable amounts identified in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) different groups of neurons encoding the value of individual options (offer value), the binary choice outcome (chosen juice), and the chosen value. These variables capture both the input and the output of the choice process, suggesting that the cell groups identified in OFC constitute the building blocks of a decision circuit. Several lines of evidence support this hypothesis. However, in previous experiments offers were presented simultaneously, raising the question of whether current notions generalize to when goods are presented or are examined in sequence. Recently, <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B2">Ballesta and Padoa-Schioppa (2019)</cross-ref> examined OFC activity under sequential offers. An analysis of neuronal responses across time windows revealed that a small number of cell groups encoded specific sequences of variables. These sequences appeared analogous to the variables identified under simultaneous offers, but the correspondence remained tentative. Thus, in the present study, we examined the relation between cell groups found under sequential versus simultaneous offers. We recorded from the OFC while monkeys chose between different juices. Trials with simultaneous and sequential offers were randomly interleaved in each session. We classified cells in each choice modality, and we examined the relation between the two classifications. We found a strong correspondence; in other words, the cell groups measured under simultaneous offers and under sequential offers were one and the same. This result indicates that economic choices under simultaneous or sequential offers rely on the same neural circuit.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Research in the past 20 years has shed light on the neuronal underpinnings of economic choices. A large number of results indicates that decisions between goods are formed in a neural circuit within the orbitofrontal cortex. In most previous studies, subjects chose between two goods offered simultaneously. Yet, in daily situations, goods available for choice are often presented or examined in sequence. Here we recorded neuronal activity in the primate orbitofrontal cortex alternating trials under simultaneous and under sequential offers. Our analyses demonstrate that the same neural circuit supports choices in the two modalities. Hence, current notions on the neuronal mechanisms underlying economic decisions generalize to choices under sequential offers.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Cortico-Cortical Pathway Targets Inhibitory Interneurons and Modulates Paw Movement during Locomotion in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>The primary somatosensory cortex (S1) is important for the control of movement as it encodes sensory input from the body periphery and external environment during ongoing movement. Mouse S1 consists of several distinct sensorimotor subnetworks that receive topographically organized corticocortical inputs from distant sensorimotor areas, including the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) and primary motor cortex (M1). The role of the vibrissal S1 area and associated cortical connections during active sensing is well documented, but whether (and if so, how) non-whisker S1 areas are involved in movement control remains relatively unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that unilateral silencing of the non-whisker S1 area in both male and female mice disrupts hind paw movement during locomotion on a rotarod and a runway. S2 and M1 provide major long-range inputs to this S1 area. Silencing S2-&gt;non-whisker S1 projections alters the hind paw orientation during locomotion, whereas manipulation of the M1 projection has little effect. Using patch-clamp recordings in brain slices from male and female mice, we show that S2 projection preferentially innervates inhibitory interneuron subtypes. We conclude that interneuron-mediated S2&ndash;S1 corticocortical interactions are critical for efficient locomotion.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Somatosensory cortex participates in controlling rhythmic movements, such as whisking and walking, but the neural circuitry underlying movement control by somatosensory cortex remains relatively unexplored. We uncover a corticocortical circuit in primary somatosensory cortex that regulates paw orientation during locomotion in mice. We identify neuronal elements that comprise these cortical pathways using pharmacology, behavioral assays, and circuit-mapping methods.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Mapping the Microstructure and Striae of the Human Olfactory Tract with Diffusion MRI</a></h4>

              
                <p>The human sense of smell plays an important role in appetite and food intake, detecting environmental threats, social interactions, and memory processing. However, little is known about the neural circuity supporting its function. The olfactory tracts project from the olfactory bulb along the base of the frontal cortex, branching into several striae to meet diverse cortical regions. Historically, using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to reconstruct the human olfactory tracts has been prevented by susceptibility and motion artifacts. Here, we used a dMRI method with readout segmentation of long variable echo-trains (RESOLVE) to minimize image distortions and characterize the human olfactory tracts <I>in vivo</I>. We collected high-resolution dMRI data from 25 healthy human participants (12 male and 13 female) and performed probabilistic tractography using constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD). At the individual subject level, we identified the lateral, medial, and intermediate striae with their respective cortical connections to the piriform cortex and amygdala (AMY), olfactory tubercle (OT), and anterior olfactory nucleus (AON). We combined individual results across subjects to create a normalized, probabilistic atlas of the olfactory tracts. We then investigated the relationship between olfactory perceptual scores and measures of white matter integrity, including mean diffusivity (MD). Importantly, we found that olfactory tract MD negatively correlated with odor discrimination performance. In summary, our results provide a detailed characterization of the connectivity of the human olfactory tracts and demonstrate an association between their structural integrity and olfactory perceptual function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study provides the first detailed <I>in vivo</I> description of the cortical connectivity of the three olfactory tract striae in the human brain, using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI). Additionally, we show that tract microstructure correlates with performance on an odor discrimination task, suggesting a link between the structural integrity of the olfactory tracts and odor perception. Lastly, we generated a normalized probabilistic atlas of the olfactory tracts that may be used in future research to study its integrity in health and disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Maturation of Temporal Saccade Prediction from Childhood to Adulthood: Predictive Saccades, Reduced Pupil Size, and Blink Synchronization</a></h4>

              
                <p>When presented with a periodic stimulus, humans spontaneously adjust their movements from reacting to predicting the timing of its arrival, but little is known about how this sensorimotor adaptation changes across development. To investigate this, we analyzed saccade behavior in 114 healthy humans (ages 6&ndash;24 years) performing the visual metronome task, who were instructed to move their eyes in time with a visual target that alternated between two known locations at a fixed rate, and we compared their behavior to performance in a random task, where target onsets were randomized across five interstimulus intervals (ISIs) and thus the timing of appearance was unknown. Saccades initiated before registration of the visual target, thus in anticipation of its appearance, were labeled predictive [saccade reaction time (SRT) &lt; 90 ms] and saccades that were made in reaction to its appearance were labeled reactive (SRT &gt; 90 ms). Eye-tracking behavior including saccadic metrics (e.g., peak velocity, amplitude), pupil size following saccade to target, and blink behavior all varied as a function of predicting or reacting to periodic targets. Compared with reactive saccades, predictive saccades had a lower peak velocity, a hypometric amplitude, smaller pupil size, and a reduced probability of blink occurrence before target appearance. The percentage of predictive and reactive saccades changed inversely from ages 8&ndash;16, at which they reached adult-levels of behavior. Differences in predictive saccades for fast and slow target rates are interpreted by differential maturation of cerebellar-thalamic-striatal pathways.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> From the first moments of life, humans are exposed to rhythm (i.e., mother's heartbeat <I>in utero</I>), but the timeline of brain development to promote the identification and anticipation of a rhythmic stimulus, known as temporal prediction, remains unknown. Here, we used saccade reaction time (SRT) in the visual metronome task to differentiate between temporally predictive and reactive responses to a target that alternated at a fixed rate in humans aged 6&ndash;24. Periods of age-related change varied little by target rate, with matured predictive performance evident by mid-adolescence for fast and slow rates. A strong correlation among saccade, pupil, and blink responses during target prediction provides evidence of oculomotor coordination and dampened noradrenergic neuronal activity when generating rhythmic motor responses.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Prediction of Learned Resistance or Helplessness by Hippocampal-Prefrontal Cortical Network Activity during Stress</a></h4>

              
                <p>The perception of control over a stressful experience may determine its impacts and generate resistance against future stressors. Although the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus (HPC) are implicated in the encoding of stressor controllability, the neural dynamics underlying this process are unknown. Here, we recorded HPC and PFC neural activities in male rats during the exposure to controllable, uncontrollable, or no shocks and investigated electrophysiological predictors of escape performance upon exposure to subsequent uncontrollable shocks. We were able to accurately discriminate stressed from nonstressed animals and predict resistant (R) or helpless (H) individuals based on hippocampal-cortical oscillatory dynamics. Remarkably, R animals exhibited an increase in theta power during CS, while H exhibited a decrease. Furthermore, R exhibited higher HPC to PFC  synchronization during stress. Notably, HPC-PFC  connectivity in the initial stress exposure showed strong correlations with escape performance evaluated days later. R rats also showed stronger  coupling to both  oscillations and neuronal firing in the PFC. Finally, we found that these distinct features of network dynamics collectively formed a pattern that accurately predicted learned resistance and was lacking in H individuals. Our findings suggest that hippocampal-prefrontal network  activity supports cognitive mechanisms of stress coping, whose impairment may underlie vulnerability to stress-related disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The appraisal of adversities as controllable or uncontrollable is key in determining resilience or risk for stress-related disorders. Here, we performed the first electrophysiological investigation during controllable or uncontrollable stress. Pharmacological studies showed that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus (HPC) encode stressor controllability, and here we identified the neural activity underlying this process. This "neural signature of stressor controllability" accurately predicted resistance to future stressors and was characterized by increased HPC-PFC oscillatory activity in the  frequency (4&ndash;10 Hz). Our findings suggest a new role of frontal  oscillations in adaptive stress coping, integrating its emotional and cognitive functions. We also endorse the potential of this biomarker to guide neurophysiologically-informed and rhythm-based stimulation therapies for depression.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Rapid Extraction of the Spatial Distribution of Physical Saliency and Semantic Informativeness from Natural Scenes in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Physically salient objects are thought to attract attention in natural scenes. However, research has shown that meaning maps, which capture the spatial distribution of semantically informative scene features, trump physical saliency in predicting the pattern of eye moments in natural scene viewing. Meaning maps even predict the fastest eye movements, suggesting that the brain extracts the spatial distribution of potentially meaningful scene regions very rapidly. To test this hypothesis, we applied representational similarity analysis to ERP data. The ERPs were obtained from human participants (<I>N</I> = 32, male and female) who viewed a series of 50 different natural scenes while performing a modified 1-back task. For each scene, we obtained a physical saliency map from a computational model and a meaning map from crowd-sourced ratings. We then used representational similarity analysis to assess the extent to which the representational geometry of physical saliency maps and meaning maps can predict the representational geometry of the neural response (the ERP scalp distribution) at each moment in time following scene onset. We found that a link between physical saliency and the ERPs emerged first (~78 ms after stimulus onset), with a link to semantic informativeness emerging soon afterward (~87 ms after stimulus onset). These findings are in line with previous evidence indicating that saliency is computed rapidly, while also indicating that information related to the spatial distribution of semantically informative scene elements is computed shortly thereafter, early enough to potentially exert an influence on eye movements.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Attention may be attracted by physically salient objects, such as flashing lights, but humans must also be able to direct their attention to meaningful parts of scenes. Understanding how we direct attention to meaningful scene regions will be important for developing treatments for disorders of attention and for designing roadways, cockpits, and computer user interfaces. Information about saliency appears to be extracted rapidly by the brain, but little is known about the mechanisms that determine the locations of meaningful information. To address this gap, we showed people photographs of real-world scenes and measured brain activity. We found that information related to the locations of meaningful scene elements was extracted rapidly, shortly after the emergence of saliency-related information.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neural Representations of Food-Related Attributes in the Human Orbitofrontal Cortex during Choice Deliberation in Anorexia Nervosa</a></h4>

              
                <p>Decisions about what to eat recruit the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and involve the evaluation of food-related attributes such as taste and health. These attributes are used differently by healthy individuals and patients with disordered eating behavior, but it is unclear whether these attributes are decodable from activity in the OFC in both groups and whether neural representations of these attributes are differentially related to decisions about food. We used fMRI combined with behavioral tasks to investigate the representation of taste and health attributes in the human OFC and the role of these representations in food choices in healthy women and women with anorexia nervosa (AN). We found that subjective ratings of tastiness and healthiness could be decoded from patterns of activity in the OFC in both groups. However, health-related patterns of activity in the OFC were more related to the magnitude of choice preferences among patients with AN than healthy individuals. These findings suggest that maladaptive decision-making in AN is associated with more consideration of health information represented by the OFC during deliberation about what to eat.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> An open question about the OFC is whether it supports the evaluation of food-related attributes during deliberation about what to eat. We found that healthiness and tastiness information was decodable from patterns of neural activity in the OFC in both patients with AN and healthy controls. Critically, neural representations of health were more strongly related to choices in patients with AN, suggesting that maladaptive overconsideration of healthiness during deliberation about what to eat is related to activity in the OFC. More broadly, these results show that activity in the human OFC is associated with the evaluation of relevant attributes during value-based decision-making. These findings may also guide future research into the development of treatments for AN.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Visual Motion and Decision-Making in Dyslexia: Reduced Accumulation of Sensory Evidence and Related Neural Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>Children with and without dyslexia differ in their behavioral responses to visual information, particularly when required to pool dynamic signals over space and time. Importantly, multiple processes contribute to behavioral responses. Here we investigated which processing stages are affected in children with dyslexia when performing visual motion processing tasks, by combining two methods that are sensitive to the dynamic processes leading to responses. We used a diffusion model which decomposes response time and accuracy into distinct cognitive constructs, and high-density EEG. Fifty children with dyslexia (24 male) and 50 typically developing children (28 male) 6-14 years of age judged the direction of motion as quickly and accurately as possible in two global motion tasks (motion coherence and direction integration), which varied in their requirements for noise exclusion. Following our preregistered analyses, we fitted hierarchical Bayesian diffusion models to the data, blinded to group membership. Unblinding revealed reduced evidence accumulation in children with dyslexia compared with typical children for both tasks. Additionally, we identified a response-locked EEG component which was maximal over centro-parietal electrodes which indicated a neural correlate of reduced drift rate in dyslexia in the motion coherence task, thereby linking brain and behavior. We suggest that children with dyslexia tend to be slower to extract sensory evidence from global motion displays, regardless of whether noise exclusion is required, thus furthering our understanding of atypical perceptual decision-making processes in dyslexia.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Reduced sensitivity to visual information has been reported in dyslexia, with a lively debate about whether these differences causally contribute to reading difficulties. In this large preregistered study with a blind modeling approach, we combine state-of-the art methods in both computational modeling and EEG analysis to pinpoint the stages of processing that are atypical in children with dyslexia in two visual motion tasks that vary in their requirement for noise exclusion. We find reduced evidence accumulation in children with dyslexia across both tasks, and identify a neural marker, allowing us to link brain and behavior. We show that children with dyslexia exhibit general difficulties with extracting sensory evidence from global motion displays, not just in tasks that require noise exclusion.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Representations of Chinese Characters: Evidence from Sublexical Components</a></h4>

              
                <p>Little research has been done about the neural substrate of the sublexical level of Chinese word recognition. In particular, it is unclear how radicals participate in Chinese word processing. We compared two measures of radical combinability, position-general radical combinability (GRC) and position-specific radical combinability (SRC) depending on whether the position of the radical is taken into account. We selected characters with embedded target radicals that had different GRC and SRC measures. These measures were used as predictors in a parametric modulation analysis and a multivariate representational similarity analysis. Human participants with native Mandarin speakers (17 males and 24 females) were asked to read words in search of animal words. Results showed that SRC is a better predictor than GRC in decoding the neural patterns. Whole-brain analysis indicated that SRC is encoded bilaterally in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG, pars opercularis, and pars triangularis), the middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and a region on the border of the superior parietal lobule and the inferior parietal lobule (SPL/IPL). Region-of-interest-based RSA confirmed the results of the whole-brain analysis. Furthermore, we observed a correlation of another sublexical variable, logographeme composition, with bilateral activity in SPL. Logographemes refer to the basic stroke combinations that form radicals and characters. Finally, we observed involvement of bilateral cerebellum activity in Chinese word recognition. Our findings confirm the importance of sublexical components (SRC and logographeme composition) in Chinese word recognition and also confirm that Chinese word recognition involves more bilateral processing than word recognition in alphabetical languages.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Chinese is a logographic language. However, characters contain informative subword components (radicals, logographemes, and strokes). We investigated whether the position of the radical is important. We presented carefully selected words and looked where brain activity correlated with subword information. Results indicate that position-dependent radicals predict brain encoding in a network of regions associated with Chinese word recognition, including higher order regions such as bilateral IFG, MFG, and SPL/IPL. Logographeme composition had an effect as well. Our findings provide strong evidence (1) for the importance of position-specific radical information and logographemes in Chinese word recognition, (2) that current brain imaging techniques are best suited to study these, and (3) that confirms the interactive nature of Chinese character recognition.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Presenilin/{gamma}-Secretase Activity Is Located in Acidic Compartments of Live Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Presenilin (PSEN)/-secretase is a protease complex responsible for the proteolytic processing of numerous substrates. These substrates include the amyloid precursor protein (APP), the cleavage of which by -secretase results in the production of &beta;-amyloid (A&beta;) peptides. However, exactly where within the neuron -secretase processes APP C99 to generate A&beta; and APP intracellular domain (AICD) is still not fully understood. Here, we employ novel Fo&#x0308;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based multiplexed imaging assays to directly "visualize" the subcellular compartment(s) in which -secretase primarily cleaves C99 in mouse cortex primary neurons (from both male and female embryos). Our results demonstrate that -secretase processes C99 mainly in LysoTracker-positive low-pH compartments. Using a new immunostaining protocol which distinguishes A&beta; from C99, we also show that intracellular A&beta; is significantly accumulated in the same subcellular loci. Furthermore, we found functional correlation between the endo-lysosomal pH and cellular -secretase activity. Taken together, our findings are consistent with A&beta; being produced from C99 by -secretase within acidic compartments such as lysosomes and late endosomes in living neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Alzheimer's disease (AD) genetics and histopathology highlight the importance of amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing by -secretase in pathogenesis. For the first time, this study has enabled us to directly "visualize" that -secretase processes C99 mainly in acidic compartments such as late endosomes and lysosomes in live neurons. Furthermore, we uncovered that intracellular &beta;-amyloid (A&beta;) is significantly accumulated in the same subcellular loci. Emerging evidence proposes the great importance of the endo-lysosomal pathway in mechanisms of misfolded proteins propagation (e.g., Tau, &alpha;-Syn). Therefore, the predominant processing of C99 and enrichment of A&beta; in late endosomes and lysosomes may be critical events in the molecular cascade leading to AD.</p>

                Purpose: To evaluate the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients with childhood glaucoma. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the data of patients with childhood glaucoma who visited the glaucoma clinics at the Queen Sirikit National Institute of Child Health and the King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital between January 2008 and January 2018. The diagnosis was based on the Childhood Glaucoma Research Network classification. We recorded their clinical characteristics and requirement of any glaucoma interventions. Results: A total of 691 eyes from 423 patients were included in this study. The patients predominantly comprised boys. The average follow-up duration was 71.3±63.8 months. The mean age at presentation was 3.9±4.4 years. Most patients presented with a high initial intraocular pressure (IOP). The average intial IOP of all patients was 28.5±11.2 mmHg. Glaucoma associated with non-acquired ocular anomalies (22.9%) was the most common subtype, followed by primary congenital glaucoma (20.8%). We recorded a family history of glaucoma in 6.4% of patients of the 234 patients with an available family history. Most patients had bilateral glaucoma (63.4%) and required at least one intervention (51.5%). The average IOP at the latest follow-up visit was 19.1±10.8 mmHg. All glaucoma types had significantly lower IOP, compared to that at their baselines (all p<0.001). Moreover, most patients had an unfavourable visual acuity (49.5%) at their latest visit. Conclusions: Secondary glaucoma associated with non-acquired ocular anomalies is the most common subtype of glaucoma. The majority of patients had unfavourable visual outcomes. These real-world findings are fundamental to acquire a better understanding of childhood glaucoma.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effects of physical activity and dietary supplement on fat free mass and bone mass density during weight loss – a systematic review and meta-analysis. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: After a diet- or surgery induced weight loss almost 1/3 of lost weight consists of fat free mass (FFM) if carried out without additional therapy. Exercise training and a sufficient supply of protein, calcium and vitamin D is recommended to reduce the loss of FFM. Objective: To investigate the effect of exercise training, protein, calcium, and vitamin D supplementation on the preservation of FFM during non-surgical and surgical weight loss and of the combination of all interventions together in adults with obesity. Methods: A systematic review was performed with a pairwise meta-analysis and an exploratory network meta-analysis according to the PRISMA statement. Results: Thirty studies were included in the quantitative analysis. The pairwise meta-analysis showed for Exercise Training + High Protein vs. High Protein a moderate and statistically significant effect size (SMD 0.45; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.86), for Exercise Training + High Protein vs. Exercise Training a high but statistically not significant effect size (SMD 0.91; 95% CI -0.59 to 2.41) and for Exercise Training alone vs. Control a moderate but statistically not significant effect size (SMD 0.67; 95% CI -0.25 to 1.60). In the exploratory network meta-analysis three interventions showed statistically significant effect sizes compared to Control and all of them included the treatment Exercise Training. Conclusions: Results underline the importance of exercise training and a sufficient protein intake to preserve FFM during weight loss in adults with obesity. The effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation remains controversial and further research are needed.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">OperonSEQer: A set of machine-learning algorithms with threshold voting for detection of operon pairs using short-read RNA-sequencing data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Raga Krishnakumar, Anne M. Ruffing</p>

Operon prediction in prokaryotes is critical not only for understanding the regulation of endogenous gene expression, but also for exogenous targeting of genes using newly developed tools such as CRISPR-based gene modulation. A number of methods have used transcriptomics data to predict operons, based on the premise that contiguous genes in an operon will be expressed at similar levels. While promising results have been observed using these methods, most of them do not address uncertainty caused by technical variability between experiments, which is especially relevant when the amount of data available is small. In addition, many existing methods do not provide the flexibility to determine the stringency with which genes should be evaluated for being in an operon pair. We present OperonSEQer, a set of machine learning algorithms that uses the statistic and p-value from a non-parametric analysis of variance test (Kruskal-Wallis) to determine the likelihood that two adjacent genes are expressed from the same RNA molecule. We implement a voting system to allow users to choose the stringency of operon calls depending on whether your priority is high recall or high specificity. In addition, we provide the code so that users can retrain the algorithm and re-establish hyperparameters based on any data they choose, allowing for this method to be expanded as additional data is generated. We show that our approach detects operon pairs that are missed by current methods by comparing our predictions to publicly available long-read sequencing data. OperonSEQer therefore improves on existing methods in terms of accuracy, flexibility, and adaptability.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Computational investigation of blood cell transport in retinal microaneurysms</a></h4>

              
                <p>by He Li, Yixiang Deng, Konstantina Sampani, Shengze Cai, Zhen Li, Jennifer K. Sun, George E. Karniadakis</p>

Microaneurysms (MAs) are one of the earliest clinically visible signs of diabetic retinopathy (DR). MA leakage or rupture may precipitate local pathology in the surrounding neural retina that impacts visual function. Thrombosis in MAs may affect their turnover time, an indicator associated with visual and anatomic outcomes in the diabetic eyes. In this work, we perform computational modeling of blood flow in microchannels containing various MAs to investigate the pathologies of MAs in DR. The particle-based model employed in this study can explicitly represent red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets as well as their interaction in the blood flow, a process that is very difficult to observe <i>in vivo</i>. Our simulations illustrate that while the main blood flow from the parent vessels can perfuse the entire lumen of MAs with small body-to-neck ratio (BNR), it can only perfuse part of the lumen in MAs with large BNR, particularly at a low hematocrit level, leading to possible hypoxic conditions inside MAs. We also quantify the impacts of the size of MAs, blood flow velocity, hematocrit and RBC stiffness and adhesion on the likelihood of platelets entering MAs as well as their residence time inside, two factors that are thought to be associated with thrombus formation in MAs. Our results show that enlarged MA size, increased blood velocity and hematocrit in the parent vessel of MAs as well as the RBC-RBC adhesion promote the migration of platelets into MAs and also prolong their residence time, thereby increasing the propensity of thrombosis within MAs. Overall, our work suggests that computational simulations using particle-based models can help to understand the microvascular pathology pertaining to MAs in DR and provide insights to stimulate and steer new experimental and computational studies in this area.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Modelling how cleaner fish approach an ephemeral reward task demonstrates a role for ecologically tuned chunking in the evolution of advanced cognition</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yosef Prat, Redouan Bshary, Arnon Lotem</p>

What makes cognition “advanced” is an open and not precisely defined question. One perspective involves increasing the complexity of associative learning, from conditioning to learning sequences of events (“chaining”) to representing various cue combinations as “chunks.” Here we develop a weighted graph model to study the mechanism enabling chunking ability and the conditions for its evolution and success, based on the ecology of the cleaner fish <i>Labroides dimidiatus</i>. In some environments, cleaners must learn to serve visitor clients before resident clients, because a visitor leaves if not attended while a resident waits for service. This challenge has been captured in various versions of the ephemeral reward task, which has been proven difficult for a range of cognitively capable species. We show that chaining is the minimal requirement for solving this task in its common simplified laboratory format that involves repeated simultaneous exposure to an ephemeral and permanent food source. Adding ephemeral–ephemeral and permanent–permanent combinations, as cleaners face in the wild, requires individuals to have chunking abilities to solve the task. Importantly, chunking parameters need to be calibrated to ecological conditions in order to produce adaptive decisions. Thus, it is the fine-tuning of this ability, which may be the major target of selection during the evolution of advanced associative learning.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Smell-induced gamma oscillations in human olfactory cortex are required for accurate perception of odor identity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Qiaohan Yang, Guangyu Zhou, Torben Noto, Jessica W. Templer, Stephan U. Schuele, Joshua M. Rosenow, Gregory Lane, Christina Zelano</p>

Studies of neuronal oscillations have contributed substantial insight into the mechanisms of visual, auditory, and somatosensory perception. However, progress in such research in the human olfactory system has lagged behind. As a result, the electrophysiological properties of the human olfactory system are poorly understood, and, in particular, whether stimulus-driven high-frequency oscillations play a role in odor processing is unknown. Here, we used direct intracranial recordings from human piriform cortex during an odor identification task to show that 3 key oscillatory rhythms are an integral part of the human olfactory cortical response to smell: Odor induces theta, beta, and gamma rhythms in human piriform cortex. We further show that these rhythms have distinct relationships with perceptual behavior. Odor-elicited gamma oscillations occur only during trials in which the odor is accurately perceived, and features of gamma oscillations predict odor identification accuracy, suggesting that they are critical for odor identity perception in humans. We also found that the amplitude of high-frequency oscillations is organized by the phase of low-frequency signals shortly following sniff onset, only when odor is present. Our findings reinforce previous work on theta oscillations, suggest that gamma oscillations in human piriform cortex are important for perception of odor identity, and constitute a robust identification of the characteristic electrophysiological response to smell in the human brain. Future work will determine whether the distinct oscillations we identified reflect distinct perceptual features of odor stimuli.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Comparative genomics reveals electron transfer and syntrophic mechanisms differentiating methanotrophic and methanogenic archaea</a></h4>

Speth, Hang Yu, Connor Morgan-Lang, Roland Hatzenpichler, Danielle Goudeau, Rex Malmstrom, William J. Brazelton, Tanja Woyke, Steven J. Hallam, Gene W. Tyson, Gunter Wegener, Antje Boetius, Victoria J. Orphan</p>

The anaerobic oxidation of methane coupled to sulfate reduction is a microbially mediated process requiring a syntrophic partnership between anaerobic methanotrophic (ANME) archaea and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). Based on genome taxonomy, ANME lineages are polyphyletic within the phylum <i>Halobacterota</i>, none of which have been isolated in pure culture. Here, we reconstruct 28 ANME genomes from environmental metagenomes and flow sorted syntrophic consortia. Together with a reanalysis of previously published datasets, these genomes enable a comparative analysis of all marine ANME clades. We review the genomic features that separate ANME from their methanogenic relatives and identify what differentiates ANME clades. Large multiheme cytochromes and bioenergetic complexes predicted to be involved in novel electron bifurcation reactions are well distributed and conserved in the ANME archaea, while significant variations in the anabolic C1 pathways exists between clades. Our analysis raises the possibility that methylotrophic methanogenesis may have evolved from a methanotrophic ancestor.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Evolutionary plasticity and functional versatility of CRISPR systems</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Eugene V. Koonin, Kira S. Makarova</p>

The principal biological function of bacterial and archaeal CRISPR systems is RNA-guided adaptive immunity against viruses and other mobile genetic elements (MGEs). These systems show remarkable evolutionary plasticity and functional versatility at multiple levels, including both the defense mechanisms that lead to direct, specific elimination of the target DNA or RNA and those that cause programmed cell death (PCD) or induction of dormancy. This flexibility is also evident in the recruitment of CRISPR systems for nondefense functions. Defective CRISPR systems or individual CRISPR components have been recruited by transposons for RNA-guided transposition, by plasmids for interplasmid competition, and by viruses for antidefense and interviral conflicts. Additionally, multiple highly derived CRISPR variants of yet unknown functions have been discovered. A major route of innovation in CRISPR evolution is the repurposing of diverged repeat variants encoded outside CRISPR arrays for various structural and regulatory functions. The evolutionary plasticity and functional versatility of CRISPR systems are striking manifestations of the ubiquitous interplay between defense and “normal” cellular functions.

                <p>by Peter Dayan</p>

Psychological and neural distinctions between the technical concepts of “liking” and “wanting” pose important problems for motivated choice for goods. Why could we “want” something that we do not “like,” or “like” something but be unwilling to exert effort to acquire it? Here, we suggest a framework for answering these questions through the medium of reinforcement learning. We consider “liking” to provide immediate, but preliminary and ultimately cancellable, information about the true, long-run worth of a good. Such initial estimates, viewed through the lens of what is known as potential-based shaping, help solve the temporally complex learning problems faced by animals.

                Classic late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN2 disease) is caused by a deficiency of tripeptidyl-peptidase-1. In 2017, the first CLN2 enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) cerliponase alfa (Brineura) was approved by the FDA and EMA. The CLN2 disease clinical rating scale (CLN2 CRS) was developed to monitor loss of motor function, language and vision as well as frequency of generalised tonic clonic seizures. Using CLN2 CRS in an open label clinical trial it was shown that Brineura slowed down the progression of CLN2 symptoms. Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a protein highly expressed in myelinated axons. An increase of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood NfL is found in a variety of neuroinflammatory, neurodegenerative, traumatic, and cerebrovascular diseases. We analysed CSF NfL in CLN2 patients treated with Brineura to establish whether it can be used as a possible biomarker of response to therapy. Newly diagnosed patients had CSF samples collected and analysed at first treatment dose and up to 12 weeks post-treatment to look at acute changes. Patients on a compassionate use programme who were already receiving ERT for approximately 1yr had CSF samples collected and NfL analysed over the following 1.3 years (2.3 years post-initiation of ERT) to look at long-term changes. All newly diagnosed patients we investigated with classical late infantile phenotype had high NfL levels >2000 pg/ml at start of treatment. No significant change was observed in NfL up to 12 weeks post-treatment. After one year of ERT, two out of six patients still had high NfL levels, but all patients showed a continued decrease, and all had low NfL levels after two years on ERT. NfL levels appear to correspond and predict improved clinical status of patients on ERT and could be useful as a biomarker to monitor neurodegeneration and verify disease modification in CLN2 patients on ERT.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The visual neuropils (lamina, medulla and lobula complex), of malacostracan crustaceans and hexapods have many organizational principles, cell types and functional properties in common. Information about the cellular elements that compose the crustacean lobula is scarce especially when focusing on small columnar cells. Semiterrestrial crabs possess a highly developed visual system and display conspicuous visually guided behaviors. In particular, <i>Neohelice granulata</i> has been previously used to describe the cellular components of the first two optic neuropils using Golgi impregnation technique. Here, we present a comprehensive description of individual elements composing the third optic neuropil, the lobula, of that same species. We characterized a wide variety of elements (140 types) including input terminals and lobula columnar, centrifugal and input columnar elements. Results reveal a very dense and complex neuropil. We found a frequently impregnated input element (suggesting a supernumerary cartridge representation) that arborizes in the third layer of the lobula and that presents four variants each with ramifications organized following one of the four cardinal axes suggesting a role in directional processing. We also describe input elements with two neurites branching in the third layer, probably connecting with the medulla and lobula plate. These facts suggest that this layer is involved in the directional motion detection pathway in crabs. We analyze and discuss our findings considering the similarities and differences found between the layered organization and components of this crustacean lobula and the lobula of insects.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Low power, less occupying area, and improved speed of a 4-bit router/rerouter circuit for low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoders [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are more error-resistant than other forward error-correcting codes. Existing circuits give high power dissipation, less speed, and more occupying area. This work aimed to propose a better design and performance circuit, even in the presence of noise in the channel. Methods: In this research, the design of the multiplexer and demultiplexer were achieved using pass transistor logic. The target parameters were low power dissipation, improved throughput, and more negligible delay with a minimum area. One of the essential connecting circuits in a decoShder architecture is a multiplexer (MUX) and a demultiplexer (DEMUX) circuit. The design of the MUX and DEMUX contributes significantly to the performance of the decoder. The aim of this paper was the design of a 4 × 1 MUX to route the data bits received from the bit update blocks to the parallel adder circuits and a 1 × 4 DEMUX to receive the input bits from the parallel adder and distribute the output to the bit update blocks in a layered architecture LDPC decoder. The design uses pass transistor logic and achieves the reduction of the number of transistors used. The proposed circuit was designed using the Mentor Graphics CAD tool for 180 nm technology. Results: The parameters of power dissipation, area, and delay were considered crucial parameters for a low power decoder. The circuits were simulated using computer-aided design (CAD) tools, and the results depicted a significantly low power dissipation of 7.06 nW and 5.16 nW for the multiplexer and demultiplexer, respectively. The delay was found to be 100.5 ns (MUX) and 80 ns (DEMUX). Conclusion: This decoder’s potential use may be in low-power communication circuits such as handheld devices and Internet of Things (IoT) circuits.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Space-log: a novel approach to inferring gene-gene net-works using SPACE model with log penalty [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Gene expression data have been used to infer gene-gene networks (GGN) where an edge between two genes implies the conditional dependence of these two genes given all the other genes. Such gene-gene networks are of-ten referred to as gene regulatory networks since it may reveal expression regulation. Most of existing methods for identifying GGN employ penalized regression with L1 (lasso), L2 (ridge), or elastic net penalty, which spans the range of L1 to L2 penalty. However, for high dimensional gene expression data, a penalty that spans the range of L0 and L1 penalty, such as the log penalty, is often needed for variable selection consistency. Thus, we develop a novel method that em-ploys log penalty within the framework of an earlier network identification method space (Sparse PArtial Correlation Estimation), and implement it into a R package space-log. We show that the space-log is computationally efficient (source code implemented in C), and has good performance comparing with other methods, particularly for networks with hubs.Space-log is open source and available at GitHub, https://github.com/wuqian77/SpaceLog

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A multi-parameter grading system for optimal fitting of scleral contact lenses [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: While scleral lens practise has improved over the years due to factors such as availability of lenses with better materials and designs as well as experience of practitioners, a lack of objectivity appears to remain in terms of assessment of scleral lens fitting. This prospective observational work aimed to achieve standardization on this front through proposing a grading system for scleral lens fitting. Methods: After application of prosthetic replacement of ocular surface ecosystem (PROSE) devices on the participants’ eyes, four fundamental components for understanding scleral lens fitting such as central and limbal corneal clearance, mid-haptic compression, and alignment of lens edge over anterior sclera were assessed through a series of slit-lamp biomicroscopy imaging as well as with anterior segment optical coherence tomography. FitConnect® was used to modify the device parameters to simulate different grading patterns on the proposed scale. Serial imaging was done for all the different lenses to compose the grading scale. Results: A clinically relevant grading scale was constructed that pictorially demonstrated grades for the different aspect of scleral lens fitting. The grades were conveniently scaled within three categories: “optimal”, “acceptable” and “not acceptable”. Conclusion: The gradation of scleral lens fitting parameters would take a step towards objectifying the assessment patterns in practise. This will also help reducing the gap between a novice and an experienced practitioner in terms of understanding of scleral lens fitting.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Temporal trends of sex differences for COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation, severe disease, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death: a meta-analysis of 229 studies covering over 10M patients [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This review aims to investigate the association of sex with the risk of multiple COVID-19 health outcomes, ranging from infection to death. Methods: Pubmed and Embase were searched through September 2020. We considered studies reporting sex and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes. Qualitative and quantitative data were extracted using standardised electronic data extraction forms with the assessment of Newcastle Ottawa Scale for risk of bias. Pooled trends in infection, hospitalization, severity, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death rate were calculated separately for men and women and subsequently random-effects meta-analyses on relative risks (RR) for sex was performed. Results: Of 10,160 titles, 229 studies comprising 10,417,452 patients were included in the analyses. Methodological quality of the included studies was high (6.9 out of 9). Men had a higher risk for infection with COVID-19 than women (RR = 1.14, 95%CI: 1.07 to 1.21). When infected, they also had a higher risk for hospitalization (RR = 1.33, 95%CI: 1.27 to 1.41), higher risk for severe COVID-19 (RR = 1.22, 95%CI: 1.17 to 1.27), higher need for Intensive Care (RR = 1.41, 95%CI: 1.28 to 1.55), and higher risk of death (RR = 1.35, 95%CI: 1.28 to 1.43). Within the period studied, the RR for infection and severity increased for men compared to women, while the RR for mortality decreased for men compared to women. Conclusions: Meta-analyses on 229 studies comprising over 10 million patients showed that men have a higher risk for COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, disease severity, ICU admission and death. The relative risks of infection, disease severity and death for men versus women showed temporal trends with lower relative risks for infection and severity of disease and higher relative risk for death at the beginning of the pandemic compared to the end of our inclusion period.
