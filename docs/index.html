                Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical regulators of chromatin and gene expression, yet their precise molecular mechanisms are often undefined. CHASERR exemplifies this challenge: haploinsufficiency of this locus causes a severe neurodevelopmental syndrome, positioning it as a master epigenetic regulator, but its physical interactors and modes of action remain unknown. Here, we define the CHASERR interactome to uncover its core mechanism. By combining RNA pull-down sequencing with promoter-binding analysis, we demonstrate that CHASERR operates as a dual-function hub. It scaffolds a specific network of non-coding RNAs, including the catalytic RMRP, the responsive lncRNA CRNDE, and multiple microRNA host genes, supporting a role in post-transcriptional regulatory circuits. Simultaneously, CHASERR binds directly to gene promoters, and this binding is functionally linked to transcriptional changes upon its depletion. This integrated mechanism, coordinating direct DNA engagement with RNA-based regulatory networks, establishes CHASERR as a central node that bridges transcriptional and post-transcriptional control. Our work provides the missing physical and mechanistic foundation for its essential role in epigenetic regulation and human disease.

                Background Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 are increasingly used in scientific writing, yet little is known about how AI-generated scientific titles are perceived by researchers in terms of quality. Objective To compare the perceived accuracy, appeal, and overall preference for AI-generated versus human-written scientific titles. Methods We conducted a blinded comparative study with 21 researchers from diverse academic backgrounds. A random sample of 50 original titles was selected from 10 high-impact general internal medicine journals. For each title, an alternative version was generated using GPT-4.0. Each rater evaluated 50 pairs of titles, each pair consisting of one original and one AI-generated version, without knowing the source of the titles or the purpose of the study. For each pair, raters independently assessed both titles on perceived accuracy and appeal, and indicated their overall preference. We analyzed accuracy/appeal using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and negative binomial models, preferences using McNemar’s test and mixed-effects logistic regression, and inter-rater agreement with Gwet’s AC. Results AI-generated titles received significantly higher ratings for both perceived accuracy (mean=7.9 vs. 6.7, p-value <0.001) and appeal (mean=7.1 vs. 6.7, p-value <0.001) than human-written titles. The odds of preferring an AI-generated title were 1.7 times higher (p-value =0.001), with 61.8% of 1,049 paired judgments favoring the AI version. Inter-rater agreement was moderate to substantial (Gwet’s AC: 0.54–0.70). Conclusions AI-generated titles can surpass human-written titles in perceived accuracy, appeal, and preference, suggesting that LLMs may enhance the effectiveness of scientific communication. These findings support the responsible integration of AI tools in research.

                This paper introduces a novel non-classical probability distribution, termed the Logistic Map distribution, which is constructed by transforming a polynomial function derived from the second iteration of the logistic map. The logistic map a well-known discrete-time dynamical system has been extensively employed in diverse scientific domains, including population dynamics (to model bounded growth under environmental constraints), physics (to study nonlinear dynamics and deterministic chaos), and economics (to represent complex, nonlinear patterns in financial and economic time series). The proposed distribution is fully characterized by two parameters: a scale parameter and a shape parameter, with the constraint ensuring the non-negativity and integrability of the density. Within this valid parameter space, we rigorously derive and establish a comprehensive suite of statistical properties. These include the probability density function, cumulative distribution function, reliability (survival) function, and hazard (failure rate) function. Furthermore, we obtain analytical expressions for key descriptive measures such as the mode and median, as well as for higher-order characteristics including the moment generating function, factorial moment generating function, and characteristic function. The proposed distribution most closely application field in materials science specifically, the statistical modeling of particle or grain size distributions in industrial powder processing, metallurgy, and pharmaceutical manufacturing. The primary objective of this study is to formalize a new family of probability distributions grounded in the mathematical framework of dynamical systems, specifically leveraging the logistic function commonly encountered in differential and difference equations. By doing so, we bridge concepts from nonlinear dynamics and classical statistical theory. The secondary aim is to conduct a thorough investigation of the distribution’s mathematical structure and statistical behavior, thereby establishing its potential utility for modeling bounded, non-negative random phenomena in applied fields such as reliability engineering, survival analysis, and environmental statistics.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22485">JParc: Joint cortical surface parcellation with registration</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.22485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cortical surface parcellation is a fundamental task in both basic neuroscience research and clinical applications, enabling more accurate mapping of brain regions. Model-based and learning-based approaches for automated parcellation alleviate the need for manual labeling. Despite the advancement in parcellation performance, learning-based methods shift away from registration and atlas propagation without exploring the reason for the improvement compared to traditional methods. In this study, we present JParc, a joint cortical registration and parcellation framework, that outperforms existing state-of-the-art parcellation methods. In rigorous experiments, we demonstrate that the enhanced performance of JParc is primarily attributable to accurate cortical registration and a learned parcellation atlas. By leveraging a shallow subnetwork to fine-tune the propagated atlas labels, JParc achieves a Dice score greater than 90% on the Mindboggle dataset, using only basic geometric features (sulcal depth, curvature) that describe cortical folding patterns. The superior accuracy of JParc can significantly increase the statistical power in brain mapping studies as well as support applications in surgical planning and many other downstream neuroscientific and clinical tasks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22785">Nonlinear Dynamical Modeling of Human Intracranial Brain Activity with Flexible Inference</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.22785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical modeling of multisite human intracranial neural recordings is essential for developing neurotechnologies such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Linear dynamical models are widely used for this purpose due to their interpretability and their suitability for BCIs. In particular, these models enable flexible real-time inference, even in the presence of missing neural samples, which often occur in wireless BCIs. However, neural activity can exhibit nonlinear structure that is not captured by linear models. Furthermore, while recurrent neural network models can capture nonlinearity, their inference does not directly address handling missing observations. To address this gap, recent work introduced DFINE, a deep learning framework that integrates neural networks with linear state-space models to capture nonlinearities while enabling flexible inference. However, DFINE was developed for intracortical recordings that measure localized neuronal populations. Here we extend DFINE to modeling of multisite human intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings. We find that DFINE significantly outperforms linear state-space models (LSSMs) in forecasting future neural activity. Furthermore, DFINE matches or exceeds the accuracy of a gated recurrent unit (GRU) model in neural forecasting, indicating that a linear dynamical backbone, when paired and jointly trained with nonlinear neural networks, can effectively describe the dynamics of iEEG signals while also enabling flexible inference. Additionally, DFINE handles missing observations more robustly than the baselines, demonstrating its flexible inference and utility for BCIs. Finally, DFINE's advantage over LSSM is more pronounced in high gamma spectral bands. Taken together, these findings highlight DFINE as a strong and flexible framework for modeling human iEEG dynamics, with potential applications in next-generation BCIs.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23144">An Inference-Based Architecture for Intent and Affordance Saturation in Decision-Making</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.23144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision paralysis, i.e. hesitation, freezing, or failure to act despite full knowledge and motivation, poses a challenge for choice models that assume options are already specified and readily comparable. Drawing on qualitative reports in autism research that are especially salient, we propose a computational account in which paralysis arises from convergence failure in a hierarchical decision process. We separate intent selection (what to pursue) from affordance selection (how to pursue the goal) and formalize commitment as inference under a mixture of reverse- and forward-Kullback-Leibler (KL) objectives. Reverse KL is mode-seeking and promotes rapid commitment, whereas forward KL is mode-covering and preserves multiple plausible goals or actions. In static and dynamic (drift-diffusion) models, forward-KL-biased inference yields slow, heavy-tailed response times and two distinct failure modes, intent saturation and affordance saturation, when values are similar. Simulations in multi-option tasks reproduce key features of decision inertia and shutdown, treating autism as an extreme regime of a general, inference-based, decision-making continuum.

                arXiv:2512.23146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a biologically inspired, multilayer neural architecture composed of Rectified Spectral Units (ReSUs). Each ReSU projects a recent window of its input history onto a canonical direction obtained via canonical correlation analysis (CCA) of previously observed past-future input pairs, and then rectifies either its positive or negative component. By encoding canonical directions in synaptic weights and temporal filters, ReSUs implement a local, self-supervised algorithm for progressively constructing increasingly complex features.
  To evaluate both computational power and biological fidelity, we trained a two-layer ReSU network in a self-supervised regime on translating natural scenes. First-layer units, each driven by a single pixel, developed temporal filters resembling those of Drosophila post-photoreceptor neurons (L1/L2 and L3), including their empirically observed adaptation to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Second-layer units, which pooled spatially over the first layer, became direction-selective -- analogous to T4 motion-detecting cells -- with learned synaptic weight patterns approximating those derived from connectomic reconstructions.
  Together, these results suggest that ReSUs offer (i) a principled framework for modeling sensory circuits and (ii) a biologically grounded, backpropagation-free paradigm for constructing deep self-supervised neural networks.

                arXiv:2512.23301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensory prediction (SP) is a fundamental mechanism of perception that supports cognitive development. Atypical SP has been reported across multiple neurodevelopmental disorders (ND), suggesting it may constitute an early cross-syndromic marker. Premature birth is a major risk factor for ND, with risk increasing as gestational age (GA) at birth decreases. However, how perinatal risk factors shape the development of SP remains poorly understood. We do not know if untimely birth itself, or exposure to iatrogenic pain during neonatal intensive care, cause neurodevelopmental impairments. In this study, we first assessed whether SP can be detected in the brains of premature neonates at 35 weeks corrected GA using a tactile oddballomission paradigm with EEG. We then examined the effects of the degree of prematurity and of the exposure to painful care procedures on neural indices of SP. Results demonstrate the presence of repetition suppression (RS) and a mismatch response (MMR) to deviant stimuli in the contralateral somatosensory cortex of premature neonates. The amplitude of these SP proxies was significantly affected by the number of painful procedures experienced since birth, independently of the effect of GA at birth. Contrary to our initial hypothesis that greater neurodevelopmental risk would be associated with less mature SP, infants with higher exposure to pain exhibited more robust indices of SP. These findings suggest that increased ex utero experience, even painful, is associated with accelerated maturation of predictive somatosensory processing. Longitudinal follow-up of participants at age 2 will explore how these early markers relate to developmental outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23661">Dynamical incompatibilities in paced finger tapping experiments</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.23661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behavioral description of the sensorimotor synchronization phenomenon in humans is exhaustive, mostly by using variations of the traditional paced finger-tapping task. This task helps unveil the inner workings of the error-correction mechanism responsible for the resynchronization after a perturbation to the period of the stimuli sequence. Yet, fundamental contradictions still exist among different works in the literature. One of such contradictions only emerges after comparing the two most-common period perturbation types: step changes and phase shifts. The stimulus sequence is exactly the same in both perturbation types up to and including the (unexpected) perturbed stimulus. Why then would the timing of the next response be different between perturbation types, as observed? The explanation lies in the buildup of different temporal contexts during the experiments that recalibrate the error-correction mechanism. Here we show, both experimentally and theoretically, that responses to different perturbation types are dynamically incompatible when they occur in separate experiments. That is, they can't be represented by the same underlying dynamical system, thus explaining many contradictory results and the difficulty in reproducing both types of perturbations with a single mathematical model. On the other hand, if both perturbation types are presented at random during the same experiment then the responses are compatible with each other and can be construed as produced by a unique underlying mechanism. We conclude that a single underlying dynamical system can represent the response to all perturbation types, signs, and sizes, which is nevertheless recalibrated by temporal context. Our results offer a ground for performing better comparisons in paced finger tapping and extend the usable range of data beyond the perturbed stimulus and into the information-rich resynchronization phase.

Abstract: The phenomenal advances in large language models (LLMs) and other foundation models over the past few years have been based on optimizing large-scale transformer models on the surprisingly simple objective of minimizing next-token prediction loss, a form of predictive coding that is also the backbone of an increasingly popular model of brain function in neuroscience and cognitive science. However, current foundation models ignore three other important components of state-of-the-art predictive coding models: tight integration of actions with generative models, hierarchical compositional structure, and episodic memory. We propose that to achieve safe, interpretable, energy-efficient, and human-like AI, foundation models should integrate actions, at multiple scales of abstraction, with a compositional generative architecture and episodic memory. We present recent evidence from neuroscience and cognitive science on the importance of each of these components. We describe how the addition of these missing components to foundation models could help address some of their current deficiencies: hallucinations and superficial understanding of concepts due to lack of grounding, a missing sense of agency/responsibility due to lack of control, threats to safety and trustworthiness due to lack of interpretability, and energy inefficiency. We compare our proposal to current trends, such as adding chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to foundation models, and discuss new ways of augmenting these models with brain-inspired components. We conclude by arguing that a rekindling of the historically fruitful exchange of ideas between brain science and AI will help pave the way towards safe and interpretable human-centered AI.

Abstract: Applying the lens of computation and information has been instrumental in driving the technological progress of our civilization as well as in empowering our understanding of the world around us. The digital computer was and for many still is the leading metaphor for how our mind operates. Information theory (IT) has also been important in our understanding of how nervous systems encode and process information. The target article deploys information and computation to bodies: to understand why they have evolved in particular ways (animal bodies) and to design optimal bodies (robots). In this commentary, I argue that the main role of bodies is not to compute.

                arXiv:2512.23137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating non-Euclidean brain imaging data with Euclidean tabular data, such as clinical and demographic information, poses a substantial challenge for medical imaging analysis, particularly in forecasting future outcomes. While machine learning and deep learning techniques have been applied successfully to cross-sectional classification and prediction tasks, effectively forecasting outcomes in longitudinal imaging studies remains challenging. To address this challenge, we introduce a time-aware graph neural network model with transformer fusion (GNN-TF). This model flexibly integrates both tabular data and dynamic brain connectivity data, leveraging the temporal order of these variables within a coherent framework. By incorporating non-Euclidean and Euclidean sources of information from a longitudinal resting-state fMRI dataset from the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA), the GNN-TF enables a comprehensive analysis that captures critical aspects of longitudinal imaging data. Comparative analyses against a variety of established machine learning and deep learning models demonstrate that GNN-TF outperforms these state-of-the-art methods, delivering superior predictive accuracy for predicting future tobacco usage. The end-to-end, time-aware transformer fusion structure of the proposed GNN-TF model successfully integrates multiple data modalities and leverages temporal dynamics, making it a valuable analytic tool for functional brain imaging studies focused on clinical outcome prediction.

                arXiv:2212.04195v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances and reflections on reproducible human neuroscience, especially brain-wide association studies (BWAS) leveraging large datasets, have led to divergent and sometimes opposing views on research practices and priorities. The debates span multiple dimensions. Shifts along these axes have fractured consensus and further fragmented an already heterogeneous field of cognitive neuroscience. Here, we sketch a holistic and integrative response grounded in population neuroscience, organized around a closed-loop "design-analysis-interpretation" research cycle that aims to build consensus while bridging these divides. Our central claim is that population neuroscience offers a unique population-level vantage point for identifying general principles, characterizing inter-individual variabilities, and benchmarking intra-individual changes, thereby providing a supportive framework for small-scale, mechanism-focused studies at the individual level and allowing them to co-evolve with population-level studies. Population neuroscience is not simply about providing larger N for BWAS; its deeper goal is to accumulate a family of cross-scale priors and shared infrastructures that can support design, analysis, and interpretation of human neuroscience for decades to come. In this sense, we outline a "third-generation" view of population neuroscience that reorients the field from amassing isolated associations toward building integrative reference frameworks for future mechanistic and translational work.

                arXiv:2401.15251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High resolution volumetric neuroimaging datasets from electron microscopy (EM) and x-ray micro and holographic-nano tomography (XRM/XHN) are being generated at an increasing rate and by a growing number of research teams. These datasets are derived from an increasing number of species, in an increasing number of brain regions, and with an increasing number of techniques. Each of these large-scale datasets, often surpassing petascale levels, is typically accompanied by a unique and varied set of metadata. These datasets can be used to derive connectomes, or neuron-synapse level connectivity diagrams, to investigate the fundamental organization of neural circuitry, neuronal development, and neurodegenerative disease. Standardization is essential to facilitate comparative connectomics analysis and enhance data utilization. Although the neuroinformatics community has successfully established and adopted data standards for many modalities, this effort has not yet encompassed EM and XRM/ XHN connectomics data. This lack of standardization isolates these datasets, hindering their integration and comparison with other research performed in the field. Towards this end, our team formed a working group consisting of community stakeholders to develop Image and Experimental Metadata Standards for EM and XRM/XHN data to ensure the scientific impact and further motivate the generation and sharing of these data. This document addresses version 1.1 of these standards, aiming to support metadata services and future software designs for community collaboration. Standards for derived annotations are described in a companion document. Standards definitions are available on a community github page. We hope these standards will enable comparative analysis, improve interoperability between connectomics software tools, and continue to be refined and improved by the neuroinformatics community.

Abstract: We present a new illusion that challenges our understanding of stereo vision. The illusion consists of a larger circle at 50cm, and smaller circle in front of it at 40cm, with constant angular sizes throughout. We move the larger circle forward by 10cm (to 40cm) and then back again (to 50cm). The question is, what distance should we move the smaller circle forward and back to maintain a constant perceived separation in depth between the circles? Constant physical distance (10cm) or constant retinal disparity (6.7cm)? Observers choose constant disparity. We therefore argue the 'Linton Stereo Illusion' appears to suggest that perceived stereo depth reflects retinal disparities rather than 3D geometry.

                arXiv:2509.09696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher-order brain connectivity (HOBC), which captures interactions among three or more brain regions, provides richer organizational information than traditional pairwise functional connectivity (FC). Recent studies have begun to infer latent HOBC from noninvasive imaging data, but they mainly focus on static analyses, limiting their applicability in dynamic prediction tasks. To address this gap, we propose DCHO, a unified approach for modeling and forecasting the temporal evolution of HOBC based on a Decomposition-Composition framework, which is applicable to both non-predictive tasks (state classification) and predictive tasks (brain dynamics forecasting). DCHO adopts a decomposition-composition strategy that reformulates the prediction task into two manageable subproblems: HOBC inference and latent trajectory prediction. In the inference stage, we propose a dual-view encoder to extract multiscale topological features and a latent combinatorial learner to capture high-level HOBC information. In the forecasting stage, we introduce a latent-space prediction loss to enhance the modeling of temporal trajectories. Extensive experiments on multiple neuroimaging datasets demonstrate that DCHO achieves superior performance in both non-predictive tasks (state classification) and predictive tasks (brain dynamics forecasting), significantly outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been associated with structural alterations across cortical and subcortical regions. Quantitative neuroimaging enables large-scale analysis of these neuroanatomical patterns. This project used structural MRI (T1-weighted) data from the publicly available ABIDE I dataset (n = 1,112) to classify ASD and control participants using a hybrid model. A 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained to learn neuroanatomical feature representations, which were then passed to a support vector machine (SVM) for final classification. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) was applied to the CNN to visualize the brain regions that contributed most to the model predictions. The Grad-CAM difference maps showed strongest relevance along cortical boundary regions, with additional emphasis in midline frontal-temporal-parietal areas, which is broadly consistent with prior ASD neuroimaging findings.

Abstract: Functional brain networks exhibit topological structures that reflect neural organization; however, statistical comparison of these networks is challenging for several reasons. This paper introduces a topologically invariant permutation test for detecting topological inequivalence. Under topological equivalence, topological features can be permuted separately between groups without distorting individual network structures. The test statistic uses $2$-Wasserstein distances on persistent diagrams, computed in closed form. To reduce variability in brain connectivities while preserving topology, heat kernel expansion on the Hodge Laplacian is applied with bandwidth $t$ controlling diffusion intensity. Theoretical results guarantee variance reduction through optimal Hilbert space projection. Simulations across diverse network topologies show superior performance compared to conventional two-sample tests and alternative metrics. Applied to resting-state fMRI data from the Multimodal Treatment of ADHD study, the method detects significant topological differences between cannabis users and non-users.

Abstract: Neural oscillations have long been considered important markers of interaction across brain regions, yet identifying coordinated oscillatory activity from high-dimensional multiple-electrode recordings remains challenging. We sought to quantify time-varying covariation of oscillatory amplitudes across two brain regions, during a memory task, based on local field potentials recorded from 96 electrodes in each region. We extended Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to multiple time series through the cross-correlation of latent time series. This, however, introduces a large number of possible lead-lag cross-correlations across the two regions. To manage that high dimensionality we developed rigorous statistical procedures aimed at finding a small number of dominant lead-lag effects. The method correctly identified ground truth structure in realistic simulation-based settings. When we used it to analyze local field potentials recorded from prefrontal cortex and visual area V4 we obtained highly plausible results. The new statistical methodology could also be applied to other slowly-varying high-dimensional time series.

                arXiv:2512.22206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern deep residual networks perform substantial redundant computation by evaluating all residual blocks for every input, even when identity mappings suffice. We introduce CosineGate, an end-to-end differentiable architecture for dynamic routing in residual networks that uses cosine incompatibility between identity and residual feature representations as a self-supervised skip signal. CosineGate measures semantic redundancy through the Cosine Incompatibility Ratio (CIR), defined as 1 - cos(x, F(x)), and uses Gumbel-Softmax relaxation to enable per-sample, per-block gating during training. A progressive FLOPs regularization term controls average compute usage without destabilizing optimization. On CIFAR-10, CosineGate spans the accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier: an aggressive configuration achieves 89.9 percent accuracy with 24.1 percent FLOPs savings, a balanced configuration achieves 91.3 percent accuracy with 28.5 percent savings at epoch 160, and a conservative configuration reaches a peak of 93.2 percent accuracy with minimal compute reduction. These results match or exceed ResNet-20 (91.3 percent) while reducing computation, without auxiliary supervision, distillation, or task-specific heuristics. Our results demonstrate that simple geometric measures of feature incompatibility provide a principled and effective signal for dynamic residual routing.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11279">Annotated History of Modern AI and Deep Learning</a></h4>

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is the science of credit assignment. It seeks to find patterns in observations that explain and predict the consequences of events and actions. This then helps to improve future performance. Minsky's so-called "fundamental credit assignment problem" (1963) surfaces in all sciences including physics (why is the world the way it is?) and history (which persons/ideas/actions have shaped society and civilisation?). Here I focus on the history of ML itself. Modern artificial intelligence (AI) is dominated by artificial neural networks (NNs) and deep learning, both of which are conceptually closer to the old field of cybernetics than what was traditionally called AI (e.g., expert systems and logic programming). A modern history of AI & ML must emphasize breakthroughs outside the scope of shallow AI text books. In particular, it must cover the mathematical foundations of today's NNs such as the chain rule (1676), the first NNs (circa 1800), the first practical AI (1914), the theory of AI and its limitations (1931-34), and the first working deep learning algorithms (1965-). From the perspective of 2025, I provide a timeline of the most significant events in the history of NNs, ML, deep learning, AI, computer science, and mathematics in general, crediting the individuals who laid the field's foundations. The text contains numerous hyperlinks to relevant overview sites. With a ten-year delay, it supplements my 2015 award-winning deep learning survey which provides hundreds of additional references. Finally, I will put things in a broader historical context, spanning from the Big Bang to when the universe will be many times older than it is now.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14484">Towards a Comprehensive Theory of Reservoir Computing</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.14484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In reservoir computing, an input sequence is processed by a recurrent neural network, the reservoir, which transforms it into a spatial pattern that a shallow readout network can then exploit for tasks such as memorization and time-series prediction or classification. Echo state networks (ESN) are a model class in which the reservoir is a traditional artificial neural network. This class contains many model types, each with sets of hyperparameters. Selecting models and parameter settings for particular applications requires a theory for predicting and comparing performances. Here, we demonstrate that recent developments of perceptron theory can be used to predict the memory capacity and accuracy of a wide variety of ESN models, including reservoirs with linear neurons, sigmoid nonlinear neurons, different types of recurrent matrices, and different types of readout networks. Across thirty variants of ESNs, we show that empirical results consistently confirm the theory's predictions. As a practical demonstration, the theory is used to optimize memory capacity of an ESN in the entire joint parameter space. Further, guided by the theory, we propose a novel ESN model with a readout network that does not require training, and which outperforms earlier ESN models without training. Finally, we characterize the geometry of the readout networks in ESNs, which reveals that many ESN models exhibit a similar regular simplex geometry as has been observed in the output weights of deep neural networks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22374">Machine Unlearning using Forgetting Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.22374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern computer systems store vast amounts of personal data, enabling advances in AI and ML but risking user privacy and trust. For privacy reasons, it is sometimes desired for an ML model to forget part of the data it was trained on. In this paper, we introduce a novel unlearning approach based on Forgetting Neural Networks (FNNs), a neuroscience-inspired architecture that explicitly encodes forgetting through multiplicative decay factors. While FNNs had previously been studied as a theoretical construct, we provide the first concrete implementation and demonstrate their effectiveness for targeted unlearning. We propose several variants with per-neuron forgetting factors, including rank-based assignments guided by activation levels, and evaluate them on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST benchmarks. Our method systematically removes information associated with forget sets while preserving performance on retained data. Membership inference attacks confirm the effectiveness of FNN-based unlearning in erasing information about the training data from the neural network. These results establish FNNs as a promising foundation for efficient and interpretable unlearning.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10477">Symphony: A Heuristic Normalized Calibrated Advantage Actor and Critic Algorithm in application for Humanoid Robots</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.10477v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our work we not explicitly hint that it is a misconception to think that humans learn fast. Learning process takes time. Babies start learning to move in the restricted liquid area called placenta. Children often are limited by underdeveloped body. Even adults are not allowed to participate in complex competitions right away. However, with robots, when learning from scratch, we often don't have the privilege of waiting for dozen millions of steps. "Swaddling" regularization is responsible for restraining an agent in rapid but unstable development penalizing action strength in a specific way not affecting actions directly. The Symphony, Transitional-policy Deterministic Actor and Critic algorithm, is a concise combination of different ideas for possibility of training humanoid robots from scratch with Sample Efficiency, Sample Proximity and Safety of Actions in mind. It is no secret that continuous increase in Gaussian noise without appropriate smoothing is harmful for motors and gearboxes. Compared to Stochastic algorithms, we set a limited parametric noise and promote a reduced strength of actions, safely increasing entropy, since the actions are kind of immersed in weaker noise. When actions require more extreme values, actions rise above the weak noise. Training becomes empirically much safer for both the environment around and the robot's mechanisms. We use Fading Replay Buffer: using a fixed formula containing the hyperbolic tangent, we adjust the batch sampling probability: the memory contains a recent memory and a long-term memory trail. Fading Replay Buffer allows us to use Temporal Advantage when we improve the current Critic Network prediction compared to the exponential moving average. Temporal Advantage allows us to update Actor and Critic in one pass, as well as combine Actor and Critic in one Object and implement their Losses in one line.

                <p>by Yuto Kikuchi, Yoshifumi Asakura, Kazuhiro Aoki, Yohei Kondo, Honda Naoki</p>

Collective cell migration is fundamental to tissue homeostasis and underlies biological processes such as wound healing and cancer invasion. Previous work has proposed governing equations to describe how chemical and mechanical inputs regulate these movements, but the quantitative validity of such models remains to be thoroughly assessed. Here, we developed a machine-learning framework that infers the governing equation from live-cell imaging data. Applied to epithelial sheet migration driven by MAPK/ERK, our approach quantitatively predicted single-cell movement from local chemical and mechanical cues. Examination of the learned equations further indicated that cells process environmental signals by computing their spatiotemporal derivatives. Moreover, when applied to individual cells, our framework revealed cell-cell heterogeneity in the underlying migratory rules. Our framework offers a powerful tool for predictive modeling of multicellular dynamics in both physiological and pathological settings.

Epidemiological models that aim for a high degree of biological realism by simulating every individual in a population are unavoidably complex, with many free parameters, which makes systematic explorations of their dynamics computationally challenging. In this study, we demonstrate how Gaussian Process emulation can overcome this challenge. To simulate disease dynamics, we developed an abstract individual-based model that is loosely inspired by dengue, incorporating some key features shaping dengue epidemics such as social structure, human movement, and seasonality. We focused on three epidemiological metrics derived from the individual-based model outcomes — outbreak probability, maximum incidence, and epidemic duration — and trained three Gaussian Process surrogate models to approximate these metrics. The GP surrogate models enabled the rapid prediction of these epidemiological metrics at any point in the eight-dimensional parameter space of the original model. Our analysis revealed that average infectivity and average human mobility are key drivers of these epidemiological metrics, while the seasonal timing of the first infection can influence the course of the epidemic outbreak. We used a dataset comprising more than 1,000 dengue epidemics observed over 12 years in Colombia to calibrate our Gaussian Process model and evaluated its predictive power. The calibrated Gaussian Process model identified a subset of municipalities with consistently higher average infectivity estimates; the notable overlap between these municipalities and previously reported dengue disease clusters suggests that statistical emulation can facilitate empirical data analysis. Overall, this work underscores the potential of Gaussian Process emulation to enable the use of more complex individual-based models in epidemiology, allowing a higher degree of realism and accuracy that should increase our ability to control diseases of public health concern.

The biological mechanisms underlying the spontaneous and recurrent transition to seizures in the epileptic brain are still poorly understood. As a result, seizures remain uncontrolled in a substantial proportion of patients. Brain stimulation is an emerging and promising method to treat various brain disorders, including drug-refractory epilepsy. Selected stimulation protocols previously demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in reducing the seizure rate. The stimulation efficacy critically depends on chosen stimulation parameters, such as the time point, amplitude, and frequency of stimulation. This study aims to explore the neurobiological impact of 1Hz stimulation and provide the mechanistic explanation behind its seizure-delaying effects. We study this effect using a computational model, a modified version of the Epileptor-2 model, in close comparison with such stimulation effects on spontaneous seizures recorded <i>in vitro</i> in a high-potassium model of ictogenesis in rat hippocampal slices. In particular, we investigate the mechanisms and dynamics of spontaneous seizure emergence, the seizure-delaying effect of the stimulation, and the optimal stimulation parameters to achieve the maximal anti-seizure effect. We show that the modified Epileptor-2 model replicates key experimental observations, and captures seizure dynamics and the anti-seizure effects of low-frequency electrical stimulation (LFES) observed in hippocampal slices. We identify the critical thresholds in the model for seizure onset and determine the optimal stimulation parameters—timing, amplitude, and duration—that exceed specific thresholds to delay seizures without triggering premature seizures. Our study highlights the central role of sodium-potassium pump dynamics in terminating seizures and mediating the LFES effect.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are crucial in addressing the global crisis of bacterial resistance. However, there are still significant limitations in existing methods on de novo AMPs design, especially in designing AMPs with desirable physicochemical properties for specific bacterial pathogens. In this study, we propose a novel generative framework for designing pathogen-targeted antimicrobial peptides with programmable physicochemical properties. More specifically, a conditional Variational Autoencoder is first pretrained for generating AMPs with editable physicochemical properties. We then develop a conditional diffusion model to learn hidden representations of AMPs for targeting pathogens of interest, and construct corresponding MIC predictors for specific bacterial strains. Through comprehensive simulation experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms most existing models in terms of antimicrobial efficacy against specific bacterial targets. Moreover, through systematic screening and analysis, we have identified two star AMPs for each of the two target bacterial species (i.e., <i>E. coli</i> or <i>S. aureus</i>), both of which exhibit excellent performance in antibacterial activity, hemolytic properties, toxicity profiles, etc. Overall, this study provides the key technological support for developing next-generation intelligent platforms for antimicrobial agents design.

Accurately quantifying cellular morphology at scale could substantially empower existing single-cell approaches. However, measuring cell morphology remains an active field of research, which has inspired multiple computer vision algorithms over the years. Here, we show that DINOv2, a vision-transformer based, self-supervised algorithm, has a remarkable ability for learning rich representations of cellular morphology without manual annotations or any other type of supervision. We apply DINOv2 to cell phenotyping problems, and compare the performance of resulting models, called Cell-DINO models, on a wide variety of tasks across two publicly available imaging datasets of diverse specifications and biological focus. Compared to supervised and other self-supervised baselines, Cell-DINO models demonstrate improved performance, especially in low annotation regimes. For instance, to classify protein localization using only 1% of annotations on a challenging single-cell dataset, Cell-DINO performs 70% better than a supervised strategy, and 24% better than another self-supervised alternative. The results show that Cell-DINO can support the study of unknown biological variation, including single-cell heterogeneity and relationships between experimental conditions, making it an excellent tool for image-based biological discovery.

Humans can evaluate the accuracy of their decisions by providing confidence judgements. Traditional cognitive models have tried to capture the mechanisms underlying this process but remain mostly limited to two-choice tasks with simple stimuli. How confidence is given for naturalistic stimuli with multiple choice alternatives is not well understood. We recently developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model – RTNet – that exhibits several important signatures of human decision making and outperforms existing alternatives in predicting human responses. Here, we use RTNet’s image computability to test seven different confidence strategies on a task involving digit discrimination with eight alternatives (N = 60). Specifically, we compared confidence strategies that consider the entire evidence distribution across choices against strategies that only consider a specific subset of the available evidence. We also compared strategies based on whether they compute confidence from posterior probabilities or from raw evidence. A model which derives confidence from the difference in raw evidence between the top-two choices (Top2Diff model) consistently provided the best quantitative and qualitative fits to the data and the best predictions of human confidence. These results support the notion that human confidence is based on a specific subset of available evidence, challenge prominent theories such as the Bayesian confidence hypothesis and the positive evidence heuristic, and establish CNNs as promising models for inferring the mechanisms underlying human confidence in naturalistic settings.

                <p>by Megan Morrison, Lai-Sang Young</p>

<i>C. elegans</i> locomotion is composed of switches between forward and reversal states punctuated by turns. This locomotory capability is necessary for the nematode to move towards attractive stimuli, escape noxious chemicals, and explore its environment. Although experimentalists have identified a number of premotor neurons as drivers of forward and reverse motion, how these neurons work together to produce the behaviors observed remains to be understood. Towards a better understanding of <i>C. elegans</i> neurodynamics, we present in this paper a minimally parameterized, biology-based dynamical systems model of the premotor network. Our model consists of a recurrently connected collection of premotor neurons (the core group) driven by over a hundred sensory and interneurons that provide diverse feedforward inputs to the core group. It is data-driven in the sense that the choice of neurons in the core group follows experimental guidance, anatomical structures are dictated by the connectome, and physiological parameters are deduced from whole-brain imaging and voltage clamps data. When simulated with realistic input signals, our model produces premotor activity that closely resembles experimental data: from the seemingly random switching between forward and reversal behaviors to the synchronization of subnetworks to various higher-order statistics. We posit that different roles are played by gap junctions and synaptic connections in switching dynamics. Using the model we identify signal neurons that strongly influence switches between behavioral states and core neurons that play an important role in integrating signal information. The model produces switching statistics that underlie behaviors such as dwelling versus roaming as a result of the synaptic inputs received.

In today’s research landscape, the dissemination and utilisation of results are not only an obligation but essential components of impactful research. Funding agencies are increasingly emphasising the translation of academic findings into practical applications that meet societal needs. However, researchers often lack training or incentives to focus on this task, leading to a disconnect between scientific enquiry and impact in practice. Innovation Boot Camps (IBCs) offer a dynamic solution to bridge this gap. IBCs provide a collaborative platform where researchers can familiarise themselves with attitudes and mindsets of end users, including industry professionals, policymakers and community members. This interaction ensures that scientific findings are aligned with real needs and challenges, increasing their relevance and applicability. These workshops foster creativity by encouraging researchers to think beyond the traditional academic framework and explore interdisciplinary approaches. This promotes not only innovative solutions, but also the effective tackling of complex societal problems. In addition to fostering creativity, IBCs also provide training to researchers in important professional skills such as communication, project management and business acumen. These skills are critical for communicating scientific concepts, navigating commercial environments and successfully implementing research findings. By participating in IBCs, researchers can assume a proactive role in transforming their findings into marketable or socially relevant innovations. This article offers a step-by-step guide on how to structure and run an effective Innovation Boot Camp, helping researchers transform their results from bureaucratic obligations into strategic opportunities for societal benefit.

Forming organs requires the appropriate distribution of spatiotemporal signals leading to tissue patterning and morphogenesis. Advances in genetic tools contributed to our understanding of cell signaling and their associated genes. Yet, due to technical challenges, the contribution of dynamic morphological transformations of tissues during organ formation remains widely unexplored. Here, we develop a new mathematical approach to understand the variables that shape the dynamic distribution of ligand and signaling. We use the TGF-α-like ligand Gurken (GRK) and the activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) during <i>Drosophila</i> oogenesis to build the model. Our model accounts for GRK secretion from a moving source, its diffusion in the perivitelline space, and the activation of EGFR in the overlaying follicle cells. Furthermore, we also capture the rapid growth of the oocyte, which was a major challenge to integrate into a model. We modeled the dynamic distribution of GRK and EGFR activation by a series of mathematical equations. We used this model to study how perturbations of the egg chamber’s morphological evolution impact cell signaling, which could not be achieved via genetic perturbation. We found that the relative movement of the follicle cells and the oocyte contributes to the distribution of EGFR signaling activation.

                <p>by Ling Xu, Pejman Senaei, Yi Jiang</p>

Mucociliary clearance is the primary defense mechanism in our respiratory system against aerosol pathogens and allergens. The rhythmic movement of cilia on airway-lining cells propels mucus flow, driving the movement of trapped particles. However, the impact of cilia density and distribution on mucociliary mixing and transport at the tissue scale remains poorly understood. In the present work, we present three-dimensional (3D) simulations of ciliary-driven mixing and transport of a Newtonian fluid as an approximation of mucus at the tissue scale. We investigate the influence of ciliary density, cilia cluster spacing, and metachrony on fluid mixing and transport. Our findings reveal that: (i) cilia clusters generate flow swirls whose size scales with ciliary density, (ii) a single cilia cluster generates horizontal and upward transport with horizontal mixing, (iii) optimal spacing between ciliary clusters enhances horizontal transport, and (iv) metachronic waves enhances mixing but reduces net transport. These findings provide useful insight into generic principles of cilia-driven transport in viscous fluids and may inform bio-inspired system design, while further work is needed to extend this work to physiologically realistic mucus transport.

                Dennaoui et al. demonstrate that cooperative functions of JAK1 and JAK2 are obligatory for the post-natal development of mammary epithelial ducts. They provide experimental evidence that these functions are independent of STAT proteins, suggesting that the early development of the mammary gland is governed by noncanonical cytokine signaling through JAKs.

                Jassinskaja, Bode et al. provide a multi-omics characterization of Tet2-mutated cells, including global proteomics revealing novel roles for extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules in selectively modifying self-renewal divisions. These findings point more broadly to physical and mechanical mediators of self-renewal, implicating integrins and cytokine signaling as extracellular drivers of clonal expansion.

                Nakamura et al. show that adult leptomeninges harbor a persistent neural crest-derived cell population that responds to ischemic injury. These cells migrate into the damaged cortex, adopt stromal states, and aid vascular repair through CXCR4 and pleiotrophin signaling, revealing an unexpected endogenous mechanism that stabilizes the injured blood-brain barrier.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105321">ANKEF1 is a key axonemal component essential for murine sperm motility and male fertility</a></h4>

              
                Sperm motility is essential for male fertility and depends on the structural integrity of the sperm axoneme, which features a canonical ‘9 + 2’ microtubule arrangement. This structure comprises nine outer doublet microtubules (DMTs) that are associated with various macromolecular complexes. Among them, the nexin–dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC) forms crossbridges between adjacent DMTs, contributing to their stabilization and enabling flagellar bending. In this study, we investigated Ankyrin repeat and EF-hand domain containing 1 (ANKEF1, also known as ANKRD5), a protein highly expressed in the sperm axoneme. We found that ANKEF1 interacts with DRC5/TCTE1 and DRC4/GAS8, two key components of the N-DRC, and these interactions occur independently of calcium regulation. Male <i>Ankef1</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice exhibited impaired sperm motility and infertility. Cryo-electron tomography revealed a typical ‘9 + 2’ axoneme structure with intact DMTs in <i>Ankef1</i> null sperm; however, the DMTs showed pronounced morphological variability and increased structural heterogeneity. Notably, ANKEF1 deficiency did not alter ATP levels, reactive oxygen species levels, or mitochondrial membrane potential. These findings suggest that ANKEF1 may attenuate the N-DRC’s mechanical buffering—akin to a ‘car bumper’—between adjacent DMTs, thereby compromising axonemal stability under high mechanical stress during vigorous flagellar beating.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106989">Glycosylated IgG antibodies contribute to the recovery of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome patients</a></h4>

              
                Haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a fatal disease caused by Hantaan virus (HTNV) infection. Humoral immunity is essential for effective viral clearance; however, the glycosylation characteristics of immunoglobulin G (IgG) in HFRS patients are not well known. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HFRS patients were obtained for B subset analysis using scRNA-seq and flow cytometry. HTNV-specific IgG antibody titers were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and IgG glycosylation was analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography. The proportions of the antibody-secreting memory (ASM) B cells and plasmablasts (PB) were significantly expanded among acute HFRS patients. We discovered significantly increased fucosylated IgG and decreased bisecting N-acetylglucosamine during the convalescent phase of HTNV infection. Meanwhile, positive correlations were observed between ASM subsets and galactosylation/sialylation in the IgG Fc region, and between PB subsets and sialylation. Notably, the glycosylation-related genes, such as <i>RPN1 and RPN2</i>, were primarily expressed differentially in the ASM and PB subclusters, which were enriched in the N-glycosylation modifications of proteins through asparagine. Our findings indicated that IgG N-glycosylation may play a crucial role in combating HTNV infection and contributing to clinical recovery, which provided new insights for optimizing glycoengineered therapeutic antibodies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96783">Sex differences in bile acid homeostasis and excretion underlie the disparity in liver cancer incidence between males and females</a></h4>

              
                Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the common liver cancer, exhibits higher incidence in males. Here, we report that mice lacking bile acid (BA) regulators, Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR also termed NR1H4) and Small Heterodimer Partner (SHP also termed NR0B2), recapitulate the sex difference in liver cancer risk. Since few therapeutic options are available, we focused on understanding the intrinsic protection afforded to female livers. Transcriptomic analysis in control and NR1H4 and NR0B2 double knockout livers identified female-specific changes in metabolism, including amino acids, lipids, and steroids. To assess translational relevance, we examined if transcriptomic signatures obtained from this murine HCC model correlate with survival outcomes for HCC patients. Gene signatures unique to the knockout females correspond with low-grade tumors and better survival. Ovariectomy blunts the metabolic changes and promotes liver tumorigenesis in females that, intriguingly, coincides with increased serum bile acid (BA) levels. Despite similar genetics, knockout male mice displayed higher serum BA concentrations, while female knockouts excreted more BAs. Decreasing enterohepatic BA recirculation using cholestyramine, an FDA-approved resin, dramatically reduced the liver cancer burden in male mice. Overall, we reveal that sex-specific BA metabolism leading to lower circulating BA concentration protects female livers from developing cancer. Thus, targeting BA excretion may be a promising therapeutic strategy against HCC.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107141">Biophysical basis for brain folding and misfolding patterns in ferrets and humans</a></h4>

              
                A mechanistic understanding of neurodevelopment requires us to follow the multiscale processes that connect molecular genetic processes to macroscopic cerebral cortical formations and thence to neurological function. Using MRI of the brain of the ferret, a model organism for studying cortical morphogenesis, we create in vitro physical gel models and in silico numerical simulations of normal brain gyrification. Using observations of genetically manipulated animal models, we identify cerebral cortical thickness and cortical expansion rate as the primary drivers of dysmorphogenesis and demonstrate that in silico models allow us to examine the causes of aberrations in morphology and developmental processes at various stages of cortical ontogenesis. Finally, we explain analogous cortical malformations in human brains, with comparisons with human phenotypes induced by the same genetic defects, providing a unified perspective on brain morphogenesis that is driven proximally by genetic causes and affected mechanically via variations in the geometry of the brain and differential growth of the cortex.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104545">Therapeutic benefits of maintaining CDK4/6 inhibitors and incorporating CDK2 inhibitors beyond progression in breast cancer</a></h4>

              
                CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) with endocrine therapy are standard for hormone receptor-positive (HR<sup>+</sup>) metastatic breast cancer. However, most patients eventually develop resistance and discontinue treatment, and there is currently no consensus on effective second-line strategies. Using preclinical HR<sup>+</sup> human breast cancer models with acquired resistance to CDK4/6i, we demonstrate that maintaining CDK4/6i therapy, either alone or combined with CDK2 inhibitors (CDK2i), slows the growth of resistant tumors by prolonging G1 progression. Mechanistically, sustained CDK4/6 blockade in drug-resistant cells reduces E2F transcription and delays G1/S via a noncanonical, posttranslational regulation of retinoblastoma protein (Rb). Durable suppression of both CDK2 activity and growth of drug-resistant cells requires co-administration of CDK2i with CDK4/6i. Moreover, cyclin E overexpression drives resistance to the combination of CDK4/6i and CDK2i. These findings elucidate how continued CDK4/6 blockade constrains resistant tumors and support clinical strategies that maintain CDK4/6i while selectively incorporating CDK2i to overcome resistance.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105465">DANCE provides an open-source and low-cost approach to quantify aggression and courtship in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Quantifying animal behavior is pivotal for identifying the neuronal and genetic mechanisms involved. Computational approaches have enabled automated analysis of complex behaviors such as aggression and courtship in <i>Drosophila</i>. However, existing approaches rely on rule-based algorithms and expensive hardware, limiting sensitivity to behavioral variations and accessibility. Here, we present the <i><span class="underline">D</span>rosophila</i> <span class="underline">A</span>ggression a<span class="underline">n</span>d <span class="underline">C</span>ourtship <span class="underline">E</span>valuator (DANCE), a low-cost, open-source platform that combines machine learning-based classifiers and inexpensive hardware to quantify aggression and courtship. DANCE consists of six novel behavioral classifiers trained using a supervised machine learning algorithm. DANCE classifiers address key limitations of rule-based algorithms, capturing dynamic behavioral variations more effectively. DANCE hardware is constructed using medicine blister packs and acrylic sheets, with recordings acquired using smartphones, making it affordable and accessible. Benchmarking demonstrated that DANCE hardware performs comparably to high-cost setups. We validated DANCE in diverse contexts, including social isolation vs. enrichment, which modulates aggression and courtship; RNAi-mediated downregulation of the neuropeptide Dsk; and optogenetic silencing of dopaminergic neurons, which promotes aggression. DANCE provides a cost-effective and portable solution for studying behaviors in resource-limited settings or near natural habitats. Its accessibility and robust performance democratize behavioral neuroscience, enabling rapid screening of genes and neuronal circuits underlying complex social behaviors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100129">Dual-modal metabolic analysis reveals hypothermia-reversible uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation in neonatal brain hypoxia-ischemia</a></h4>

              
                Hypoxia-ischemia (HI), which disrupts the oxygen supply-demand balance in the brain by impairing blood oxygen supply and the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO<sub>2</sub>), is a leading cause of neonatal brain injury. However, it is unclear how post-HI hypothermia helps to restore the balance, as cooling reduces CMRO<sub>2</sub>. Also, how transient HI leads to secondary energy failure (SEF) in neonatal brains remains elusive. Using photoacoustic microscopy, we examined the effects of HI on CMRO<sub>2</sub> in awake 10-day-old mice, supplemented by bioenergetic analysis of purified cortical mitochondria. Our results show that while HI suppresses ipsilateral CMRO<sub>2</sub>, it sparks a prolonged CMRO<sub>2</sub>-surge post-HI, associated with increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption, superoxide emission, and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential necessary for ATP synthesis—indicating oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) uncoupling. Post-HI hypothermia prevents the CMRO<sub>2</sub>-surge by constraining oxygen extraction fraction, reduces mitochondrial oxidative stress, and maintains ATP and N-acetylaspartate levels, resulting in attenuated infarction at 24 hr post-HI. Our findings suggest that OXPHOS-uncoupling induced by the post-HI CMRO<sub>2</sub>-surge underlies SEF and blocking the surge is a key mechanism of hypothermia protection. Also, our study highlights the potential of optical CMRO<sub>2</sub> measurements for detecting neonatal HI brain injury and guiding the titration of therapeutic hypothermia at the bedside.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103542">A system for functional studies of the major virulence factor of malaria parasites</a></h4>

              
                PfEMP1 is a variable antigen displayed on erythrocytes infected with the malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>. PfEMP1 mediates binding of the infected cell to the endothelium of blood vessels, a cause of severe malaria. Each parasite encodes ~60 different PfEMP1 variants but only one is expressed at a time. Switching between variants underlies immune evasion in the host and variant-specific severity of disease. PfEMP1 is difficult to study due to expression heterogeneity between parasites which also renders genetic modification approaches ineffective. Here, we used selection-linked integration (SLI) to generate parasites all expressing the same PfEMP1 variant and genome edit the expressed locus. Moving this system from the reference strain 3D7 to IT4 resulted in PfEMP1 expressor parasites with effective receptor binding capacities. We also introduce a second version of SLI (SLI2) to introduce additional genome edits. Using these systems, we study PfEMP1 trafficking, generate cell lines binding to the most common endothelial receptors, survey the protein environment from functional PfEMP1 in the host cell, and identify new proteins needed for PfEMP1-mediated sequestration. These findings show the usefulness of the system to study the key virulence factor of malaria parasites.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107138">Morphogenesis and morphometry of brain folding patterns across species</a></h4>

              
                Evolutionary adaptations associated with the formation of a folded cortex in many mammalian brains are thought to be a critical specialization associated with higher cognitive function. The dramatic surface expansion and highly convoluted folding of the cortex during early development is a theme with variations that suggest the need for a comparative study of cortical gyrification. Here, we use a combination of physical experiments using gels, computational morphogenesis, and geometric morphometrics to study the folding of brains across different species. Starting with magnetic resonance images of brains of a newborn ferret, a fetal macaque, and a fetal human, we construct two-layer physical gel brain models that swell superficially in a solvent, leading to folding patterns similar to those seen in vivo. We then adopt a three-dimensional continuum model based on differential growth to simulate cortical folding in silico. Finally, we deploy a comparative morphometric analysis of the in vivo, in vitro, and in silico surface buckling patterns across species. Our study shows that a simple mechanical instability driven by differential growth suffices to explain cortical folding and suggests that variations in the tangential growth and different initial geometries are sufficient to explain the differences in cortical folding across species.

                Loss-of-function mutations in Progranulin (GRN) cause neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) and hereditary frontotemporal dementia, presumably through lysosomal dysfunction. The effect of progranulin deficiency on cell type-specific lysosomal composition in the mammalian brain has not been examined. We used cell type-specific LysoIP to perform tandem-mass-tag mass-spectrometry and detected distinct aberrant proteomic signatures in progranulin-deficient astrocytes, neurons, and microglia, indicating cell type-specific dysregulation of key lysosomal proteins with crucial functions in sphingolipid metabolism and lysosome organization. These proteins markedly differed from progranulin-deficient RNAseq data sets, suggesting progranulin regulates lysosomal composition through post-translational mechanisms including the sorting of nascent proteins to the lysosome. Validation experiments confirmed that Mfsd8 and Ppt1, proteins whose mutation on their own cause NCL, were essentially absent from progranulin-deficient neuronal and microglial lysosomes, respectively. Our findings suggest that progranulin may function as an essential hub protein during endolysosomal sorting and highlight the necessity of restoring stoichiometric levels of progranulin expression in the secretory pathway for the development of effective therapeutic strategies.

Recent evidence indicates that the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) antagonist pimavanserin reduces tic severity and improves quality of life, yet its mechanism of action in TS remains unclear. Here, we combine postmortem human and preclinical approaches to gain insight into the role of 5-HT2ARs in TS. Western-blot analyses of postmortem prefrontal cortex (PFC) samples obtained from individuals with TS revealed a pronounced, male-specific elevation of 5-HT2AR protein levels in Brodmann Area (BA) 10. We then tested pimavanserin and the selective 5-HT2AR antagonist volinanserin in two mouse models of TS: D1CT-7 transgenic mice and mice with early-life depletion of striatal cholinergic interneurons. Systemic administration of pimavanserin (1-2 mg/kg, IP) or volinanserin (0.1-0.3 mg/kg, IP) robustly reduced tic-like movements and stereotypies in both models. Local infusion of pimavanserin into the medial PFC, but not the dorsal striatum, recapitulated these effects, indicating a cortical locus of action. Pimavanserin also reduced resident-intruder aggression, but not locomotion or anxiety-like behavior. Together, these findings identify elevated prefrontal 5-HT2ARs as a key mechanistic contributor to TS and a promising therapeutic target for individuals with TS and pathological aggression.

">Chemogenetic activation of hippocampal area CA2 promotes acute and chronic seizures in a mouse model of epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Pyramidal cells (PCs) of hippocampal area CA2 exhibit increased excitability in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and in mouse models of TLE. In epileptic mice, selective inhibition of CA2 PCs reduces chronic seizures. Here we asked if activating CA2 PCs increases seizures. Mice expressing Cre recombinase in CA2 PCs (Amigo2-Cre mice) were injected with the convulsant pilocarpine to induce a period of severe seizures (status epilepticus, SE), which leads to chronic seizures after 3-4 weeks (epilepsy). Epileptic mice were injected with a Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) to express an excitatory designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug (eDREADD; hM3Dq) in dorsal CA2 bilaterally and implanted with subdural EEG electrodes. After recovery, mice were recorded continuously using video and EEG for 6 weeks, 3 weeks with drinking water containing the eDREADD activator clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) and 3 weeks without CNO. CA2 activation with CNO caused a significant increase in seizure frequency and duration. Seizures occurred in clusters (many seizures per day over several consecutive days) and mice given water with CNO had a greater maximum number of seizures per day during a cluster compared to water without CNO. CNO had no significant effect in control mice. In naive Amigo2-Cre mice expressing hM3Dq, pre-treatment with CNO before pilocarpine administration shortened the latency to SE and increased EEG power at the start of SE. Taken together with prior findings, the results suggest that CA2 is a control point for regulating seizures in the pilocarpine mouse model of TLE.

">Altered aperiodic EEG spectral power during speech perception task is associated with verbal communication in youths with Autism Spectrum Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Most children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have co-occurring language impairment, but its neural mechanisms are not well known. Excitation (E) / inhibition (I) imbalance is considered as a key neurobiological mechanism of ASD, and several electroencephalography (EEG)-based E/I balance metrics have been proposed in the previous studies. The goal of the present research was to focus on these metrics abstracted from the speech perception task to investigate their relation to language/communication in autistic youths. We used a high-density 128-channel EEG to register neural responses during speech perception task in the sex- and age-matched groups of youths with ASD (N = 162) and typically developing (TD) controls (N = 144), aged 7-18 years old. The results revealed alterations in the E/I measures in the ASD group, pointing to a higher level of excitation or neural "noise" in the cortex as well as broadband reduction of spectral power during speech perception. A greater neural "noise" reflected in the reduction of aperiodic exponent and offset was associated with lower verbal communication skills in youths with ASD. The findings suggested that the higher "noisiness" in the cortical systems may be a relevant marker to monitor in relation to language/communication in ASD.

">Single-cell atlas of the developing Down syndrome brain cortex</a></h4>

              
                Down syndrome (DS), caused by trisomy of chromosome 21, is the leading genetic cause of intellectual disability, yet the mechanisms disrupting fetal brain development remain unclear. We performed single cell transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiling of approximately 250,000 cells from 15 DS and 15 control human fetal cortices (10 to 20 weeks post-conception). Our analysis revealed a subtype-specific reduction in RORB/FOXP1 expressing excitatory neurons and widespread disruption of neurodevelopmental transcriptional programs. Chromosome 21 transcription factors BACH1, PKNOX1, and GABPA emerged as dosage-sensitive hubs regulating genes linked to intellectual disability. Antisense oligonucleotide mediated normalization of these factors in human neural progenitors in vitro partially rescued target gene expression. Benchmarking a humanized in vivo model captured additional molecular and cellular signatures of DS, complementing the in vitro model. Together, this resource defines the gene regulatory landscape underlying cortical development in DS and highlights candidate molecular targets and preclinical models for further investigation.

">A mouse model of CHCHD10 p.R15L familial ALS presents mild, age-related motor neuron degeneration without protein instability or mitochondrial dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the mitochondrial protein CHCHD10 (D10) cause a spectrum of hereditary neurodegenerative disorders. Among these, the p.R15L variant is linked to a slowly progressive, late-onset familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with unclear pathogenic mechanisms. To better understand this, we investigated a knock-in (KI) mouse model carrying the p.R15L mutation in the endogenous protein. Unlike previously described mutant D10 KI models, p.R15L KI mice exhibited normal D10 protein levels, with no evidence of large protein aggregates. Mitochondrial respiration and hydrogen peroxide emission in mitochondria isolated from muscle and brain were unaltered. Similarly, fibroblasts from human p.R15L carriers exhibited normal D10 levels and unchanged oxidative phosphorylation function. Histochemical analyses of p.R15L KI muscle revealed mild increases in mitochondrial enzymatic activity in a subset of muscle fibers and muscle transcriptomics showed elevated expression of PGC-1, suggesting enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis. p.R15L KI mice developed subtle, late-onset phenotypes, including reduced body weight and motor activity and increased anxiety-like behavior. Importantly, in aged mice electrophysiological studies demonstrated decreased amplitude of the compound muscle action potential, commensurate with a moderate loss of spinal cord motor neurons and elevated serum neurofilament light levels, indicative of neurodegeneration. Together, these results indicate that the p.R15L mutation produces a mild, late-onset motor neuron phenotype in mice, partially recapitulating the human disease, without mitochondrial functional or morphological alterations. The findings indicate that p.R15L D10 selectively impairs mouse motor neurons through a gain-of-function mechanism, providing a genetically accurate yet mild in vivo model of familial ALS.

">GM1-oligosaccharide rescues rotenone-impaired neuronal polarization through RhoA/ROCK modulation and mitochondrial protection</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal polarization is a fundamental process in the formation of functional neural circuits, relying on the precise coordination between cytoskeletal regulatory signals and mechanisms that sustain cellular integrity. Disruption of these processes compromises neuronal differentiation and survival, and various neurotoxic compounds, including certain pesticides, have been associated with such dysfunctions. In this context, identifying molecules that counteract these detrimental effects is of significant therapeutic interest. Neuronal polarization is essential for the establishment of functional neural circuits and relies on coordinated regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics, RhoA/ROCK signaling, and mitochondrial function. Here, we investigated the neuroprotective and neurorestorative potential of the ganglioside GM1 and its oligosaccharide derivative, osGM1, in primary hippocampal pyramidal neurons exposed to the mitochondrial neurotoxin rotenone. Rotenone induced a marked arrest of neuronal development, impaired axonal elongation, and disrupted mitochondrial organization and membrane potential. Both GM1 and osGM1 promoted recovery of neuronal polarity and axonal growth, exerting protective and restorative effects even under continuous toxin exposure, with osGM1 showing superior efficacy. Notably, osGM1 also reversed axonal growth deficits caused by pathological actin stabilization. Mechanistically, osGM1 normalized rotenone-induced hyperactivation of the RhoA/ROCK pathway without altering basal signaling and partially restored mitochondrial network integrity and function. Collectively, these findings identify osGM1 as a multi-target modulator of cytoskeletal and mitochondrial dysfunction and support its translational potential as a therapeutic strategy to counteract neurotoxin-induced neuronal damage.

">Categorical rhythmic priors in macaques</a></h4>

              
                Rhythmic ability is a universal aspect of human cultures and sets the basis for musical rhythm perception and synchronization. While humans can synchronize movements to complex rhythms, it is unclear whether this capability extends to our primate ancestors. In this study, we explore whether primates can synchronize to complex rhythms and acquire rhythmic representations with generalizability akin to humans. Using controlled behavioral experiments, we provide evidence that monkeys not only can synchronize to short-long or long-short rhythms but also learn representations that generalize across a wide range of rhythm ratios and total durations. These results indicate ability to flexibly represent ratios within a relative timing framework is not exclusive to humans, but it is also present in monkeys. In addition, the produced intervals show a bias towards rhythmic categories. Notably, in an iterative tapping task, macaques and humans showed large priors for isochrony and integer ratios (2:1, 3:1). These results demonstrate a common biological foundation for rhythm synchronization in primates, extending our understanding of the shared cognitive mechanisms between primates and humans, and highlight the enormous potential of using monkeys to study the neurophysiological basis of complex rhythm perception.

">Investigating the mechanisms underlying saccade generation in the frontal eye fields using multi-site microstimulation</a></h4>

              
                The frontal eye field (FEF), a region of frontal cortex, has long been associated with the cortical control of eye movements. Classically, saccades can be reliably evoked by delivering low-intensity electrical microstimulation to the FEF. Although this makes clear the importance of FEF in the descending control of eye movements, the way in which population activity in the FEF is integrated by downstream regions to generate a motor command remains a mystery. To probe these mechanisms, we used a 16-channel microelectrode array to deliver microstimulation to the FEF of two awake, behaving monkeys. First, we found that larger current intensities were required to evoke changes in saccade direction relative to saccade amplitude when single-site saccades were evoked by stimulating a single contact on the array. Second, when stimulating two contacts simultaneously to investigate how population activity in the FEF is read out, a new polar average model more accurately predicted the amplitude and direction of dual-site saccades than traditional vector sum and vector average models. Using preexisting data from the superior colliculus (SC), we found that although the polar average model was more accurate at predicting saccade amplitude in the SC, it was no more accurate than traditional models at predicting saccade direction. Finally, when stimulating two contacts in FEF simultaneously with unequal current intensities, model accuracy depended on the amplitude of the saccades evoked by stimulating each individual site alone, suggesting that the brain may flexibly combine amplitude and direction information from the FEF to generate saccadic plans.

">Intensity-dependent corticospinal facilitation by repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation: Evidence for a major contribution of group I afferents</a></h4>

              
                Background: Repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation (PMS) is increasingly used in neurorehabilitation, yet the optimal stimulation intensity for inducing corticospinal facilitation and the underlying afferent mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated the intensity-dependent effects of repetitive PMS on corticospinal excitability and single motor unit responses, and tested group I afferent contribution. Methods: Healthy participants received repetitive PMS (25 Hz; 2-s ON/2-s OFF) over the extensor carpi radialis (ECR) in a crossover design at 0.9x motor threshold (MT), 1.2xMT, and high intensity sufficient to induce maximal wrist dorsiflexion (mean 1.8xMT). Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation were recorded from the ECR and flexor carpi radialis (FCR) before and during the intervention (total 15 min). The lasting effects were assessed after 9 min of high-intensity PMS for 50 min. To examine group I afferent contribution, the same high-intensity protocol was applied during upper-arm ischemia after reducing the ECR H-reflex to <10% of baseline. Sensory-motor input characteristics across stimulation intensities were compared using post-stimulus time histograms of ECR single motor unit firings during weak voluntary contraction. Results: High-intensity PMS significantly increased ECR MEPs after 9 min of intervention, whereas 1.2xMT of PMS required 15 min to induce a marked effect. PMS at 0.9xMT did not induce significant MEP changes. Across all intensities, the FCR MEPs remained unaltered. ECR MEPs remained markedly elevated for up to 30 min after 9 min of high-intensity PMS. In contrast, PMS delivered during ischemia produced no MEP enhancement. The motor unit analysis revealed that suprathreshold PMS elicited an early peak in firing probability--consistent with monosynaptic Ia excitation--whose amplitude increased with stimulation intensity, whereas PMS at 0.9xMT produced no discernible peak. Conclusions: Repetitive PMS above MT facilitates corticospinal excitability in an intensity-dependent manner. Facilitation was abolished during ischemia. Together with the presence of a short-latency peak in motor unit firing via a monosynaptic pathway, this finding supports a major contribution of large-diameter muscle afferents, with a substantial Ia component, to PMS-induced corticospinal facilitation.

">Transcriptional Changes Fade Prior to Long-Term Memory for Sensitization of the Aplysia Siphon-Withdrawal Reflex</a></h4>

              
                Forming a long-term memory requires changes in neuronal transcription. What happens, though, as the memory is forgotten? And how does the transcriptional state relate to the maintenance and recall of the long-term memory? To answer these questions we have been systematically tracing the time-course of transcriptional changes evoked by long-term sensitization in the marine mollusk Aplysia californica. Our approach captures transcriptional changes in neurons of known behavioral relevance using a within-subjects design, delineating patterns of transcriptional change that are comprehensive and reproducible. We have previously reported that within 1 day of long-term sensitization training there is a widespread transcriptional response involving robust changes in over 5% of tested transcripts (1,252 of ~22k; Conte, 2017). Within 1 week, however, memory strength fades and nearly all transcriptional changes relapse to baseline (Perez, 2018). Here we report microarray analysis (N = 16) of transcriptional changes 5 days post-learning, a time-point when memory strength has weakened but is still robust. Remarkably, we find that at this intermediate behavioral stage nearly all transcriptional changes have fully decayed, even in subsets of animals that have shown very little forgetting. Thus, most transcriptional changes seem to decay more rapidly than memory expression. We discuss several possible ways that memory expression could become decoupled from detectable transcriptional regulation.

">CaMPARI2 Enables Stimulus-Locked Whole-Brain Activity Mapping at Cellular Resolution in Unrestrained Larval Zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Visualizing active neurons and circuits in vivo is critical for investigating the neural activity that underlies behavior. While several established methodologies are available to achieve this end in larval zebrafish, they are limited by the scale of tissue visualization, temporal resolution, need to restrain larvae, and/or accessibility of necessary instruments. Here, we establish a pipeline for the visualization and quantification of spatiotemporally precise whole-brain neural activity in larval zebrafish using CaMPARI2, a genetically encoded calcium indicator. Using temporally specific photoconverting UV light exposures, we capture whole-brain "snapshots" of neural activity time-locked to stimuli during unrestrained larval behavior. We optimize experimental conditions for establishing sub-second neuronal activity changes across acoustically-evoked behavioral paradigms spanning minutes to hours. We then leverage this system to pinpoint brain-wide neural activity changes during nonassociative habituation learning, observing distinct activity signatures in the subpallium, preoptic area, and habenulae that are altered through pharmacological disruption of habituation learning. This approach effectively complements the temporal precision achievable through post hoc activity detection methods and expands the accessibility of large-scale behavioral circuit dissection beyond highly specialized real-time volumetric imaging equipment.

">Slow Spindle Trains During Daytime Naps are Associated with Improved Declarative Memory Consolidation</a></h4>

              
                Memory consolidation refers to the process by which newly encoded memories are strengthened and retained over time, and ample evidence indicates that sleep supports this process for both procedural and declarative memories. Although sleep spindles during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep have been associated to consolidation, it remains unclear whether all spindle types contribute equally. Spindles vary in frequency and topography - slow spindles (<=12.5Hz) predominating over frontal regions, whereas fast spindles (>12.5Hz) peak parietally - and recent work suggests that procedural memory consolidation during overnight sleep is related to the temporal organization of spindles in trains (i.e., events occurring <6s apart). Here we investigated whether a similar mechanism operates for declarative memory during daytime naps. Participants were assigned to a Nap (N=23) or No-Nap (N=15) group, and completed an object-spatial location task involving 36 item-location associations. Memory was assessed immediately after learning and again following a 90-minute nap or an equivalent wake period. Results showed that the Nap group exhibited significantly better delayed memory, as measured by combined recall-recognition score, and a greater proportion of participants maintained or improved their performance. In the Nap group, memory performance correlated with local spindle density at frontal and parietal sites, and, critically, with the proportion of slow spindles clustered in trains during NREM2. These findings suggest the temporal organization of slow spindles into clusters support declarative memory consolidation, pointing to a shared spindle-based mechanism across domains.

">The neural correlates of parallel and serial search</a></h4>

              
                For almost half a century, target distractor similarity has been known to induce different visual search modes. When a target is highly salient, it can pop out, suggesting parallel processing of all items irrespective of set size. By contrast, high similarity among items requires item-by-item comparison with an attentional template, a characteristic of serial search. Despite this long-standing distinction, little is known about the neural correlates of search modes, as typical differences in visual displays confound interpretation. Here, we contrasted the neural correlates of serial and parallel search under visually identical displays. Across distinct blocks, we biased 24 participants (21 female) toward parallel or serial search by varying target distractor similarity, thereby directing attentional focus toward a single feature or conjunction. Embedded among inducer trials, test trials were visually identical across all blocks and afforded both parallel and serial search. Behavioral analyses confirmed successful induction of distinct search modes during test trials. EEG decoding reliably discriminated search modes and these neural patterns generalized across inducer and test trials. Attentional deployment toward the target differed across search modes, revealing topographical differences in target location representations. The strength of target-location representations correlated with response times, indicating that during parallel test trials, participants switched search strategies when the target was not detected early. Moreover, target representations diverged between search modes: a temporally stable pattern emerged during serial search, suggesting reliance on working memory, whereas parallel search was characterized by more dynamic representations, likely reflecting prioritization of the relevant feature. These findings demonstrate that search history shapes search mode, giving rise to clearly distinct neural dynamics even under visually identical stimulation.

">The critical roaming hypothesis: arousal-driven transitions across critical lines reproduce human functional connectivity dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Ongoing brain activity displays rich temporal variability associated with efficient cognition, with functional connectivity (FC) continually reconfiguring over time. The resulting functional connectivity dynamics (FCD) specifically show complex, fat-tailed statistics that alternate between persistent epochs and faster reconfiguration transients. While nonlinear whole-brain models tuned nearby a critical point have reproduced some aspects of FCD, they fall short of capturing its full temporal complexity. We propose that slow fluctuations in arousal offer a biologically plausible mechanism for exploring critical regimes in large-scale brain dynamics and thus enrich FCD. Using a connectome-based model of coupled cortical populations, we identified phase boundaries where system dynamics transition between regimes of faster or slower FCD. We then phenomenologically incorporated arousal changes, modeling them as stochastic fluctuations in key parameters such as cortical excitability, input gain, and noise amplitude. This non-autonomous formulation enables the system to roam dynamically across regime boundaries, flexibly tuning its distance from critical transition lines and producing intermittent transitions that mirror the stochastic evolution observed in empirical FCD. Fitting these models to human resting-state fMRI and performing model comparison, we find that arousal-driven models more accurately reproduce the distinctive quantitative features of FCD with the greatest improvements coming from the previously poorly accounted fat-tailed portions of the distributions. Together, these results suggest that arousal fluctuations - likely mediated by changes in neuromodulatory tone-- shape the brain's attractor landscape over time, expanding the repertoire of accessible functional network states and providing a mechanistic basis for the complexity of spontaneous functional dynamics.

">Injury-induced CTE-like pathology emerges in a human multicellular in vitro brain model and reveals mitochondrial and neurovascular regulation.</a></h4>

              
                Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease linked to repetitive mild head impacts, but no human-based experimental system exists to study injury-induced CTE-like pathology. Here, we establish a long-lived, human multicellular in vitro brain platform in which controlled mechanical injury induces key cellular features of CTE-like pathology. Injured cultures developed persistent tau phosphorylation, axonal degeneration, chronic inflammation, and metabolic dysfunction without widespread neuronal loss, consistent with progressive pathology rather than acute toxicity. To assess physiological relevance, we integrated transcriptomic profiles from the model with postmortem human CTE brain datasets. This analysis revealed striking convergence at the level of disease-associated modules and pathways, with endothelial cells emerging as critical contributors to CTE-like transcriptional programs. Using this human-based system, we further identified delayed mitochondrial dysfunction as a prominent and sustained feature of injury-induced pathology. Together, these findings establish the first human in vitro platform for studying injury-induced CTE-like pathology and identify neurovascular and mitochondrial regulation as central components of chronic neurodegeneration following repetitive mild brain injury.

">Whole-Brain Convergence of Real-World Visual Expertise beyond Faces: Meta-Analytic Evidence for Core-Adaptive Neural Architecture</a></h4>

              
                Visual expertise-the ability to discriminate highly similar exemplars quickly and accurately within a category-supports skilled performance across real-world domains and is supported by distributed neural systems. We focus on non-face expertise to test cross-domain convergence in acquired real-world visual skills, treating faces separately because socially embedded, sensitive-period-constrained processing could blur this inference. It remains unresolved whether non-face expertise across heterogeneous domains converges on a shared, domain-general whole-brain architecture, or instead recruits domain-contingent neural configurations that vary with task and stimulus demands. We conducted a coordinate-based meta-analysis of 22 task-fMRI studies spanning 11 real-world non-face expertise domains (579 participants, 210 peak-activation foci). Primary analysis revealed a robust, right-lateralized parieto-temporo-occipital circuit centered on the middle occipital gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, angular gyrus and adjoining inferior parietal lobule. We propose that this circuit constitutes a domain-general neural core that integrates fine-grained visual features with semantic associations while supporting attention-guided recognition of visually similar objects in expert performance. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses uncovered a complementary adaptive component, the engagement of which varied systematically with representational and contextual factors. Pictorial stimuli and expert-novice contrasts reliably strengthened recruitment of the right-hemisphere core, whereas symbolic stimuli engagement toward left temporal regions while selectively re-engaging right-core nodes. In addition, male-skewed samples showed attenuated left-hemisphere activation. Together, these findings delineate a stable right-hemisphere neural scaffold underlying non-face visual expertise, flexibly supplemented by left-hemisphere systems as a function of stimulus format, task demands, and demographic context, providing a whole-brain reference framework for future studies.

">Sleep-Wake Transitions Are Impaired in the AppNL-G-FMouse Model of Early Onset Alzheimers Disease</a></h4>

              
                Poor sleep quality and reduced sleep duration are associated with Alzheimers disease (AD)-related {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) pathologies. We conducted two studies of sleep/wake, activity and body temperature in AppNL-G-F mice, a strain that exhibits three mutations in the human App gene associated with elevated risk for early onset AD. First, AppNL-G-F mice were compared to wildtype (WT) littermates at 14-18 and 18-22 months of age and, at both ages, were found to exhibit partial insomnia with more Wake and less NREM and REM sleep than WT littermates. This long wake/short sleep phenotype was evident during the dark phase at 14-18 months but occurred in both the light and dark phases at 18-22 months. AppNL-G-F mice had fewer short (<60 sec) and more long (>260 sec) Wake bouts and were hyperactive at 18-22 months, which undoubtedly contributed to the increased Wake/reduced sleep. Despite this partial insomnia phenotype, AppNL-G-F mice were no sleepier than WT mice and the sleep homeostat was functional in both strains. In the second study, sex differences in these parameters were assessed at 18-24 months. Partial insomnia was evident in both sexes of AppNL-G-F mice but was clearly stronger in females. Wake and REM sleep bout durations were longer in both sexes of AppNL-G-F mice than in WT littermates. EEG spectral power during NREM sleep was reduced in female AppNL-G-F mice between 4.88-10.50 Hz compared to WT mice whereas, during REM sleep, both male and female AppNL-G-F mice exhibited reduced spectral power in the theta range. These results suggest that A{beta} deposition may impair state transition mechanism(s) in AppNL-G-F mice and demonstrate that, as in human AD patients, female AppNL-G-F mice exhibit a stronger insomniac-like phenotype, thus supporting the use of this strain as a model to investigate interventions that mitigate AD burden during early disease stages.

">A multi-ring shifter network computes head direction in zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                From insects to fish to mammals, many species have an internal compass: a set of recurrently connected neurons that combine motor feedback, vestibular signals, and external cues to compute the animal's heading direction. Whether the underlying mechanism is universal across different species is unresolved. In Drosophila, for instance, the central complex contains three connected, yet anatomically separate, functional neuron rings. Two rings receive countervailing velocity signals that shift neuronal activity bumps around all three rings. An alternative, classical continuous-attractor model invokes only one ring but requires velocity-modulated synaptic connections. A single-ring compass has been discovered in the anterior hindbrain of zebrafish. Using theory and experiments, we find, however, that three rings, including two shifter rings, are intermingled on the same anatomical scaffold. Zebrafish and Drosophila, therefore, use the same basic compass mechanism, suggestive of convergent evolution.

">A CAR-T Cell-Based Strategy for Eliminating Pathogenic Microglia in ALS</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative diseases are defined by the propagation of neuroinflammation, driven in part by disease-associated microglia (DAM) that amplify inflammatory signaling and hasten neurodegeneration. Strategies to selectively eliminate DAM to attenuate disease progression remain elusive. Using existing datasets in combination with multiplexed immunofluorescence analysis of post-mortem ALS tissues, we identified the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) as a novel surface marker of DAM. uPAR protein is markedly elevated in IBA1/CD68 microglia within ALS-affected regions of both sporadic and familial cases, with negligible expression in unaffected areas or control tissues. These uPAR-high microglia drive neurite retraction in iPSC-derived neurons. To target these cells, we engineered 3rd-generation CAR-T cells expressing an anti-uPAR single-chain variable fragment, enabling specific recognition and elimination of uPAR-expressing microglia. Target specificity was assessed in human microglia C20 cells driven into a pathogenic state by poly(IC) or IFN{gamma} stimulation, which resulted in robust surface uPAR expression alongside phagocytic (CD68) and antigen-presenting (CD80) markers. uPAR-CAR-T cells induced antigen-dependent cytolysis of uPAR-high microglia, reducing their viability by over 80% while sparing resting microglia and neurons in a mixed culture system. These results position uPAR-directed CAR-T cells as a viable immunotherapeutic approach to selectively disrupt disease-amplifying microglial subsets and modify the trajectories of neuroinflammatory diseases.

">Astrocytic Cholesterol Fine-Tunes the Balance of Different Modes of Synaptic Exo- and Endocytosis</a></h4>

              
                Cholesterol is essential for organization of neurotransmitter release machinery, yet how it regulates the balance among different forms of synaptic exo- and endocytosis remains poorly understood. Moreover, which pre-synaptic processes rely on neuronal vs astrocyte-derived cholesterol is unknown. Using nanoscale-precision imaging of single-vesicle release in hippocampal synapses we demonstrate that astrocytic cholesterol is a critical determinant of both temporal and spatial aspects of presynaptic dynamics by differentially modulating the two main forms of synchronous release, uni-vesicular (UVR) and multi-vesicular (MVR), effectively fine-tuning their balance. Disruption of astrocytic cholesterol trafficking to neurons combined with its re-supplementation demonstrated that astrocyte-derived cholesterol is necessary and sufficient to determine the UVR/MVR balance. Moreover, astrocytic cholesterol determines the spatial distribution of vesicle release by modulating utilization of different release sites across the active zone. Astrocytic cholesterol also regulates the balance of the two main forms of single-vesicle endocytosis, fast and ultra-fast. These findings suggest that astrocytic cholesterol supply is a critical modulator of synaptic strength that fine-tunes the balance of different forms of synaptic vesicle exo- and endocytosis.

">Mathematics Anxiety Selectively Modulates Attentional and Memory-Related Neural Mechanisms During Numerical Cognition</a></h4>

              
                Mathematics achievement can be influenced by negative emotions and expectations related to numerical tasks. Individuals with high mathematics anxiety often show poorer numerical performance. This study investigated the neural mechanisms underlying different levels of numerical processing associated with mathematics anxiety using number line estimation and arithmetic verification tasks during fMRI. Participants were classified into high (n=22) and low (n=24) mathematics anxiety groups based on detailed screening prior to scanning. Trait and test anxiety were also assessed to capture broader anxiety-related characteristics. Before the fMRI session, participants completed assessments of calculation performance and digit span, and a mock MRI session was used to reduce scanner-related stress. Participants completed task and control conditions for each numerical task during fMRI. Neuroimaging findings were analyzed before and after statistically controlling for trait and test anxiety. Results showed that low mathematics anxiety was associated with greater frontal eye field activity during number-space mapping and stronger supramarginal gyrus activity during arithmetic computation compared with high mathematics anxiety. Controlling for general anxiety revealed a dissociation between mathematics anxiety specific and general anxiety related neural effects. Overall, mathematics anxiety selectively influenced attentional and memory mechanisms, whereas broader anxiety processes engaged distinct motor and cognitive systems.

">The role of structural heterogeneity in shaping whole-brain dynamics across scales</a></h4>

              
                The brain must rapidly and dynamically recruit the appropriate brain regions to respond to environmental changes. An extensive body of literature views the ability to spontaneously explore a rich repertoire of activity patterns, even during rest, as a correlate of the capacity to respond rapidly to internal fluctuations and external stimuli. Brain flexibility, defined as the number of unique patterns of activity explored, has been used to quantify the richness of resting-state dynamics. Beyond its theoretical relevance, brain flexibility successfully indexes pathological conditions such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, this approach is inherently global and provides no information about the contribution of each region to the flexibility of brain dynamics. Given the functional and structural heterogeneity of brain regions, we expect their roles in sustaining flexibility to be heterogeneous and related to regional structural properties. To investigate these hypotheses, we present the flexibility gradient (FG), which quantifies regional contributions to flexibility. To quantify FG across the brain, we employed three datasets spanning different recording techniques and a range of spatial and temporal scales. We used 47 MEG and 11 EEG recordings to access fast dynamics, while to investigate slower dynamics, we leveraged 77 fMRI recordings along with the corresponding tractographies. We found that FG is not homogeneously distributed, with associative regions contributing the most. The same gradient is evident within each hemisphere independently, and the structural properties of brain regions correlate with the FG. Our findings are stable across modalities and time scales.

">A convergent cortical scheme for visual scene segmentation</a></h4>

              
                Scene segmentation, a key step towards structured understanding of natural environments, entails a complementary set of computations. Instead of accessing these segmentation computations in isolation, we perceive the segregated object as a unified whole, but the neural basis supporting such a unitary percept remains unclear. We bridged this gap by showing a convergent coding scheme: an object-level additive code in the primary visual cortex, which serves as a spatial segmentation mask for the object. Across individual neurons, this code uniformly boosted their responses to the segmented object. In the population space, this code created an orthogonal representational geometry by perpendicularly displacing the neural manifold for image features, efficiently multiplexing both local and global information about the object. Computational modeling further revealed the utility and optimality of this convergent coding scheme, which effectively isolates objects in cluttered environments and in turn unclutters downstream object representations. Our findings reveal the computational logic of visual segmentation and call for a revision of the visual cortical hierarchy.

">Age-Related Changes to Olivocochlear Efferent Neurons in Mice with Pathological Hearing</a></h4>

              
                One of the fundamental features of age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is difficulty discriminating speech signals from background noise. In addition to protecting the ear from acoustic trauma, olivocochlear (OC) efferent neurons participate in signal discrimination by virtue of their inhibitory actions on auditory nerve firing. Given the time course of peripheral degeneration in ARHL, we sought to investigate the central degeneration of medial (MOC) and lateral (LOC) efferent neurons in mutant mice that exhibit genetic hearing loss or deafness at different ages. Tests of cochlear function were combined with anatomical and morphological quantification of changes to somatic number, morphology, and location of OC neurons. Neuronal tract tracing methods were employed to label OC neurons in 1-, 3-, and 6-month-old CBA/CaH mice with normal hearing; DBA/2J mice with progressive, high frequency hearing loss; and homozygous Shaker2 mice with congenital deafness. Deaf Shaker2-/- animals exhibited age-related atrophy and loss of MOCs, with contralateral MOCs more affected than ipsilateral MOCs, while LOCs were largely unaffected. No such OC degeneration was observed in DBA/2J mice, even after progressive elevation of low frequency auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) thresholds. Thus, OC efferent neurons can appear morphologically 'normal' in the complete absence of acoustic input in early life (as in deaf Shaker2-/- animals) and that the retention of these neurons is not affected by late onset high-frequency hearing loss observed in DBA/2J animals. Differential patterns of MOC neuron degeneration may affect functional plasticity of auditory brainstem feedback circuitry in ARHL.

                Axon collaterals of type 1 molecular layer interneurons (MLI1s) contribute to pinceaux that engulf the initial segments of Purkinje cell (PC) axons and generate extracellular signals that ephaptically inhibit PCs. Here we show that a remarkably large number of MLI1s (~50) contribute to each pinceau, and that this allows networks of synchronously firing MLI1s to use ephaptic signals to control the precise timing of PC firing in vivo.

">Organization of mouse prefrontal cortex subnetwork revealed by spatial single-cell multi-omic analysis of SPIDER-Seq</a></h4>

              
                Deciphering the connectome, anatomy, transcriptome and spatial-omics integrated multi-modal brain atlas and the underlying organization principles remains a great challenge. We developed a Single-cell Projectome-transcriptome In situ Deciphering Sequencing (SPIDER-Seq) technique by combining viral barcoding tracing with single-cell sequencing and spatial-omics. This empowers us to delineate a integrated single-cell spatial molecular, cellular, anatomic and projectomic atlas of mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC). The projectomic and transcriptomic cell clusters display distinct modular organization principles, but are coordinately configured in the PFC. The projection neurons gradiently occupied different territories in the PFC aligning with their wiring patterns. Importantly, they show higher co-projection probability to the downstream nuclei with reciprocal circuit connections. Moreover, we integrated projectomic atlas with their distinct spectrum of neurotransmitter/neuropeptide and the receptors-related gene profiles and depicted PFC neural signal transmission network. By which, we uncovered potential mechanisms underlying the complexity and specificity of neural transmission. Finally, leveraging machine learning, we predicted neuron projections with high accuracy by combining gene profiles and spatial information. As a proof of concept, we used this model to predict projections of fear recall engram neurons. This study facilitates our understanding of brain multi-modal network and neural computation.

">Dopamine Modulation of Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity for Spatio-Temporal Spike Pattern Detection in Single Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine (DA) is an important neuromodulator that has been suggested to play key roles in a range of neuropsychiatric disorders. However, its computational impact at the neural circuit level has not been elucidated. Here, we extended a spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP)-based single-neuron spatio-temporal pattern detection model by incorporating a DA input and DA-type STDP modulation. We analyzed the direct effect of the DA-type STDP curve and the effect of DA release. We found that the DA-type STDP curve accelerates learning but may promote coarse potentiation of the synaptic efficacy, which leads to false detections. It was also shown that DA can improve the pattern-detection performance up to a 44 percent success rate (2.44 times control) with no false detection, but a DA release with an excessive amount or with too short a delay induces false detection. These results suggest that DA can maintain the pattern detection ability only when released within a limited concentration and a sufficient delay.

">Oestradiol and Progesterone Variability in Adolescent Females: Associations with Brain Structure and Mental Health Problems</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Adolescent females are at increased risk for adverse mental health problems, and puberty is thought to be a critical factor. Pubertal onset involves substantial variability in oestradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4), yet the impact of these hormone dynamics remains unclear. We investigated whether within-individual E2 and P4 variability across one month relates to brain structure and mental health problems in adolescent females. Methods: Participants were 147 females (11 to 17 years) from the community-based, cross-sectional Puberty and NeuroDevelopment in Adolescents (PANDA) study in Australia. Salivary E2 and P4 were collected weekly for one month, with variability indexed as within-subject standard deviation. Structural MRI was acquired on the final sampling day. Mental health problems were assessed via self- and parent-report. Linear regression and mediation analyses tested associations between hormone variability, brain structure, and mental health, adjusting for demographics. Results: Greater P4 variability was associated with smaller left thalamus volume (d = -0.26, pFDR = 0.031). Higher E2 variability was associated with fewer anxiety (d = -0.170, pFDR = 0.043) and depressive symptoms (d = -0.179, pFDR = 0.036), lower emotion dysregulation (d = -0.179, pFDR = 0.036), and smaller right hippocampus volume in pre-menarchal adolescents (d = -0.192, p = 0.02). Weekly reductions in E2 predicted lower positive affect (d = 0.084, p = 0.048). Conclusion: These findings indicate that hormone variability may meaningfully shape brain and behavioural development in adolescent girls differently from hormone-related transitions in adulthood. Larger, replicable, and longer-term studies are needed to confirm these patterns.

">FAM84B facilitates tau propagation via RYR3-mediated exocytosis in response to neuroinflammation</a></h4>

              
                The increasing prevalence of dementia underscores the pressing need for effective therapeutic interventions. Despite extensive research into A{beta}, the limited efficacy of existing treatment modalities necessitates a paradigm shift toward tau pathology including tau propagation to slow dementia progression. Here, we identified a novel protein, FAM84B (also known as LRATD2), involved in tau propagation. Elevated FAM84B levels were detected in the postmortem cortex, cerebrospinal fluid, and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neurons of patients with tauopathy. FAM84B facilitates tau secretion through exosome assembly and RYR3-mediated exocytosis, followed by exosomal uptake into neighboring cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, thereby driving tau propagation. We confirmed that neuroinflammation induced by heightened STAT3 activity and cytokine treatment upregulated FAM84B expression, stimulating tau propagation, as evidenced by reduced propagation upon RYR3 inhibition. These findings provide invaluable insights into potential avenues for targeting tau propagation to ameliorate disease progression in tauopathies.

                Background Identity politics is one of political terminology which is subjected to continuous and increasingly contested conceptualization and use. Moreover, identity exists in all social level starting for individual to international level, which makes identity a multi-layer concept. There has been a great deal of identity-based terminological distortion and misconception in Ethiopian political discourses and practice since its formation in the modern form. One of the primary challenges in Ethiopian present political discourse is misconception, complexity, and contradiction between ethnic identity (የብሄር ማንነት) and civic identity or citizenship (የዜግነት ማንነት), which must be addressed in Ethiopian political discourse. Methods In this paper, critical post-modernism research philosophy and Dialectical Method is used to analyze the rotation of contradiction between Pan-Ethiopianism and Pan-ethnic nationalism. The narrative analysis is used to make a critical investigation of the vicious cycle unending dialectics of identity politics in Ethiopia. Discussion The current political situation is an indication of unending dialectics of Ethiopian politics. The existing politics of ethnic identity and citizenship indicate unending dialectic of political friction with the rotation of thesis and anti-thesis which left the state building projection of country incomplete and weak dialectical process. Wrong policy and political responses of successive regime to the nationality questions (quests for power sharing and autonomous self-government) resulted in the sustained and vicious circle of conflict. Conclusion Generally, it is argued that prescription of one side of nationalism at the expense of the other will never resolve the political crisis of the country. Therefore, it is recommended that both integrationist and accommodationist institutional design and multinational democratic federalism should be implemented effectively to cope with the salience of identity politics in the country.

                Background This bibliometric analysis evaluates health-related research in Public Health, Environmental Health, and Occupational Health (PHEOH) journals indexed in Scopus, categorized by Scimago quartiles (Q1–Q4) from 2016 to 2024. The study aims to identify trends, research productivity, and thematic priorities across these journals. Methods From 654 eligible journals, 100 (25 per quartile) were randomly selected. A total of 70,580 documents were retrieved from Scopus and analysed using Microsoft Excel and VOSviewer (v.1.6.20). Co-occurrence analysis of author and indexed keywords was performed separately for each quartile to identify research hotspots, thematic clusters, and trends over time. Results Q1 journals contributed the highest proportion of publications (37.7%), followed by Q2 (25.4%), Q4 (22.1%), and Q3 (14.8%). The United States dominated output in Q1–Q3 journals, whereas Pakistan led in Q4. Across all quartiles, “COVID-19” was the most frequent and highly connected author keyword, followed by mental health, SARS-CoV-2, and child-related research. Indexed keyword analysis ranked “humans” highest in every quartile. Topics related to SARS-CoV-2 and mental health received the highest average citations. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic significantly influenced the research agenda of Public, Environmental, and Occupational Health journals between 2016 and 2024, particularly in higher-quartile outlets. The findings reveal persistent disparities in productivity across journal tiers and geographic regions.

                The increasing need for natural and safe food preservatives has triggered interest in bacteriocins (antimicrobial peptides) produced by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as viable alternatives to chemical preservatives. This study aimed to optimize bacteriocin production from LAB isolated from Nigerian fermented foods and to evaluate its effectiveness in extending the shelf life of selected fruit juices. A total of 33 LAB strains were isolated from Nigerian local fermented foods (iru, fufu, and ogi) using MRS agar, screened for antibacterial activity against selected foodborne pathogens, and characterized using 16S rRNA sequencing. Five LAB strains were identified: Lactobacillus plantarum (PV937062, PV937063, PV937065), Lactobacillus paracasei (PV937064), and Lactobacillus acidophilus (PV937061). The agar well diffusion method was used to optimize the effects of culture age, pH, temperature, organic solvents, ultraviolet radiation, protease treatment, and storage conditions on the bacteriocin activity. This study demonstrated that optimized bacteriocins by LAB from Nigerian fermented food has the potential to be an effective food preservative by extending the shelf life of fruit juices as a safe and environmentally friendly alternative to synthetic preservatives to enhance food safety and quality.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>I recount the personal and professional circumstances that contributed to recognizing overdispersion in the discharge of hippocampal place cells. Place cell overdispersion describes the general fact that when a rodent passes through the cell's place field, action potential discharge is often surprisingly excessive or inadequate relative to expectations from the cell's firing rate map. These large deviations from place tuning are far beyond what random noise can explain. Instead, overdispersion indicates that there are additional extrapositional signals in place cell discharge, not merely place. I discuss that the finding might have been initially ignored because we did not identify a specific source of extrapositional information, and that today many have been identified. The narrative focuses on the overall importance of recognizing that there must be extrapositional signals (i.e., mixed selectivity) to the intellectual evolution of my research program.</p>

                Background High-need, high-cost inpatient cases represent a small proportion of hospital admissions yet account for a disproportionately large share of hospital expenditures. Understanding the factors that influence hospitals’ ability to recover costs from these cases is essential for improving financial performance and supporting sustainable healthcare financing. This study investigates how patient profile, patient care characteristics, and treatment-related factors shape the cost recovery rate of high-need, high-cost inpatient cases in Indonesian hospitals. Methods The study analyzed 121,482 inpatient cases from two public and two private hospitals between 2017 and 2020. All cases were covered under the National Health Insurance scheme. The analysis focused on the highest twenty-five percent of inpatient cases based on cost, representing approximately sixty percent of total inpatient expenditure. Cost recovery rate was defined as the ratio of reimbursement fee to hospital claim for each inpatient case. Multiple regression and decision tree analyses were used to identify factors associated with variations in cost recovery. Results Patient characteristics such as age and sex showed limited influence on cost recovery. In contrast, several patient care characteristics and treatment-related factors demonstrated substantial effects. Discharge type, severity level, and medical intervention category emerged as the most influential determinants of cost recovery among high-need, high-cost patients. Length of stay, care class, and use of intensive care also contributed to explaining variation but to a lesser extent. Conclusions The findings indicate that cost recovery is driven primarily by treatment complexity and patient care characteristics rather than patient demographic factors. Hospitals may enhance cost recovery for high-need, high-cost cases by strengthening discharge management, improving claim documentation for complex interventions, and standardizing care processes through structured clinical pathways. These measures can help improve financial performance while supporting more efficient resource allocation for patients requiring intensive services.

                Abstract* Background Cardiorespiratory fitness in young adults is an early marker of cardiometabolic risk, yet the contribution of diet and vitamin status to physical capacity in this group remains insufficiently defined. Methods In a cross-sectional study, 22 healthy adults (median age 28 years) were classified into normal (VO2max ≥84% predicted; n=9) and reduced endurance (VO2max <84% predicted; n=13) groups based on cardiopulmonary exercise testing on a cycle ergometer. All participants underwent anthropometry and bioimpedance analysis of body composition. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) was used to assess rest HR, peak HR, VO2 max, and VO2 max (% predicted). 72-hour food diaries were analyzed with specialized software, and serum concentrations of vitamins B₁, B2, B₆, B₁2, C, A, E, and D were measured using immunoassay and related techniques. Results The reduced endurance group reported higher total daily energy intake (2635.0 kcal/day vs. 1750.5 kcal/day; p=0.047) and carbohydrate intake (229.2 g/day vs. 163.9 g/day; p=0.007), whereas the normal endurance group consumed more vegetables (219.1 g/day vs. 110.0 g/day; p=0.025) and had higher serum vitamin D concentrations (34.6 ng/mL vs. 16.1 ng/mL; p=0.009). Physical capacity showed a positive correlation with serum vitamin D (r=0.606; p=0.003) and vegetable intake (r=0.576; p=0.008), while other measured vitamins and major food groups were not significantly associated with aerobic performance. Conclusions Among healthy young adults, better physical capacity was linked to higher vitamin D serum levels and vegetable consumption, independent of anthropometric differences. These findings suggest that optimizing vitamin D and plant-rich dietary patterns may support cardiorespiratory endurance in this population, although larger longitudinal studies are needed to confirm causality.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1464/v1?src=rss">Social Innovation in Entrepreneurship: A Strategic Pathway to Poverty Reduction for Sustainable Development: A systematic Literature Review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                In this review, we examine how social innovation plays a role in entrepreneurship as a way to fight poverty and encourage sustainable development. While entrepreneurship has long been seen as a key driver of economic growth, our review establishes that there has been little focus on its link with social innovation. Specifically, more attention is needed on how it can address economic, social, and environmental challenges in a comprehensive way. This gap in the literature shows the need to better understand how entrepreneurial practices, when paired with social innovation, can create value beyond just financial success. The study is anchored on Diffusion of Innovations Theory, which provides a framework for understanding how novel entrepreneurial solutions are adopted and scaled within communities. To address this, the review applies a systematic literature review approach guided by PRISMA protocols. Empirical studies, reports, and peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2019 and 2025 were identified and thematically analysed to capture how social innovation is integrated into entrepreneurial strategies and practices. Findings indicate that interventions such as microfinance, digital platforms, vocational training, renewable energy projects, and community-driven models have demonstrated substantial potential in improving livelihoods and reducing vulnerability among marginalised populations. However, we observe that persistent challenges remain regarding long-term sustainability, scalability, and context-specific adaptation. What makes our review unique is its interdisciplinary approach, linking business strategy to social results. Our review offers a well-rounded view of how entrepreneurship can be used to tackle deep-rooted societal issues. This work adds to the existing knowledge by providing a thorough analysis of how social innovation in entrepreneurship can drive significant change, encourage inclusivity, and support sustainable development. It also offers insights that can guide future research, policy, and practice seeking to leverage entrepreneurial innovation for inclusive and sustainable development.

                <p>We used targeted immunopurification-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) to characterize human neurofilament light chain (NfL) proteoforms across various compartments to assess their alterations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). NfL is truncated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood in patients with sporadic ALS (sALS) and these proteoforms differ between compartments. Mid-domain species were elevated in CSF whereas plasma NfL proteoforms were mostly comprised of the tail subdomain region. Our results suggest NfL isoforms are proteolyzed and differentially distributed between ALS biofluid compartments and that analyzing by these specific regions or in ratios between regions can provide improvements in biomarker utility. These insights enhance the understanding of NfL and its potential for disease monitoring and therapeutic targeting in ALS. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Background The integration of digital technologies into project-based language learning has attracted growing scholarly attention; however, research in this area remains conceptually fragmented. A systematic synthesis of theoretical foundations, projects typologies, language skills and knowledge addressed, and pedagogical implications of technology-enhanced project-based language learning (TEPBLL) is still limited. Methods Restricted to SSCI-indexed publications and guided by PRISMA 2020 protocols, this systematic review examined 31 empirical studies published between 2015 and 2024. The analysis focused on the nature of publications, underlying theoretical frameworks, types of technology-supported projects, reported language-learning outcomes, and implications for research and instructional practice. Results The reviewed studies indicate that TEPBLL research is predominantly grounded in five theoretical frameworks and encompasses seven diverse technology-supported projects types. Across studies, TEPBLL is frequently reported improvements in eight major skills and knowledge areas. The review also identifies recurring three dimensions of implications for instructional practice and future research. Conclusions This review systematically synthesizes prevailing patterns in the TEPBLL literature. The study offers a coherent and comprehensive overview that can guide future research design and support more theory-informed, methodologically rigorous, and context-sensitive application of TEPBLL.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Congenital heart disease is linked to substantial variability in neurodevelopmental outcomes, with sex being a key contributing factor. Compared with females, male congenital heart disease infants often show greater impairments in motor, cognitive, and language development. However, studies on sex differences in early brain development among congenital heart disease patients remain limited. To fill these gaps, this study included 79 infants with complex congenital heart disease (42 males, 37 females) and 87 healthy controls (47 males, 40 females), collecting magnetic resonance imaging data, clinical information, and neurodevelopmental assessments. We examined sex-specific effects on global and regional brain development in congenital heart disease infants aged 1 to 2 yr using imaging and statistical analysis. Male congenital heart disease infants showed global brain volume reduction and regional cortical delays, including increased cortical thickness and gray matter volume. In contrast, female congenital heart disease infants had no significant global volume change but exhibited localized structural abnormalities, such as reduced surface area and increased cortical thickness. Notably, reduced global brain volume in congenital heart disease males was associated with poorer gross motor skills. Distinct sex differences in brain development exist among congenital heart disease infants during early life. Recognizing these differences is critical for developing sex-specific treatment and neuroprotective strategies.</span>

                <p>Decoding algorithms provide a powerful tool for understanding the firing patterns that underlie cognitive processes such as motor control, learning, and recall. When implemented in the context of a real-time system, decoders also make it possible to deliver feedback based on the representational content of ongoing neural activity. That, in turn, allows experimenters to test hypotheses about the role of that content in driving downstream activity patterns and behaviors. While multiple real-time systems have been developed, they are typically implemented with a compiled programming language, making them more difficult for users to quickly adapt for new experiments. Here we present a software system written in the widely used Python programming language to facilitate rapid experimentation. Our solution implements the state space based clusterless decoding algorithm for an online, real-time environment. The parallelized application processes neural data with temporal resolution of 6 ms and median computational latency &lt;50 ms for medium- to large-scale (32+ tetrodes) rodent hippocampus recordings without the need for spike sorting. It also executes auxiliary functions such as detecting sharp wave ripples from local field potential data. Even with an interpreted language, the performance is similar to state-of-the-art solutions that use compiled programming languages. We demonstrate this real-time decoder in a rat behavior experiment in which the decoder allowed closed-loop neurofeedback based on decoded hippocampal spatial representations. Overall this system provides a powerful and easy-to-modify tool for real-time feedback experiments.</p>

                Background The study of bi-univalent functions has gained considerable attention due to its relevance in geometric function theory, particularly in determining bounds for the initial coefficients of analytic functions. Previous research has introduced several subclasses of bi-univalent functions using tools such as convolution, subordination, differential subordination, and various families of special polynomials. Methods Motivated by these developments, this work constructs new subclasses of bi-univalent functions by employing generalized Fibonacci polynomials. The analytic properties of these polynomials are used to define the classes and derive the corresponding functional relations needed for coefficient estimation. Results For the newly introduced subclasses, bounds for the initial coefficients are established. Furthermore, Fekete–Szegö inequalities are obtained for each subclass, extending previously known results and demonstrating the influence of the generalized Fibonacci structure on coefficient behavior. Conclusions The results contribute to the ongoing development of bi-univalent function theory by providing broader subclasses and sharper estimates. The use of generalized Fibonacci polynomials offers a flexible analytical framework that can be further applied to related classes in future studies.

                Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains the most common cause of dementia worldwide and one of the greatest health challenges of the twenty-first century. Traditionally viewed as a neurodegenerative disorder defined by amyloid-β plaques and tau tangles, recent evidence implicates systemic metabolic dysfunction and endothelial injury as key drivers of the disease progression. Insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and chronic hyperglycemia impair neuronal glucose utilization and insulin signaling, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and tau hyperphosphorylation. Concurrently, abnormal lipid metabolism and the presence of the apolipoprotein E4 allele accelerate amyloidogenic processing, while advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) formed during hyperglycemia activate RAGE-mediated inflammatory pathways that amplify neuronal injury. Endothelial dysfunction further compounds these effects by reducing nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, disrupting the blood–brain barrier, and diminishing cerebral perfusion inhibiting amyloid clearance and intensifying neuroinflammation. These interconnected metabolic and vascular abnormalities establish a “metabolic–vascular–neurodegenerative axis” that links systemic disease to progressive neuronal degeneration. Understanding this integrative framework shifts the perspective of AD from a purely brain-centered disorder to a systemic, multi-organ pathology. Emerging therapeutic strategies that combine metabolic regulation, endothelial protection, and anti-inflammatory approaches offer a more comprehensive path toward prevention and disease modification. future research and clinical interventions can achieve a sustained neuroprotection by addressing the metabolic and vascular roots of AD.

                <p>by John S. McAlister, Jesse L. Brunner, Danielle J. Galvin, Nina H. Fefferman</p>

Global trade of material goods involves the potential to create pathways for the spread of infectious pathogens. One trade sector in which this synergy is clearly critical is that of wildlife trade networks. This highly complex system involves important and understudied bidirectional coupling between the economic decision making of the stakeholders and the contagion dynamics on the emergent trade network. While each of these components are independently well studied, there is a meaningful gap in understanding the feedback dynamics that can arise between them. In the present study, we describe a general game theoretic model for trade networks of goods susceptible to contagion. The primary result relies on the acyclic nature of the trade network and shows that, through the course of trading with stochastic infections, the probability of infection converges to a directly computable fixed point. This allows us to compute best responses and thus identify equilibria in the game. We present ways to use this model to describe and evaluate trade networks in terms of global and individual risk of infection under a wide variety of structural or individual modifications to the trade network. In capturing the bidirectional coupling of the system, we provide critical insight into the global and individual drivers and consequences for risks of infection inherent in and arising from the global wildlife trade, and any economic trade network with associated contagion risks.

                <p>by Juan Giral Martínez, Matthieu Barbier, Silvia De Monte</p>

Minimal models for complex ecosystems often assume random interactions, whose statistics suffice to predict dynamical and macroecological patterns. However, ecological networks commonly possess a variety of properties, such as hierarchies or functional groups, that structure species interactions. Here, we ask how conclusions from random interaction models are altered by the presence of such community-level network structures. We consider a Lotka-Volterra model where pairwise species interactions combine structure and randomness, and study macroscopic community-level observables, abundance distributions and dynamical regimes. Randomness and structure combine in a surprisingly yet deceptively straightforward way: contributions from each component to community patterns are largely independent. Yet, their interplay has non-trivial consequences, notably out of equilibrium. We conclude that whether interaction structure matters depends on the pattern: when breaking species equivalence, static patterns of species presence and abundance predicted from random interaction models are less robust than the qualitative nature of dynamical regimes.

                <p>by Guy Elisha, Sourav Halder, Xinyi Liu, Dustin A. Carlson, Peter J. Kahrilas, John E. Pandolfino, Neelesh A. Patankar</p>

Esophageal motility arises from the continuous coupling between enteric neural activity and the organ’s mechanical response, yet the structure of this coupling remains poorly understood. Esophageal motility disorders represent mechanical dysfunctions that originate from abnormalities in neural control, underscoring the need to understand how neural and mechanical processes interact to produce coordinated motion. We present an empirically guided neuromechanical model of the esophagus, comprising unidirectionally coupled relaxation oscillators activated by intrinsic enteric nervous system mechanoreceptors sensitive to wall distension. The model reveals complex behaviors emerging from interactions among its components, predicting various clinically observed normal and abnormal esophageal responses to distension. Specifically, repetitive antegrade contractions (RACs) are shown to arise from the coupled neuromechanical dynamics in response to sustained volumetric distension. Normal RACs are shown to have a robust balance between excitatory and inhibitory neural activities and mechanical input through these intrinsic distension-sensitive mechanoreceptors. When this balance is affected, contraction patterns resembling motility disorders emerge. For example, clinically observed repetitive retrograde contractions emerge due to hypersensitive mechanoreceptors in the esophageal wall. Such neuromechanical insights may ultimately guide the development of targeted pharmacological interventions.

                <p>by Joel Vanin, Michael Getz, Catherine Mahony, Thomas B. Knudsen, James A. Glazier</p>
Purpose <p>To develop a computational model that addresses limitations in current ocular irritation assessment methods, particularly regarding long-term effects, and recovery patterns following chemical exposure or trauma to the cornea.</p> Methods <p>V-Cornea is an agent-based computer simulation implemented in CompuCell3D that models corneal epithelial homeostasis and injury response. The model incorporates biologically-inspired rules governing cell behaviors (proliferation, differentiation, death) and key signaling pathways including Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), translating cell-level behaviors to tissue-level outcomes (<i>in vitro</i> to <i>in vivo</i> extrapolation, IVIVE).</p> Results <p>V-Cornea successfully reproduces corneal epithelial architecture and maintains tissue homeostasis over extended simulated periods. Following simulated trauma or toxicant exposure, the model accurately predicts healing timeframes of 3–5 days for slight and mild injuries. For moderate injuries with basement membrane disruption, the model demonstrates longer recovery times and emergent dynamic structural disorganization that mimics recurrent corneal erosions, providing mechanistic insights into these pathological conditions.</p> Conclusions <p>V-Cornea’s modular CompuCell3D implementation is easily extensible to incorporate additional recovery and injury mechanisms. Future versions will include more realistic basement membrane dynamics and explicit representation of stromal tissue and immune response to improve predictivity for moderate injuries. This virtual-tissue approach shows potential not only for toxicological assessments but also for drug discovery and therapy optimization by providing a platform to test interventions and predict outcomes across various injury scenarios.</p>

                Abstract* Background Heavy metals such as cadmium, lead, and mercury are ubiquitous in the environment, accumulating in plants, animals, water and human food. Human exposure through the consumption of vegetable crops is a global concern because such metals may be toxic even in trace amounts. There are many factors influencing heavy metal concentrations in vegetables including, soil properties, growing practices and flooding events. This study aimed to investigate heavy metal concentrations in vegetable samples in Hawke’s Bay, New Zealand, one year post Severe Tropical Cyclone Gabrielle, which caused widespread flooding on the 14th of February 2023. Methods This cross-sectional study included organic and non-organic vegetables and sites impacted and not-impacted by cyclone flooding. In total, 736 vegetable samples were combined to form 153 representative samples collected from 14 markets grown at 10 growing sites. Samples were analysed by ICP-MS in an ISO-17025 accredited laboratory. Results Cadmium (p = 0.003) and nickel (p < 0.001) contamination were higher in non-organic vegetables. Growing vegetables on flood-affected land was independently associated with reduced cadmium (p = 0.030) and nickel (p = 0.024) contamination. Three samples exceeded Codex Alimentarius lead permissible levels (0.1 mg kg−1 fresh weight), and one sample exceeded cadmium permissible levels (0.05 mg kg−1 fresh weight in Brassica). Conclusions This study suggests that Hawke’s Bay vegetables by global standards, are generally low risk, for heavy metal toxicity and organic vegetables, carry the lowest risk. However, some vegetables do exceed maximum limits for lead and cadmium. We speculate that recent Severe Tropical Cyclone Gabrielle did not increase risk and may have reduced the risk of heavy metal toxicity from vegetable consumption.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1460/v1?src=rss">Dysregulation of MicroRNA-181a-5p Targets TNFAIP3 to Promote MIF-CXCR4 Signaling and Immune Inflammatory Remodeling in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The non-coding RNAs, particularly microRNA-181a-5p target the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3) a key negative regulator of NF-κB signaling and affect the levels of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) in chronic myeloid leukamia (CML). Methods The study included 57 individuals with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and 33 healthy individuals. Hematological parameters (Hb, RBCs, WBCs and platelets) were assessed. The serum levels of MIF, TNFAIP3 and CXCR4 were measured using ELISA Technique. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to assess miR-181a expression. The potential targets and immune associated pathways of miR-181a were predicted using bioinformatics tools including TargetScan, miRTarBase, STRING, DAVID, and Enrichr. Statistical analysis included ROC curve evaluation, Pearson correlation, and t-tests. Results Compared to controls, CML patients exhibited reduced platelets, Hb and RBC while elevated WBCs recorded. There were significantly elevated serum levels of MIF and CXCR4, and reduced levels of TNFAIP3 (p<0.01) in CML patients compared to control. Moreover, higher miR-181a expression (2.28 fold, p=0.0001) recorded in CML compared to control. Positive correlations were observed between miR-181a expression and both MIF and CXCR4 levels while TNFAIP3 exhibited a reverse correlation. ROC analysis showed that MIF (AUC = 0.873) and CXCR4 (AUC = 0.929) exhibited strong diagnostic performance while TNFAIP3 (AUC = 0.142) and miR-181a-5p (AUC = 0.201) demonstrated weak accuracy consistent with their opposite expression patterns between CML patients and healthy controls. Conclusion The inhibition of TNFAIP3 by miR-181a leads to enhanced NF-κB-mediated inflammatory and immune signaling suggesting a novel pathogenic mechanism in CML involving immune dysregulation. The identification of miR-181a, MIFpresent3, and CXCR4 as key players in immune modulation and inflammation presents promising therapeutic targets and diagnostic biomarkers in CML particularly within the Iraqi population.
