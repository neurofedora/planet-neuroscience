              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neural effects of continuous theta-burst stimulation in macaque parietal neurons</a></h4>

              
                Theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (TBS) has become a standard non-invasive technique to induce offline changes in cortical excitability in human volunteers. Yet, TBS suffers from a high variability across subjects. A better knowledge about how TBS affects neural activity in vivo could uncover its mechanisms of action and ultimately allow its mainstream use in basic science and clinical applications. To address this issue, we applied continuous TBS (cTBS, 300 pulses) in awake behaving rhesus monkeys and quantified its after-effects on neuronal activity. Overall, we observed a pronounced, long-lasting, and highly reproducible reduction in neuronal excitability after cTBS in individual parietal neurons, with some neurons also exhibiting periods of hyperexcitability during the recovery phase. These results provide the first experimental evidence of the effects of cTBS on single neurons in awake behaving monkeys, shedding new light on the reasons underlying cTBS variability.

                <i>Plasmodium falciparum,</i> the causative agent of malaria, remains a global health threat as parasites continue to develop resistance to antimalarial drugs used throughout the world. Accordingly, drugs with novel modes of action are desperately required to combat malaria. <i>P. falciparum</i> parasites infect human red blood cells where they digest the host’s main protein constituent, hemoglobin. Leucine aminopeptidase <i>Pf</i>A-M17 is one of several aminopeptidases that have been implicated in the last step of this digestive pathway. Here, we use both reverse genetics and a compound specifically designed to inhibit the activity of <i>Pf</i>A-M17 to show that <i>Pf</i>A-M17 is essential for <i>P. falciparum</i> survival as it provides parasites with free amino acids for growth, many of which are highly likely to originate from hemoglobin. We further show that loss of <i>Pf</i>A-M17 results in parasites exhibiting multiple digestive vacuoles at the trophozoite stage. In contrast to other hemoglobin-degrading proteases that have overlapping redundant functions, we validate <i>Pf</i>A-M17 as a potential novel drug target.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Controllability boosts neural and cognitive signatures of changes-of-mind in uncertain environments</a></h4>

              
                In uncertain environments, seeking information about alternative choice options is essential for adaptive learning and decision-making. However, information seeking is usually confounded with changes-of-mind about the reliability of the preferred option. Here, we exploited the fact that information seeking requires control over which option to sample to isolate its behavioral and neurophysiological signatures. We found that changes-of-mind occurring with control require more evidence against the current option, are associated with reduced confidence, but are nevertheless more likely to be confirmed on the next decision. Multimodal neurophysiological recordings showed that these changes-of-mind are preceded by stronger activation of the dorsal attention network in magnetoencephalography, and followed by increased pupil-linked arousal during the presentation of decision outcomes. Together, these findings indicate that information seeking increases the saliency of evidence perceived as the direct consequence of one’s own actions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Rapid transgenerational adaptation in response to intercropping reduces competition</a></h4>

              
                By capitalising on positive biodiversity-productivity relationships, intercropping provides opportunities to improve agricultural sustainability. Intercropping is generally implemented using commercial seeds that were bred for maximal productivity in monocultures, thereby ignoring the ability of plants to adapt over generations to the surrounding neighbourhood, notably through increased complementarity, i.e. reduced competition or increased facilitation. This is why using monoculture-adapted seeds for intercropping might limit the benefits of crop diversity on yield. However, the adaptation potential of crops and the corresponding changes in complementarity have not been explored in annual crop systems. Here we show that plant-plant interactions among annual crops shifted towards reduced competition and/or increased facilitation when the plants were growing in the same community type as their parents did in the previous two generations. Total yield did not respond to this common coexistence history, but in fertilized conditions, we observed increased overyielding in mixtures with a common coexistence history. Surprisingly, we observed character convergence between species sharing the same coexistence history for two generations, in monocultures but also in mixtures: the six crop species tested converged towards taller phenotypes with lower leaf dry matter content. This study provides the first empirical evidence for the potential of parental diversity affecting plant-plant interactions, species complementarity and therefore potentially ecosystem functioning of the following generations in annual cropping systems. Although further studies are required to assess the context-dependence of these results, our findings may still have important implications for diversified agriculture as they illustrate the potential of targeted cultivars to increase complementarity of species in intercropping, which could be achieved through specific breeding for mixtures.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Regulation of oligodendrocyte lineage development by VAMP2/3 in the developing mouse spinal cord</a></h4>

              
                In the developing and adult CNS, new oligodendrocytes (OLs) are generated from a population of cells known as oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). As they begin to differentiate, OPCs undergo a series of highly regulated changes to morphology, gene expression, and membrane organization. This stage represents a critical bottleneck in oligodendrogenesis, and the regulatory program that guides it is still not fully understood. Here we show that in vivo toxin-mediated cleavage of the vesicle associated SNARE proteins VAMP2/3 in the OL lineage of both male and female mice impairs the ability of early OLs to mature into functional, myelinating OLs. In the developing mouse spinal cord, many VAMP2/3-deficient OLs appeared to stall in the premyelinating, early OL stage, resulting in an overall loss of both myelin density and OL number. The Src kinase Fyn, a key regulator of oligodendrogenesis and myelination, is highly expressed among premyelinating OLs, but its expression decreases as OLs mature. We found that OLs lacking VAMP2/3 in the spinal cord white matter showed significantly higher expression of Fyn compared to neighboring control cells, potentially due to an extended premyelinating stage. Overall, our results show that functional VAMP2/3 in OL lineage cells is essential for proper myelin formation and plays a major role in controlling the maturation and terminal differentiation of premyelinating OLs.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">341 Repeats Is Not Enough for Methylation in a New Fragile X Mouse Model</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a leading monogenic cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders, spurring decades of intense research and a multitude of mouse models. So far, these models do not recapitulate the genetic underpinning of classical FXS&mdash;CGG repeat-induced methylation of the <I>Fmr1</I> locus&mdash;and their findings have failed to translate into the clinic. We sought to answer whether this disparity was because of low repeat length and generated a novel mouse line with 341 repeats, <I>Fmr1<sup>hs341</sup></I>, which is the largest allele in mice reported to date. This repeat length is significantly longer than the 200 repeats generally required for methylation of the repeat tract and promoter region in FXS patients, which leads to silencing of the <I>FMR1</I> gene. Bisulfite sequencing fails to detect the robust methylation expected of FXS in <I>Fmr1<sup>hs341</sup></I> mice. Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting results also do not resemble FXS and instead produce a biochemical profile consistent with the fragile X-associated premutation disorders. These findings suggest that repeat length is unlikely to be the core determinant preventing methylation in mice, and other organisms phylogenetically closer to humans may be required to effectively model FXS.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Humans Can Track But Fail to Predict Accelerating Objects</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Objects in our visual environment often move unpredictably and can suddenly speed up or slow down. The ability to account for acceleration when interacting with moving objects can be critical for survival. Here, we investigate how human observers track an accelerating target with their eyes and predict its time of reappearance after a temporal occlusion by making an interceptive hand movement. Before occlusion, observers smoothly tracked the accelerating target with their eyes. At the time of occlusion, observers made a predictive saccade to the location where they subsequently intercepted the target with a quick pointing movement. We tested how observers integrated target motion information by comparing three alternative models that describe time-to-contact (TTC) based on the (1) final target velocity sample before occlusion, (2) average target velocity before occlusion, or (3) final target velocity and the rate of target acceleration. We show that observers were able to accurately track the accelerating target with visually-guided smooth pursuit eye movements. However, the timing of the predictive saccade and manual interception revealed inability to act on target acceleration when predicting TTC. Instead, interception timing was best described by the final velocity model that relies on extrapolating the last available target velocity sample before occlusion. Moreover, predictive saccades and manual interception showed similar insensitivity to target acceleration and were correlated on a trial-by-trial basis. These findings provide compelling evidence for the failure of integrating target acceleration into predictive models of target motion that drive both interceptive eye and hand movements.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Students' Digital Competence and Perceived Learning: The mediating role of Learner Agility [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background:  The ravages of COVID-19 escalated the penetration of online education and usage of digital technologies. While educational institutions across the globe adopted different forms of computer-mediated communication, the institutes in India have gradually attuned to the new normal, notwithstanding the initial glitches of adopting new technology and shifting to blended. It became increasingly significant to gain a better understanding of students’ perspectives of newly emerged learning environment. This motivated the researchers to study the digital competencies (DC) and their impact on students’ learning agility (LA) and perceived learning (PL) in professional/technical education.  Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a DigiComp 2.1 framework was attempted to investigate the relationship between DC and PL among higher education students in India. The data from 359 graduate and post-graduate students were analyzed using Structural equation modelling and Process Macro 4.0. Results: The findings of this study revealed that DC has a significant positive impact on PL (b = 0.33; p < 0.001), indicating that higher learners' DC leads to higher learning outcomes. Similarly, DC also had a significant positive impact on LA (b = 0.59; p < 0.001), suggesting that the higher DC of learners leads to higher learning agility. Further, a positive significant relationship was also found between LA and PL (b = 0.21; p < 0.001). This significant positive path reveals that higher learners' agility leads to higher student learning outcomes. Discussion: Post-COVID, DC, a technology-related skill set is linked to the academic performance of teachers and students.  Our findings reveal that DC significantly positively impacts PL and LA.  Therefore, we recommend that the higher educational institutes in India consider the inclusion of DC in their curriculum as a fundamental competence for a better learning outcome for learners.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Job characteristics of a Malaysian bank’s anti-money laundering system and its employees’ job satisfaction [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Banks and financial institutions are vulnerable to money laundering (ML) as a result of crime proceeds infiltrating banks in the form of significant cash deposits. Improved financial crime compliance processes and systems enable anti-ML (AML) analysts to devote considerable time and effort to case investigation and process quality work, thereby lowering financial risks by reporting suspicious activity in a timely and effective manner. This study uses Job Characteristics Theory (JCT) to evaluate the AML system through the job satisfaction and motivation of its users. The purpose of this study is to determine how satisfied AML personnel are with their jobs and how motivated they are to work with the system. Methods: This cross-sectional study used JCT to investigate the important elements impacting employee satisfaction with the AML system. The five core dimensions of the job characteristics were measured using a job diagnostic survey. The respondents were employees working in the AML department of a Malaysian bank, and the sample group was chosen using a purposive sampling approach. A total of 100 acceptable replies were gathered and analysed using various statistical approaches. A motivating potential score was generated for each employee based on five main job characteristics. Results: Findings revealed that five core job characteristics, namely, skill diversity, task identity, task importance, autonomy and feedback, positively influence the AML system employees’ job satisfaction. However, skill variety and autonomy are found to be low, which are reflected in the poor motivating potential score. Conclusion: This study examined the characteristics of the AML system and its users’ job satisfaction. Findings revealed that task significance is the most widely recognised characteristic, followed by feedback and task identity. However, there is a lack of skill variety and autonomy, which must be addressed to improve employee satisfaction with the AML system.

                Gender imbalance has persisted over time and is well documented in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and singularly in artificial intelligence (AI). In this article we emphasize the importance of increasing the visibility and recognition of women researchers to attract and retain women in the AI field. We review the ratio of women in STEM and AI, its evolution through time, and the differences among disciplines. Then, we discuss the main sources of this gender imbalance highlighting the lack of female role models and the problems which may arise; such as the so called Marie Curie complex, suvivorship bias, and impostor syndrome. We also emphasize the importance of active participation of women researchers in conferences, providing statistics corresponding with the leading conferences. Finally, to support these views, we give examples of several prestigious female researchers in the field and we review their research work related to COVID-19 displayed in the workshop “Artificial Intelligence for the Fight Against COVID-19” (AI4FA COVID-19), which is an example of a more balanced participation between genders.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effects of modified twin block appliance in growing Class II high angle cases: A cephalometric study [version 2; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Class II malocclusions represent anteroposterior dysplasia usually resulting from mandibular retrusion. Along with a retropositioned mandible, it can be associated with either upward or backward jaw rotation. High angle cases are often associated with a short ramal height, steeper mandibular plane, and large gonial angle. Twin block is a commonly used myofunctional appliance that incorporates bite planes that direct the occlusal forces in a more favorable direction for correction of the retrognathic mandible. We aimed to evaluate skeletal, dental, and soft tissue changes following modified twin block appliance therapy in high-angle cases. Methods: A cephalometric study was performed on 15 growing (10-14 years) high angle (Frankfort mandibular angle 28-35°) Class II Division I malocclusion patients undergoing twin block therapy. Skeletal, dental, and soft tissue changes were evaluated by cephalometric analysis using Dolphin software. Results: Pre- and post-treatment changes in cephalograms were assessed by analysis of variance and paired t-test. Significant changes in the position of the mandible (angle between Sella-Nasion-Point B [SNB] increased by 3.9 degrees, P=0.02), Wits appraisal (decreased by 1.54in  mm, P=0.04), maxillo-mandibular relationship (angle between Point A-Nasion-Point B [ANB] decreased by 3.73 degrees, P=0.02) were observed. Soft tissue changes like the nasolabial angle were also significant, increasing by 3.8 degrees (P=0.04) and lower lip relation to E-line (reduction in lower lip protrusion) by 2 mm (P=0.04). Vertical parameters showed non-significant changes, like the Frankfort mandibular angle (FMA) increased by 0.07 degrees, (P=0.67), the angle between Sella-Nasion and Gonion-Gnathion (SN-Go-Gn) increased by 0.33 degrees, (P=0.67), Y-axis increased by 0.2 degrees, (P=0.32). The upper incisor inclination decreased non-significantly from 5.60±1.24 to 4.20±0.86 degrees, (P=0.31) and lower incisor increased non-significantly from 100.13±2.23 to 101.80 ±1.37 degrees, (P=0.08). Conclusions: Modified twin block appliance can be used to successfully treat Class II Division I high angle cases with good vertical control.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">(Semi)automated approaches to data extraction for systematic reviews and meta-analyses in social sciences: A living review protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: An abundance of rapidly accumulating scientific evidence presents novel opportunities for researchers and practitioners alike, yet such advantages are often overshadowed by resource demands associated with finding and aggregating a continually expanding body of scientific information. Across social science disciplines, the use of automation technologies for timely and accurate knowledge synthesis can enhance research translation value, better inform key policy development, and expand the current understanding of human interactions, organizations, and systems. Ongoing developments surrounding automation are highly concentrated in research for evidence-based medicine with limited evidence surrounding tools and techniques applied outside of the clinical research community. Our objective is to conduct a living systematic review of automated data extraction techniques supporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses in the social sciences. The aim of this study is to extend the automation knowledge base by synthesizing current trends in the application of extraction technologies of key data elements of interest for social scientists. Methods: The proposed study is a living systematic review employing a partial replication framework based on extant literature surrounding automation of data extraction for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Protocol development, base review, and updates follow PRISMA standards for reporting systematic reviews. This protocol is preregistered in OSF: (Semi)Automated Approaches to Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses in Social Sciences: A Living Review Protocol on August 14, 2022. Conclusions: Anticipated outcomes of this study include: (a) generate insights supporting advancement in transferring existing reliable methods to social science research; (b) provide a foundation for protocol development leading to enhancement of comparability and benchmarking standards across disciplines; and (c) uncover exigencies that spur continued value-adding innovation and interdisciplinary collaboration for the benefit of the collective systematic review community.

                The Open Microscopy Environment Remote Objects (OMERO) is an open-source image manager used by many biologists to store, organize, view, and share microscopy images, while the open-source software ImageJ/Fiji is a very popular program used to analyse them. However, there is a lack of an easy-to-use generic tool to run a workflow on a batch of images without having to download them to local computers, and to automatically organize the results in OMERO. To offer this functionality, we have built (i) a library in Java: “Simple OMERO Client”, to communicate with an OMERO database from Java software, (ii) an ImageJ/Fiji plugin to run a macro-program on a batch of images from OMERO and (iii) a new set of Macro Functions, “OMERO Macro extensions“, dedicated to interact with OMERO in macro-programming. The latter is intended for developers, with additional possibilities using tag criteria, while the “Batch OMERO plugin” is more geared towards non-IT scientists and has a very easy to use interface. Each tool is illustrated with a use case.

                Background: Serum levels of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) have a significant association with ovarian response in the event of assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment cycles. The present study was performed to evaluate the ovarian stimulation protocols selection with respect to serum AMH levels in patients and its impact on ART outcome. Methods: Based on the serum AMH, 191 women were classified as low, normal and high responders. Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Human Menopausal Gonadotropin (HMG) dosages in controlled ovarian stimulation were determined. Retrieval, maturation, fertilization and utilization rates were measured. Subgroup analysis was done using one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc analysis. The relationship between AMH levels and fertilization was determined using Pearson’s correlation analysis. A p-value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: According to AMH levels, the majority of the patients were normal responders (52.4%) followed by high responders (29.8%) and low responders (17.8%). The average FSH, HMG per day and number of days HMG required was found to be significant among the different responders. Further, retrieval rate and blastulation rate was found to be significant among the different responders. A positive correlation was found between AMH and the number of oocytes retrieved and number of oocytes successfully fertilized, which was found to be significant. In addition, there was a significant inverse relationship between AMH levels and age. Conclusions: The study outcomes revealed that the rates of retrieval, maturation, fertilization, embryo utilization and blastulation were higher among the high responders compared with the low responders. Thus, proper increase in dosages of ovarian stimulation protocol is required among the low responders to achieve quality embryos.

                Background: Staphylococcus aureus is commonly found in dairy cows and is a source of contamination in milk. S. aureus that are resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics (especially cefoxitin) are referred to as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).  The spread of MRSA cannot be separated from sanitation management during milking; it can originate from milk collected from the udder or from the hands of farmers during the milking process. The purpose of this study was to examine the level of MRSA contamination in dairy cow's milk and farmer's hand. Methods: A total of 109 samples of dairy cow’s milk and 41 samples of farmer’s hand swabs were collected at a dairy farm in Probolinggo, East Java, Indonesia. Samples were cultured and purified using mannitol salt agar (MSA). The profile of S. aureus resistance was established by disk diffusion test using a disk of beta-lactam antibiotics, namely oxacillin and cefoxitin. Results: The S. aureus isolates that were resistant to oxacillin and cefoxitin antibiotics were then tested for oxacillin resistance screening agar base (ORSAB) as a confirmation test for MRSA identity. S. aureus isolates suspected to be MRSA were then tested genotypically by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method to detect the presence of the mecA gene. The results of the isolation and identification found 80 isolates (53.33%) of S. aureus. The results of the resistance test found that 42 isolates (15%) of S. aureus were resistant to oxacillin and 10 isolates (12.5%) were resistant to cefoxitin. The ORSAB test found as many as 20 isolates (47.62%) were positive for MRSA. In PCR testing to detect the presence of the mecA gene, three isolates (30%) were positive for the mecA gene. Conclusions: This study shows that several S. aureus isolates were MRSA and had the gene encoding mecA in dairy farms.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Spatial transcriptomics dimensionality reduction using wavelet bases [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Spatially resolved transcriptomics (ST) measures gene expression along with the spatial coordinates of the measurements. The analysis of ST data involves significant computation complexity. In this work, we propose a gene expression dimensionality reduction algorithm that retains spatial structure. Methods: We combine the wavelet transformation with matrix factorization to select spatially-varying genes. We extract a low-dimensional representation of these genes. We adopt an Empirical Bayes perspective, imposing regularization through the prior distribution of factor genes. Additionally, we visualize the extracted representations, providing an overview of global spatial patterns. We illustrate the performance of our methods through spatial structure recovery and gene expression reconstruction using a simulation and real data analysis. Results: In real data experiments, our method identifies spatial structure of gene factors and outperforms regular decomposition regarding reconstruction error. We find a connection between the fluctuation of gene patterns and wavelet estimates, and this allows us to provide smoother visualizations. We develop the package and share the workflow generating reproducible quantitative results and gene visualization. The package is available at https://github.com/OliverXUZY/waveST. Conclusions: We have proposed a pipeline for dimensionality reduction that respects spatial structure. Both simulations and real data experiments demonstrate that wavelet and shrinkage techniques show positive results in spatially resolved transcriptomics data. We highlight the idea of combining image processing techniques and statistical methods for application in a spatial genomics context

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Data set of a representative online survey on search engines with a focus on search engine optimization (SEO): a cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                To gain a better understanding of user knowledge and perspectives of search engines, a fruitful approach are representative online surveys. In 2020, we conducted an online survey with a sample representative of the German online population aged 16 through 69 (N = 2,012). The online survey included 12 search engine-related sections. The questions cover topics such as usage behavior, self-assessed search engine literacy, trust in search engines, knowledge of ads and search engine optimization (SEO), ability to distinguish ads from organic results, assessments and opinions regarding SEO, and personalization of search results. SEO is the specific focus of the survey, as it was conducted as part of the SEO Effect project, dealing with issues such as the role of SEO from the user perspective. This data set contains complete data from the online survey. On the one hand, the data set will allow further analyses, and, on the other hand, comparisons with follow-up studies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Smart city perspectives in post-pandemic governance: Externalities reduction policy [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The ongoing COVID-19 quarantine restrictions have caused multiple sharp decreases in activities associated with the movement of large masses of people. The economies of regions and cities that are critically dependent on tourist flows related to various segments have suffered. This research aims to provide an economic-mathematical model of smart cities externalities’ impact from the point of view of achieving social and environmental goals Methods: The objective of this study was to develop an algorithm for supporting decision-makers. Methods of mathematical modeling, statistical processing of data received in real-time, as well as methods for finding solutions by expansion into dynamic series are used, and the theory of mathematical games is applied. The theoretical mathematical model presented considers the statistical processing of data provided in real time referring to the performance indicators of megacities. Results: The activities of administrations and governments aimed at maintaining stability over the past two years have been aimed at reducing the negative impact of the pandemic. The prospect of returning to normal conditions is complicated by a number of factors. The proposed approach allows the development of the fundamental basis for making administrative decisions within individual megapolises and in environmental policy on a territory of any scale. The developed mathematical model is abstract by definition and is applied by taking into account specific tasks and criteria. Since the tasks of the administration differ depending on the region and country, the choice of criteria is set individually. Conclusions: During the period of isolation, the volume of services in the Hotel - Restaurant- Catering/Café (HORECA) segment has decreased, and personnel has also been lost. The reduced pressure on public infrastructure and the departure of migrants means that, in the long term, this work cannot be restored within a short period of time.

                Background: Insufficient and excessive iodine intake during pregnancy can lead to serious health problems. In Tanzania, information available on iodine status during pregnancy is minimal. The aim of this study was to assess the iodine status and its association with socio-demographic factors in pregnant women in the Mbeya region, Tanzania. Method: A cross sectional survey involving 420 pregnant women (n=420) registered in Reproductive and Child Health Clinics was conducted. Data were collected via interviews and laboratory analysis of urinary iodine concentration (UIC). Results: Median UIC was 279.4μg/L (+/-26.1) to 1915μg/L. Insufficient iodine intake (UIC below 150μg/L) was observed in 17.14% of participants, sufficient intake in 24.29% and 58.57% had intakes above the recommended level (>250μg/L). Pregnant women who consume fish had an increased risk of insufficient iodine [Adjusted OR7= 2.60 (95%CI 1.31-5.15)] while the risk was lower for those who attended primary education compared to non-formal education [Adjusted OR= 0.29 (95%CI 0.08-0.99)]. Pregnant women resident in Mbarali district aged between 35-49 years were associated with an increased risk of UIC above recommended level [Adjusted OR=4.09 (95%CI 1.85-9.010] and [Adjusted OR=2.51 (95%CI 0.99-6.330] respectively . Conclusion: This study demonstrated a significant relationship between geographical factors (residence in the Mbarali district) and excess median urine iodine concentration, in addition, this study also found an association between consumption of freshwater fish and insufficient mean urine iodine concentration as indicated by the World Health Organization recommendation. Therefore, educational programs on iodine intake are needed as attending primary education was found to be a protective factor for insufficient median urine iodine concentration.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Risk of lowering mortality from the improvement of inflammatory markers and disease progression among moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19 patients using anticoagulant : a cross-sectional study from two second referral hospitals in Surabaya, Indonesia </a></h4>

              
                Background: To date, coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) has no definitive treatment. Thrombosis and hypercoagulation may occur in the advanced stage. Further study on how to use anticoagulants is still required to promote the best prognosis. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 110 moderate, 140 severe, and 81 critical patients receiving unfractioned heparin (UFH), low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), and fondaparinux was conducted. Data were collected from March 15th to August 31st 2020 at Universitas Airlangga and Husada Utama Hospital. A comparative study of white blood cell (WBC), neutrophils, lymphocytes, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), c-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), D-dimer, all-cause mortality rate, length of stay, and days of death among three severities of COVID-19 was done. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to determine the correlation between inflammatory state after anti-coagulant with patients’ mortality. Results: Two deaths occurred in moderate cases, 36 deaths in severe cases, and 70 deaths in critical cases on ventilators. On day 13, moderate and severe groups showed decreased WBC, neutrophils, NLR, CRP, and D-dimer (p < 0.05). NLR, CRP, and D-dimer (p<0.05) in critically ill and ventilated patients decreased. Day-13 evaluation revealed 32.73% decrease of inflammatory markers in moderate group; 32.86% in severe patients; and 16.05% in critically ill, ventilated patients. A significant correlation between day 13 inflammatory status with mortality was seen in moderate and critical cases with a ventilator (r=0.337; p< 0.05 and r=0.25; p 0.05). Inflammatory profile on day 6 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.36; p < 0.05) and day 13 ([aOR] = 4.15; p < 0.05) was associated with patients’ mortality. Conclusions: Anticoagulants in COVID-19 patients lower inflammation markers. Evaluating inflammatory status is essential to predict the mortality. Inflammatory markers on day 13, based on the severity of COVID-19 and comorbidities, were associated with mortality in moderate and critical cases.

                Respiratory tract infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first occurred in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and was declared as a pandemic by WHO. The interaction between the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and pulmonary hypertension (PH) in children is not widely known. Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDEI), one class of drugs used to treat PH, including sildenafil, can suppress angiotensin type I (AT-1) receptor expression. Furthermore, it reduces proinflammatory cytokines and infiltrates the alveolar, inhibits endothelial and smooth muscle transition, mesenchymal cells in the pulmonary artery, and prevents clotting and thrombosis complications. Sildenafil has shown positive effects by diverting the blood flow to the lungs in such a way that ventilation is adequate and can also be anti-inflammatory.

                Incorporating eels and tempe can replace and complement the content of proteins, macronutrients, and micronutrients, which may be related to curative effects for malnutrition. In addition, converting the ingredients into a form of flour can increase their shelf life and nutrient concentration. Therefore, an in vivo approach was undertaken to explore further the nutritional status value of biomarkers in malnourished male rats (Rattus norvegicus) after Eel and Tempe Composite (ETC) flour supplementation. Data was collected from blood samples (both plasma and serum) of rats in all groups, and the appropriate biomarkers were analyzed. The final data presented in this study is openly available and can be further analyzed using statistical means to determine the dose of ETC flour as the basis of clinical trials, which other researchers can reproduce. This data may also be valuable for those interested in using different analytical methods to research the same questions or even new preclinical studies focusing solely on nutritional status biomarker analysis methods, including clinical trial prospects.

                This article provides details on the development of a statistical learning algorithm developed for constructing personalized treatment plans for psychotherapy. The algorithm takes data collected via Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) as an input. From this, it constructs an idiographic disorder model that reflects the latent dimensions of this patient’s psychopathology and their temporal interrelations. The priority of individual problems is derived from this statistical model. Based on this, treatment modules from cognitive-behavioral therapy are ranked so that the problems with the highest priority are dealt with first. A case study is used to illustrate the different analysis steps of the algorithm from data collection to the treatment plan.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">PrMFTP: Multi-functional therapeutic peptides prediction based on multi-head self-attention mechanism and class weight optimization</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Wenhui Yan, Wending Tang, Lihua Wang, Yannan Bin, Junfeng Xia</p>

Prediction of therapeutic peptide is a significant step for the discovery of promising therapeutic drugs. Most of the existing studies have focused on the mono-functional therapeutic peptide prediction. However, the number of multi-functional therapeutic peptides (MFTP) is growing rapidly, which requires new computational schemes to be proposed to facilitate MFTP discovery. In this study, based on multi-head self-attention mechanism and class weight optimization algorithm, we propose a novel model called PrMFTP for MFTP prediction. PrMFTP exploits multi-scale convolutional neural network, bi-directional long short-term memory, and multi-head self-attention mechanisms to fully extract and learn informative features of peptide sequence to predict MFTP. In addition, we design a class weight optimization scheme to address the problem of label imbalanced data. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrate that PrMFTP is superior to other state-of-the-art computational methods for predicting MFTP. We provide a user-friendly web server of PrMFTP, which is available at http://bioinfo.ahu.edu.cn/PrMFTP.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Thalamic regulation of frontal interactions in human cognitive flexibility</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ali Hummos, Bin A. Wang, Sabrina Drammis, Michael M. Halassa, Burkhard Pleger</p>

Interactions across frontal cortex are critical for cognition. Animal studies suggest a role for mediodorsal thalamus (MD) in these interactions, but the computations performed and direct relevance to human decision making are unclear. Here, inspired by animal work, we extended a neural model of an executive frontal-MD network and trained it on a human decision-making task for which neuroimaging data were collected. Using a biologically-plausible learning rule, we found that the model MD thalamus compressed its cortical inputs (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dlPFC) underlying stimulus-response representations. Through direct feedback to dlPFC, this thalamic operation efficiently partitioned cortical activity patterns and enhanced task switching across different contingencies. To account for interactions with other frontal regions, we expanded the model to compute higher-order strategy signals outside dlPFC, and found that the MD offered a more efficient route for such signals to switch dlPFC activity patterns. Human fMRI data provided evidence that the MD engaged in feedback to dlPFC, and had a role in routing orbitofrontal cortex inputs when subjects switched behavioral strategy. Collectively, our findings contribute to the emerging evidence for thalamic regulation of frontal interactions in the human brain.

We perform a thorough analysis of RNA velocity methods, with a view towards understanding the suitability of the various assumptions underlying popular implementations. In addition to providing a self-contained exposition of the underlying mathematics, we undertake simulations and perform controlled experiments on biological datasets to assess workflow sensitivity to parameter choices and underlying biology. Finally, we argue for a more rigorous approach to RNA velocity, and present a framework for Markovian analysis that points to directions for improvement and mitigation of current problems.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A quantitative modelling approach for DNA repair on a population scale</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Leo Zeitler, Cyril Denby Wilkes, Arach Goldar, Julie Soutourina</p>

The great advances of sequencing technologies allow the <i>in vivo</i> measurement of nuclear processes—such as DNA repair after UV exposure—over entire cell populations. However, data sets usually contain only a few samples over several hours, missing possibly important information in between time points. We developed a data-driven approach to analyse CPD repair kinetics over time in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. In contrast to other studies that consider sequencing signals as an average behaviour, we understand them as the superposition of signals from independent cells. By motivating repair as a stochastic process, we derive a minimal model for which the parameters can be conveniently estimated. We correlate repair parameters to a variety of genomic features that are assumed to influence repair, including transcription rate and nucleosome density. The clearest link was found for the transcription unit length, which has been unreported for budding yeast to our knowledge. The framework hence allows a comprehensive analysis of nuclear processes on a population scale.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Digital twin predicting diet response before and after long-term fasting</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Oscar Silfvergren, Christian Simonsson, Mattias Ekstedt, Peter Lundberg, Peter Gennemark, Gunnar Cedersund</p>

Today, there is great interest in diets proposing new combinations of macronutrient compositions and fasting schedules. Unfortunately, there is little consensus regarding the impact of these different diets, since available studies measure different sets of variables in different populations, thus only providing partial, non-connected insights. We lack an approach for integrating all such partial insights into a useful and interconnected big picture. Herein, we present such an integrating tool. The tool uses a novel mathematical model that describes mechanisms regulating diet response and fasting metabolic fluxes, both for organ-organ crosstalk, and inside the liver. The tool can mechanistically explain and integrate data from several clinical studies, and correctly predict new independent data, including data from a new study. Using this model, we can predict non-measured variables, <i>e</i>.<i>g</i>. hepatic glycogen and gluconeogenesis, in response to fasting and different diets. Furthermore, we exemplify how such metabolic responses can be successfully adapted to a specific individual’s sex, weight, height, as well as to the individual’s historical data on metabolite dynamics. This tool enables an offline digital twin technology.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">CINS: Cell Interaction Network inference from Single cell expression data</a></h4>

Studies comparing single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data between conditions mainly focus on differences in the proportion of cell types or on differentially expressed genes. In many cases these differences are driven by changes in cell interactions which are challenging to infer without spatial information. To determine cell-cell interactions that differ between conditions we developed the Cell Interaction Network Inference (CINS) pipeline. CINS combines Bayesian network analysis with regression-based modeling to identify differential cell type interactions and the proteins that underlie them. We tested CINS on a disease case control and on an aging mouse dataset. In both cases CINS correctly identifies cell type interactions and the ligands involved in these interactions improving on prior methods suggested for cell interaction predictions. We performed additional mouse aging scRNA-Seq experiments which further support the interactions identified by CINS.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Rhythmicity is linked to expression cost at the protein level but to expression precision at the mRNA level</a></h4>

              
                <p>by David Laloum, Marc Robinson-Rechavi</p>

Many genes have nycthemeral rhythms of expression, <i>i.e</i>. a 24-hours periodic variation, at either mRNA or protein level or both, and most rhythmic genes are tissue-specific. Here, we investigate and discuss the evolutionary origins of rhythms in gene expression. Our results suggest that rhythmicity of protein expression could have been favored by selection to minimize costs. Trends are consistent in bacteria, plants and animals, and are also supported by tissue-specific patterns in mouse. Unlike for protein level, cost cannot explain rhythm at the RNA level. We suggest that instead it allows to periodically reduce expression noise. Noise control had the strongest support in mouse, with limited evidence in other species. We have also found that genes under stronger purifying selection are rhythmically expressed at the mRNA level, and we propose that this is because they are noise sensitive genes. Finally, the adaptive role of rhythmic expression is supported by rhythmic genes being highly expressed yet tissue-specific. This provides a good evolutionary explanation for the observation that nycthemeral rhythms are often tissue-specific.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">TAMC: A deep-learning approach to predict motif-centric transcriptional factor binding activity based on ATAC-seq profile</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tianqi Yang, Ricardo Henao</p>

Determining transcriptional factor binding sites (TFBSs) is critical for understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating gene expression in different biological conditions. Biological assays designed to directly mapping TFBSs require large sample size and intensive resources. As an alternative, ATAC-seq assay is simple to conduct and provides genomic cleavage profiles that contain rich information for imputing TFBSs indirectly. Previous footprint-based tools are inheritably limited by the accuracy of their bias correction algorithms and the efficiency of their feature extraction models. Here we introduce TAMC (Transcriptional factor binding prediction from ATAC-seq profile at Motif-predicted binding sites using Convolutional neural networks), a deep-learning approach for predicting motif-centric TF binding activity from paired-end ATAC-seq data. TAMC does not require bias correction during signal processing. By leveraging a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) model, TAMC make predictions based on both footprint and non-footprint features at binding sites for each TF and outperforms existing footprinting tools in TFBS prediction particularly for ATAC-seq data with limited sequencing depth.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Blind spots on western blots: Assessment of common problems in western blot figures and methods reporting with recommendations to improve them</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Cristina Kroon, Larissa Breuer, Lydia Jones, Jeehye An, Ayça Akan, Elkhansa Ahmed Mohamed Ali, Felix Busch, Marinus Fislage, Biswajit Ghosh, Max Hellrigel-Holderbaum, Vartan Kazezian, Alina Koppold, Cesar Alberto Moreira Restrepo, Nico Riedel, Lea Scherschinski, Fernando Raúl Urrutia Gonzalez, Tracey L. Weissgerber</p>

Western blotting is a standard laboratory method used to detect proteins and assess their expression levels. Unfortunately, poor western blot image display practices and a lack of detailed methods reporting can limit a reader’s ability to evaluate or reproduce western blot results. While several groups have studied the prevalence of image manipulation or provided recommendations for improving western blotting, data on the prevalence of common publication practices are scarce. We systematically examined 551 articles published in the top 25% of journals in neurosciences (<i>n</i> = 151) and cell biology (<i>n</i> = 400) that contained western blot images, focusing on practices that may omit important information. Our data show that most published western blots are cropped and blot source data are not made available to readers in the supplement. Publishing blots with visible molecular weight markers is rare, and many blots additionally lack molecular weight labels. Western blot methods sections often lack information on the amount of protein loaded on the gel, blocking steps, and antibody labeling protocol. Important antibody identifiers like company or supplier, catalog number, or RRID were omitted frequently for primary antibodies and regularly for secondary antibodies. We present detailed descriptions and visual examples to help scientists, peer reviewers, and editors to publish more informative western blot figures and methods. Additional resources include a toolbox to help scientists produce more reproducible western blot data, teaching slides in English and Spanish, and an antibody reporting template.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Considering humans as habitat reveals evidence of successional disease ecology among human pathogens</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nina H. Fefferman, Charles A. Price, Oliver C. Stringham</p>

The realization that ecological principles play an important role in infectious disease dynamics has led to a renaissance in epidemiological theory. Ideas from ecological succession theory have begun to inform an understanding of the relationship between the individual microbiome and health but have not yet been applied to investigate broader, population-level epidemiological dynamics. We consider human hosts as habitat and apply ideas from succession to immune memory and multi-pathogen dynamics in populations. We demonstrate that ecologically meaningful life history characteristics of pathogens and parasites, rather than epidemiological features alone, are likely to play a meaningful role in determining the age at which people have the greatest probability of being infected. Our results indicate the potential importance of microbiome succession in determining disease incidence and highlight the need to explore how pathogen life history traits and host ecology influence successional dynamics. We conclude by exploring some of the implications that inclusion of successional theory might have for understanding the ecology of diseases and their hosts.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Plasma metabolome predicts trained immunity responses after antituberculosis BCG vaccination</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Valerie A. C. M. Koeken, Cancan Qi, Vera P. Mourits, L. Charlotte J. de Bree, Simone J. C. F. M. Moorlag, Vidhisha Sonawane, Heidi Lemmers, Helga Dijkstra, Leo A. B. Joosten, Arjan van Laarhoven, Cheng-Jian Xu, Reinout van Crevel, Mihai G. Netea, Yang Li</p>

The antituberculosis vaccine Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) induces nonspecific protection against heterologous infections, at least partly through induction of innate immune memory (trained immunity). The amplitude of the response to BCG is variable, but the factors that influence this response are poorly understood. Metabolites, either released by cells or absorbed from the gut, are known to influence immune responses, but whether they impact BCG responses is not known. We vaccinated 325 healthy individuals with BCG, and collected blood before, 2 weeks and 3 months after vaccination, to assess the influence of circulating metabolites on the immune responses induced by BCG. Circulating metabolite concentrations after BCG vaccination were found to have a more pronounced impact on trained immunity responses, such as the increase in IL-1β and TNF-α production upon <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> stimulation, than on specific adaptive immune memory, assessed as IFN-γ production in response to <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. Circulating metabolites at baseline were able to predict trained immunity responses at 3 months after vaccination and enrichment analysis based on the metabolites positively associated with trained immunity revealed enrichment of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and glutamine metabolism, both of which were previously found to be important for trained immunity. Several new metabolic pathways that influence trained immunity were identified, among which taurine metabolism associated with BCG-induced trained immunity, a finding validated in functional experiments. In conclusion, circulating metabolites are important factors influencing BCG-induced trained immunity in humans. Modulation of metabolic pathways may be a novel strategy to improve vaccine and trained immunity responses.

                Background: A relationship between oral microbiota and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection has been extensively studied. However, the relationship between oral commensal flora and expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) remains to be established. In this observational study, we collected saliva from patients with COVID-19 and evaluated the relationship between ACE2 expression and Candida albicans as well as with selected gram-negative bacteria (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Veillonella parvula). We investigated how this may be directly or indirectly involved in oral dysbiosis in patients with COVID-19. Methods: We included 23 hospitalized patients admitted to Universitas Indonesia Hospital with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, with six healthy participants serving as controls. Saliva and tongue surface swabs were collected from patients with diabetes (DG) and without diabetes (NDG) and subject controls. Using quantitative PCR (qPCR) we assessed the mRNA expression of ACE2, the abundance of C. albicans, and the transcription levels of its biofilm-associated genes, agglutinin-like protein 3 (ALS3), hyphal wall protein 1 (HWP1), and yeast-form wall protein 1 (YWP1). We also counted the relative proportion of the three selected gram-negative oral bacteria in saliva. All analyses were performed to determine the relationship between ACE2 expression and C. albicans and gram-negative bacteria. Results: ACE2 mRNA expression was significantly higher in tongue swab samples than in saliva. However, no significant difference was observed between the patient groups. Conversely, DG patients had a significantly higher abundance of C. albicans in saliva compared to NDG patients and control group patients. The correlation and sensitivity/specificity relationship between ACE2 expression and C. albicans or the selected oral bacteria were also observed. Conclusions: The data show that ACE2 expression can be detected in saliva of patients with COVID-19 and its association with C. albicans and gram-negative oral bacteria might contribute toward developing an oral dysbiosis based predictor for prognosis of COVID-19 severity.

                Background: A study to reveal existing pedagogical or technological pedagogical content knowledge frameworks is crucial to inform and their effectiveness in teaching mathematics. This review study intended to explore the trends of the pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) framework, how it has changed over time until the most recent version of technological and pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) was developed, and its effectiveness in teaching mathematics. Methods: We initially downloaded 273 articles from the first 30 Google Scholar pages and analyzed 229 journal articles. We got 24 frameworks from 64 journal articles since Shulman’s first model in 1986. About 52 out of 229 were mathematics studies. Among these studies, we found that 18 studies have extensively investigated the use of identified frameworks. Results: The frameworks were presented and descriptively discussed in chronological order. The empirical studies that compared the role of pedagogical and technological pedagogical content knowledge models among classrooms with teachers who possess and do not possess such skills were demonstrated. Conclusions: The gap in empirical studies was identified, and further studies about the intervention of PCK and TPACK models were suggested to gain more insight into the mathematics classroom.

                Background: Referred pain often complicates and delays the diagnosis of temporomandibular disorders (TMD). Elaborating the prevalence and characteristics of TMD-associated referred pain as well as the distribution of referred pain in different TMD classes will significantly improve the diagnostic process. The objectives of the present study were to assess the prevalence and to evaluate the characteristics of referred pain associated with TMD diagnosed according to the DC/TMD. Methods: A total of 252 patients were evaluated using the DC/TMD Axes-I and –II assessment tools. Different modalities were used to treat the diagnosed TMD. Referred pain was diagnosed when the location of the perceived pain in response to palpation extended beyond the boundary of the structure that was examined. For pain locations that were perceived as deep, patients were asked to locate the surface of the area of pain. The result of the assessment was identified as positive if the patient described his perceived pain during the clinical examination as being familiar pain that was experienced in the same location in the last 30 days.  Results: TMD-associated referred pain was recorded in 153 patients (60.7%). The most common referred pain location was the temporal area (45.2%), followed by the ear (42.1%). The referred pain was recorded in disc displacement with reduction with intermittent locking and myofascial pain with referral in all patients (100%). The proportion of patients with referred pain was significantly different between the different TMD diagnostic subgroups (P < 0.001).  The recorded percentage of improvement in the referred pain following the treatment was 50.41% after 3 months and 56.65% after 6 months. Conclusions: Referred pain is a prominent feature of TMD. The prevalence of referred pain associated with TMD was 60.7%.  A strong strength association between the different diagnostic subgroups and the presence of referred pain existed.

<p>Quantitative analyses of spinal lamina I projection neurons (PNs) and interneurons (INs) revealed almost identical dendritic patterns but local axon collateral distribution patterns that are distinct. INs mostly establish connections within the superficial dorsal horn and may bridge its medial and lateral halves. PNs also relay their input locally, to deeper laminae of the spinal gray matter and may link other ascending systems and participate directly in the nociceptive withdrawal reflex.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Our knowledge about the detailed wiring of neuronal circuits in the spinal dorsal horn (DH), where initial sensory processing takes place, is still very sparse. While a substantial amount of data is available on the somatodendritic morphology of DH neurons, the laminar and segmental distribution patterns and consequential function of individual axons are much less characterized. In the present study, we fully reconstructed the axonal and dendritic processes of 10 projection neurons (PNs) and 15 interneurons (INs) in lamina I of the rat, to reveal quantitative differences in their distribution. We also performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to test the predicted function of certain axon collaterals. In line with our earlier qualitative description, we found that lamina I INs in the lateral aspect of the superficial DH send axon collaterals toward the medial part and occupy mostly laminae I–III, providing anatomical basis for a lateromedial flow of information within the DH. Local axon collaterals of PNs were more extensively distributed including dorsal commissural axon collaterals that might refer to those reported earlier linking the lateral aspect of the left and right DHs. PN collaterals dominated the dorsolateral funiculus and laminae IV–VI, suggesting propriospinal and ventral connections. Indeed, patch-clamp recordings confirmed the existence of a dorsoventral excitatory drive upon activation of neurokinin-1 receptors that, although being expressed in various lamina I neurons, are specifically enriched in PNs. In summary, lamina I PNs and INs have almost identical dendritic input fields, while their segmental axon collateral distribution patterns are distinct. INs, whose somata reside in lamina I, establish local connections, may show asymmetry, and contribute to bridging the medial and lateral halves of the DH. PNs, on the other hand, preferably relay their integrated dendritic input to deeper laminae of the spinal gray matter where it might be linked to other ascending pathways or the premotor network, resulting in a putative direct contribution to the nociceptive withdrawal reflex.</p>

<p>IL-12p40 is acutely upregulated, specifically on astrocytes in the ventro- and dorsomedial regions of the injured cords. IL-12RB1 and IL-12RB2 are expressed early and chronically after SCI expanding from the ventromedial regions throughout the rest of the injured cord. <i>IL-12p40</i>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Secondary damage obstructs functional recovery for individuals who have sustained a spinal cord injury (SCI). Two processes significantly contributing to tissue damage after trauma are spinal cord hemorrhage and inflammation: more specifically, the recruitment and activation of immune cells, frequently driven by pro-inflammatory factors. Cytokines are inflammatory mediators capable of modulating the immune response. While cytokines are necessary to elicit inflammation for proper healing, excessive inflammation can result in destructive processes. The pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-12 and IL-23 are pathogenic in multiple autoimmune diseases. The cytokine subunit IL-12p40 is necessary to form bioactive IL-12 and IL-23. In this study, we examined the relationship between spinal cord hemorrhage and IL-12-related factors, as well as the impact of IL-12p40 (IL-12/IL-23) on secondary damage and functional recovery after SCI. Using in vivo magnetic resonance imaging and protein tissue analyses, we demonstrated a positive correlation between IL-12 and tissue hemorrhage. Receptor and ligand subunits of IL-12 were significantly upregulated after injury and colocalized with astrocytes, demonstrating a myriad of opportunities for IL-12 to induce an inflammatory response. <i>IL-12p40</i>
<sup>
   <i>−/−</i>
</sup> mice demonstrated significantly improved functional recovery and reduced lesion sizes compared to wild-type mice. Targeted gene array analysis in wild-type and <i>IL-12p40</i>
<sup>
   <i>−/−</i>
</sup> female mice after SCI revealed an upregulation of genes associated with worsened recovery after SCI. Taken together, our data reveal a pathogenic role of IL-12p40 in the secondary damage after SCI, hindering functional recovery. IL-12p40 (IL-12/IL-23) is thus an enticing neuroinflammatory target for further study as a potential therapeutic target to benefit recovery in acute SCI.</p>

Moreover, NPAS4 re-expression is critical in maintaining the functionally distinct SST-IN ensemble throughout the course of learning.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The C. elegans gonadal sheath Sh1 cells extend asymmetrically over a differentiating germ cell population in the proliferative zone</a></h4>

              
                The <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> adult hermaphrodite germline is surrounded by a thin tube formed by somatic sheath cells that support germ cells as they mature from the stem-like mitotic state through meiosis, gametogenesis, and ovulation. Recently, we discovered that the distal Sh1 sheath cells associate with mitotic germ cells as they exit the niche Gordon et al., 2020. Here, we report that these sheath-associated germ cells differentiate first in animals with temperature-sensitive mutations affecting germ cell state, and stem-like germ cells are maintained distal to the Sh1 boundary. We analyze several markers of the distal sheath, which is best visualized with endogenously tagged membrane proteins, as overexpressed fluorescent proteins fail to localize to distal membrane processes and can cause gonad morphology defects. However, such reagents with highly variable expression can be used to determine the relative positions of the two Sh1 cells, one of which often extends further distal than the other.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The acid ceramidase/ceramide axis controls parasitemia in Plasmodium yoelii-infected mice by regulating erythropoiesis</a></h4>

              
                Acid ceramidase (Ac) is part of the sphingolipid metabolism and responsible for the degradation of ceramide. As bioactive molecule, ceramide is involved in the regulation of many cellular processes. However, the impact of cell-intrinsic Ac activity and ceramide on the course of <i>Plasmodium</i> infection remains elusive. Here, we use Ac-deficient mice with ubiquitously increased ceramide levels to elucidate the role of endogenous Ac activity in a murine malaria model. Interestingly, ablation of Ac leads to alleviated parasitemia associated with decreased T cell responses in the early phase of <i>Plasmodium yoelii</i> (<i>P. yoelii</i>) infection. Mechanistically, we identified dysregulated erythropoiesis with reduced numbers of reticulocytes, the preferred host cells of <i>P. yoelii</i>, in Ac-deficient mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that administration of the Ac inhibitor carmofur to wild type mice has similar effects on <i>P. yoelii</i> infection and erythropoiesis. Notably, therapeutic carmofur treatment after manifestation of <i>P. yoelii</i> infection is efficient in reducing parasitemia. Hence, our results provide evidence for the involvement of Ac and ceramide in controlling <i>P. yoelii</i> infection by regulating red blood cell development.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Unfolding and identification of membrane proteins in situ</a></h4>

              
                Single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) uses the cantilever tip of an AFM to apply a force able to unfold a single protein. The obtained force-distance curve encodes the unfolding pathway, and from its analysis it is possible to characterize the folded domains. SMFS has been mostly used to study the unfolding of purified proteins, in solution or reconstituted in a lipid bilayer. Here, we describe a pipeline for analyzing membrane proteins based on SMFS, that involves the isolation of the plasma membrane of single cells and the harvesting of force-distance curves directly from it. We characterized and identified the embedded membrane proteins combining, within a Bayesian framework, the information of the shape of the obtained curves, with the information from Mass Spectrometry and proteomic databases. The pipeline was tested with purified/reconstituted proteins and applied to five cell types where we classified the unfolding of their most abundant membrane proteins. We validated our pipeline by overexpressing 4 constructs, and this allowed us to gather structural insights of the identified proteins, revealing variable elements in the loop regions. Our results set the basis for the investigation of the unfolding of membrane proteins <i>in situ</i>, and for performing proteomics from a membrane fragment.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Live-cell imaging in human colonic monolayers reveals ERK waves limit the stem cell compartment to maintain epithelial homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                The establishment and maintenance of different cellular compartments in tissues is a universal requirement across all metazoans. Maintaining the correct ratio of cell types in time and space allows tissues to form patterned compartments and perform complex functions. Patterning is especially evident in the human colon, where tissue homeostasis is maintained by stem cells in crypt structures that balance proliferation and differentiation. Here, we developed a human 2D patient derived organoid (PDO) screening platform to study tissue patterning and kinase pathway dynamics in single cells. Using this system, we discovered that waves of ERK signaling induced by apoptotic cells play a critical role in maintaining tissue patterning and homeostasis. If ERK is activated acutely across all cells instead of in wavelike patterns, then tissue patterning and stem cells are lost. Conversely, if ERK activity is inhibited, then stem cells become unrestricted and expand dramatically. This work demonstrates that the colonic epithelium requires coordinated ERK signaling dynamics to maintain patterning and tissue homeostasis. Our work reveals how ERK can antagonize stem cells while supporting cell replacement and the function of the gut.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Time-resolved parameterization of aperiodic and periodic brain activity</a></h4>

              
                Macroscopic neural dynamics comprise both aperiodic and periodic signal components. Recent advances in parameterizing neural power spectra offer practical tools for evaluating these features separately. Although neural signals vary dynamically and express non-stationarity in relation to ongoing behaviour and perception, current methods yield static spectral decompositions. Here, we introduce Spectral Parameterization Resolved in Time (SPRiNT) as a novel method for decomposing complex neural dynamics into periodic and aperiodic spectral elements in a time-resolved manner. First, we demonstrate, with naturalistic synthetic data, SPRiNT’s capacity to reliably recover time-varying spectral features. We emphasize SPRiNT’s specific strengths compared to other time-frequency parameterization approaches based on wavelets. Second, we use SPRiNT to illustrate how aperiodic spectral features fluctuate across time in empirical resting-state EEG data (n=178) and relate the observed changes in aperiodic parameters over time to participants’ demographics and behaviour. Lastly, we use SPRiNT to demonstrate how aperiodic dynamics relate to movement behaviour in intracranial recordings in rodents. We foresee SPRiNT responding to growing neuroscientific interests in the parameterization of time-varying neural power spectra and advancing the quantitation of complex neural dynamics at the natural time scales of behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neural synchronization is strongest to the spectral flux of slow music and depends on familiarity and beat salience</a></h4>

              
                Neural activity in the auditory system synchronizes to sound rhythms, and brain–environment synchronization is thought to be fundamental to successful auditory perception. Sound rhythms are often operationalized in terms of the sound’s amplitude envelope. We hypothesized that – especially for music – the envelope might not best capture the complex spectro-temporal fluctuations that give rise to beat perception and synchronized neural activity. This study investigated (1) neural synchronization to different musical features, (2) tempo-dependence of neural synchronization, and (3) dependence of synchronization on familiarity, enjoyment, and ease of beat perception. In this electroencephalography study, 37 human participants listened to tempo-modulated music (1–4 Hz). Independent of whether the analysis approach was based on temporal response functions (TRFs) or reliable components analysis (RCA), the spectral flux of music – as opposed to the amplitude envelope – evoked strongest neural synchronization. Moreover, music with slower beat rates, high familiarity, and easy-to-perceive beats elicited the strongest neural response. Our results demonstrate the importance of spectro-temporal fluctuations in music for driving neural synchronization, and highlight its sensitivity to musical tempo, familiarity, and beat salience.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">DNA passes through cohesin’s hinge as well as its Smc3–kleisin interface</a></h4>

              
                The ring model proposes that sister chromatid cohesion is mediated by co-entrapment of sister DNAs inside a single tripartite cohesin ring. The model explains how Scc1 cleavage triggers anaphase but has hitherto only been rigorously tested using small circular mini-chromosomes in yeast, where covalently circularizing the ring by crosslinking its three interfaces induces catenation of individual and sister DNAs. If the model applies to real chromatids, then the ring must have a DNA entry gate essential for mitosis. Whether this is situated at the Smc3/Scc1 or Smc1/Smc3 hinge interface is an open question. We have previously demonstrated DNA entrapment by cohesin in vitro (Collier et al., 2020). Here we show that cohesin in fact possesses two DNA gates, one at the Smc3/Scc1 interface and a second at the Smc1/3 hinge. Unlike the Smc3/Scc1 interface, passage of DNAs through SMC hinges depends on both Scc2 and Scc3, a pair of regulatory subunits necessary for entrapment in vivo. This property together with the lethality caused by locking this interface but not that between Smc3 and Scc1 in vivo suggests that passage of DNAs through the hinge is essential for building sister chromatid cohesion. Passage of DNAs through the Smc3/Scc1 interface is necessary for cohesin’s separase-independent release from chromosomes and may therefore largely serve as an exit gate.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The number of cytokinesis nodes in mitotic fission yeast scales with cell size</a></h4>

              
                Cytokinesis nodes are assemblies of stoichiometric ratios of proteins associated with the plasma membrane, which serve as precursors for the contractile ring during cytokinesis by fission yeast. The total number of nodes is uncertain, because of the limitations of the methods used previously. Here, we used the ~140 nm resolution of Airyscan super-resolution microscopy to measure the fluorescence intensity of small, single cytokinesis nodes marked with Blt1-mEGFP in live fission yeast cells early in mitosis. The ratio of the total Blt1-mEGFP fluorescence in the broad band of cytokinesis nodes to the average fluorescence of a single node gives about 190 single cytokinesis nodes in wild-type fission yeast cells early in mitosis. Most, but not all of these nodes condense into a contractile ring. The number of cytokinesis nodes scales with cell size in four strains tested, although large diameter <i>rga4Δ</i> mutant cells form somewhat fewer cytokinesis nodes than expected from the overall trend. The Pom1 kinase restricts cytokinesis nodes from the ends of cells, but the surface density of Pom1 on the plasma membrane around the equators of cells is similar with a wide range of node numbers, so Pom1 does not control cytokinesis node number. However, when the concentrations of either kinase Pom1 or kinase Cdr2 were varied with the <i>nmt1</i> promoter, the numbers of cytokinesis nodes increased above a baseline of about ~190 with the total cellular concentration of either kinase.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Differentiation signals from glia are fine-tuned to set neuronal numbers during development</a></h4>

              
                Neural circuit formation and function require that diverse neurons are specified in appropriate numbers. Known strategies for controlling neuronal numbers involve regulating either cell proliferation or survival. We used the <i>Drosophila</i> visual system to probe how neuronal numbers are set. Photoreceptors from the eye-disc induce their target field, the lamina, such that for every unit eye there is a corresponding lamina unit (column). Although each column initially contains ~6 post-mitotic lamina precursors, only 5 differentiate into neurons, called L1-L5; the 'extra' precursor, which is invariantly positioned above the L5 neuron in each column, undergoes apoptosis. Here, we showed that a glial population called the outer chiasm giant glia (xg<sup>O</sup>), which resides below the lamina, secretes multiple ligands to induce L5 differentiation in response to EGF from photoreceptors. By forcing neuronal differentiation in the lamina, we uncovered that though fated to die, the 'extra' precursor is specified as an L5. Therefore, two precursors are specified as L5s but only one differentiates during normal development. We found that the row of precursors nearest to xg<sup>O</sup> differentiate into L5s and, in turn, antagonise differentiation signalling to prevent the 'extra' precursors from differentiating, resulting in their death. Thus, an intricate interplay of glial signals and feedback from differentiating neurons defines an invariant and stereotyped pattern of neuronal differentiation and programmed cell death to ensure that lamina columns each contain exactly one L5 neuron

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Perceptual learning improves discrimination while distorting appearance</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual learning, a form of adult brain plasticity that produces improved discrimination, has been studied in various tasks and senses. However, it is unknown whether and how this improved discrimination alters stimulus appearance. Here, in addition to a discrimination task, we used an estimation task to investigate how training affects stimulus appearance in human adults. Before and after training, observers were shown stimuli composed of dots moving slightly clockwise or counter-clockwise horizontal, whose appearance has been shown to be biased away from horizontal. Observers were subdivided into three groups: Those who (1) trained in a discrimination task; (2) trained in an estimation task; (3) did not train. Training improved discrimination accuracy and decreased coherence thresholds. Counterintuitively, training also distorted appearance, substantially exacerbating estimation biases. These changes occurred in both training groups (but not in the no-training control group), suggesting a common learning mechanism. We developed a computational observer model that simulates performance on both discrimination and estimation tasks. The model incorporates three components: (1) the internal representation favors cardinal motion directions, which are most common in the natural environment; (2) in the estimation task, observers implicitly categorize motion, conditioning their estimates on this; and (3) both types of training induce an increase in the precision of representation of trained motions. We find that the simulations of the model, fit to individual observer data, can account for their improved discrimination and increased estimation bias. We conclude that perceptual learning improves discrimination while simultaneously distorting appearance.

                Advances in theoretical understanding are frequently unlocked by access to large, diverse experimental datasets. Olfactory neuroscience and psychophysics remain years behind the other senses in part because rich datasets linking olfactory stimuli with their corresponding percepts, behaviors, and neural pathways underlying this transformation, remain scarce. Here we present a concerted effort to unlock and unify dozens of stimulus-linked olfactory datasets across species and modalities under a unified framework called Pyrfume. We present examples of how researchers might use Pyrfume to conduct novel analyses uncovering new principles, introduce trainees to the field, or construct benchmarks for machine olfaction.

                Animals use information about gravity and other destabilizing forces to balance and navigate through their environment. Measuring how brains respond to these forces requires considerable technical knowledge and/or financial resources. We present a simple alternative: Tilt In Place Microscopy (TIPM). TIPM is a low-cost and non-invasive way to measure neural activity following rapid changes in body orientation. Here we used TIPM to study vestibulospinal neurons in larval zebrafish during and immediately after roll tilts. Vestibulospinal neurons responded with reliable increases in activity that varied as a function of ipsilateral tilt amplitude. TIPM differentiated tonic (i.e. sustained tilt) from phasic responses, revealing coarse topography of stimulus sensitivity in the lateral vestibular nucleus. Neuronal variability across repeated sessions was minor relative to trial-to-trial variability, allowing us to use TIPM for longitudinal studies of the same neurons across two developmental timepoints. There, we observed global increases in response strength, and systematic changes in the neural representation of stimulus direction. Our data extend classical characterization of the body tilt representation by vestibulospinal neurons and establish TIPM's utility to study the neural basis of balance, especially in developing animals.

	<p>Severe Acquired Brain Injury (sABI) is a leading cause of disability and requires intensive rehabilitation treatment. Discharge from the rehabilitation ward is a key moment in patient management. Delays in patient discharge can adversely affect hospital productivity and increase healthcare costs. The discharge should be structured from the hospital admission toward the most appropriate environment. The purpose of our study is to investigate early predictors of outcome for discharge in older adults with sABI. A retrospective study was performed on 22 patients who were admitted to an intensive neurorehabilitation unit between June 2019 and December 2021. Patients were divided into two outcome categories, good outcome (GO) or poor outcome (PO), based on discharge destination, and the possible prognostic factors were analyzed at one and two months after admission. Among the factors analyzed, changes in the Disability Rating Scale (DRS) and Level of Cognitive Functioning (LCF) at the first and second month of hospitalization were predictive of GO at discharge (DRS, p = 0.025; LCF, p = 0.011). The presence of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy at two months after admission was also significantly associated with PO (p = 0.038). High Body Mass Index (BMI) and the presence of sepsis at one month after admission were possible predictors of PO (BMI p = 0.048; sepsis p = 0.014). An analysis of dynamic predictors could be useful to guarantee an early evaluation of hospital discharge in frail patients with sABI.</p>

	<p>Previous experimental studies have reported clear differences between native speakers and second language (L2) learners as concerns their capacity to extract and exploit morphosyntactic information during online processing. We examined the online processing of nominal case morphology in Korean by native speakers and L2 learners by contrasting canonical (SOV) and scrambled (OSV) structures, across auditory (Experiment 1) and written (Experiment 2) formats. Moreover, we compared different instances of nominal case marking: accusative (NOM-ACC) and dative (NOM-DAT). During auditory processing, Koreans showed incremental processing based on case information, with no effect of scrambling or specific case marking. In contrast, the L2 group showed no evidence of predictive processing and was negatively impacted by scrambling, especially for the accusative. During reading, both Koreans and the L2 group showed a cost of scrambling on first pass reading times, specifically for the dative. Lastly, L2 learners showed better comprehension for scrambled dative than accusative structures across formats. The current set of results show that format, the specific case marking, and word order all affect the online processing of nominal case morphology.</p>

	<p>Virtual reality (VR) technology provides highly immersive depth perception experiences; nevertheless, stereoscopic visual fatigue (SVF) has become an important factor currently hindering the development of VR applications. However, there is scant research on the underlying neural mechanism of SVF, especially those induced by VR displays, which need further research. In this paper, a Go/NoGo paradigm based on disparity variations is proposed to induce SVF associated with depth perception, and the underlying neural mechanism of SVF in a VR environment was investigated. The effects of disparity variations as well as SVF on the temporal characteristics of visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were explored. Point-by-point permutation statistical with repeated measures ANOVA results revealed that the amplitudes and latencies of the posterior VEP component P2 were modulated by disparities, and posterior P2 amplitudes were modulated differently by SVF in different depth perception situations. Cortical source localization analysis was performed to explore the original cortex areas related to certain fatigue levels and disparities, and the results showed that posterior P2 generated from the precuneus could represent depth perception in binocular vision, and therefore could be performed to distinguish SVF induced by disparity variations. Our findings could help to extend an understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying depth perception and SVF as well as providing beneficial information for improving the visual experience in VR applications.</p>

Early sensory neurons modulate their average firing rates in response to some features of the external stimulus, creating tuned responses. In early visual areas, these modulations (or tunings) are predominantly single-peaked. However, periodic tuning, as exhibited by grid cells, has been linked to a significant increase in decoding performance. Does this imply that the tuning curves in early visual areas are sub-optimal? We argue that the time scale at which neurons encode information is imperative to understanding the relative advantages of single-peaked and periodic tuning curves. Because, if decoding ability scales differently with time for the different shapes of tuning curves, the time scale at which the neurons operate becomes critical. Here, we show that the possibility of catastrophic (large) errors due to overlapping neural responses for distinct stimulus conditions creates a trade-off between decoding time and decoding ability. Unfortunately, standard theoretical measures such as Fisher information do not capture these errors. We investigate how (very) short decoding times and stimulus dimensionality affect the optimal shape of tuning curves for stimuli with finite domains. In particular, we focus on the spatial periods of the tuning curves (or the number of "peaks") for a class of circular tuning curves. We show a general trend for minimal decoding time, i.e., the shortest decoding time required to produce a statistically reliable signal, to increase with increasing Fisher information implying a trade-off between accuracy and speed. This trade-off is reinforced whenever the stimulus dimensionality is high or there is ongoing activity. Thus, given constraints on processing speed, we present normative arguments for the existence of single-peaked, rather than a periodic, tuning organization observed in early visual areas.

                We advance a model of the Mushroom Body of the Drosophila brain based on the recently published fruit fly brain connectome. We quantify the effect of the connectivity from antennal lobe projection neurons to Kenyon Cells (KCs) and the effect of feedback between KCs and the anterior paired lateral (APL) neuron on the representation of odorants at the KC level. We then characterize odorant representation in the mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) as a function of semantics represented by the dopaminergic neurons (DANs). Finally, we evaluate the performance of associative learning in the MB that endows pure odorants with DAN semantics.

                The ability to compare quantities of visual objects with two distinct measures, proportion and difference, is observed in newborn animals. Nevertheless, how this function originates in the brain, even before training, remains unknown. Here, we show that neuronal tuning for quantity comparison can arise spontaneously in completely untrained deep neural networks. Using a biologically inspired model neural network, we found that units selective to proportions and differences between visual quantities emerge in randomly initialized networks and that they enable the network to perform quantity comparison tasks. Further analysis shows that two distinct tunings to proportion and difference both originate from a random summation of monotonic, nonlinear responses to changes in relative quantities. Notably, we found that a slight difference in the nonlinearity profile determines the type of measure. Our results suggest that visual quantity comparisons are primitive types of functions that can emerge spontaneously in random feedforward networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The effects of acute Methylene Blue administration on cerebral blood flow and metabolism in humans and rats</a></h4>

              
                Methylene Blue (MB) is a brain-penetrating drug with putative neuroprotective, antioxidant and metabolic enhancing effects. In vitro studies suggest that MB enhances mitochondrial complexes activity. However, no study has directly assessed the haemodynamic and metabolic effects of MB in the human brain.

We used in vivo neuroimaging to measure the effect of MB on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and brain metabolism in humans and in rats. Two doses of MB (0.5 and 1 mg/kg in humans; 2 and 4 mg/kg in rats; iv) induced reductions in global cerebral blood flow (CBF) in humans (F(1.74, 12.17)5.82, p=0.02) and rats (F(1,5)26.04, p=0.0038). Human cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) was also significantly reduced (F(1.26, 8.84)8.01, p=0.016), as was the rat cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRglu) (t=2.6(16) p=0.018).

This was contrary to our hypothesis that MB will increase CBF and energy metrics. Nevertheless, our results were reproducible across species and dose dependent. One possible explanation is that the concentrations used, although clinically relevant, reflect MBs hormetic effects, i.e., higher concentrations produce inhibitory rather than augmentation effects on metabolism. Additionally, here we used healthy volunteers and healthy rats with normal cerebral metabolism where MBs ability to enhance cerebral metabolism might be limited.

                In socially monogamous prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster), parental behaviors not only occur in mothers and fathers, but also can exist in virgin males ("parental"). However, some virgin males display aggressive behaviors towards conspecific pups ("attacker"). Although this behavioral dichotomy in response to pup exposure has been well documented, little is known about the gene expression changes underlie the parental behavioral differences and their regulatory mechanisms. To address this, we profiled the transcriptome and DNA methylome of hippocampal dentate gyrus of four prairie vole groups, attacker virgin males, parental virgin males, fathers, and mothers. We found a concordant pattern of gene transcription in parental virgin males and fathers, when comparing to the attacker group. The methylome analysis also revealed signaling pathways enriched for epigenetic changes involving both receptor-mediated and secondary messenger signaling across both behavioral phenotypes and sexual experiences. Furthermore, we found correlations between gene expression changes and DNA methylation differences between attacker and parental virgin males, which suggests a canonical gene expression regulatory role of DNA methylation in paternal care. Therefore, our study presents an integrated view of transcriptome and epigenome that provides a DNA epigenetic based molecular insight of paternal behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Localizing the Sources of Modulations of the P3m Component by Task Difficulty</a></h4>

              
                1The P3m is a late component of the event-related field (ERF) and is assumed to reflect the allocation of resources in various cognitive domains. The amplitude of the P3m can be affected by several task parameters, like stimulus probability, inter-stimulus interval and task difficulty. The task difficulty can alter the P3m amplitude, depending on which mechanisms are involved. The sources of the P3m are located in several brain areas, suggesting a widespread network generating the P3m. Which of these sources of the P3m give rise to the task-difficulty induced amplitude modulation are not well investigated. However, localizing these sources could pave the way for intervention studies with non-invasive brain stimulation methods, which might be suitable to modulate the pathologically altered P3m emerging in various psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. We designed a MEG-study with a visual oddball-like task with two different task difficulties to 1) show decreased P3m amplitudes induced by increased task difficulty and 2) estimate the sources of this P3m modulation. Additionally, the influence of the increased task difficulty on behavioral outcomes were analyzed. The P3m amplitude decreased significantly in the hard condition compared to easy condition. Furthermore, the hit rate for standard trials decreased significantly, while the reaction times increased for both, targets and standards. For this specific visual oddball-like task, the sources of the task difficulty dependent P3m amplitude modulation are located in the centro-parietal regions.

                ObjectiveThe role of astrocytes largely remains to be explored in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD). Due to limited study models and inaccessibility to patient-tissue samples, we differentiated astrocytes from patient fibroblast-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs) which provided a unique system to investigate molecular and etiopathogenetic mechanisms, identify targets, and develop therapeutic agents for X-ALD.

MethodsWe reprogrammed fibroblasts from adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) and cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (cALD) patients carrying ABCD1 with pathogenic variants and a control patient to generate iPSCs. We differentiated iPSCs into astrocytes and performed transmission electron microscopy, gene expression, immunoblotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, miRNA-Seq, and lipidomics to characterize phenotypic and molecular features of patient-derived astrocytes.

ResultsThese differentiated astrocytes exhibit diseased phenotypes and replicate biochemical and molecular changes found in patients. We confirmed the deletion of ABCD1 gene-encoded ALD protein and identified ABCD1 variant-driven very long chain fatty acid deposition in AMN and cALD astrocytes. Especially, cALD astrocytes showed increased glycolysis, increased signal transducer and transcription activator (STAT)3 activation, higher miR-9 expression in miRNA-Seq analysis, and reduced expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as arginase-1 and mannose receptor C-type-1. Consequently, Toll-like receptor-signaling via myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-{kappa}B; p52 and p65) induced STAT3 and an altered miR-9 expression is a potential contributor to inflammatory milieu in cALD while interleukin-6 -induced anti-inflammatory cytokine production and increased chemotactic CCL-2 (MCP-1) production in AMN potentially favors microglial recruitment protecting its further progression.

InterpretationWe demonstrate for the first time that patient iPSC-derived astrocytes mimic and recapitulate neuroinflammatory and biochemical defects of X-ALD and provide an in vitro cellular system to study X-ALD.

SUMMARY FOR SOCIAL MEDIAX-adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is an inherited progressive metabolic disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the ABCD1 gene and thus accumulation of very long chain fatty acids in body fluids and tissues. In the absence of genotype-phenotype correlation, clinical outcomes of X-ALD: cerebral inflammatory adrenoleukodystrophy (cALD) and milder adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) cannot be predicted and the mechanism of neuroinflammatory response in cALD phenotype remains unknown. Our study investigated metabolic and genetic profile of patient astrocytes derived from healthy control (CTL), AMN, and cALD skin fibroblast-induced pluripotent stem cells with an objective to develop a direct translatable patient-derived model of X-ALD. We, for the first-time, show that astrocytes of cALD revealed significantly higher phosphorylation of STAT3 which can be due to increased Toll-like receptor expression compared to that of AMN whereas AMN astrocytes showed a higher interleukin-6 signaling, resulting in higher anti-inflammatory activity compared to CTL and cALD. In our first report of miRNA sequencing in X-ALD astrocytes, we observed that miR-9 is associated with disease severity. Patient-iPSC derived astrocytes used in this study provide a cellular model system to study mechanisms underlying disease severity in AMN and cALD, and a platform to identify prospective therapeutic targets and investigate or screen drugs for X-ALD.

                Visual attention is a fundamental cognitive operation that allows the brain to evoke behaviors based on the most important stimulus features. Although mouse models offer immense potential to gain a circuit-level understanding of this phenomenon, links between visual attention and behavioral decisions in mice are not well understood. Here, we describe a new behavioral task for mice that addresses this limitation. We trained mice to detect weak vertical bars in a background of checkerboard noise while audiovisual cues manipulated their spatial attention. We then modified a reverse correlation method from human studies to link behavioral decisions to stimulus locations and features. We show that mice attended to stimulus locations just rostral of their optical axis, which was highly sensitive for vertically oriented stimulus energy whose spatial frequency matched those of the weak vertical bars. We found that the tuning of sensitivity to orientation and spatial frequency grew stronger during training, was multiplicatively scaled with attention, and approached that of an ideal observer. These results provide a new task to measure spatial- and feature-based attention in mice which can be leveraged with new recording methods to uncover attentional circuits.

                The creation of mutant mice has been invaluable for advancing biomedical science, but is too time- and resource-intensive for investigating the full range of mutations and polymorphisms. Cell culture models are therefore an invaluable complement to mouse models, especially for cell-autonomous pathways like the circadian clock. In this study, we quantitatively assessed the use of CRISPR to create cell models in MEFs as compared to mouse models. We generated two point mutations in the clock genes Per1 and Per2 in mice and in MEFs using the same sgRNAs and repair templates for HDR and quantified the frequency of the mutations by digital PCR. The frequency was about an order of magnitude higher in mouse zygotes compared to that in MEFs. However, the mutation frequency in MEFs was still high enough for clonal isolation by simple screening of a few dozen individual cells. The Per mutant cells that we generated provide important new insights into the role of the PAS domain in regulating PER phosphorylation, a key aspect of the circadian clock mechanism. Accurate quantification of the mutation frequency in bulk MEF populations provides a critical basis for optimizing CRISPR protocols and time/resource planning for generating cell models for further studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Resting fMRI-guided TMS evokes subgenual anterior cingulate response in depression</a></h4>

              
                Depression alleviation following treatment with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) tends to be more effective when TMS is targeted to cortical areas with high resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) with the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC). However, it has not yet been confirmed that rsFC-guided TMS coil placement leads to TMS modulation of the sgACC. For each participant (N=115, 34 depressed patients), a peak rsFC cortical  hotspot for the sgACC and control targets were prospectively identified. Single pulses of TMS interleaved with fMRI readouts were then administered to these targets and established significant downstream fMRI BOLD responses in the sgACC. We then marked an association between TMS-evoked BOLD responses in the sgACC and rsFC between the stimulation site and sgACC. This effect was qualified by a difference between healthy and patient participants: only in depressed patients, positively connected sites of stimulation led to the strongest evoked responses in the sgACC. Our results highlight rsFC-based targeting as a viable strategy to causally modulate sgACC subcortical targets and further suggest that cortical sites with high positive rsFC to the sgACC might represent an alternative target for the treatment of depression.

                AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the central pacemaker for mammalian circadian rhythms. As such, this ensemble of cell-autonomous neuronal oscillators with divergent periods must maintain coordinated oscillations. To investigate ultrastructural features enabling such synchronization, 805 coronal ultrathin sections of mouse SCN tissue were imaged with electron microscopy and aligned into a volumetric stack, from which selected neurons within the SCN core were reconstructed in silica. We found that clustered SCN core neurons were physically connected to each other via multiple large soma-to-soma plate-like contacts. In some cases, a sliver of a glial process was interleaved. These contacts were large, covering on average [~]21% of apposing neuronal somata. It is possible that contacts may be the electrophysiological substrate for synchronization between SCN neurons. Such plate-like contacts may explain why synchronization of SCN neurons is maintained even when chemical synaptic transmission or electrical synaptic transmission via gap junctions is blocked. Such ephaptic contact-mediated synchronization among nearby neurons may therefore underlie the wave-like oscillations of circadian core clock genes and calcium signals observed in the SCN.

SO_SCPLOWIGNIFICANCEC_SCPLOWThree-dimensional reconstruction of SCN tissue via serial electron microscopy revealed a novel structural feature of SCN neurons that may account for inter-neuronal synchronization that persists even when usual mechanisms of neuronal communication are blocked. We found that SCN core neurons are connected by multiple soma-soma contact specializations, ultrastructural elements that could enable synchronization of tightly packed neurons organized in clustered networks. This extensive network of plate-like soma-soma contacts among clustered SCN neurons may provide insight into how [~]20,000 autonomous neuronal oscillators with a broad range of intrinsic periods remain synchronized in the absence of ordinary communication modalities, thereby conferring the resilience required for the SCN to function as the mammalian circadian pacemaker.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Low noise HRTFs and delay line corrections are detrimental to the prediction of ITD discrimination thresholds from environmental statistics</a></h4>

              
                Interaural Time Difference (ITD) is the main cue for azimuthal auditory perception in humans. ITDs at each frequency contribute differently to azimuth discrimination, which can be quantified by their azimuthal Fisher Information. Consistently, human ITD discrimination thresholds are predicted by the azimuthal information. However, this prediction is poor for frequencies below 500 Hz. Such poor prediction could be ascribed to the strategy of quantifying azimuthal information using HRTFs obtained in unnaturalistic anechoic chambers or by using a direct method which does not incorporate the delay lines proposed by the Jeffress-Colburn model. In the present study, we obtained ITD discrimination thresholds from extensive sampling across frequency and ITD, and applied multiple strategies for quantifying azimuthal information. These strategies employed HRTFs obtained in realistic and anechoic chambers, with and without considering delay lines. We found that ITD discriminability thresholds across the complete range of frequencies are better predicted by azimuthal information conveyed by ITD cues when (1) we use naturalistic high-noise HRTFs, and (2) ITD delay compensation is not applied. Our results support that auditory perception is shaped by natural environments, which include high reverberation in low frequencies. Moreover, we also suggest that delay lines are not a crucial feature for determining ITD discrimination thresholds in the human auditory system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The BigMac dataset: an open resource combining multi-contrast MRI and microscopy in the macaque brain</a></h4>

              
                Understanding brain structure and function often requires combining data across different modalities and scales to link microscale cellular structures to macroscale features of whole brain organisation. Here we introduce the BigMac dataset, a resource combining in vivo MRI, extensive postmortem MRI and multi-contrast microscopy for multimodal characterisation of a single whole macaque brain. The data spans modalities (MRI and microscopy), tissue states (in vivo and postmortem), and four orders of spatial magnitude, from microscopy images with micrometre or sub-micrometre resolution, to MRI signals on the order of millimetres. Crucially, the MRI and microscopy images are carefully co-registered together to facilitate quantitative multimodal analyses. Here we detail the acquisition, curation, and first release of the data, that together make BigMac a unique, openly-disseminated resource available to researchers worldwide. Further, we demonstrate example analyses and opportunities afforded by the data, including improvement of connectivity estimates from ultra-high angular resolution diffusion MRI, neuroanatomical insight provided by polarised light imaging and myelin-stained histology, and the joint analysis of MRI and microscopy data for reconstruction of the microscopy-inspired connectome. All data and code are made openly available.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Death induced by survival gene elimination (DISE) contributes to neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundAlzheimers disease (AD) is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, but the specific events that cause cell death remain poorly understood. Death Induced by Survival gene Elimination (DISE) is a recently discovered powerful cell death mechanism mediated by short (s) RNAs including micro (mi) RNAs acting through the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC). G-rich 6mer seed sequences in the sRNAs (position 2-7) target hundreds of C-rich seed matches in genes essential for cell survival resulting in the simultaneous activation of multiple cell death pathways. The RISC of most cells is occupied by miRNAs with nontoxic 6mer seeds, which may protect them from DISE by blocking loading of toxic sRNAs. However, during aging when miRNA expression decreases, toxic sRNAs may enter the RISC more readily leaving cells primed for DISE. Whether DISE contributes to neuronal loss in a neurodegenerative disease such as AD has not been evaluated.

MethodsUsing Ago precipitation and RNAseq (Ago-RP-Seq) combined with SPOROS, a recently developed bioinformatics pipeline to analyze small RNAseq data with respect to 6mer seed toxicity, we analyzed RISC bound sRNAs (R-sRNAs) in in vitro models and in the brains of multiple in vivo AD mouse models, aged mice, and AD patients.

ResultsWe find that in in vitro cell line studies, in mouse models that show neurodegeneration, and in the aging brain R-sRNAs shift to more toxic seeds. In contrast, in cells that survived in post-mortem brains of AD patients and the brains of "SuperAgers", individuals over age 80 who have superior memory performance, R-sRNAs shift to more nontoxic seeds, supporting a protective function of miRNAs.

ConclusionOur data provide first evidence of a contribution of DISE to the neurotoxicity seen in AD suggesting that increasing the levels of protective miRNAs in the brain or blocking the activity of toxic R-sRNAs could lead to a novel way of treating the disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Proactive interhemispheric disinhibition supports response preparation during selective stopping</a></h4>

              
                Response inhibition is essential for terminating inappropriate actions. A substantial delay may occur in the response of the non-stopped effector when only part of a multi-effector action is terminated. This stopping-interference effect has been attributed to nonselective response inhibition processes and can be reduced with proactive cueing. This study aimed to elucidate the role of interhemispheric primary motor cortex (M1-M1) influences during selective stopping with proactive cueing. We hypothesized that stopping-interference would be reduced as stopping certainty increased, owing to proactive recruitment of interhemispheric facilitation or interhemispheric inhibition when cued to respond or stop, respectively. Twenty-three healthy human participants performed a bimanual anticipatory response inhibition paradigm with cues signaling the likelihood of a stop-signal occurring. Dual-coil transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to determine corticomotor excitability (CME), interhemispheric inhibition (IHI), and interhemispheric facilitation (IHF) in the left hand at rest and during response preparation. Response times slowed and stopping-interference decreased with cues signaling increased stopping certainty. Proactive response inhibition was marked by a reduced rate of rise and faster cancel time in electromyographical bursts during stopping. There was a nonselective release of IHI but not CME from rest to in-task response preparation, while IHF was not observed in either context. An effector-specific CME but not IHF or IHI reduction was observed when the left hand was cued to stop. These findings indicate that the stopping-interference effect can be reduced through proactive suppression. Interhemispheric M1-M1 channels modulate inhibitory tone that supports responding, but not selective stopping, in a proactive response inhibition context.

Significance statementResponse inhibition is essential for terminating inappropriate actions and, in some cases, may be required for only part of a multi-effector action. The present study examined interhemispheric influences between the primary motor cortices during selective stopping with proactive cueing. Stopping selectivity was greater with increased stopping certainty and marked by proactive response inhibition of the hand cued to stop. Inhibitory interhemispheric influences were released during response preparation but were not affected by proactive cueing. These findings indicate that between-hand stopping can be selective with proactive cueing, but cue-related improvements are unlikely to reflect advance engagement of interhemispheric influences between primary motor cortices.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Characterizing the differential distribution and targets of Sumo paralogs in the mouse brain</a></h4>

              
                SUMOylation is an evolutionarily conserved and essential mechanism whereby Small Ubiquitin Like Modifiers, or SUMO proteins (Sumo in mice), are covalently bound to protein substrates in a highly dynamic and reversible manner. SUMOylation is involved in a variety of basic neurological processes including learning and memory, and central nervous system development, but is also linked with neurological disorders. However, studying SUMOylation in vivo remains challenging due to limited tools to study Sumo proteins and their targets in their native context. More complexity arises from the fact that Sumo1 and Sumo2 are [~]50% homologous, whereas Sumo2 and Sumo3 are nearly identical and indistinguishable with antibodies. While Sumo paralogues can compensate for one anothers loss, Sumo2 is highest expressed and only paralog essential for embryonic development making it critical to uncover roles specific to Sumo2 in vivo. To further examine the roles of Sumo2, and to begin to tease apart the redundancy and similarity between key Sumo paralogs, we generated (His6-)HA epitope-tagged Sumo2 knock-in mouse alleles, expanding the current Sumo knock-in mouse tool-kit comprising of the previously generated His6-HA-Sumo1 knock-in model. Using these HA-Sumo mouse lines, we performed whole brain imaging and mapping to the Allen Brain Atlas to analyze the relative distribution of the Sumo1 and Sumo2 paralogues in the adult mouse brain. We observed differential staining patterns between Sumo1 and Sumo2, including a partial localization of Sumo2 in nerve cell synapses of the hippocampus. Combining immunoprecipitation with mass spectrometry, we identified native substrates targeted by Sumo1 or Sumo2 in the mouse brain. We validated select hits using proximity ligation assays, further providing insight into the subcellular distribution of neuronal Sumo2-conjugates. These mouse models thus serve as valuable tools to study the cellular and biochemical roles of SUMOylation in the central nervous system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Examining Litter Specific Variability in Mice and its Impact on Neurodevelopmental Studies</a></h4>

              
                Our current understanding of litter variability in neurodevelopmental studies using mouse may limit translation of neuroscientific findings. Higher variance of measures across litters than within, often termed intra-litter likeness, may be attributable to pre- and postnatal environment. This study aimed to assess the litter-effect within behavioral assessments (2 timepoints), and anatomy using T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (4 timepoints) across 72 brain region volumes (36 C57bl/6J inbred mice; 7 litters: 19F/17M). Between-litter comparisons of brain and behavioral measures and their associations were evaluated using univariate and multivariate techniques. A power analysis using simulation methods was then performed modeling neurodevelopment and evaluating trade-offs between number-of-litters, mice-per-litter, and sample size. Our results show litter-specific developmental effects, from the adolescent period to adulthood for brain structure volumes and behaviors, and their associations in adulthood. Our power simulation analysis results suggest increasing the number-of-litters in experimental design to achieve the smallest total sample size for detecting different rates of change in specific brain regions. Our results also demonstrate how litter-specific effects may influence development and that increasing the litters to the total sample size ratio should be strongly considered when designing neurodevelopmental studies.

                Bushy neurons of the cochlear nucleus encode temporal fine structure and modulation of sound with high fidelity. However, the synaptic maps and electrotonic structures that underlie these properties are not specified in meaningful explanatory detail. We employed modern volume electron microscopy techniques to provide exact data on the numbers of synaptic inputs and their weights determined by the number of contained active zones, and the surface areas of all postsynaptic cellular compartments. Leveraging these high-resolution images, we discovered cabling of dendrite branches and new structures within dendrites, and identified non-innervated dendrites. We extend current nanoscale connectomic studies with methods to export cellular reconstructions into morphologically-constrained, biophysically-based predictive computational models. We reveal both coincidence detection and mixed supra/subthreshold modes of input convergence across the bushy cell population and show subthreshold inputs contribute to enhanced temporal encoding even in the presence of suprathreshold inputs. We demonstrate the variation of dendritic load and axon parameters and their importance in controlling excitability as potential homeostatic mechanisms, thereby defining heterogeneity in stimulus-evoked responses across the BC population.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuronal mitochondrial morphology is significantly affected by both fixative and oxygen level during perfusion</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in the brain have a uniquely polarized structure consisting of multiple dendrites and a single axon generated from a cell body. Interestingly, intracellular mitochondria also show strikingly polarized morphologies along the dendrites and axons: in cortical pyramidal neurons (PNs) dendritic mitochondria have a long and tubular shape, while axonal mitochondria are small and circular. Mitochondria play important roles in each compartment of the neuron by generating ATP and buffering calcium, thereby affecting synaptic transmission and neuronal development. In addition, mitochondrial shape, and thereby function, is dynamically altered by environmental stresses such as oxidative stress, or in various neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimers disease and Parkinsons disease. Although the importance of altered mitochondrial shape has been claimed by multiple studies, methods for studying this stress-sensitive organelle have not been standardized. Here we address the pertinent steps that influence mitochondrial morphology during experimental processes. We demonstrate that fixative solutions containing only paraformaldehyde (PFA), or that introduce hypoxic conditions during the procedure induce dramatic fragmentation of mitochondria both in vitro and in vivo. This disruption was not observed following the use of glutaraldehyde addition or oxygen supplementation, respectively. Finally, using pre-formed fibril -synuclein treated neurons, we show a difference between mitochondrial morphology when samples were fixed with PFA/glutaraldehyde or PFA/sucrose containing solutions, but not PFA alone. Our study provides optimized methods for examining mitochondrial morphology in neurons, and demonstrates that fixation conditions are critical when investigating the underlying cellular mechanisms involving mitochondria in physiological and neurodegenerative disease models.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Individual variability in neural event segmentation reflects stimulus content and interpretation</a></h4>

              
                Event segmentation is a spontaneous part of perception, important for processing continuous information and organizing it into memory. While neural and behavioral event segmentation show a degree of inter-subject consistency, meaningful individual variability exists atop these shared patterns. Here we characterized individual differences in the location of neural and behavioral event boundaries across four short movies that varied in both high- and low-level features and evoked variable interpretations. We studied the same individuals across movies to investigate the extent to which individual segmentation styles are stable irrespective of the stimulus (i.e., "trait-like") versus content-dependent. Results showed that across-subject event boundary alignment follows a posterior-to-anterior gradient that is tightly correlated with the rate of segmentation; slower segmenting regions that integrate information over longer time periods show more individual variability. We found that certain aspects of movie content--namely, continuity editing and social content--drive more shared boundaries and are better suited to pull out individual differences. We identified a subset of regions, specific to each movie, in which neural boundary locations are both aligned with behavioral boundaries during encoding and predictive of stimulus interpretation, suggesting that event segmentation may be a mechanism by which narratives generate variable memories and appraisals of stimuli.

                To prevent a fall when a disturbance to walking is encountered requires sensory information about the disturbance to be perceived, integrated, and then used to generate an appropriate corrective response. Prior research has shown that feedback of whole-body motion drives this corrective response. Here, we hypothesized that young adults also use whole-body motion to perceive locomotor disturbances. 15 subjects performed a locomotor discrimination task in which the supporting leg was slowed during stance every 8-12 steps to emulate subtle slips. The perception threshold of these disturbances was determined using a psychometrics approach and found to be 0.08 {+/-} 0.03 m/s. Whole-body feedback was examined through center-of-mass (CoM) kinematics and whole-body angular momentum (WBAM). Perturbation-induced deviations of CoM and WBAM were calculated in response to the two perturbation levels nearest each subjects perception threshold. Consistent with our hypothesis, we identified significantly higher perturbation induced deviations for perceived perturbations in sagittal-plane WBAM, anteroposterior CoM velocity, and mediolateral CoM position, velocity, and acceleration. Because whole body motion is not sensed directly but instead arises from the integration of various sensory feedback signals, we also explored local sensory feedback contributions to the perception of locomotor disturbances. Local sensory feedback was estimated through kinematic analogues of vision (head angle), vestibular (head angular velocity), proprioception (i.e., sagittal hip, knee, and ankle angles), and somatosensation (i.e., anterior-posterior & mediolateral center-of-pressure, COP). We identified significantly higher perturbation induced deviations for perceived perturbations in sagittal-plane ankle angle only. These results provide evidence for both whole-body feedback and ankle proprioception as important for the perception of subtle slip-like locomotor disturbances in young adults. Our interpretation is ankle proprioception is a dominant contributor to estimates of whole-body motion to perceive locomotor disturbances.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Does Functional Recovery Imply Stable Circuitry in the Spinal Animal?</a></h4>

              
                Spinal animals can regain locomotor function through gait training. However, the neural processes involved in this recovery are poorly understood. Here we use computer simulation to address if the reorganization of spinal circuits associated with the functional recovery leads to meaningful, stable circuitry function. Specifically, we develop a neuromuscular model of a spinalized rat whose circuitry can adapt based on two alternative Hebbian learning strategies, one designed to guide the circuitry back to its normal pre-injury state and the other designed to destabilize it and drive it into saturation. Exposing the model to simulated gait training, we find that both strategies lead to recovery of locomotor function as defined by the outcome measures reported in studies with spinal rats. If anything, the results obtained with the destabilizing learning strategy seem to agree more with animal observations, since it produces similarly excessive amplitudes in muscle activity. Our results suggest that gait training of spinalized animals does not necessarily effect a meaningful recovery of their spinal circuitry function. More experimental work should be directed to clarify this point, as it may have grave implications for the potential of gait rehabilitation in patients with motor complete injuries of the spinal cord.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Beta spectral power during sleep is associated with impaired recall of extinguished fear</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundThe failure to retain memory for extinguished fear plays a major role in the maintenance of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with successful extinction recall necessary for symptom reduction. Disturbed sleep, a hallmark symptom of PTSD, impairs fear extinction recall. However, our understanding of the electrophysiological mechanisms underpinning sleeps role in extinction retention remain underdetermined.

MethodsWe reanalyzed data from two existing datasets examining the relationship between the microarchitecture of sleep and extinction recall in healthy controls (Study 1, n = 46) and a pilot study in individuals with PTSD (Study 2, n = 12). In both studies, participants underwent a fear conditioning and extinction protocol over the course of two days, with polysomnography sleep recording occurring between conditioning and extinction. Twenty-four hours after extinction learning, participants underwent extinction recall. Power spectral density (PSD) was computed for NREM and REM sleep during both pre- and post-extinction learning.

ResultsIncreased PSD in frequencies spanning the canonical beta band during pre-extinction learning sleep were associated with worse extinction recall in healthy participants (r = .41, p = .004). Beta PSD was shown to be highly stable across three nights of sleep (NREM intraclass correlation (ICC) = 0.93; REM ICC = 0.94). Individuals with PTSD were found to have increased beta PSD compared to healthy controls (NREM: p = .038; REM: p = .007), and beta PSD correlated with extinction recall in the PTSD group at a similar magnitude to controls (r = .39).

ConclusionsThe present findings suggest that beta band PSD may be a trait-like feature of the sleep EEG that is heightened in PTSD and associated with impaired fear extinction recall. Thus, beta PSD during sleep may reflect a trait marker for vulnerability to PTSD, specifically implicated in difficulties recalling extinguished fear.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Characterizing Cone Spectral Classification by Optoretinography</a></h4>

              
                Light propagation in photoreceptor outer segments is affected by photopigment absorption and the phototransduction amplification cascade. Photopigment absorption has been studied using retinal densitometry, while recently, optoretinography (ORG) has provided an avenue to probe changes in outer segment optical path length due to phototransduction. With adaptive optics (AO), both densitometry and ORG have been used for cone spectral classification, based on the differential bleaching signatures of the three cone types. Here, we characterize cone classification by ORG, implemented in an AO line-scan OCT and compare it against densitometry. The cone mosaics of five color normal subjects were classified using ORG showing high probability ([~]0.99), low error (<0.22%), high test-retest reliability ([~]97%) and short imaging durations (< 1 hour). Of these, the cone spectral assignments in two subjects were compared against AOSLO densitometry. High agreement (mean: 91%) was observed between the two modalities in these 2 subjects, with measurements conducted 6-7 years apart. Overall, ORG benefits from higher sensitivity and dynamic range to probe cone photopigments compared to densitometry, and thus provides greater fidelity for cone spectral classification.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Selective inhibition of excitatory synaptic transmission alters the emergent bursting dynamics of in vitro neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in vitro connect to each other and form neural networks that display emergent electrophysiological activity. This activity begins as spontaneous uncorrelated firing in the early phase of development, and as functional excitatory and inhibitory synapses mature, this activity typically emerges as spontaneous network bursts. Network bursts are events of coordinated global activation among many neurons interspersed with periods of silencing and are important for synaptic plasticity, neural information processing, and network computation. While bursting is the consequence of balanced excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) interactions, the functional mechanisms underlying their evolution from physiological to potentially pathophysiological states are still poorly understood. This is partly because we have limited knowledge of and access to the synaptic connections themselves. In this study, we used selective chemogenetic inhibition to target and disrupt excitatory synaptic transmission in in vitro neural networks to study functional response and recovery of spontaneous network bursts over time. We found that inhibition resulted in neural networks subsequently exhibiting high frequency network bursts with high number of spikes per bursts, and with up to 98% of all spikes being in network bursts. Our results imply that the disruption in excitatory synaptic transmission during early network development likely affected inhibitory synaptic maturity which resulted in an overall decrease in network inhibition at later stages. These findings give evidence to the importance of E/I balance in maintaining physiological bursting patterns in neural networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Invariance of object detection in untrained deep neural networks</a></h4>

              
                The ability to perceive visual objects with various types of transformations, such as rotation, translation, and scaling, is crucial for consistent object recognition. In machine learning, invariant object detection for a network is often implemented by augmentation with a massive number of training images, but the mechanism of invariant object detection in biological brains -- how invariance arises initially and whether it requires visual experience -- remains elusive. Here, using a model neural network of the hierarchical visual pathway of the brain, we show that invariance of object detection can emerge spontaneously in the complete absence of learning. First, we found that units selective to a particular object class arise in randomly initialized networks even before visual training. Intriguingly, these units show robust tuning to images of each object class under a wide range of image transformation types, such as viewpoint rotation. We confirmed that this "innate" invariance of object selectivity enables untrained networks to perform an object-detection task robustly, even with images that have been significantly modulated. Our computational model predicts that invariant object tuning originates from combinations of non-invariant units via random feedforward projections, and we confirmed that the predicted profile of feedforward projections is observed in untrained networks. Our results suggest that invariance of object detection is an innate characteristic that can emerge spontaneously in random feedforward networks.

                Mapping neuronal networks from 3-dimensional electron microscopy data still poses substantial reconstruction challenges, in particular for thin axons. Currently available automated image segmentation methods, while substantially progressed, still require human proof reading for many types of connectomic analyses. RoboEM, an AI-based self-steering 3D flight system trained to navigate along neurites using only EM data as input, substantially improves automated state-of-the-art segmentations and replaces human proof reading for more complex connectomic analysis problems, yielding computational annotation cost for cortical connectomes about 400-fold lower than the cost of manual error correction.

                Organisms process sensory information in the context of their own moving bodies, an idea referred to as embodiment. This idea is important for developmental neuroscience, and increasingly plays a role in robotics and systems neuroscience. The mechanisms that support such embodiment are unknown, but a manifestation could be the observation in mice of brain-wide neuromodulation, including in the primary visual cortex, driven by task-irrelevant spontaneous body movements. Here we tested this hypothesis in macaque monkeys, a primate model for human vision, by simultaneously recording visual cortex activity and facial and body movements. Activity in the visual cortex (V1, V2, V3,V3A) was associated with the animals' own movements, but this modulation was largely explained by the impact of the movements on the retinal image. These results suggest that embodiment in primate vision may be realized by input provided by the eyes themselves.

                A major cause of human deafness and vestibular dysfunction is permanent loss of the mechanosensory hair cells of the inner ear. In non-mammalian vertebrates such as zebrafish, regeneration of missing hair cells can occur throughout life. While a comparative approach has the potential to reveal the basis of such differential regenerative ability, the degree to which the inner ears of fish and mammals share common hair cells and supporting cell types remains unresolved. Here we perform single-cell RNA sequencing of the zebrafish inner ear at embryonic through adult stages to catalog the diversity of hair cell and non-sensory supporting cells. We identify a putative progenitor population for hair cells and supporting cells, as well as distinct hair cells and supporting cell types in the maculae versus cristae. The hair cell and supporting cell types differ from those described for the lateral line system, a distributed mechanosensory organ in zebrafish in which most studies of hair cell regeneration have been conducted. In the maculae, we identify two subtypes of hair cells that share gene expression with mammalian striolar or extrastriolar hair cells. In situ hybridization reveals that these hair cell subtypes occupy distinct spatial domains within the two major macular organs, the utricle and saccule, consistent with the reported distinct electrophysiological properties of hair cells within these domains. These findings suggest that primitive specialization of spatially distinct striolar and extrastriolar hair cells likely arose in the last common ancestor of fish and mammals. The similarities of inner ear cell type composition between fish and mammals also support using zebrafish as a relevant model for understanding inner ear-specific hair cell function and regeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Successful working memory linked to theta connectivity patterns in the hippocampal-entorhinal circuit</a></h4>

              
                Working memory (WM) is the ability to actively maintain information for a short time and is central to human behavior. Rodent studies have proposed that hippocampal-entorhinal communication supports WM maintenance. However, the exact neural mechanisms of this interaction in WM remains unclear in humans. To address these questions, we combined machine learning analyses with intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings from the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex (EC) in human participants, who maintained a set of letters in their WM. We found that WM maintenance was accompanied by elevated bidirectional hippocampal-EC information exchange via the theta band (2-8 Hz) and bidirectional cross-region theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). Further decoding analyses showed that the unidirectional inter-regional communication, with both theta oscillations in the hippocampus modulating EC gamma activity and theta band-coordinated information flow from the hippocampus, could decode correct performance at the level of participants. Taken together, our results demonstrate that theta functional coupling in the hippocampal-EC supports the maintenance of WM information via a specific pattern of frequency and direction. This connectivity-based coding could shed light on the neural mechanisms of WM processing.

	<p>It has been reported that attending to stimuli in visual modality can spread to task-irrelevant but synchronously presented stimuli in auditory modality, a phenomenon termed the cross-modal spread of attention, which could be either stimulus-driven or representation-driven depending on whether the visual constituent of an audiovisual object is further selected based on the object representation. The stimulus-driven spread of attention occurs whenever a task-irrelevant sound synchronizes with an attended visual stimulus, regardless of the cross-modal semantic congruency. The present study recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate whether the stimulus-driven cross-modal spread of attention could be modulated by audio-visual emotional congruency in a visual oddball task where emotion (positive/negative) was task-irrelevant. The results first demonstrated a prominent stimulus-driven spread of attention regardless of audio-visual emotional congruency by showing that for all audiovisual pairs, the extracted ERPs to the auditory constituents of audiovisual stimuli within the time window of 200&amp;amp;ndash;300 ms were significantly larger than ERPs to the same auditory stimuli delivered alone. However, the amplitude of this stimulus-driven auditory Nd component during 200&amp;amp;ndash;300 ms was significantly larger for emotionally incongruent than congruent audiovisual stimuli when their visual constituents&amp;amp;rsquo; emotional valences were negative. Moreover, the Nd was sustained during 300&amp;amp;ndash;400 ms only for the incongruent audiovisual stimuli with emotionally negative visual constituents. These findings suggest that although the occurrence of the stimulus-driven cross-modal spread of attention is independent of audio-visual emotional congruency, its magnitude is nevertheless modulated even when emotion is task-irrelevant.</p>

	<p>Previous studies indicated that the onsets of different social threats, such as threats to &amp;amp;rdquo;belonging&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;control&amp;amp;rdquo;, are inconsistent with the subjective beliefs of social participation and require readjustment of expectations. Because a common cognitive system is assumed to be involved, the adjustment triggered by the experience of a single social threat should affect the processing of subsequent social interactions. We examined how preexposure to a loss of control affected social exclusion processing by using the Cyberball paradigm. An event-related brain component (P3) served as a probe for the state of the expectancy system, and self-reports reflected the subjective evaluations of the social threats. In the control group (n = 23), the transition to exclusion elicited a significant P3 effect and a high threat to belonging in the self-reports. Both effects were significantly reduced when the exclusion was preceded by preexposure to a loss of control (EG1disc, n = 23). These effects, however, depend on the offset of the preexposure. In case of a continuation (EG2cont, n = 24), the P3 effect was further reduced, but the threat to belonging was restored. We conclude that the P3 data are consistent with predictions of a common expectancy violation account, whereas self-reports are supposed to be affected by additional processes.</p>

	<p>Sociomoral reasoning (SMR) is an essential component of social functioning allowing children to establish judgments based on moral criteria. The progressive emergence and complexification of SMR during childhood is thought to be underpinned by a range of characteristics and abilities present in the preschool years. Past studies have mostly examined concurrent associations between individual factors and SMR. Using a more comprehensive and predictive approach to identify early predictors of school-age SMR would contribute to a more complete picture of SMR development. This study aimed to investigate the contribution of four domains of preschool predictors to SMR at school-age: demographic (age, sex, parental education), cognitive (executive and sociocognitive functions), behavioral (internalizing and externalizing behaviors), and familial (parent&amp;amp;ndash;child interactions, parental stress) factors. Parents of 122 children 3 to 5 years (M = 3.70, SD = 0.66 years, 51% girls) completed questionnaires and children were administered executive and sociocognitive tasks. Parent&amp;amp;ndash;child interactions were assessed using an observational approach. SMR was measured four years later using the SoMoral task. A four-step hierarchical regression analysis revealed that executive functions and internalizing problems were significant independent predictors of SMR. These findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of the early precursors of SMR during childhood.</p>

	<p>Blinking analysis contributes to the understanding of physiological mechanisms in healthy subjects as well as the pathophysiological mechanisms of neurological diseases. To date, blinking is assessed by various neurophysiological techniques, including electromyographic (EMG) recordings and optoelectronic motion analysis. We recorded eye-blink kinematics with a new portable device, the EyeStat (Generation 3, blinktbi, Inc., Charleston, SC, USA), and compared the measurements with data obtained using traditional laboratory-based techniques. Sixteen healthy adults underwent voluntary, spontaneous, and reflex blinking recordings using the EyeStat device and the SMART motion analysis system (BTS, Milan, Italy). During the blinking recordings, the EMG activity was recorded from the orbicularis oculi muscles using surface electrodes. The blinking data were analyzed through dedicated software and evaluated with repeated-measure analyses of variance. The Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s product-moment correlation coefficient served to assess possible associations between the EyeStat device, the SMART motion system, and the EMG data. We found that the EMG data collected during the EyeStat and SMART system recordings did not differ. The blinking data recorded with the EyeStat showed a linear relationship with the results obtained with the SMART system (r ranging from 0.85 to 0.57; p ranging from &amp;amp;lt;0.001 to 0.02). These results demonstrate a high accuracy and reliability of a blinking analysis through this portable device, compared with standard techniques. EyeStat may make it easier to record blinking in research activities and in daily clinical practice, thus allowing large-scale studies in healthy subjects and patients with neurological diseases in an outpatient clinic setting.</p>

	<p>Ependymomas are commonly classified as low-grade tumors, although they may harbor a malignant behavior characterized by distant neural dissemination and spinal drop metastasis. Extra-CNS ependymoma metastases are extremely rare and only few cases have been reported in the lung, lymph nodes, pleura, mediastinum, liver, bone, and diaphragmatic, abdominal, and pelvic muscles. A review of the literature yielded 14 other case reports metastasizing outside the central nervous system, but to our knowledge, no studies describe metastasis in the paravertebral muscles. Herein, we report the case of a 39-year-old patient with a paraspinal muscles metastasis from a myxopapillary ependymoma. The neoplasm was surgically excised and histologically and molecularly analyzed. Both the analyses were consistent with the diagnosis of muscle metastases of myxopapillary ependymoma. The here-presented case report is first case in the literature of a paraspinal muscles metastasis of myxopapillary ependymoma.</p>

	<p>The social salience hypothesis proposes that the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) can impact human social behavior by modulating the salience of social cues. Here, frequency-tagging EEG was used to quantify the neural responses to social versus non-social stimuli while administering a single dose of OT (24 IU) versus placebo treatment. Specifically, two streams of faces and houses were superimposed on one another, with each stream of stimuli tagged with a particular presentation rate (i.e., 6 and 7.5 Hz or vice versa). These distinctive frequency tags allowed unambiguously disentangling and objectively quantifying the respective neural responses elicited by the different streams of stimuli. This study involved a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial with 31 healthy adult men. Based on four trials of 60 s, we detected robust frequency-tagged neural responses in each individual, with entrainment to faces being more pronounced in lateral occipito-temporal regions and entrainment to houses being focused in medial occipital regions. However, contrary to our expectation, a single dose of OT did not modulate these stimulus-driven neural responses, not in terms of enhanced social processing nor in terms of generally enhanced information salience. Bayesian analyses formally confirmed these null findings. Possibly, the baseline ceiling level performance of these neurotypical adult participants as well as the personal irrelevance of the applied stimulation streams might have hindered the observation of any OT effect.</p>

	<p>The impact of the COVID-19 health crisis on the mental health of the population requires the implementation of new primary screening strategies of mental health disorders to intervene in a timelier manner, and technology may provide solutions. We aimed to evaluate the usefulness of the mobile app Mentali (version 1.1.2; creators: Jorge Alfonso Sol&amp;amp;iacute;s Galv&amp;amp;aacute;n Sodel V&amp;amp;aacute;zquez Reyes, Margarita de la Luz Mart&amp;amp;iacute;nez Fierro, Perla Velasco Elizondo, Idalia Garza Veloz, Alejandro Mauricio Gonz&amp;amp;aacute;lez and Claudia Caldera Villalobos, Zacatecas, M&amp;amp;eacute;xico) as a primary screening tool for anxiety and depression disorders in medical students and to assess the triggering risk factors. This was a descriptive and longitudinal study and included 155 Mexican medical students. Participants interacted with Mentali for 6 months. The mobile app integrated the Beck anxiety and depression inventories together with a mood module. At the end of the interaction, the students received psychological and psychiatric interventions to confirm their primary diagnoses. Symptoms of moderate/severe anxiety and depression were present in 62.6% and 54.6% of the studied population. When corroborating the diagnoses, Mentali obtained a sensitivity of 100%, 95%, and 43% to classify a mental health disorder, anxiety, and depression, respectively. The most important triggers found were as follows: belonging to a dysfunctional family, being introverted, and having suffered from bullying. The proportion of users with excellent/good mood decreased from 78.7% to 34.4% at the end of the semester, and the proportion of users who claimed to have bad/very bad mood increased from 7.4% to 34.4% at the end of the semester (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Mentali was useful for identifying users with anxiety and/or depression, and as an auxiliary tool to coordinate the provision of specialized interventions, allowing us to increase the proportion of patients who needed psychological care and received it by 30%. The efficacy of Mentali in identifying activities through time with an impact on the mood and mental health of the users was confirmed. Our results support the use of Mentali for the primary screening of mental health disorders in young adults, including medical students.</p>

	<p>High cervical spinal cord stimulation (HCSCS) was found to have therapeutic effects on Parkinsonian gait disturbance. However, the results were inconsistent and confounded with symptoms of pain. This study aimed to reveal the gait and dysarthric effects of HCSCS in PD (Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease) and MSA-P (Parkinson variant of multiple system atrophy) patients without pain. Three PD and five MSA-P patients without painful comorbidities were assessed for gait performance and speech before SCS surgery and at 3- and 6-month follow-up. Stride length and the time spent in the Timed Up-and-Go task showed little change after HCSCS surgery. Overall voice quality (measured by dysphonia severity index) and perceptual speech intelligence improved significantly at 3 months, but improvements slightly diminished at 6 months postoperatively. Change in quality of life (measured by 8-item Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease questionnaire) was also notable at 3 months but narrowed over time following HCSCS. In conclusion, HCSCS showed therapeutic effects in improving the dysarthria but not gait disturbance in pain-free PD and MSA-P patients.</p>

                Strategic smart factory design is essential to utilize Industry 4.0 technologies in production environments effectively. Although a series of earlier reviews in the context of smart manufacturing have been published, so far none addresses smart factory design, i. e. the planning and operation of smart factories.  This review provides an overview of recent research in the field by systematizing opportunities, risks and success factors of smart factory design as available from recent empirical studies (2018-2022). Businesses are informed how smart factory design should be approached and implemented to realize cost advantages and increase competitiveness. Academic research benefits of a classification of relevant issues and open research fields are outlined.

                Ageism in medication use decreases older persons' well-being and quality of life and increases health care utilization and costs. This policy brief outlines several strategies that may be considered to combat ageism in medication use and its widespread negative consequences. The strategies are the following: 1) Establish a global action plan (designate an international organization to take a leading and coordinating role; involve all stakeholders; take a multidisciplinary, intersectoral, and systems approach; ensure affordability, accessibility, and availability of care and medications; address the needs of older adults facing multiple forms of discrimination; tailor strategies to the local contexts; designate coordinators at the national and organizational levels); 2) Enhance integration and coordination between health and social care and across different levels of health care (deliver team-based, multidisciplinary, integrated, and coordinated care; ensure interoperability of electronic health records); 3) Implement a quality and safety perspective (integrate and implement patient safety in all policies and programmes; establish a safety culture; establish open reporting culture; take an active and proactive approach; use international indicators); 4) Empower and engage older patients (involve patients in shared decision-making; provide health and medication-related information; provide decision aids and question prompt lists; launch campaigns to raise awareness about ageism in medication use and medication safety, and to promote a life-course perspective, a healthy lifestyle, and the benefits of non-pharmacological strategies); and 5) Improve education and training of care professionals (develop comprehensive curricula; implement interprofessional and intergenerational education and training; develop and revise clinical guidelines to meet older persons' needs and preferences; translate clinical guidelines into computerized clinical decision support systems, prescribing algorithms and alerts). By tackling ageism in medication use, policies, strategies, and actions can enhance the lives of older people and, in turn, their contribution to society.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The hierarchical organization of autocatalytic reaction networks and its relevance to the origin of life</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Zhen Peng, Jeff Linderoth, David A. Baum</p>

Prior work on abiogenesis, the emergence of life from non-life, suggests that it requires chemical reaction networks that contain self-amplifying motifs, namely, autocatalytic cores. However, little is known about how the presence of multiple autocatalytic cores might allow for the gradual accretion of complexity on the path to life. To explore this problem, we develop the concept of a seed-dependent autocatalytic system (SDAS), which is a subnetwork that can autocatalytically self-maintain given a flux of food, but cannot be initiated by food alone. Rather, initiation of SDASs requires the transient introduction of chemical “seeds”. We show that, depending on the topological relationship of SDASs in a chemical reaction network, a food-driven system can accrete complexity in a historically contingent manner, governed by rare seeding events. We develop new algorithms for detecting and analyzing SDASs in chemical reaction databases and describe parallels between multi-SDAS networks and biological ecosystems. Applying our algorithms to both an abiotic reaction network and a biochemical one, each driven by a set of simple food chemicals, we detect SDASs that are organized as trophic tiers, of which the higher tier can be seeded by relatively simple chemicals if the lower tier is already activated. This indicates that sequential activation of trophically organized SDASs by seed chemicals that are not much more complex than what already exist could be a mechanism of gradual complexification from relatively simple abiotic reactions to more complex life-like systems. Interestingly, in both reaction networks, higher-tier SDASs include chemicals that might alter emergent features of chemical systems and could serve as early targets of selection. Our analysis provides computational tools for analyzing very large chemical/biochemical reaction networks and suggests new approaches to studying abiogenesis in the lab.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">ceRNAR: An R package for identification and analysis of ceRNA-miRNA triplets</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yi-Wen Hsiao, Lin Wang, Tzu-Pin Lu</p>

Competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) represents a novel mechanism of gene regulation that controls several biological and pathological processes. Recently, an increasing number of <i>in silico</i> methods have been developed to accelerate the identification of such regulatory events. However, there is still a need for a tool supporting the hypothesis that ceRNA regulatory events only occur at specific miRNA expression levels. To this end, we present an R package, ceRNAR, which allows identification and analysis of ceRNA-miRNA triplets via integration of miRNA and RNA expression data. The ceRNAR package integrates three main steps: (i) identification of ceRNA pairs based on a rank-based correlation between pairs that considers the impact of miRNA and a running sum correlation statistic, (ii) sample clustering based on gene-gene correlation by circular binary segmentation, and (iii) peak merging to identify the most relevant sample patterns. In addition, ceRNAR also provides downstream analyses of identified ceRNA-miRNA triplets, including network analysis, functional annotation, survival analysis, external validation, and integration of different tools. The performance of our proposed approach was validated through simulation studies of different scenarios. Compared with several published tools, ceRNAR was able to identify true ceRNA triplets with high sensitivity, low false-positive rates, and acceptable running time. In real data applications, the ceRNAs common to two lung cancer datasets were identified in both datasets. The bridging miRNA for one of these, the ceRNA for <i>MAP4K3</i>, was identified by ceRNAR as hsa-let-7c-5p. Since similar cancer subtypes do share some biological patterns, these results demonstrated that our proposed algorithm was able to identify potential ceRNA targets in real patients. In summary, ceRNAR offers a novel algorithm and a comprehensive pipeline to identify and analyze ceRNA regulation. The package is implemented in R and is available on GitHub (https://github.com/ywhsiao/ceRNAR).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Species abundance correlations carry limited information about microbial network interactions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Susanne Pinto, Elisa Benincà, Egbert H. van Nes, Marten Scheffer, Johannes A. Bogaards</p>

Unraveling the network of interactions in ecological communities is a daunting task. Common methods to infer interspecific interactions from cross-sectional data are based on co-occurrence measures. For instance, interactions in the human microbiome are often inferred from correlations between the abundance of bacterial phylogenetic groups across subjects. We tested whether such correlation-based methods are indeed reliable for inferring interaction networks. For this purpose, we simulated bacterial communities by means of the generalized Lotka-Volterra model, with variation in model parameters representing variability among hosts. Our results show that correlations can be indicative for presence of bacterial interactions, but only when measurement noise is low relative to the variation in interaction strengths between hosts. Indication of interaction was affected by type of interaction network, process noise and sampling under non-equilibrium conditions. The sign of a correlation mostly coincided with the nature of the strongest pairwise interaction, but this is not necessarily the case. For instance, under rare conditions of identical interaction strength, we found that competitive and exploitative interactions can result in positive as well as negative correlations. Thus, cross-sectional abundance data carry limited information on specific interaction types. Correlations in abundance may hint at interactions but require independent validation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Patterns of asymmetry and energy cost generated from predictive simulations of hemiparetic gait</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Russell T. Johnson, Nicholas A. Bianco, James M. Finley</p>

Hemiparesis, defined as unilateral muscle weakness, often occurs in people post-stroke or people with cerebral palsy, however it is difficult to understand how this hemiparesis affects movement patterns as it often presents alongside a variety of other neuromuscular impairments. Predictive musculoskeletal modeling presents an opportunity to investigate how impairments affect gait performance assuming a particular cost function. Here, we use predictive simulation to quantify the spatiotemporal asymmetries and changes to metabolic cost that emerge when muscle strength is unilaterally reduced and how reducing spatiotemporal symmetry affects metabolic cost. We modified a 2-D musculoskeletal model by uniformly reducing the peak isometric muscle force unilaterally. We then solved optimal control simulations of walking across a range of speeds by minimizing the sum of the cubed muscle excitations. Lastly, we ran additional optimizations to test if reducing spatiotemporal asymmetry would result in an increase in metabolic cost. Our results showed that the magnitude and direction of effort-optimal spatiotemporal asymmetries depends on both the gait speed and level of weakness. Also, the optimal speed was 1.25 m/s for the symmetrical and 20% weakness models but slower (1.00 m/s) for the 40% and 60% weakness models, suggesting that hemiparesis can account for a portion of the slower gait speed seen in people with hemiparesis. Modifying the cost function to minimize spatiotemporal asymmetry resulted in small increases (~4%) in metabolic cost. Overall, our results indicate that spatiotemporal asymmetry may be optimal for people with hemiparesis. Additionally, the effect of speed and the level of weakness on spatiotemporal asymmetry may help explain the well-known heterogenous distribution of spatiotemporal asymmetries observed in the clinic. Future work could extend our results by testing the effects of other neuromuscular impairments on optimal gait strategies, and therefore build a more comprehensive understanding of the gait patterns observed in clinical populations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Utility of constraints reflecting system stability on analyses for biological models</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yoshiaki Kariya, Masashi Honma, Keita Tokuda, Akihiko Konagaya, Hiroshi Suzuki</p>

Simulating complex biological models consisting of multiple ordinary differential equations can aid in the prediction of the pharmacological/biological responses; however, they are often hampered by the availability of reliable kinetic parameters. In the present study, we aimed to discover the properties of behaviors without determining an optimal combination of kinetic parameter values (parameter set). The key idea was to collect as many parameter sets as possible. Given that many systems are biologically stable and resilient (BSR), we focused on the dynamics around the steady state and formulated objective functions for BSR by partial linear approximation of the focused region. Using the objective functions and modified global cluster Newton method, we developed an algorithm for a thorough exploration of the allowable parameter space for biological systems (TEAPS). We first applied TEAPS to the NF-κB signaling model. This system shows a damped oscillation after stimulation and seems to fit the BSR constraint. By applying TEAPS, we found several directions in parameter space which stringently determines the BSR property. In such directions, the experimentally fitted parameter values were included in the range of the obtained parameter sets. The arachidonic acid metabolic pathway model was used as a model related to pharmacological responses. The pharmacological effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were simulated using the parameter sets obtained by TEAPS. The structural properties of the system were partly extracted by analyzing the distribution of the obtained parameter sets. In addition, the simulations showed inter-drug differences in prostacyclin to thromboxane A2 ratio such that aspirin treatment tends to increase the ratio, while rofecoxib treatment tends to decrease it. These trends are comparable to the clinical observations. These results on real biological models suggest that the parameter sets satisfying the BSR condition can help in finding biologically plausible parameter sets and understanding the properties of biological systems.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Ambiguity drives higher-order Pavlovian learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tomislav D. Zbozinek, Omar D. Perez, Toby Wise, Michael Fanselow, Dean Mobbs</p>

In the natural world, stimulus-outcome associations are often ambiguous, and most associations are highly complex and situation-dependent. Learning to disambiguate these complex associations to identify which specific outcomes will occur in which situations is critical for survival. Pavlovian occasion setters are stimuli that determine whether other stimuli will result in a specific outcome. Occasion setting is a well-established phenomenon, but very little investigation has been conducted on how occasion setters are disambiguated when they themselves are ambiguous (i.e., when they do not consistently signal whether another stimulus will be reinforced). In two preregistered studies, we investigated the role of higher-order Pavlovian occasion setting in humans. We developed and tested the first computational model predicting direct associative learning, traditional occasion setting (i.e., 1<sup>st</sup>-order occasion setting), and 2<sup>nd</sup>-order occasion setting. This model operationalizes stimulus ambiguity as a mechanism to engage in higher-order Pavlovian learning. Both behavioral and computational modeling results suggest that 2<sup>nd</sup>-order occasion setting was learned, as evidenced by lack and presence of transfer of occasion setting properties when expected and the superior fit of our 2<sup>nd</sup>-order occasion setting model compared to the 1<sup>st</sup>-order occasion setting or direct associations models. These results provide a controlled investigation into highly complex associative learning and may ultimately lead to improvements in the treatment of Pavlovian-based mental health disorders (e.g., anxiety disorders, substance use).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A transcriptional cycling model recapitulates chromatin-dependent features of noisy inducible transcription</a></h4>

              
                <p>by M. Elise Bullock, Nataly Moreno-Martinez, Kathryn Miller-Jensen</p>

Activation of gene expression in response to environmental cues results in substantial phenotypic heterogeneity between cells that can impact a wide range of outcomes including differentiation, viral activation, and drug resistance. An important source of gene expression noise is transcriptional bursting, or the process by which transcripts are produced during infrequent bursts of promoter activity. Chromatin accessibility impacts transcriptional bursting by regulating the assembly of transcription factor and polymerase complexes on promoters, suggesting that the effect of an activating signal on transcriptional noise will depend on the initial chromatin state at the promoter. To explore this possibility, we simulated transcriptional activation using a transcriptional cycling model with three promoter states that represent chromatin remodeling, polymerase binding and pause release. We initiated this model over a large parameter range representing target genes with different chromatin environments, and found that, upon increasing the polymerase pause release rate to activate transcription, changes in gene expression noise varied significantly across initial promoter states. This model captured phenotypic differences in activation of latent HIV viruses integrated at different chromatin locations and mediated by the transcription factor NF-κB. Activating transcription in the model via increasing one or more of the transcript production rates, as occurs following NF-κB activation, reproduced experimentally measured transcript distributions for four different latent HIV viruses, as well as the bimodal pattern of HIV protein expression that leads to a subset of reactivated virus. Importantly, the parameter ‘activation path’ differentially affected gene expression noise, and ultimately viral activation, in line with experimental observations. This work demonstrates how upstream signaling pathways can be connected to biological processes that underlie transcriptional bursting, resulting in target gene-specific noise profiles following stimulation of a single upstream pathway.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Quantitative prediction of ensemble dynamics, shapes and contact propensities of intrinsically disordered proteins</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lei Yu, Rafael Brüschweiler</p>

Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are highly dynamic systems that play an important role in cell signaling processes and their misfunction often causes human disease. Proper understanding of IDP function not only requires the realistic characterization of their three-dimensional conformational ensembles at atomic-level resolution but also of the time scales of interconversion between their conformational substates. Large sets of experimental data are often used in combination with molecular modeling to restrain or bias models to improve agreement with experiment. It is shown here for the N-terminal transactivation domain of p53 (p53TAD) and Pup, which are two IDPs that fold upon binding to their targets, how the latest advancements in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations methodology produces native conformational ensembles by combining replica exchange with series of microsecond MD simulations. They closely reproduce experimental data at the global conformational ensemble level, in terms of the distribution properties of the radius of gyration tensor, and at the local level, in terms of NMR properties including <sup>15</sup>N spin relaxation, without the need for reweighting. Further inspection revealed that 10–20% of the individual MD trajectories display the formation of secondary structures not observed in the experimental NMR data. The IDP ensembles were analyzed by graph theory to identify dominant inter-residue contact clusters and characteristic amino-acid contact propensities. These findings indicate that modern MD force fields with residue-specific backbone potentials can produce highly realistic IDP ensembles sampling a hierarchy of nano- and picosecond time scales providing new insights into their biological function.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence, causes and impacts of human trafficking in Asian countries: A scoping review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In Asian countries, human trafficking is often encountered as forced labor, forced marriage, sex trafficking, men, women, and children exploitation. This review points out how human trafficking activities are prevalent in Asian countries and also reveals different causes that are the basis of increasingly human trafficking in Asian countries such as poverty, unemployment, political uncertainty, war, natural disaster, corruption and weak policies. Human trafficking also creates huge health, physical, psychological and social implications on individuals and the overall society. Methods: The purpose of this study is to collect evidence on human trafficking in Asian countries. A scoping review methodology was used to systematically search online databases including Sage Journals Online, Wiley Online, Hein Online, Taylor & Francis Online, Web of Science, and Scopus literature to amalgamate information on this issue. For the purposes of this article, 64 studies met the inclusion criteria after searching and screening a total number of 1,278 studies. Results: The findings of this study were classified under three categories: prevalence of human trafficking in Asia, causes of human trafficking in Asia (poverty and unemployment, environmental and manmade disaster, weak policies and corruption), and impacts of human trafficking including social, health, physical, psychological impacts. Conclusion: Keeping in mind the prevalence and impacts of human trafficking, the author also recommends some meaningful and practical steps for policymakers and researchers to effectively tackle human trafficking in Asian countries.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Dual-active-ingredient, insecticidal nets for preventing malaria: a systematic review protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Malaria is caused by the Plasmodium parasite and is a highly transmissible disease representing a significant global public health burden. The provision of insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) has contributed to the reduction of malaria across endemic countries. However, the detection of insecticide resistance in many mosquito vector species potentially threatens the long-term effectiveness of ITNs. A novel method to reduce the impact of insecticide resistance is to treat mosquito nets with multiple active ingredients. Methods and analysis: This review will comprehensively search the literature (both published and unpublished) for any studies investigating the effectiveness of mosquito nets treated with multiple active ingredients, known henceforth as dual-active-ingredient (DAI) ITNs. The DAI ITNs of interest include those treated with a pyrethroid and non-pyrethroid insecticide (review question 1) or with a pyrethroid and an insect growth regulator (review question 2).  Studies will be screened to meet the inclusion criteria by a minimum of two authors, followed by assessment of risk of bias (using appropriate risk of bias tools for randomised and non-randomised studies) and extraction of relevant information using structured forms by two independent authors. Meta-analyses will be carried out where possible for epidemiological outcomes and subgrouping will be considered. Certainty in the evidence will be established with GRADE assessments. Ethics and dissemination: A full review report will be submitted to the Vector Control and Insecticide Resistance Unit, Global Malaria Program, WHO. A version of this report will be submitted for publication in an open access peer-reviewed journal. The report will inform the development of WHO recommendations regarding the use of DAI ITNs for the prevention of malaria. This systematic review does not require ethics approval as it is a review of primary studies. Registration: PROSPERO ID: CRD42022333044

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">How critical is brain criticality?</a></h4>

              
                Criticality is the singular state of complex systems poised at the brink of a phase transition between order and randomness. Such systems display remarkable information-processing capabilities, evoking the compelling hypothesis that the brain may itself be critical. This foundational idea is now drawing renewed interest thanks to high-density data and converging cross-disciplinary knowledge. Together, these lines of inquiry have shed light on the intimate link between criticality, computation, and cognition.

                Feedforward and feedback pathway interactions are widespread, yet poorly understood. Rindner et al. show that subpopulations of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the PPC integrate sensory and frontal afferents with distinct nonlinear synaptic dynamics that arise from an interaction of ionic mechanisms and cell-type-specific feedforward inhibition.

                LSD is the prototypical psychedelic drug that profoundly alters human sensation, perception, and mood. Cao et al. determined the high-resolution cryo-EM structures of LSD-bound HTR2B in transducer-free, G-protein-coupled, and β-arrestin-1-coupled states, which reveal the molecular bases underlying the differential engagement of downstream signaling transducers for LSD.

                Presynaptic homeostatic plasticity (PHP) is an adaptive physiological process that regulates neurotransmission, contributing to nervous system resilience. Orr and colleagues harness both mice and Drosophila to define a presynaptic protein assembly that drives the initiation and expression of PHP, creating a dynamic model for the adaptive control synaptic transmission.

                How do forces activate mechanical nociceptors? Gong and Chen et al. find that poking a Drosophila larva elicits shear stress to activate nociceptors through select TrpA1 isoforms. Single-channel recordings further demonstrate TrpA1 as a conserved mechanosensitive channel that is specifically activated by shear stress but not stretch.

                The oncogenic G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) Smoothened (SMO) is a key transducer of the hedgehog (HH) morphogen, which plays an essential role in the patterning of epithelial structures. Here, we examine how HH controls SMO subcellular localization and activity in a polarized epithelium using the <i>Drosophila</i> wing imaginal disc as a model. We provide evidence that HH promotes the stabilization of SMO by switching its fate after endocytosis toward recycling. This effect involves the sequential and additive action of protein kinase A, casein kinase I, and the Fused (FU) kinase. Moreover, in the presence of very high levels of HH, the second effect of FU leads to the local enrichment of SMO in the most basal domain of the cell membrane. Together, these results link the morphogenetic effects of HH to the apico-basal distribution of SMO and provide a novel mechanism for the regulation of a GPCR.

                Redox reactions are central to biochemistry and are both controlled by and induce protein structural changes. Here, we describe structural rearrangements and crosstalk within the <i>Bacillus cereus</i> ribonucleotide reductase R2b–NrdI complex, a di-metal carboxylate-flavoprotein system, as part of the mechanism generating the essential catalytic free radical of the enzyme. Femtosecond crystallography at an X-ray free electron laser was utilized to obtain structures at room temperature in defined redox states without suffering photoreduction. Together with density functional theory calculations, we show that the flavin is under steric strain in the R2b–NrdI protein complex, likely tuning its redox properties to promote superoxide generation. Moreover, a binding site in close vicinity to the expected flavin O<sub>2</sub> interaction site is observed to be controlled by the redox state of the flavin and linked to the channel proposed to funnel the produced superoxide species from NrdI to the di-manganese site in protein R2b. These specific features are coupled to further structural changes around the R2b–NrdI interaction surface. The mechanistic implications for the control of reactive oxygen species and radical generation in protein R2b are discussed.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Arbidol inhibits human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma growth in vitro and  in vivo through suppressing ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein kinase</a></h4>

              
                Human esophageal cancer has a global impact on human health due to its high incidence and mortality. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new drugs to treat or prevent the prominent pathological subtype of esophageal cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Based upon a screening of drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration, we discovered that Arbidol could effectively inhibit the proliferation of human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma <i>in vitro</i>. Next, we conducted a series of cell-based assays and found that Arbidol treatment inhibited the proliferation and colony formation ability of ESCC cells and promoted G1 phase cell cycle arrest. Phospho-proteomics experiments, <i>in vitro</i> kinase assays and pull-down assays were subsequently performed in order to identify the underlying growth inhibitory mechanism. We verified Arbidol is a potential ATR inhibitor via binding to ATR kinase to reduce the phosphorylation and activation of MCM2 at Ser108. Finally, we demonstrated Arbidol had the inhibitory effect of ESCC <i>in vivo</i> by a PDX model. All together, Arbidol inhibits the proliferation of ESCC <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> through the DNA replication pathway and is associated with the cell cycle.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Automatically tracking feeding behavior in populations of foraging C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> feeds on bacteria and other small microorganisms which it ingests using its pharynx, a neuromuscular pump. Currently, measuring feeding behavior requires tracking a single animal, indirectly estimating food intake from population-level metrics, or using restrained animals. To enable large throughput feeding measurements of unrestrained, crawling worms on agarose plates at a single worm resolution, we developed an imaging protocol and a complementary image analysis tool called PharaGlow. We image up to 50 unrestrained crawling worms simultaneously and extract locomotion and feeding behaviors. We demonstrate the tool’s robustness and high-throughput capabilities by measuring feeding in different use-case scenarios, such as through development, with genetic and chemical perturbations that result in faster and slower pumping, and in the presence or absence of food. Finally, we demonstrate that our tool is capable of long-term imaging by showing behavioral dynamics of mating animals and worms with different genetic backgrounds. The low-resolution fluorescence microscopes required are readily available in <i>C. elegans</i> laboratories, and in combination with our python-based analysis workflow makes this methodology easily accessible. PharaGlow therefore enables the observation and analysis of the temporal dynamics of feeding and locomotory behaviors with high-throughput and precision in a user-friendly system.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Foveal vision anticipates defining features of eye movement targets</a></h4>

              
                High-acuity foveal processing is vital for human vision. Nonetheless, little is known about how the preparation of large-scale rapid eye movements (saccades) affects visual sensitivity in the center of gaze. Based on findings from passive fixation tasks, we hypothesized that during saccade preparation, foveal processing anticipates soon-to-be fixated visual features. Using a dynamic large-field noise paradigm, we indeed demonstrate that defining features of an eye movement target are enhanced in the pre-saccadic center of gaze. Enhancement manifested as higher Hit Rates for foveal probes with target-congruent orientation and a sensitization to incidental, target-like orientation information in foveally presented noise. Enhancement was spatially confined to the center of gaze and its immediate vicinity, even after parafoveal task performance had been raised to a foveal level. Moreover, foveal enhancement during saccade preparation was more pronounced and developed faster than enhancement during passive fixation. Based on these findings, we suggest a crucial contribution of foveal processing to trans-saccadic visual continuity: Foveal processing of saccade targets commences before the movement is executed and thereby enables a seamless transition once the center of gaze reaches the target.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">GENESPACE tracks regions of interest and gene copy number variation across multiple genomes</a></h4>

              
                The development of multiple chromosome-scale reference genome sequences in many taxonomic groups has yielded a high-resolution view of the patterns and processes of molecular evolution. Nonetheless, leveraging information across multiple genomes remains a significant challenge in nearly all eukaryotic systems. These challenges range from studying the evolution of chromosome structure, to finding candidate genes for quantitative trait loci, to testing hypotheses about speciation and adaptation. Here, we present GENESPACE, which addresses these challenges by integrating conserved gene order and orthology to define the expected physical position of all genes across multiple genomes. We demonstrate this utility by dissecting presence–absence, copy-number, and structural variation at three levels of biological organization: spanning 300 million years of vertebrate sex chromosome evolution, across the diversity of the Poaceae (grass) plant family, and among 26 maize cultivars. The methods to build and visualize syntenic orthology in the GENESPACE R package offer a significant addition to existing gene family and synteny programs, especially in polyploid, outbred, and other complex genomes.

                Background: Soluble Resistance Related Calcium Binding Protein (sorcin) is a calcium (Ca2+) binding protein which has been shown to play a role in maintaining intracellular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ stores and lowering ER stress. Recently, our lab has demonstrated that sorcin expression was downregulated in the islets of Langerhans of mice fed a high-fat diet or in human islets incubated with the saturated fatty acid palmitate. We also showed that overexpression of sorcin under control of the rat insulin promoter (RIP7) in C57BL/6J mice, or whole body sorcin deletion in 129S1/SvImJ mice, improves or impairs insulin secretion and pancreatic {beta}-cell function respectively. The mechanisms behind this beneficial role of sorcin in the pancreatic {beta}-cell might depend on protection against lipotoxic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress through improved ER Ca2+ dynamics and activation of the Activating Transcription Factor 6 (ATF6) branch of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Whether sorcin is also implicated in hypothalamic ER stress during the progression of obesity is unknown. This could potentially contribute to the diminished satiety typically observed in overweight individuals. Aim: To investigate a potential role of sorcin in hypothalamic ER stress, leptin resistance, hyperphagia and obesity. Methods: Whole-body sorcin null mice, backcrossed onto the C57BL/6J genetic background, were used. Body weight, food intake and EchoMRI body composition were measured in vivo whereas qRT-PCR analysis of sorcin and ER stress markers expression were performed on the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. Leptin signalling through STAT3 phosphorylation was measured by Western blots on sorcin-null HEK293 cells, engineered by CRISPR/Cas9, and transfected with leptin receptor (LepRb). Results: Sorcin expression was not influenced in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus by diet-induced obesity. Whole-body sorcin ablation did not cause ARC ER stress nor changes in body weight, body composition or food intake in C57BL/6 male mice exposed to a high-fat, high-sugar diet. STAT3 phosphorylation (Y705) in response to leptin was not impaired in sorcin-null HEK293 cells. Conclusion: In our model, whole body sorcin ablation did not increase hypothalamic ER stress nor influenced food intake or body weight.

                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of persistent functional brain impairment and results in a robust, but poorly understood, neuroinflammatory response that contributes to the long-term pathology. Here, we used single-nuclei RNA-sequencing to study transcriptomic changes in different cell populations from human brain tissue obtained acutely after severe, life-threatening TBI. We found a unique transcriptional response in several cell types, including the activation of an interferon response in oligodendrocytes coupled with the transcriptional activation of MHC-class I and class II related genes. Thus, oligodendrocytes undergo a transformation to an immune-like cell state immediately after TBI, indicating an important role for these cells in the initiation of neuroinflammation. Notably, the activation of immune-related genes correlated with the expression of endogenous retroviruses in oligodendrocytes, linking these ancient viral sequences to neuroinflammation. In summary, this work provides a unique insight into the initiating events of the neuroinflammatory response in TBI, which has new therapeutic implications.

                Although thermal body signals provide crucial information about the state of an organism, and changes in body temperature may be a sign of affective states (e.g., stress, pain, sexual arousal), research on thermal awareness is limited. Here we developed a task measuring awareness of changes in peripheral body temperature (thermal interoception) and compared it to the classical heartbeat counting task (cardiac interoception). With an infrared lightbulb we delivered stimuli of different temperature intensities to the right hand of 31 healthy participants. Thermal interoceptive accuracy, i.e., the difference between participants' real and perceived change in hand temperature, showed good inter-individual variability. We found that thermal interoception did not correlate with (and was generally higher than) cardiac interoception, suggesting that different interceptive channels provide separate contributions to awareness of bodily states. Moreover, the results hint at the great salience of thermal signals and the need for thermoregulation in day-to-day life. Finally, thermal interoceptive accuracy was associated with self-reported awareness of body temperature changes, and with the ability to regulate distress by focusing on body sensations. Our task has the potential to significantly increase current knowledge about the role of interoception in cognition and behavior, particularly in social and emotional contexts.

                The spinal cord has poor ability to regenerate after injury, which may be due to cell loss, cyst formation, inflammation, and scarring. A promising approach to treat spinal cord injury (SCI) is the use of biomaterials. We have developed a novel hydrogel scaffold fabricated from oligo(poly(ethylene glycol) fumarate) (OPF) as a 0.08 mm thick sheet containing polymer ridges and a cell-attractive surface chemistry on the other side. When the cells are cultured on OPF with the chemical patterning, the cells attach, align, and deposit ECM along the direction of the pattern. Animals implanted with the rolled scaffold sheets had greater hindlimb recovery compared to the multichannel scaffold control, likely due to the greater number of axons growing across. Inflammation, scarring, and ECM deposits were equal across conditions. Overall, the results suggest that the scaffold sheets promote axon outgrowth that can be guided across the scaffold, thereby promoting hindlimb recovery.

                As the demand for prosthetic limbs with reliable and multi-functional control increases, recent advances in myoelectric pattern recognition and implanted sensors have proven considerably advantageous. Additionally, sensory feedback from the prosthesis can be achieved via stimulation of the residual nerves, enabling closed-loop control over the prosthesis. However, this stimulation can cause interfering artifacts in the electromyographic (EMG) signals which deteriorate the reliability and function of the prosthesis. Here, we implement two real-time stimulation artifact removal algorithms, Template Subtraction and {varepsilon}-Normalized Least Mean Squares, and investigate their performance in offline and real-time myoelectric pattern recognition in two transhumeral amputees implanted with nerve cuff and EMG electrodes. We show that both algorithms are capable of significantly improving signal-to-noise ratio and offline pattern recognition accuracy of artifact-corrupted EMG signals. Furthermore, both algorithms improved real-time decoding of motor intention during active neurostimulation. Although these outcomes are dependent on the user-specific sensor locations and neurostimulation settings, they nonetheless represent progress towards bi-directional neuromusculoskeletal prostheses capable of multifunction control and simultaneous sensory feedback.

                The brain organizes experiences into memories that can be used to guide future behavior. Hippocampal CA1 population activity may reflect the retrieval of predictive models that contain information about future events, but little is known about how these kinds of memories develop with experience. We trained mice on a series of tone discrimination problems with or without a common statistical structure to observe how memories are formed and updated during learning. Mice that learned structured problems integrated their experiences into a predictive model that contained the solutions to upcoming novel problems. Retrieving the model during learning improved discrimination accuracy and facilitated learning by decreasing the amount of new information that needed to be acquired. Using calcium imaging to track the activity of thousands of CA1 neurons during learning on this task, we observed the emergence of a persistent hippocampal ensemble at the same time that mice formed a predictive model of their environment. This ensemble was reactivated during training and incorporated new neuronal activity patterns from each training problem. Interestingly, the degree to which mice reactivated the ensemble was related to how well their model predicted the content of the current problem, ensuring that the model was only updated with congruent information. In contrast, mice trained on unstructured problems did not form a predictive model or engage a persistent ensemble. These results show how hippocampal activity supports building predictive models by organizing newly learned information according to its congruence with existing memories.

                Recent research has highlighted the importance of domain-general processes and brain regions for language and semantic cognition. Yet, this has been mainly observed in executively demanding tasks, leaving open the question of the contribution of domain-general processes to natural language and semantic cognition. Using fMRI, we investigated whether neural processes reflecting context integration and context update - two key aspects of naturalistic language and semantic processing - are domain-specific versus domain-general. Thus, we compared neural responses during integration of contextual information across semantic and non-semantic tasks. Whole-brain results revealed both shared (left posterior-dorsal inferior frontal gyrus, left posterior inferior temporal gyrus, and left dorsal angular gyrus/intraparietal sulcus) and distinct (left anterior-ventral inferior frontal gyrus, left anterior ventral angular gyrus, left posterior middle temporal gyrus for semantic control only) regions involved in context integration and update. Furthermore, data-driven functional connectivity analysis clustered domain-specific versus domain-general brain regions into distinct but interacting functional neural networks. These results provide a first characterisation of the neural processes required for context-dependent integration during language processing along the domain-specificity dimension, and at the same time, they bring new insights on the role of left posterior lateral temporal cortex and left angular gyrus for semantic cognition.

                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 44 children. Chromatin regulatory proteins are overrepresented among genes that contain high risk variants in ASD. Disruption of the chromatin environment leads to widespread dysregulation of gene expression, which is traditionally thought as a mechanism of disease pathogenesis associated with ASD. Alternatively, alterations in chromatin dynamics could also lead to dysregulation of alternative splicing, which is understudied as a mechanism of ASD pathogenesis. The anticonvulsant valproic acid (VPA) is a well-known environmental risk factor for ASD that acts as a class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying defects in human neuronal development associated with exposure to VPA are understudied. To dissect how VPA exposure and subsequent chromatin hyperacetylation influence molecular signatures involved in ASD pathogenesis, we conducted RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in human cortical neurons that were treated with VPA. We observed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched for mRNA splicing, mRNA processing, histone modification, and metabolism related gene sets. Furthermore, we observed widespread increase in the number and the type of alternative splicing events. Analysis of differential transcript usage (DTU) showed that exposure to VPA induces extensive alterations in transcript isoform usage across neurodevelopmentally important genes. Finally, we find that DEGs and genes that display DTU overlap with known ASD-risk genes. Together, these findings suggest that, in addition to differential gene expression, changes in alternative splicing correlated with alterations in the chromatin environment could act as an additional mechanism of disease in ASD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">When Abstract Becomes Concrete: Naturalistic Encoding of Concepts in the Brain</a></h4>

              
                Humans learn and process language in complex and dynamic contexts, involving simultaneous processing of connected speech, faces, bodies, objects and including, at times, touch, odor, and taste. How words and their associated concepts are encoded in the brain during real world processing is unclear. We investigated the representational structure of conceptual encoding in a naturalistic setting and asked to what extent brain responses dynamically depend on context. Across different contexts, we find evidence that concrete and abstract concepts encode experience-based information in roughly differential sets of brain regions. However, these differences reduce when contextual variance is considered. Specifically, the response profile of abstract concepts becomes more concrete-like when they are processed in context highly related to their meaning. Conversely, when context is unrelated to a given concrete concept, the activation pattern resembles more that of abstract conceptual processing. Our results suggest that while concepts encode habitual experiences on average, the underlying neurobiological organization is not fixed but depends dynamically on available contextual information at the time of processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adaptive Encoding Speed in Working Memory</a></h4>

              
                Humans can adapt when complex patterns unfold at a faster or slower pace, for instance when remembering a grocery list that is dictated at an increasingly fast pace. Integrating information over such timescales crucially depends on working memory, but although state-of-the-art theories assume that working memory capacity can be flexibly adapted, these theories assume that encoding speed cannot. In a series of experiments, we found that humans encoded at a faster rate when they were adapted to overall and recent rate of incoming information. Interestingly, our participants were unable to use explicit cues to speed up encoding, even though these cues were more informative than statistical information. Our findings suggest that adaptive tuning of encoding speed in working memory is a fundamental but largely implicit mechanism underlying our ability to keep up with the pace of our surroundings.

	<p>The technology for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has significantly changed over the years, with important improvements in the signal generators, the coils, the positioning systems, and the software for modeling, optimization, and therapy planning. In this systematic literature review (SLR), the evolution of each component of TMS technology is presented and analyzed to assess the limitations to overcome. This SLR was carried out following the PRISMA 2020 statement. Published articles of TMS were searched for in four databases (Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, IEEE). Conference papers and other reviews were excluded. Records were filtered using terms about TMS technology with a semi-automatic software; articles that did not present new technology developments were excluded manually. After this screening, 101 records were included, with 19 articles proposing new stimulator designs (18.8%), 46 presenting or adapting coils (45.5%), 18 proposing systems for coil placement (17.8%), and 43 implementing algorithms for coil optimization (42.6%). The articles were blindly classified by the authors to reduce the risk of bias. However, our results could have been influenced by our research interests, which would affect conclusions for applications in psychiatric and neurological diseases. Our analysis indicates that more emphasis should be placed on optimizing the current technology with a special focus on the experimental validation of models. With this review, we expect to establish the base for future TMS technological developments.</p>

	<p>Background and Aims. Most research on Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) focuses on describing symptoms and movement characteristics. Studies rarely focus on the early detection of PD and the search for suitable markers of a prodromal stage. Early detection is important, so treatments that may potentially change the course of the disease can be attempted early on. While gait disturbances are less pronounced in the early stages of the disease, the prevalence, and severity increase with disease progression. Therefore, postural instability and gait difficulties could be identified as sensitive biomarkers. The aim was to evaluate the discriminatory power of the Trail-Walking Test (TWT; Schott, 2015) as a potential diagnostic instrument to improve the predictive power of the clinical evaluation concerning the severity of the disease and record the different aspects of walking. Methods. A total of 20 older healthy (M = 72.4 years, SD = 5.53) adults and 43 older adults with PD and the motor phenotypes postural instability/gait difficulty (PIGD; M = 69.7 years, SD = 8.68) and tremor dominant (TD; M = 68.2 years, SD = 8.94) participated in the study. The participants performed a motor-cognitive dual task (DT) of increasing cognitive difficulty in which they had to walk a given path (condition 1), walk to numbers in ascending order (condition 2), and walk to numbers and letters alternately and in ascending order (condition 3). Results. With an increase in the cognitive load, the time to complete the tasks (seconds) became longer in all groups, F(1.23, 73.5) = 121, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, &amp;amp;#627;2p = 0.670. PIGD showed the longest times in all conditions of the TWT, F(2, 60) = 8.15, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, &amp;amp;#627;2p = 0.214. Mutual interferences in the cognitive and motor domain can be observed. However, clear group-specific patterns cannot be identified. A differentiation between the motor phenotypes of PD is especially feasible with the purely motor condition (TWT-M; AUC = 0.685, p = 0.44). Conclusions. PD patients with PIGD must be identified by valid, well-evaluated clinical tests that allow for a precise assessment of the disease&amp;amp;rsquo;s individual fall risk, the severity of the disease, and the prognosis of progression. The TWT covers various aspects of mobility, examines the relationship between cognitive functions and walking, and enables differentiation of the motor phenotypes of PD.</p>
