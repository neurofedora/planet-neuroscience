              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17510">NeuroPath: A Neural Pathway Transformer for Joining the Dots of Human Connectomes</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.17510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although modern imaging technologies allow us to study connectivity between two distinct brain regions in-vivo, an in-depth understanding of how anatomical structure supports brain function and how spontaneous functional fluctuations emerge remarkable cognition is still elusive. Meanwhile, tremendous efforts have been made in the realm of machine learning to establish the nonlinear mapping between neuroimaging data and phenotypic traits. However, the absence of neuroscience insight in the current approaches poses significant challenges in understanding cognitive behavior from transient neural activities. To address this challenge, we put the spotlight on the coupling mechanism of structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) by formulating such network neuroscience question into an expressive graph representation learning problem for high-order topology. Specifically, we introduce the concept of topological detour to characterize how a ubiquitous instance of FC (direct link) is supported by neural pathways (detour) physically wired by SC, which forms a cyclic loop interacted by brain structure and function. In the clich\'e of machine learning, the multi-hop detour pathway underlying SC-FC coupling allows us to devise a novel multi-head self-attention mechanism within Transformer to capture multi-modal feature representation from paired graphs of SC and FC. Taken together, we propose a biological-inspired deep model, coined as NeuroPath, to find putative connectomic feature representations from the unprecedented amount of neuroimages, which can be plugged into various downstream applications such as task recognition and disease diagnosis. We have evaluated NeuroPath on large-scale public datasets including HCP and UK Biobank under supervised and zero-shot learning, where the state-of-the-art performance by our NeuroPath indicates great potential in network neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17525">When A Man Says He Is Pregnant: ERP Evidence for A Rational Account of Speaker-contextualized Language Comprehension</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.17525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spoken language is often, if not always, understood in a context that includes the identities of speakers. For instance, we can easily make sense of an utterance such as "I'm going to have a manicure this weekend" or "The first time I got pregnant I had a hard time" when the utterance is spoken by a woman, but it would be harder to understand when it is spoken by a man. Previous event-related potential (ERP) studies have shown mixed results regarding the neurophysiological responses to such speaker-mismatched utterances, with some reporting an N400 effect and others a P600 effect. In an experiment involving 64 participants, we showed that these different ERP effects reflect distinct cognitive processes employed to resolve the speaker-message mismatch. When possible, the message is integrated with the speaker context to arrive at an interpretation, as in the case of violations of social stereotypes (e.g., men getting a manicure), resulting in an N400 effect. However, when such integration is impossible due to violations of biological knowledge (e.g., men getting pregnant), listeners engage in an error correction process to revise either the perceived utterance or the speaker context, resulting in a P600 effect. Additionally, we found that the social N400 effect decreased as a function of the listener's personality trait of openness, while the biological P600 effect remained robust. Our findings help to reconcile the empirical inconsistencies in the literature and provide a rational account of speaker-contextualized language comprehension.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17599">Information thermodynamics: from physics to neuroscience</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.17599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a perspective on applying the concepts of information thermodynamics, developed recently in non-equilibrium statistical physics, to problems in theoretical neuroscience. Historically, information and energy in neuroscience have been treated separately, in contrast to physics approaches, where the relationship of entropy production with heat is a central idea. It is argued here that also in neural systems information and energy can be considered within the same theoretical framework. Starting from basic ideas of thermodynamics and information theory on a classic Brownian particle, it is shown how noisy neural networks can infer its probabilistic motion. The decoding of the particle motion by neurons is performed with some accuracy and it has some energy cost, and both can be determined using information thermodynamics. In a similar fashion, we also discuss how neural networks in the brain can learn the particle velocity, and maintain that information in the weights of plastic synapses from a physical point of view. Generally, it is shown how the framework of stochastic and information thermodynamics can be used practically to study neural inference, learning, and information storing.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17516">Functional Classification of Spiking Signal Data Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques: A Review</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.17516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human brain neuron activities are incredibly significant nowadays. Neuronal behavior is assessed by analyzing signal data such as electroencephalography (EEG), which can offer scientists valuable information about diseases and human-computer interaction. One of the difficulties researchers confront while evaluating these signals is the existence of large volumes of spike data. Spikes are some considerable parts of signal data that can happen as a consequence of vital biomarkers or physical issues such as electrode movements. Hence, distinguishing types of spikes is important. From this spot, the spike classification concept commences. Previously, researchers classified spikes manually. The manual classification was not precise enough as it involves extensive analysis. Consequently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) was introduced into neuroscience to assist clinicians in classifying spikes correctly. This review discusses the importance and use of AI in spike classification, focusing on the recognition of neural activity noises. The task is divided into three main components: preprocessing, classification, and evaluation. Existing methods are introduced and their importance is determined. The review also highlights the need for more efficient algorithms. The primary goal is to provide a perspective on spike classification for future research and provide a comprehensive understanding of the methodologies and issues involved. The review organizes materials in the spike classification field for future studies. In this work, numerous studies were extracted from different databases. The PRISMA-related research guidelines were then used to choose papers. Then, research studies based on spike classification using machine learning and deep learning approaches with effective preprocessing were selected.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17661">A Fuzzy-based Approach to Predict Human Interaction by Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.17661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper introduces a Fuzzy-based Attention (Fuzzy Attention Layer) mechanism, a novel computational approach to enhance the interpretability and efficacy of neural models in psychological research. The proposed Fuzzy Attention Layer mechanism is integrated as a neural network layer within the Transformer Encoder model to facilitate the analysis of complex psychological phenomena through neural signals, such as those captured by functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). By leveraging fuzzy logic, the Fuzzy Attention Layer is capable of learning and identifying interpretable patterns of neural activity. This capability addresses a significant challenge when using Transformer: the lack of transparency in determining which specific brain activities most contribute to particular predictions. Our experimental results demonstrated on fNIRS data from subjects engaged in social interactions involving handholding reveal that the Fuzzy Attention Layer not only learns interpretable patterns of neural activity but also enhances model performance. Additionally, the learned patterns provide deeper insights into the neural correlates of interpersonal touch and emotional exchange. The application of our model shows promising potential in deciphering the subtle complexities of human social behaviors, thereby contributing significantly to the fields of social neuroscience and psychological AI.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12124">Optimal Visual Search with Highly Heuristic Decision Rules</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.12124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual search is a fundamental natural task for humans and other animals. We investigated the decision processes humans use when searching briefly presented displays having well-separated potential target-object locations. Performance was compared with the Bayesian-optimal decision process under the assumption that the information from the different potential target locations is statistically independent. Surprisingly, humans performed slightly better than optimal, despite humans' substantial loss of sensitivity in the fovea, and the implausibility of the human brain replicating the optimal computations. We show that three factors can quantitatively explain these seemingly paradoxical results. Most importantly, simple and fixed heuristic decision rules reach near optimal search performance. Secondly, foveal neglect primarily affects only the central potential target location. Finally, spatially correlated neural noise causes search performance to exceed that predicted for independent noise. These findings have far-reaching implications for understanding visual search tasks and other identification tasks in humans and other animals.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04428">Hybrid Spiking Neural Networks for Low-Power Intra-Cortical Brain-Machine Interfaces</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.04428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intra-cortical brain-machine interfaces (iBMIs) have the potential to dramatically improve the lives of people with paraplegia by restoring their ability to perform daily activities. However, current iBMIs suffer from scalability and mobility limitations due to bulky hardware and wiring. Wireless iBMIs offer a solution but are constrained by a limited data rate. To overcome this challenge, we are investigating hybrid spiking neural networks for embedded neural decoding in wireless iBMIs. The networks consist of a temporal convolution-based compression followed by recurrent processing and a final interpolation back to the original sequence length. As recurrent units, we explore gated recurrent units (GRUs), leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons, and a combination of both - spiking GRUs (sGRUs) and analyze their differences in terms of accuracy, footprint, and activation sparsity. To that end, we train decoders on the "Nonhuman Primate Reaching with Multichannel Sensorimotor Cortex Electrophysiology" dataset and evaluate it using the NeuroBench framework, targeting both tracks of the IEEE BioCAS Grand Challenge on Neural Decoding. Our approach achieves high accuracy in predicting velocities of primate reaching movements from multichannel primary motor cortex recordings while maintaining a low number of synaptic operations, surpassing the current baseline models in the NeuroBench framework. This work highlights the potential of hybrid neural networks to facilitate wireless iBMIs with high decoding precision and a substantial increase in the number of monitored neurons, paving the way toward more advanced neuroprosthetic technologies.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17693">Spatial embedding promotes a specific form of modularity with low entropy and heterogeneous spectral dynamics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.17693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how biological constraints shape neural computation is a central goal of computational neuroscience. Spatially embedded recurrent neural networks provide a promising avenue to study how modelled constraints shape the combined structural and functional organisation of networks over learning. Prior work has shown that spatially embedded systems like this can combine structure and function into single artificial models during learning. But it remains unclear precisely how, in general, structural constraints bound the range of attainable configurations. In this work, we show that it is possible to study these restrictions through entropic measures of the neural weights and eigenspectrum, across both rate and spiking neural networks. Spatial embedding, in contrast to baseline models, leads to networks with a highly specific low entropy modularity where connectivity is readily interpretable given the known spatial and communication constraints acting on them. Crucially, these networks also demonstrate systematically modulated spectral dynamics, revealing how they exploit heterogeneity in their function to overcome the constraints imposed on their structure. This work deepens our understanding of constrained learning in neural networks, across coding schemes and tasks, where solutions to simultaneous structural and functional objectives must be accomplished in tandem.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17786">Predicting the Stay Length of Patients in Hospitals using Convolutional Gated Recurrent Deep Learning Model</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.17786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting hospital length of stay (LoS) stands as a critical factor in shaping public health strategies. This data serves as a cornerstone for governments to discern trends, patterns, and avenues for enhancing healthcare delivery. In this study, we introduce a robust hybrid deep learning model, a combination of Multi-layer Convolutional (CNNs) deep learning, Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and Dense neural networks, that outperforms 11 conventional and state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methodologies in accurately forecasting inpatient hospital stay duration. Our investigation delves into the implementation of this hybrid model, scrutinising variables like geographic indicators tied to caregiving institutions, demographic markers encompassing patient ethnicity, race, and age, as well as medical attributes such as the CCS diagnosis code, APR DRG code, illness severity metrics, and hospital stay duration. Statistical evaluations reveal the pinnacle LoS accuracy achieved by our proposed model (CNN-GRU-DNN), which averages at 89% across a 10-fold cross-validation test, surpassing LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by 19%, 18.2%, 18.6%, and 7%, respectively. Accurate LoS predictions not only empower hospitals to optimise resource allocation and curb expenses associated with prolonged stays but also pave the way for novel strategies in hospital stay management. This avenue holds promise for catalysing advancements in healthcare research and innovation, inspiring a new era of precision-driven healthcare practices.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18016">Relating Superconducting Optoelectronic Networks to Classical Neurodynamics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.18016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The circuits comprising superconducting optoelectronic synapses, dendrites, and neurons are described by numerically cumbersome and formally opaque coupled differential equations. Reference 1 showed that a phenomenological model of superconducting loop neurons eliminates the need to solve the Josephson circuit equations that describe synapses and dendrites. The initial goal of the model was to decrease the time required for simulations, yet an additional benefit of the model was increased transparency of the underlying neural circuit operations and conceptual clarity regarding the connection of loop neurons to other physical systems. Whereas the original model simplified the treatment of the Josephson-junction dynamics, essentially by only considering low-pass versions of the dendritic outputs, the model resorted to an awkward treatment of spikes generated by semiconductor transmitter circuits that required explicitly checking for threshold crossings and distinct treatment of time steps wherein somatic threshold is reached. Here we extend that model to simplify the treatment of spikes coming from somas, again making use of the fact that in neural systems the downstream recipients of spike events almost always perform low-pass filtering. We provide comparisons between the first and second phenomenological models, quantifying the accuracy of the additional approximations. We identify regions of circuit parameter space in which the extended model works well and regions where it works poorly. For some circuit parameters it is possible to represent the downstream dendritic response to a single spike as well as coincidences or sequences of spikes, indicating the model is not simply a reduction to rate coding. The governing equations are shown to be nearly identical to those ubiquitous in the neuroscience literature for modeling leaky-integrator dendrites and neurons.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet they struggle with inconsistent reasoning, particularly in novel domains and complex logical sequences. This research introduces Proof of Thought, a framework that enhances the reliability and transparency of LLM outputs. Our approach bridges LLM-generated ideas with formal logic verification, employing a custom interpreter to convert LLM outputs into First Order Logic constructs for theorem prover scrutiny. Central to our method is an intermediary JSON-based Domain-Specific Language, which by design balances precise logical structures with intuitive human concepts. This hybrid representation enables both rigorous validation and accessible human comprehension of LLM reasoning processes. Key contributions include a robust type system with sort management for enhanced logical integrity, explicit representation of rules for clear distinction between factual and inferential knowledge, and a flexible architecture that allows for easy extension to various domain-specific applications. We demonstrate Proof of Thought's effectiveness through benchmarking on StrategyQA and a novel multimodal reasoning task, showing improved performance in open-ended scenarios. By providing verifiable and interpretable results, our technique addresses critical needs for AI system accountability and sets a foundation for human-in-the-loop oversight in high-stakes domains.

Abstract: The field of artificial intelligence faces significant challenges in achieving both biological plausibility and computational efficiency, particularly in visual learning tasks. Current artificial neural networks, such as convolutional neural networks, rely on techniques like backpropagation and weight sharing, which do not align with the brain's natural information processing methods. To address these issues, we propose the Memory Network, a model inspired by biological principles that avoids backpropagation and convolutions, and operates in a single pass. This approach enables rapid and efficient learning, mimicking the brain's ability to adapt quickly with minimal exposure to data. Our experiments demonstrate that the Memory Network achieves efficient and biologically plausible learning, showing strong performance on simpler datasets like MNIST. However, further refinement is needed for the model to handle more complex datasets such as CIFAR10, highlighting the need to develop new algorithms and techniques that closely align with biological processes while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Volatile memristors have recently gained popularity as promising devices for neuromorphic circuits, capable of mimicking the leaky function of neurons and offering advantages over capacitor-based circuits in terms of power dissipation and area. Additionally, volatile memristors are useful as selector devices and for hardware security circuits such as physical unclonable functions. To facilitate the design and simulation of circuits, a compact behavioral model is essential. This paper proposes V-VTEAM, a compact, simple, general, and flexible behavioral model for volatile memristors, inspired by the VTEAM nonvolatile memristor model and developed in MATLAB. The validity of the model is demonstrated by fitting it to an ion drift/diffusion-based Ag/SiOx/C/W volatile memristor, achieving a relative root mean error square of 4.5%.

                arXiv:2409.18032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating fluid flow around arbitrary shapes is key to solving various engineering problems. However, simulating flow physics across complex geometries remains numerically challenging and computationally resource-intensive, particularly when using conventional PDE solvers. Machine learning methods offer attractive opportunities to create fast and adaptable PDE solvers. However, benchmark datasets to measure the performance of such methods are scarce, especially for flow physics across complex geometries. We introduce FlowBench, a dataset for neural simulators with over 10K samples, which is currently larger than any publicly available flow physics dataset. FlowBench contains flow simulation data across complex geometries (\textit{parametric vs. non-parametric}), spanning a range of flow conditions (\textit{Reynolds number and Grashoff number}), capturing a diverse array of flow phenomena (\textit{steady vs. transient; forced vs. free convection}), and for both 2D and 3D. FlowBench contains over 10K data samples, with each sample the outcome of a fully resolved, direct numerical simulation using a well-validated simulator framework designed for modeling transport phenomena in complex geometries. For each sample, we include velocity, pressure, and temperature field data at 3 different resolutions and several summary statistics features of engineering relevance (such as coefficients of lift and drag, and Nusselt numbers). %Additionally, we include masks and signed distance fields for each shape. We envision that FlowBench will enable evaluating the interplay between complex geometry, coupled flow phenomena, and data sufficiency on the performance of current, and future, neural PDE solvers. We enumerate several evaluation metrics to help rank order the performance of neural PDE solvers. We benchmark the performance of several baseline methods including FNO, CNO, WNO, and DeepONet.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL), the remarkable ability to solve a task from only input exemplars, is often assumed to be a unique hallmark of Transformer models. By examining commonly employed synthetic ICL tasks, we demonstrate that multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) can also learn in-context. Moreover, MLPs, and the closely related MLP-Mixer models, learn in-context competitively with Transformers given the same compute budget in this setting. We further show that MLPs outperform Transformers on a series of classical tasks from psychology designed to test relational reasoning, which are closely related to in-context classification. These results underscore a need for studying in-context learning beyond attention-based architectures, while also challenging strong prior arguments about MLPs' limited ability to solve relational tasks. Altogether, our results highlight the unexpected competence of MLPs, and support the growing interest in all-MLP alternatives to task-specific architectures.

                arXiv:2407.00312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-stage neural combinatorial optimization solvers have achieved near-optimal results on various small-scale combinatorial optimization (CO) problems without needing expert knowledge. However, these solvers exhibit significant performance degradation when applied to large-scale CO problems. Recently, two-stage neural methods with divide-and-conquer strategies have shown efficiency in addressing large-scale CO problems. Nevertheless, the performance of these methods highly relies on problem-specific heuristics in either the divide or the conquer procedure, which limits their applicability to general CO problems. Moreover, these methods employ separate training schemes and ignore the interdependencies between the dividing and conquering strategies, which often leads to sub-optimal solutions. To tackle these drawbacks, this article develops a unified neural divide-and-conquer framework (i.e., UDC) for solving general large-scale CO problems. UDC offers a Divide-Conquer-Reunion (DCR) training method to eliminate the negative impact of a sub-optimal dividing policy. Employing a high-efficiency Graph Neural Network (GNN) for global instance dividing and a fixed-length sub-path solver for conquering divided sub-problems, the proposed UDC framework demonstrates extensive applicability, achieving superior performance in 10 representative large-scale CO problems. The code is available at https://github.com/CIAM-Group/NCO_code/tree/main/single_objective/UDC-Large-scale-CO-master.

Abstract: Recent research in Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) have shown that meta-trained neural networks can effectively guide the design of black-box optimizers, significantly reducing the need for expert tuning and delivering robust performance across complex problem distributions. Despite their success, a paradox remains: MetaBBO still rely on human-crafted Exploratory Landscape Analysis features to inform the meta-level agent about the low-level optimization progress. To address the gap, this paper proposes Neural Exploratory Landscape Analysis (NeurELA), a novel framework that dynamically profiles landscape features through a two-stage, attention-based neural network, executed in an entirely end-to-end fashion. NeurELA is pre-trained over a variety of MetaBBO algorithms using a multi-task neuroevolution strategy. Extensive experiments show that NeurELA achieves consistently superior performance when integrated into different and even unseen MetaBBO tasks and can be efficiently fine-tuned for further performance boost. This advancement marks a pivotal step in making MetaBBO algorithms more autonomous and broadly applicable.The source code of NeurELA can be accessed at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Neur-ELA-303C.

	<p>Background: Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by structural changes in the brain, including hippocampal atrophy, cortical thinning, amyloid plaques, and tau tangles. Due to the aging of the global population, the burden of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease is expected to increase, making the exploration of non-pharmacological interventions, such as physical exercise, an urgent priority. Results: There is emerging evidence that regular physical exercise may mitigate the structural and functional declines associated with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. The underlying mechanisms, however, remain poorly understood. Gut&amp;amp;ndash;brain axis research is a promising area for further investigation. This system involves bidirectional communication between the gut microbiome and the brain. According to recent studies, the gut microbiome may influence brain health through modulating neuroinflammation, producing neuroactive compounds, and altering metabolic processes. Exercise has been shown to alter the composition of the gut microbiome, potentially impacting brain structure and function. In this review, we aim to synthesize current research on the relationship between physical exercise, structural brain changes in Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, and the gut&amp;amp;ndash;brain axis. Conclusions: In this study, we will investigate whether changes in the gut microbiome induced by physical exercise can mediate its neuroprotective effects, offering new insights into the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. By integrating findings from neuroimaging studies, clinical trials, and microbiome research, this review will highlight potential mechanisms. It will also identify key gaps in the literature. This will pave the way for future research directions.</p>

	<p>Background: Long COVID-19 is an emerging chronic illness of significant public health concern due to a myriad of neuropsychiatric sequelae, including increased suicidal ideation (SI) and behavior (SB). Methods: This review provides a concise synthesis of clinical evidence that points toward the dysfunction of astrocytes, the most abundant glial cell type in the central nervous system, as a potential shared pathology between SI/SB and COVID-19. Results: Depression, a suicide risk factor, and SI/SB were both associated with reduced frequencies of various astrocyte subsets and complex proteomic/transcriptional changes of astrocyte-related markers in a brain-region-specific manner. Astrocyte-related circulating markers were increased in depressed subjects and, to a less consistent extent, in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, reactive astrocytosis was observed in subjects with SI/SB and those with COVID-19. Conclusions: Astrocyte dysfunctions occurred in depression, SI/SB, and COVID-19. Reactive-astrocyte-mediated loss of the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier (BBB) integrity and subsequent neuroinflammation&amp;amp;mdash;a factor previously linked to SI/SB development&amp;amp;mdash;might contribute to increased suicide in individuals with long COVID-19. As such, the formulation of new therapeutic strategies to restore astrocyte homeostasis, enhance BBB integrity, and mitigate neuroinflammation may reduce SI/SB-associated neuropsychiatric manifestations among long COVID-19 patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-788/v2?src=rss">Cheating and plagiarism in higher education institutions (HEIs): A literature review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Cheating and plagiarism have become serious problems in higher education institutions (HEIs). It affects educational quality as well as the reputation of higher education. The purpose of this study is to identify the most prevalent types of cheating and plagiarism, as well as the elements that contribute to cheating and plagiarism, and to present solutions to this recurring problem. This paper systematically reviews 45 articles published from 2018, to 2022, aligned with the PRISMA guidelines in the selection, filtering, and reporting of the papers. This review shows that factors such as increased pressure on students, poor academic integrity awareness, lack of up-to-date academic honor codes, and the unethical application of AI tools are prime contributing factors to cheating and plagiarism in HEIs. In a broader sense, all these factors are classified as individual, social, cultural, institutional, and technological factors that are responsible for this problem. This problem can be reduced by establishing ethical and moral development tutorials as well as formulating up-to-date honor codes considering AI tools. Furthermore, higher education institutions must develop anti-plagiarism detection software in order to detect plagiarism and aid students in improving academic writing and paraphrasing approaches. The findings of this systematic literature review provide useful insights for educators and policymakers to solve the complicated issue of cheating and plagiarism in higher education institutions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1097/v1?src=rss">A high-throughput gene expression analysis software tool for developmental time series and gene signature analysis of human cardiomyocyte differentiation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Publicly available high-throughput gene expression data enable the investigation of biological processes by the scientific community. Although several bioinformatics tools offer methodologies for basic differential gene expression analysis, difficulties arise in the analysis of multiple sample groups comprising a developmental time series, especially when the identification and classification of unique gene expression patterns is the primary goal of the study. Data analysis using these tools requires programming experience, which limits the accessibility of these tools to the broader community. To streamline developmental time-series investigations, we created the Developmental Gene Expression Analysis (devGEA) tool. This environment can be implemented locally or via web browsers to expedite differential gene expression analysis. This tool provides gene signature determination methods that can classify differentially expressed genes based on their correlation with gene expression patterns. devGEA was used to characterize cardiac development gene expression signatures from high-throughput RNA-seq datasets profiling small-molecule directed cardiomyocyte differentiation of human pluripotent stem cell lines (hiPSCs). After pre-processing, discrete gene expression criteria-based expected changes were used to classify the genes into developmental signatures. Several cardiomyocyte differentiation markers and candidate cardiac genes representing different developmental signatures were experimentally validated using the GIBCOTM hiPSC line. This method was then compared to a gene signature correlation approach that classified expressed genes based on their degree of similarity with key cardiac developmental signatures representing the stages of cardiomyocyte differentiation. Therefore, devGEA provides a robust workflow for investigator-driven analysis of developmental time series, allowing for the identification of differentially expressed genes and gene signatures for extensive experimental investigation. We also introduced a method for classifying genes by their correlation with genes or developmental patterns of interest. Our correlation-based method takes advantage of a priori knowledge of an experiment and is conceptually simpler than unsupervised clustering approaches.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-789/v2?src=rss">Occurrence of pathogenic yeast species in artisanal cheeses from Boyacá, Colombia, including fluconazole resistant isolates [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Yeasts are widely known for their application in food production, but also because of their clinical significance. As human pathogens, several species of yeasts, mainly of the genus Candida, are responsible for a great number of life-threatening infections. The occurrence of yeasts in cheeses, including pathogenic species, has been largely studied, yet the antifungal susceptibility of these microorganisms is rarely reported. Here, we identified the species and determined the antifungal susceptibility profile of 45 Candida isolates recovered from artisanal cheeses from 20 cities in Boyacá, Colombia. Among the species, Candida lambica (28.9%) prevailed, followed by Candida krusei (24.4%), Candida kefyr (22.2%), Candida lusitaniae (11.1%), Candida inconspicua (6.7%) Candida parapsilosis (4.4%) and Candida guillermondii (2.2%). Notably, all seven species have been globally reported, to a greater or lesser extent, to cause fungemia and other invasive infections with high mortality rates. Remarkably, most isolates of C. lambica C. krusei, C. inconspicua and C. parapsilosis were resistant to fluconazole, one of the most common drugs to treat candidiasis. Our findings highlight the importance of exploring the ecological niches of pathogenic yeasts, together with their antifungal susceptibility, considering that the emergence of resistance in non-commensal opportunistic pathogens poses a serious threat to public health.

                Global suicide rates owing to disaster impacts have been confusing because of varied and unclear results. This study aimed to investigate how suicides have occurred worldwide during disasters. The methodology used included a systematic literature review and comparative analysis. The disaster exacerbation (X, bad human nature, or suicide rate rise) perspective was compared with the disaster resilience (Y, good human nature, or suicide rate fall) perspective to extract disaster ecology (Z, neutral human nature, or suicide rate fluctuation) perspective from international leaders, government officials, researchers, and disaster victims. A major theme was that the four stakeholders would adopt the Z perspective based on the fusion of X and Y perspectives (leading to X+Y=Z), while embracing heterogeneous research, proactive and long-term strategies, education, and so on. This study relied heavily on the large-scale dynamics of suicide rates than previous studies.

                <p>by Ylva Katarina Wedmark, Jon Olav Vik, Ove Øyås</p>

The metabolic network of an organism can be analyzed as a constraint-based model. This analysis can be biased, optimizing an objective such as growth rate, or unbiased, aiming to describe the full feasible space of metabolic fluxes through pathway analysis or random flux sampling. In particular, pathway analysis can decompose the flux space into fundamental and formally defined metabolic pathways. Unbiased methods scale poorly with network size due to combinatorial explosion, but a promising approach to improve scalability is to focus on metabolic subnetworks, e.g., cells’ metabolite exchanges with each other and the environment, rather than the full metabolic networks. Here, we applied pathway enumeration and flux sampling to metabolite exchanges in microbial species and a microbial community, using models ranging from central carbon metabolism to genome-scale and focusing on pathway definitions that allow direct targeting of subnetworks such as metabolite exchanges (elementary conversion modes, elementary flux patterns, and minimal pathways). Enumerating growth-supporting metabolite exchanges, we found that metabolite exchanges from different pathway definitions were related through a hierarchy, and we show that this hierarchical relationship between pathways holds for metabolic networks and subnetworks more generally. Metabolite exchange frequencies, defined as the fraction of pathways in which each metabolite was exchanged, were similar across pathway definitions, with a few specific exchanges explaining large differences in pathway counts. This indicates that biological interpretation of predicted metabolite exchanges is robust to the choice of pathway definition, and it suggests strategies for more scalable pathway analysis. Our results also signal wider biological implications, facilitating detailed and interpretable analysis of metabolite exchanges and other subnetworks in fields such as metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.

                <p>by Elena Miu, Luke Rendell, Sam Bowles, Rob Boyd, Daniel Cownden, Magnus Enquist, Kimmo Eriksson, Marcus W. Feldman, Timothy Lillicrap, Richard McElreath, Stuart Murray, James Ounsley, Kevin N. Lala</p>

Social learning is common in nature, yet cumulative culture (where knowledge and technology increase in complexity and diversity over time) appears restricted to humans. To understand why, we organized a computer tournament in which programmed entries specified when to learn new knowledge and when to refine (i.e. improve) existing knowledge. The tournament revealed a ‘refinement paradox’: refined behavior afforded higher payoffs as individuals converged on a small number of successful behavioral variants, but refining did not generally pay. Paradoxically, entries that refined only in certain conditions did best during behavioral improvement, while simple copying entries thrived when refinement levels were high. Cumulative cultural evolution may be rare in part because sophisticated strategies for improving knowledge and technology are initially advantageous, yet complex culture, once achieved, favors conformity, blind imitation and hyper-credulity.

                <p>by Carlos Albors, Jordi Mill, Andy L. Olivares, Xavier Iriart, Hubert Cochet, Oscar Camara</p>

Left atrial appendage occlusion devices (LAAO) are a feasible alternative for non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) patients at high risk of thromboembolic stroke and contraindication to antithrombotic therapies. However, optimal LAAO device configurations (i.e., size, type, location) remain unstandardized due to the large anatomical variability of the left atrial appendage (LAA) morphology, leading to a 4-6% incidence of device-related thrombus (DRT). In-silico simulations have the potential to assess DRT risk and identify the key factors, such as suboptimal device positioning. This work presents fluid simulation results computed on 20 patient-specific left atrial geometries, analysing different commercially available LAAO occluders, including plug-type and pacifier-type devices. In addition, we explored two distinct device positions: 1) the real post-LAAO intervention configuration derived from follow-up imaging; and 2) one covering the pulmonary ridge if it was not achieved during the implantation (13 out of 20). In total, 33 different configurations were analysed. In-silico indices indicating high risk of DRT (e.g., low blood flow velocities and flow complexity around the device) were combined with particle deposition analysis based on a discrete phase model. The obtained results revealed that covering the pulmonary ridge with the LAAO device may be one of the key factors to prevent DRT, resulting in higher velocities and reduced flow recirculations (e.g., mean velocities of 0.183 ± 0.12 m/s and 0.236 ± 0.16 m/s for uncovered versus covered positions in DRT patients). Moreover, disk-based devices exhibited enhanced adaptability to various LAA morphologies and, generally, demonstrated a lower risk of abnormal events after LAAO implantation.

Understanding perturbations in circulating lipid levels that often occur years or decades before clinical symptoms may enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms and provide novel intervention opportunities. Here, we assessed if polygenic scores (PGSs) for complex traits could detect lipid dysfunctions related to the traits and provide new biological insights. We constructed genome-wide PGSs (approximately 1 million genetic variants) for 50 complex traits in 7,169 Finnish individuals with routine clinical lipid profiles and lipidomics measurements (179 lipid species). We identified 678 associations (<i>P</i> < 9.0 × 10<sup>−5</sup>) involving 26 traits and 142 lipids. Most of these associations were also validated with the actual phenotype measurements where available (89.5% of 181 associations where the trait was available), suggesting that these associations represent early signs of physiological changes of the traits. We detected many known relationships (e.g., PGS for body mass index (BMI) and lysophospholipids, PGS for type 2 diabetes and triacyglycerols) and those that suggested potential target for prevention strategies (e.g., PGS for venous thromboembolism and arachidonic acid). We also found association of PGS for favorable adiposity with increased sphingomyelins levels, suggesting a probable role of sphingomyelins in increased risk for certain disease, e.g., venous thromboembolism as reported previously, in favorable adiposity despite its favorable metabolic effect. Altogether, our study provides a comprehensive characterization of lipidomic alterations in genetic predisposition for a wide range of complex traits. The study also demonstrates potential of PGSs for complex traits to capture early, presymptomatic lipid alterations, highlighting its utility in understanding disease mechanisms and early disease detection.

                <p>by Alexander Kroll, Nico Niebuhr, Gregory Butler, Martin J. Lercher</p>

Transport proteins play a crucial role in cellular metabolism and are central to many aspects of molecular biology and medicine. Determining the function of transport proteins experimentally is challenging, as they become unstable when isolated from cell membranes. Machine learning-based predictions could provide an efficient alternative. However, existing methods are limited to predicting a small number of specific substrates or broad transporter classes. These limitations stem partly from using small data sets for model training and a choice of input features that lack sufficient information about the prediction problem. Here, we present SPOT, the first general machine learning model that can successfully predict specific substrates for arbitrary transport proteins, achieving an accuracy above 92% on independent and diverse test data covering widely different transporters and a broad range of metabolites. SPOT uses Transformer Networks to represent transporters and substrates numerically. To overcome the problem of missing negative data for training, it augments a large data set of known transporter-substrate pairs with carefully sampled random molecules as non-substrates. SPOT not only predicts specific transporter-substrate pairs, but also outperforms previously published models designed to predict broad substrate classes for individual transport proteins. We provide a web server and Python function that allows users to explore the substrate scope of arbitrary transporters.

                <p>by Jobran Chebib, Anika Jonas, Eugenio López-Cortegano, Sven Künzel, Diethard Tautz, Peter D. Keightley</p>

Each generation, spontaneous mutations introduce heritable changes that tend to reduce fitness in populations of highly adapted living organisms. This erosion of fitness is countered by natural selection, which keeps deleterious mutations at low frequencies and ultimately removes most of them from the population. The classical way of studying the impact of spontaneous mutations is via mutation accumulation (MA) experiments, where lines of small effective population size are bred for many generations in conditions where natural selection is largely removed. Such experiments in microbes, invertebrates, and plants have generally demonstrated that fitness decays as a result of MA. However, the phenotypic consequences of MA in vertebrates are largely unknown, because no replicated MA experiment has previously been carried out. This gap in our knowledge is relevant for human populations, where societal changes have reduced the strength of natural selection, potentially allowing deleterious mutations to accumulate. Here, we study the impact of spontaneous MA on the mean and genetic variation for quantitative and fitness-related traits in the house mouse using the MA experimental design, with a cryopreserved control to account for environmental influences. We show that variation for morphological and life history traits accumulates at a sufficiently high rate to maintain genetic variation and selection response. Weight and tail length measures decrease significantly between 0.04% and 0.3% per generation with narrow confidence intervals. Fitness proxy measures (litter size and surviving offspring) decrease on average by about 0.2% per generation, but with confidence intervals overlapping zero. When extrapolated to humans, our results imply that the rate of fitness loss should not be of concern in the foreseeable future.

[version 2; peer review: 1 appr</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Restorative dental materials are defined as substances that are used to repair, replace, or enhance a patient’s teeth. Various materials used in paediatric dentistry are zinc oxide eugenol, glass ionomer cement, resin composite, calcium hydroxide, silver amalgam, giomers etc. GIC is a biocompatible material having a low thermal expansion coefficient and fluoride release property. There are still a few drawbacks of GICdue of their poor mechanical properties therefore addition of Silver Nanoparticles demonstrated improved mechanical and bactericidal capabilities. There hasn’t been much study on the quality of the bond contact between silver nanoparticles and dentin, as well as the color’s durability. Aim: To evaluate and compare the mechanical properties and bond strength of Glass ionomer cement reinforced with three different concentrations of silver nanoparticle as against conventional glass ionomer cement in primary Teeth. Materials and Method: Silver nanoparticles will be prepared using three chemicals namely, silver nitrate, sodium citrate and tannic acid. Traditional GIC (GC Fuji II, GC Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) will be purchased. Three different concentrations of silver nanoparticles will be prepared i.e., 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6%. The GIC specimens will then be divided into 4 groups: GIC without silver nanoparticles (AgNPs),0.2%,0.4% and 0.6% AgNPs. Mechanical properties will be checked such as compressive, tensile, and bond strength using Universal Testing Machine. Expected Results: GIC reinforced with silver nano particles is expected to have better mechanical strength, less microleakage and wear resistance, greater fracture resistance and adhesive bond strength. Conclusion: GIC reinforced with silver nano particles will be expected to have better mechanical and physical properties than conventional Type II GICs and is expected to be a promising material for restoration in primary teeth.

                Background An abundance of rapidly accumulating scientific evidence presents novel opportunities for researchers and practitioners alike, yet such advantages are often overshadowed by resource demands associated with finding and aggregating a continually expanding body of scientific information. Data extraction activities associated with evidence synthesis have been described as time-consuming to the point of critically limiting the usefulness of research. Across social science disciplines, the use of automation technologies for timely and accurate knowledge synthesis can enhance research translation value, better inform key policy development, and expand the current understanding of human interactions, organizations, and systems. Ongoing developments surrounding automation are highly concentrated in research for evidence-based medicine with limited evidence surrounding tools and techniques applied outside of the clinical research community. The goal of the present study is to extend the automation knowledge base by synthesizing current trends in the application of extraction technologies of key data elements of interest for social scientists. Methods We report the baseline results of a living systematic review of automated data extraction techniques supporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses in the social sciences. This review follows PRISMA standards for reporting systematic reviews. Results The baseline review of social science research yielded 23 relevant studies. Conclusions When considering the process of automating systematic review and meta-analysis information extraction, social science research falls short as compared to clinical research that focuses on automatic processing of information related to the PICO framework. With a few exceptions, most tools were either in the infancy stage and not accessible to applied researchers, were domain specific, or required substantial manual coding of articles before automation could occur. Additionally, few solutions considered extraction of data from tables which is where key data elements reside that social and behavioral scientists analyze.

                Background Selfies have been defined as “a photograph that one has taken of oneself, and are a continuing growing trend among Millennials. Narcissism refers to the personality trait of an extraordinary self-awareness and adoration. Studies have shown a close relationship between selfie-taking behaviour, narcissism and oral health. Hence, a study was conducted with aim of the influence of selfie-taking behavior and narcissism on oral health. Methods An analytical cross-sectional questionnaire study was designed using relevant literature for collating information on sociodemographic characteristics, frequency of dental visits, selfie-taking behavior and perceived oral health. Oral health examination was performed to assess decay and plaque. Narcissism was assessed using The Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory Short Form Results The study included a sample of 163 participants. The associations between selfies taken per day and perceived oral health was statistically significant (p value 0.047*). Binary logistic regression models were constructed, which were significant for perceived oral health and grandiose fantasy. Plaque Scores showed significant corelations between indifference, manipulativeness, thrill seeking and age. Step forward binary regression demonstrated a significant odds ratio for grandiose narcissism followed by selfie-taking behavior Conclusion This study revealed a correlation between perceived oral health and selfie-taking behaviour. Further studies are required to assess selfie-taking behaviour and oral health.

                Background The primary objective worldwide during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had been controlling disease transmission. However, lockdown measures used to mitigate transmission affected human behavior and altered lifestyles, with a likely impact on chronic non-communicable diseases. More than a year into the pandemic, substantial peer-reviewed literature emerged on altered lifestyles following the varying lockdown measures imposed globally to control the virus spread. We explored the impact of lockdown measures on six lifestyle factors, namely diet, physical activity, sleep, stress, social connectedness, and the use of tobacco, alcohol, or other harmful substances. Methods We comprehensively searched PubMed and the World Health Organization’s global literature database on COVID-19 and retrieved 649 relevant articles for the narrative review. A critical interpretative synthesis of the articles was performed. Results Most of the articles included in the review identified the negative effect of lockdown measures on each of the lifestyle factors in many parts of the world. Encouraging lifestyle trends were also highlighted in a few articles. Such trends can positively influence the outcome of lifestyle-related chronic diseases, such as obesity and diabetes. Conclusions The lockdown associated with COVID-19 has largely had a negative impact on the lifestyles of individuals and communities across many countries and cultures. However, some individuals and communities also initiated positive lifestyle-related behavioral changes. If the knowledge generated by studying the impact of COVID-19-related lockdowns on the six lifestyle factors is further consolidated, it could improve chronic disease outcomes. This will help better understand lifestyle behaviors amidst crises and assist in redesigning extreme public health measures such as lockdowns.. It is up to governments, communities, and healthcare/academic entities to derive benefit from lessons learned from the pandemic, with the ultimate objective of better educating and promoting healthy lifestyles among communities.

                Behçet’s disease (BD) is rare in children. Herein, we report a case of 12-year-old male child with a history of left superficial femoral vein thrombosis and bilateral pulmonary embolism, admitted for multiple thrombosis located in the inferior vena cava, right atrium and ventricle associated with multiple pulmonary artery aneurisms and fissurations concomitant to oral aphthosis, which was suggestive of BD. Despite corticoids and immunosuppressive therapy, the child had a massive hemoptysis resulting in his death. The association between intracardiac thrombosis, pulmonary aneurism and venous thrombosis should raise suspicion of angio-Behçet, which could be lethal.

                Background The escalating impact of climate change underscores the critical need for advanced and sustainable climate forecasting techniques. This review examines the current state and future prospects of leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) for climate forecasting, focusing on enhancing accuracy and identifying complex patterns in large datasets. Methods A systematic bibliometric methodology was employed, analyzing peer-reviewed literature from the past two decades. The study screened 455 articles from Scopus and Web of Science databases using specific keywords related to AI and weather forecasting. After removing duplicates and irrelevant studies, 218 articles were selected for detailed analysis. Bibliometric analysis was conducted using RStudio software to examine publication trends, co-word co-occurrence, and thematic evolution. Results The findings indicate significant growth in AI applications for climate forecasting, particularly from 2014 to 2023. AI techniques such as machine learning, artificial neural networks, and deep learning have shown promise in improving the accuracy of weather forecasts and early warning systems. The thematic analysis identified key themes like numerical weather prediction, feature selection, and neural networks as fundamental areas of research. Additionally, AI-based early warning systems for extreme weather events were highlighted as a crucial application. Below Figure 1. shows the graphical abstract of research Conclusions AI has the potential to significantly enhance climate forecasting by analyzing vast amounts of data and identifying complex patterns. Future research should focus on developing universal AI models, increasing model accuracy with explainable AI techniques, and integrating region-specific forecasts to aid decision-making in various sectors. Addressing ethical concerns and ensuring sustainable AI applications are essential for the responsible deployment of AI in climate forecasting.

                Background This study examines Muhammad Shahrur’s theory of limits and women’s issues. This theory adjusts the muhkamat verses to remain relevant to sociocultural conditions while remining within the jurisdiction of Allah SWT. Shahrur’s approach conveyed women as different from traditional ulemas and controversial. Therefore, it is necessary to describe Shahrur’s theory and interpretation of women’s issues. Methods This was an exploratory bibliographic study using descriptive-hermeneutic analysis. Two of Shahrur’s books were selected and five chapters from Al-Kitāb wa Al-Qur’ān, Qirā’ah Mu’āshirah and five chapters from Nahw Ushūl al-Jadīdah Li al-Fiqh al-Islāmy; Fiqh al-Mar’ah . Results Shahrur’s interpretations on women’s issues are: a) relationships between teenagers of the opposite sex without marriage or living together are “halal” if they follow their will without a contract and are accompanied by syecih, or permission; b) the maximum limit of the hijab is to cover the entire body except the face and palms. In contrast, the minimum limit covers the juyūb, including cleavage under the armpits, body parts, genitals, and buttocks. Apart from these, it does not include intimate parts and adapts to the community. c) Women’s intimate parts are shown only to the seven groups: brothers, fathers, children of a sibling, parents of one’s wives, and their children; d) Polygamy has both an upper limit and a lower limit. Shahrur allows polygamy under two conditions: widows with children whose husbands left them to protect them; polygamy has two limitations: a limit for quantity and a limit for quality; and e) the law of adultery has a lower and upper limit. Conclusion According to Shahrur, women’s issues are divided into four limits: sometimes they are at the upper limit and sometimes at the lower limit. Shahrur’s linguistic approach finally led him to draw the conclusion that the product of Islamic law is highly dependent on the sociocultural context.

                Hydatidosis is a pathology that is still common. Hydatid cysts commonly involves the liver and lung. Cases of multi visceral echinococcosis with atypical localization are rare. We, herein, report the case of a 53-year-old Maghrebi farmer with multiple organ hydatidosis including 13 hydatid cysts involving the lungs, the liver, the left heart ventricle, the left kidney, the abdomen cavity, the muscles (psoas, adductors), and the subcutaneous gluteal area. The majority of these cysts were already treated surgically, and some of them were due to be removed.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-241/v2?src=rss">Post kidney transplant hematologic abnormalities and association of post-transplant anemia with graft function [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Haematological abnormalities following renal transplantation are frequently observed and have a significant effect on survival and graft outcomes. The pattern of haematological abnormalities varies globally. Few studies have been conducted in Asian countries. We aimed to evaluate the patterns of haematological abnormalities in post-transplant recipients in our center during the first year after post-renal transplant and the association of post-transplant anemia with graft function. Methods This single-center retrospective study was conducted on renal transplantation recipients between 2014 and 2019. The study included all patients who received kidney transplants from live/cadaveric donors and had follow-up data collected up to 12 months after the transplant. The outcome studied was the prevalence of haematological abnormalities and the association between post-transplant anemia (PTA) and graft function in post-transplant recipients. Results A total of 106 renal transplant recipients were included in the study. The prevalence of PTA was 98% in the first week, 75% at one month, 35% at three months, 32% at six months, and 27% at 12 months. The other cytopenia cases were leukopenia (43.4%), thrombocytopenia (33.2%), and pancytopenia (15.1%). Post-transplant erythrocytosis was observed in 17.9% of patients. 18 patients with severe PTA in the first week of transplant had significant allograft dysfunction (p=0.04). Patients with and without PTA had similar graft functions at six and 12 months (p=0.50). Conclusions Haematological abnormalities are common in renal transplant recipients. PTA is highly prevalent during the first week and improves over time. Other haematological abnormalities observed were leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, and post-transplant erythrocytosis. Leucopenia was primarily drug-induced, and thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia were frequently caused by infections in our cohort. Additionally, severe PTA was significantly associated with graft dysfunction in the first week post-transplant, whereas similar graft function was observed at 6 and 12 months post-transplant, irrespective of the presence or absence of PTA.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-604/v2?src=rss">COVID-19 vaccinations and their side effects: a scoping systematic review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: The COVID-19 virus has impacted people worldwide, causing significant changes in their lifestyles. Since the emergence of the epidemic, attempts have begun to prepare a vaccine that can eliminate the virus and restore balance to life in the entire world. Over the past two years, countries and specialized companies have competed to obtain a license from the World Health Organization for the vaccines that were discovered. After the appearance of vaccines in the health community, comparisons and fears of their side effects began, but people don’t get an answer to the question of which is the best vaccine. Methods: IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, the New England Journal of Medicine, Google Scholar, and PubMed databases were searched for literature on the COVID-19 vaccine and its side effects. we surveyed the literature on the COVID-19 vaccine’s side effects and the sorts of side effects observed after vaccination. Depending on data from the literature, we compared these vaccines in terms of side effects, then we analyzed the gaps and obstacles of previous studies and made proposals to process these gaps in future studies. Results: Overall, 17 studies were included in this scoping systematic review as they fulfilled the criteria specified, the majority of which were cross-sectional and retrospective cross-sectional studies. Most of the side effects were mild, self-limiting, and common. Thus, they usually resolve within 1–3 days after vaccination. Factors associated with higher side effects included advanced age, allergic conditions, those taking other medications (particularly immunosuppressive ones), those with a history of type II diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, COVID-19 infection, and female sex. Our meta‐analyses also found that mRNA vaccines looked to be more effective, while inactivated vaccinations had fewer side effects. Conclusion: This review shows that the COVID-19 vaccine is safe to administer and induces protection.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90293">The deubiquitinase Ubp3/Usp10 constrains glucose-mediated mitochondrial repression via phosphate budgeting</a></h4>

              
                Many cells in high glucose repress mitochondrial respiration, as observed in the Crabtree and Warburg effects. Our understanding of biochemical constraints for mitochondrial activation is limited. Using a <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> screen, we identified the conserved deubiquitinase Ubp3 (Usp10), as necessary for mitochondrial repression. Ubp3 mutants have increased mitochondrial activity despite abundant glucose, along with decreased glycolytic enzymes, and a rewired glucose metabolic network with increased trehalose production. Utilizing <i>∆ubp3</i> cells, along with orthogonal approaches, we establish that the high glycolytic flux in glucose continuously consumes free Pi. This restricts mitochondrial access to inorganic phosphate (Pi), and prevents mitochondrial activation. Contrastingly, rewired glucose metabolism with enhanced trehalose production and reduced GAPDH (as in <i>∆ubp3</i> cells) restores Pi. This collectively results in increased mitochondrial Pi and derepression, while restricting mitochondrial Pi transport prevents activation. We therefore suggest that glycolytic flux-dependent intracellular Pi budgeting is a key constraint for mitochondrial repression.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97662">Muscle-resident mesenchymal progenitors sense and repair peripheral nerve injury via the GDNF-BDNF axis</a></h4>

              
                Fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) are muscle-resident mesenchymal progenitors that can contribute to muscle tissue homeostasis and regeneration, as well as postnatal maturation and lifelong maintenance of the neuromuscular system. Recently, traumatic injury to the peripheral nerve was shown to activate FAPs, suggesting that FAPs can respond to nerve injury. However, questions of how FAPs can sense the anatomically distant peripheral nerve injury and whether FAPs can directly contribute to nerve regeneration remained unanswered. Here, utilizing single-cell transcriptomics and mouse models, we discovered that a subset of FAPs expressing GDNF receptors <i>Ret</i> and <i>Gfra1</i> can respond to peripheral nerve injury by sensing GDNF secreted by Schwann cells. Upon GDNF sensing, this subset becomes activated and expresses <i>Bdnf</i>. FAP-specific inactivation of <i>Bdnf</i> (<i>Prrx1<sup>Cre</sup>; Bdnf<sup>fl/fl</sup></i>) resulted in delayed nerve regeneration owing to defective remyelination, indicating that GDNF-sensing FAPs play an important role in the remyelination process during peripheral nerve regeneration. In aged mice, significantly reduced <i>Bdnf</i> expression in FAPs was observed upon nerve injury, suggesting the clinical relevance of FAP-derived BDNF in the age-related delays in nerve regeneration. Collectively, our study revealed the previously unidentified role of FAPs in peripheral nerve regeneration, and the molecular mechanism behind FAPs’ response to peripheral nerve injury.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94916">Hippocampal-occipital connectivity reflects autobiographical memory deficits in aphantasia</a></h4>

              
                Aphantasia refers to reduced or absent visual imagery. While most of us can readily recall decade-old personal experiences (autobiographical memories, AM) with vivid mental images, there is a dearth of information about whether the loss of visual imagery in aphantasics affects their AM retrieval. The hippocampus is thought to be a crucial hub in a brain-wide network underlying AM. One important question is whether this network, especially the connectivity of the hippocampus, is altered in aphantasia. In the current study, we tested 14 congenital aphantasics and 16 demographically matched controls in an AM fMRI task to investigate how key brain regions (i.e. hippocampus and visual-perceptual cortices) interact with each other during AM re-experiencing. All participants were interviewed regarding their autobiographical memory to examine their episodic and semantic recall of specific events. Aphantasics reported more difficulties in recalling AM, were less confident about their memories, and described less internal and emotional details than controls. Neurally, aphantasics displayed decreased hippocampal and increased visual-perceptual cortex activation during AM retrieval compared to controls. In addition, controls showed strong negative functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the visual cortex during AM and resting-state functional connectivity between these two brain structures predicted better visualization skills. Our results indicate that visual mental imagery plays an important role in detail-rich vivid AM, and that this type of cognitive function is supported by the functional connection between the hippocampus and the visual-perceptual cortex.

">Cerebellar control of targeted tongue movements</a></h4>

              
                The cerebellum is critical for coordinating movements related to eating, drinking and swallowing. Cerebellar Purkinje cell activity has been shown to encode ongoing tongue movements, but it is unclear how this activity can alter the trajectory of the tongue. To elucidate the impact of Purkinje cells on goal-directed tongue movements, we recorded their activity in the vermis and hemispheres during spontaneous licking from a stationary or moving water spout. Some Purkinje cells encode rhythmic tongue movements with their complex spikes, others with their simple spikes or a combination of both. Complex spikes predominantly marked the start and end of a licking bout, and thus encoded behavioural state changes, while simple spike firing was more related to individual licks. In addition, complex spikes reported unexpected changes in the position of the water spout and subsequent modulation of simple spike firing caused bending of the tongue, reaching out for the new target position. Using machine learning, we demonstrated that it is possible to predict licking activity based on the spiking patterns of individual Purkinje cells. Using optogenetic stimulation of Purkinje cells, we could experimentally replicate the impact of modulated simple spike firing, suggesting that increased simple spike activity indeed causes ipsilateral bending of the tongue during goal-directed movements. Our data highlight that directional control of movements is paramount in cerebellar function and that complex spike and simple spike modulation complement each other during sensorimotor coordination. These results bring us closer to understanding clinical implications of cerebellar disorders during eating, drinking and swallowing.

">Cross-species evidence for a developmental origin of adult hypersomnia with loss of synaptic adhesion molecules beat-Ia/CADM2</a></h4>

              
                Idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) is a poorly-understood sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness despite normal nighttime sleep. Combining human genomics with behavioral and mechanistic studies in fish and flies, we uncover a role for beat-Ia/CADM2, synaptic adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily, in excessive sleepiness. Neuronal knockdown of Drosophila beat-Ia results in sleepy flies and loss of the vertebrate ortholog of beat-Ia, CADM2, results in sleepy fish. We delineate a developmental function for beat-Ia in synaptic elaboration of neuropeptide F (NPF) neurites projecting to the suboesophageal zone (SEZ) of the fly brain. Brain connectome and experimental evidence demonstrate these NPF outputs synapse onto a subpopulation of SEZ GABAergic neurons to stabilize arousal. NPF is the Drosophila homolog of vertebrate neuropeptide Y (NPY), and an NPY receptor agonist restores sleep to normal levels in zebrafish lacking CADM2. These findings point towards NPY modulation as a treatment target for human hypersomnia.

">Distinct modulation of Ih by synaptic potentiation in excitatory and inhibitory neurons</a></h4>

              
                Selective modifications in the expression or function of dendritic ion channels regulate the propagation of synaptic inputs and determine the intrinsic excitability of a neuron. Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels open upon membrane hyperpolarization and conduct a depolarizing inward current (Ih). HCN channels are enriched in the dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal neurons where they regulate the integration of synaptic inputs. Synaptic plasticity can bidirectionally modify dendritic HCN channels in excitatory neurons depending on the strength of synaptic potentiation. In inhibitory neurons, however, the dendritic expression and modulation of HCN channels is largely unknown. In this study, we systematically compared the modulation of Ih by synaptic potentiation in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons and stratum Radiatum (sRad) interneurons. Ih properties were similar in inhibitory and excitatory neurons and contributed to resting membrane potential and action potential firing. We found that in sRad interneurons, HCN channels were downregulated after synaptic plasticity, irrespective of the strength of synaptic potentiation. This suggest differential regulation of Ih in excitatory and inhibitory neurons, possibly signifying their distinct role in network activity.

">Comparative transcriptomic rhythms in the mouse and human prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Alterations in multiple subregions of the human prefrontal cortex (PFC) have been heavily implicated in psychiatric diseases. Moreover, emerging evidence suggests that circadian rhythms in gene expression are present across the brain, including in the PFC, and that these rhythms are altered in disease. However, investigation into the potential circadian mechanisms underlying these diseases in animal models must contend with the fact that the human PFC is highly evolved and specialized relative to that of rodents. Here, we use RNA sequencing to lay the groundwork for translational studies of molecular rhythms through a sex-specific, cross species comparison of transcriptomic rhythms between the mouse medial PFC (mPFC) and two subregions of the human PFC, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC). We find that while circadian rhythm signaling is conserved across species and subregions, there is a phase shift in the expression of core clock genes between the mouse mPFC and human PFC subregions that differs by sex. Furthermore, we find that the identity of rhythmic transcripts is largely unique between the mouse mPFC and human PFC subregions, with the most overlap (20%, 236 transcripts) between the mouse mPFC and the human ACC in females. Nevertheless, we find that basic biological processes are enriched for rhythmic transcripts across species, with key differences between regions and sexes. Together, this work highlights both the evolutionary conservation of transcriptomic rhythms and the advancement of the human PFC, underscoring the importance of considering cross-species differences when using animal models.

">Brain-derived neurotrophic factor and adenosine A2A receptor interaction modulates oligodendrogenesis derived from postnatal SVZ neural stem cells</a></h4>

              
                Oligodendrocytes (OLs) are vital for myelin formation in the Central Nervous System. OLs can be produced by the maturation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) present throughout the brain parenchyma or from the differentiation of subventricular zone-derived neural stem cells (SVZ-NSCs). Importantly, efficient differentiation from SVZ-NSCs remains a significant area of research due to its potential for remyelination in demyelinating disorders. In this work, we studied the role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and adenosine A2A receptors (A2ARs), as well as the putative crosstalk between these two modulatory mechanisms, in regulating oligodendrogenesis from SVZ-NSCs. Using a neurosphere culture system, we observed that BDNF significantly increased the mRNA expression levels of OPC cell markers after 2 days in vitro (DIV), an effect blocked by the A2AR antagonist ZM 241385. This early transcriptional regulation by BDNF was followed by changes in the percentage of both OPCs and mature OLs in culture at DIV 7 and 14. Interestingly, blocking A2ARs prevented the potentiating effect of BDNF on the percentage of OLs at DIV 14. Concerning the morphology of mature OLs, BDNF influenced their maturation by reducing branching near the soma at DIV 7, an effect that was not observed at 14 DIV, when all treatments resulted in similar OL morphology. Overall, our results establish BDNF as a regulator of OL formation from SVZ-NSCs, with A2AR-BDNF interaction modulating the differentiation process.

">Properties of rhythmogenic currents in spinal Shox2 interneurons across postnatal development</a></h4>

              
                Locomotor behaviors are performed by organisms throughout life, despite developmental changes in cellular properties, neural connectivity, and biomechanics. The basic rhythmic activity in the central nervous system that underlies locomotion is thought to be generated via a complex balance between network and intrinsic cellular properties. Within mature mammalian spinal locomotor circuitry, we have yet to determine which properties of spinal interneurons (INs) are critical to rhythmogenesis and how they change during development. Here, we combined whole cell patch clamp recordings, immunohistochemistry, and RNAscope targeting lumbar Shox2 INs in mice, which are known to be involved in locomotor rhythm generation. We focused on the properties of putatively rhythmogenic ionic currents and the expression of corresponding ion channels across postnatal time points in mice. We show that subsets of Shox2 INs display voltage-sensitive conductances, in addition to respective ion channels, which may contribute to or shape rhythmic bursting. Persistent inward currents, M-type potassium currents, slow afterhyperpolarization, and T-type calcium currents are enhanced with age. In contrast, the hyperpolarization-activated and A-type potassium currents were either found with low prevalence in subsets of neonatal, juvenile, and adult Shox2 INs or did not developmentally change. We show that Shox2 INs become more electrophysiologically diverse by juvenile and adult ages, when locomotor behavior is weight-bearing. These results suggest a developmental shift in the magnitude of rhythmogenic ionic currents and the expression of corresponding ion channels that may be important for mature, weight-bearing locomotor behavior.

">Assessing neurocognitive maturation in early adolescence based on baby and adult functional brain landscapes</a></h4>

              
                Adolescence is a period of growth in cognitive performance and functioning. Recently, data-driven measures of brain-age gap, which can index cognitive decline in older populations, have been utilized in adolescent data with mixed findings. Instead of using a data-driven approach, here we assess the maturation status of the brain functional landscape in early adolescence by directly comparing an individual's resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) to the canonical early-life and adulthood communities. Specifically, we hypothesized that the degree to which a youth's connectome is better captured by adult networks compared to infant/toddler networks is predictive of their cognitive development. To test this hypothesis across individuals and longitudinally, we utilized the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study at baseline (9-10 years; n = 6,489) and 2-year-follow-up (Y2: 11-12 years; n = 5,089). Adjusted for demographic factors, our anchored rsFC score (AFC) was associated with better task performance both across and within participants. AFC was related to age and aging across youth, and change in AFC statistically mediated the age-related change in task performance. In conclusion, we showed that a model-fitting-free index of the brain at rest that is anchored to both adult and baby connectivity landscapes predicts cognitive performance and development in youth.

">Individual-specific strategies inform category learning</a></h4>

              
                Categorization is an essential task for sensory perception. Individuals learn category labels using a variety of strategies to ensure that sensory signals, such as sounds or images, can be assigned to proper categories. Categories are often learned on the basis of extreme examples, and the boundary between categories can differ among individuals. The trajectories for learning also differ among individuals, as different individuals rely on different strategies, such as repeating or alternating choices. However, little is understood about the relationship between individual learning trajectories and learned categorization. To study this relationship, we trained mice to categorize auditory stimuli into two categories using a two-alternative forced choice task. Because the mice took several weeks to learn the task, we were able to quantify the time course of individual strategies and how they relate to how mice categorize stimuli around the categorization boundary. Different mice exhibited different trajectories in learning the task. Mice displayed preferences for a specific category, manifested by a choice bias in their responses, but this bias drifted with learning. We found that this drift in choice bias correlated with variability in the category boundary for sounds with ambiguous category membership. Next, we asked how stimulus-independent, individual-specific strategies informed learning. We found that the tendency to repeat choices, which is a form of perseveration, contributed to long-term learning. These results indicate that long-term trends in individual strategies during category learning affect learned category boundaries.

">Bridging Glucose Metabolism and Intrinsic Functional Organization of the Human Cortex</a></h4>

              
                The human brain requires a continuous supply of energy to function effectively. Here, we investigated how the low-dimensional organization of intrinsic functional connectivity patterns based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging relates to brain energy expenditure measured by fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. By incrementally adding more dimensions of brain organization (via functional gradients), we were able to show that increasing amounts of variance in the map of brain energy expenditure could be accounted for. In particular, the brain organization dimensions that explained a large amount of the variance in intrinsic brain function also explained a large amount of the regional variance in the energy expenditure maps. This was particularly true for brain organization maps based on the strongest connections, suggesting that "weak" connections may not explain as much energy variance. Notably, our topological model was more effective than random brain organization configurations, suggesting that brain organization may be specifically associated with energy optimization. Finally, using brain asymmetry as a model for metabolic efficiency, we found that optimizing energy expenditure independently in each hemisphere outperformed non-independent optimization. This supports the concept of hemispheric competition rather than lateralization in energy allocation. Our results demonstrate how the spatial organization of functional connections is systematically linked to optimized energy expenditure in the human brain, providing new insights into the metabolic basis of brain function.

">The Neural Underpinnings of Aphantasia: A Case Study of Identical Twins</a></h4>

              
                Aphantasia is a condition characterized by reduced voluntary mental imagery. As this lack of mental imagery disrupts visual memory, understanding the nature of this condition can provide important insight into memory, perception, and imagery. Here, we leveraged the power of case studies to better characterize this condition by running a pair of identical twins, one with aphantasia and one without, through mental imagery tasks in an fMRI scanner. We identified objective, neural measures of aphantasia, finding less visual information in their memories which may be due to lower connectivity between frontoparietal and occipitotemporal lobes of the brain. However, despite this difference, we surprisingly found more visual information in the aphantasic twin's memory than anticipated, suggesting that aphantasia is a spectrum rather than a discrete condition.

                Neuroimaging and cognitive neuroscience studies have identified neural circuits linked to anxiety, mood, and trauma-related symptoms and focused on their interaction with the medial prefrontal default mode circuitry. Despite these advances, developing new neuromodulatory treatments based on neurocircuitry remains challenging. It remains unclear which nodes within and controlling these circuits are affected and how their impairment is connected to psychiatric symptoms. Concurrent single-pulse (sp) TMS/fMRI offers a promising approach to probing and mapping the integrity of these circuits. In this study, we present concurrent sp-TMS/fMRI data along with structural MRI scans from 152 participants, including both healthy and depressed individuals. The sp-TMS was administered to 11 different cortical sites, providing a dataset that allows researchers to investigate how brain circuits are modulated by spTMS.

">Differential participation of the corticospinal and corticorubral neurons during motor execution in the rat</a></h4>

              
                The sensorimotor cortex is crucial for learning and executing new movements with precision (Nudo & Frost, 2007). It selectively modulates sensory information flow and represents motor information in a spatially organized manner (Canedo, 1997; Chen et al., 2017). The pyramidal system is made up layer 5 pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs), which are organized into populations with distinct morphological, genetic and functional properties. These subpopulations project to different subcortical structures in a segregated manner (Nudo & Frost, 2007). To understand whether PTNs projecting to different structures play distinct functional roles in motor control, we characterized two types of layer 5 neurons in the motor cortex: corticorubral (CR) neurons, which project to the red nucleus, and corticospinal (CS) neurons, which project to the spinal cord. To analyze movement performance in rats, we compared the selective optogenetic inhibition of motor cortex CS or CR neurons during lever movement execution in response to a light stimulus. As the animals progressed through the training sessions, the variability of lever trajectories decreased, and the movements became more stereotyped. Photoinhibition of CS or CR neurons increased the performance variability of learned movements but differentially affected kinematic parameters. CR neuron inhibition affected amplitude, duration, reaction times, speed, and acceleration of the movement. In contrast, inhibition of CS neurons mainly altered the duration, speed, and acceleration of the movement. We conclude that CS and CR are complementary pathways for transmitting information rather than copies of the same motor command.

">GPR30 in spinal cholecystokinin-positive neurons modulates neuropathic pain via mediating descending facilitation</a></h4>

              
                Neuropathic pain, a major health problem affecting 7 - 10% of the global population, lacks effective treatment due to its elusive mechanisms. Cholecystokinin-positive (CCK+) neurons in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH) are critical for neuropathic pain, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here we showed that the membrane estrogen receptor G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER/GPR30) in spinal was significantly upregulated in chronic constriction injury (CCI) mice and that inhibition of GPR30 in CCK+ neurons reversed CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Besides, GPR30 in spinal CCK+ neurons was essential for the enhancement of AMPA-mediated excitatory synaptic transmission in CCI mice. Furthermore, GPR30 was expressed in the spinal CCK+ neurons receiving direct projection from the primary sensory cortex (S1-SDH). Chemogenetic inhibition of S1-SDH post-synaptic neurons alleviated CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Conversely, chemogenetic activation of these neurons mimicked neuropathic pain symptoms, which were attenuated by spinal inhibition of GPR30. Finally, we confirmed that GPR30 in S1-SDH post-synaptic neurons is required for CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Taken together, our findings suggest that GPR30 in spinal CCK+ neurons is pivotal for neuropathic pain and mediates descending facilitation by corticospinal direct projections, thereby representing a promising therapeutic target for neuropathic pain.

">Effect of Acute Alcohol Consumption in a Novel Rodent Model of Decision Making</a></h4>

              
                Abstract Background Alcohol use, especially at high consumption levels, can lead to irrational decision-making. In humans, this can lead to harmful outcomes often seen in the context of driving under the influence and or aggressive behavior. To date, the field is lacking comprehensive animal models to examine the impact of alcohol use on decision making in rodents, particularly to examine sex differences in choice behavior. To address this issue, the present study examined the effects of acute alcohol consumption during a behavioral approach-avoidance task that captures momentary changes in decision-making behavior and choice selection in female and male rats. Methods Our team has developed a novel behavioral protocol involving a concurrent choice to consume four different concentrations of alcohol and sucrose combinations. During the task, female or male rats can approach or avoid drinking solutions in four distinct corners of our test apparatus. The solutions were prepared in inverse concentrations (higher sucrose was paired with lower alcohol and vice versa) so that the rodents pursue minimal alcohol use by consuming the higher sucrose concentrations or higher concentrations of alcohol by drinking the lower sucrose concentrations. The animals also have the option to avoid drinking alcohol by not approaching any of the drinking cups. Behavior and choice were tracked during task performance involving different solution concentrations of alcohol and sucrose. Results The choice of consuming different concentrations of alcohol or sucrose resulted in sex-dependent differences in an approach-avoid trade-off pattern of behavior that was sensitive to different concentrations of alcohol/sucrose combinations. Notably, males were greatly affected by the introduction of alcohol into the task environment, approaching higher alcohol concentrations significantly more often than the non-alcohol containing options. In contrast, females choice patterns and task performance were largely unchanged during alcohol and non-alcohol containing tasks. Regardless of sex, we identify a novel method for identifying individual subject decision-making abnormalities during and after alcohol consumption. Conclusions This research reveals a novel approach for examining the effects of acute alcohol exposure during a trade-off task, with decision patterns being more impacted by alcohol use in males as compared to females. We also offer the field a novel approach for identifying individual abnormalities in decision making behavior with the presentation of alcohol. Future research can explore these abnormal patterns in both acute and chronic alcohol conditions to develop methods for identifying subjects at-risk for developing an alcohol use disorder and the deleterious impact of alcohol on rational decision making.

">Spatial transcriptomics reveals modulation of transcriptional networks across brain regions after auditory threat conditioning</a></h4>

              
                Prior research has demonstrated genome-wide transcriptional changes related to fear and anxiety across species, often focusing on individual brain regions or cell types. However, the extent of gene expression differences across brain regions and how these changes interact at the level of transcriptional connectivity remains unclear. To address this, we performed spatial transcriptomics RNAseq analyses in an auditory threat conditioning paradigm in mice. We generated a spatial transcriptomic atlas of a coronal mouse brain section covering cortical and subcortical regions, corresponding to histologically defined regions. Our finding revealed widespread transcriptional responses across all brain regions examined, particularly in the medial and lateral habenula, and the choroid plexus. Network analyses highlighted altered transcriptional connectivity between cortical and subcortical regions, emphasizing the role of steroidogenic factor 1. These results provide new insights into the transcriptional networks involved in auditory threat conditioning, enhancing our understanding of molecular and neural mechanisms underlying fear and anxiety disorders.

">Multi-omics identification of extracellular components of the fetal monkey and human neocortex.</a></h4>

              
                During development, precursor cells are continuously and intimately interacting with their extracellular environment, which guides their ability to generate functional tissues and organs. Much is known about the development of the neocortex in mammals. This information has largely been derived from histological analyses, heterochronic cell transplants, and genetic manipulations in mice, and to a lesser extent from transcriptomic and histological analyses in humans. However, these approaches have not led to a characterization of the extracellular composition of the developing neocortex in any species. Here, using a combination of single-cell transcriptomic analyses from published datasets, and our proteomics and immunohistofluorescence analyses, we provide a more comprehensive and unbiased picture of the early developing fetal neocortex in humans and non-human primates. Our findings provide a starting point for further hypothesis-driven studies on structural and signaling components in the developing cortex that had previously not been identified.

">An in vivo and in vitro spatiotemporal atlas of human midbrain development</a></h4>

              
                The dopaminergic system has key roles in human physiology and is implicated in a broad range of neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions that are increasingly investigated using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived midbrain models. To determine the similarity of such models to human systems, we undertook single cell and spatial profiling of first and second trimester fetal midbrain and compared it to in vitro midbrain models. Our initial histological analysis of second trimester fetal midbrain revealed structural complexity already similar to that of adult tissue, although this similarity did not fully extend to transcriptional activity. Moreover, we show that in vitro models recapitulate the transcriptional activity of late first trimester fetal midbrain, while 3D models replicate the spatial organization and cellular microenvironments of first and second trimester fetal midbrain. Understanding the extent of human tissue recapitulation in midbrain laboratory models is essential to justify their use as biological proxies.

">The capacity of the medial temporal lobe to represent memory items in their ordinal position in a sequence is domain-general</a></h4>

              
                Memory systems in humans are less segregated than initially thought as learning tasks from different memory domains (e.g., declarative vs. procedural) can recruit similar brain areas. However, it remains unclear whether the functional role of these overlapping brain regions and the hippocampus in particular is domain-general. Here, we test the hypothesis that the hippocampus encodes and preserves the temporal order of sequential information irrespective of the nature of that information. We used multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA) of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired in young healthy individuals during the execution of learned sequences of movements and objects to test whether the hippocampus represents information about the temporal order of items in a learned sequence irrespective of their nature. We also examined such coding in brain regions involved in both motor (primary and premotor cortices) and object (perirhinal cortex and parahippocampus) sequence learning. Our results suggest that hippocampal and perirhinal multivoxel activation patterns do not carry information about specific items or temporal position in a random series of objects or movements. Rather, these regions code for the representation of items in their learned temporal position in sequences irrespective of their nature (i.e., item-position coding). In contrast, although all other ROIs showed evidence of item-position coding, this representation could at least partially be attributed to the coding of other information such as position information. Altogether, our findings indicate that the capacity of regions in the medial temporal lobe to represent the temporal order of sequential information is domain-general. Our data suggest that these regions contribute to the development of item-position maps that might provide a cognitive framework to order sequential behaviors irrespective of their nature.

">Oxytocin receptor controls distinct components of pair bonding and development in prairie voles</a></h4>

              
                Oxytocin receptor (Oxtr) signaling influences complex social behaviors in diverse species, including social monogamy in prairie voles. How Oxtr regulates specific components of social attachment behaviors and the neural mechanisms mediating them remains unknown. Here, we examine prairie voles lacking Oxtr and demonstrate that pair bonding comprises distinct behavioral modules: the preference for a bonded partner, and the rejection of novel potential mates. Our longitudinal study of social attachment shows that Oxtr sex-specifically influences early interactions between novel partners facilitating the formation of partner preference. Additionally, Oxtr suppresses promiscuity towards novel potential mates following pair bonding, contributing to rejection. Oxtr function regulates coordinated patterns of gene expression in regions implicated in attachment behaviors and regulates the expression of oxytocin in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, a principal source of oxytocin. Thus, Oxtr controls genetically separable components of pair bonding behaviors and coordinates development of the neural substrates of attachment.

">The effects of P2Y12 loss on microglial gene expression, dynamics, and injury response in the cerebellum and cerebral cortex.</a></h4>

              
                Despite the emerging consensus that microglia are critical to physiological and pathological brain function, it is unclear how microglial roles and their underlying mechanisms differ between brain regions. Microglia throughout the brain express common markers, such as the purinergic receptor P2Y12, that delineate them from peripheral macrophages. P2Y12 is a critical sensor of injury but also contributes to the sensing of neuronal activity and remodeling of synapses, with microglial loss of P2Y12 resulting in behavioral deficits. P2Y12 has largely been studied in cortical microglia, despite the fact that a growing body of evidence suggests that microglia exhibit a high degree of regional specialization. Cerebellar microglia, in particular, exhibit transcriptional, epigenetic, and functional profiles that set them apart from their better studied cortical and hippocampal counterparts. Here, we demonstrate that P2Y12 deficiency does not alter the morphology, distribution, or dynamics of microglia in the cerebellum. In fact, loss of P2Y12 does little to disturb the distinct transcriptomic profiles of cortical and cerebellar microglia. However, unlike in cortex, P2Y12 is not required for a full microglial response to focal injury, suggesting that cerebellar and cortical microglia use different cues to respond to injury. Finally, we show that P2Y12 deficiency impairs cerebellar learning in a delay eyeblink conditioning task, a common test of cerebellar plasticity and circuit function. Our findings suggest not only region-specific roles of microglial P2Y12 signaling in the focal injury response, but also indicate a conserved role for P2Y12 in microglial modulation of plasticity across regions.

	<p>Background/Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the acute effects of a single session of a VR exergame (Beat Saber) and a VR nature video (Ireland 4K) on attentional performance, using the Flanker and Attentional Blink (AB) tasks. The objective was to assess whether these VR interventions could enhance attentional control, as measured by improvements in response times and accuracy. Methods: A total of 39 psychology students, aged 19&amp;amp;ndash;25, were randomly assigned to one of three groups: VR exergame, VR nature video, or control. Participants completed the Flanker and AB tasks before and after the intervention. A repeated measures design was employed to analyze changes in response times and accuracy across pre- and post-test sessions. Results: The study revealed significant improvements in response times and accuracy across all groups in the post-test measures, indicating a strong training effect. In the AB task, shorter stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) led to decreased accuracy and slower response times, emphasizing the difficulty in processing closely spaced targets. The interaction between Type and Group in response times for target stimuli suggested that the intervention types differentially influenced processing speed in specific conditions. Conclusions: The findings suggest that while brief VR interventions did not produce significant differences between groups, the training effect observed highlights the influence of task-specific factors such as SOA and target presence. Further research is needed to explore whether longer or repeated VR sessions, as well as the optimization of task-specific parameters, might lead to more pronounced cognitive benefits.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Increasing evidence shows an involvement of brain plasticity mechanisms in both motor and central manifestations of neuromuscular disorders (NMDs). These mechanisms could be specifically addressed with neuromodulation or rehabilitation protocols. The aim of this scoping review is to summarise the evidence on plasticity mechanisms&amp;amp;rsquo; involvement in NMDs to encourage future research. Methods: A scoping review was conducted searching the PubMed and Scopus electronic databases. We selected papers addressing brain plasticity and central nervous system (CNS) studies through non-invasive brain stimulation techniques in myopathies, muscular dystrophies, myositis and spinal muscular atrophy. Results: A total of 49 papers were selected for full-text examination. Regardless of the variety of pathogenetic and clinical characteristics of NMDs, studies show widespread changes in intracortical inhibition mechanisms, as well as disruptions in glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission, resulting in altered brain plasticity. Therapeutic interventions with neurostimulation techniques, despite being conducted only anecdotally or on small samples, show promising results; Conclusions: despite challenges posed by the rarity and heterogeneity of NMDs, recent evidence suggests that synaptic plasticity may play a role in the pathogenesis of various muscular diseases, affecting not only central symptoms but also strength and fatigue. Key questions remain unanswered about the role of plasticity and its potential as a therapeutic target. As disease-modifying therapies advance, understanding CNS involvement in NMDs could lead to more tailored treatments.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: This study investigates the relationship between movement-related beta synchrony and primary motor cortex (M1) excitability, focusing on the time-dependent inhibition of movement. Voluntary movement induces beta frequency (13&amp;amp;ndash;30 Hz) event-related desynchronisation (B-ERD) in M1, followed by post-movement beta rebound (PMBR). Although PMBR is linked to cortical inhibition, its temporal relationship with motor cortical excitability is unclear. This study aims to determine whether PMBR acts as a marker for post-movement inhibition by assessing motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) during distinct phases of the beta synchrony profile. Methods: Twenty-five right-handed participants (mean age: 24 years) were recruited. EMG data were recorded from the first dorsal interosseous muscle, and TMS was applied to the M1 motor hotspot to evoke MEPs. A reaction time task was used to elicit beta oscillations, with TMS delivered at participant-specific time points based on EEG-derived beta power envelopes. MEP amplitudes were compared across four phases: B-ERD, early PMBR, peak PMBR, and late PMBR. Results: Our findings demonstrate that MEP amplitude significantly increased during B-ERD compared to rest, indicating heightened cortical excitability. In contrast, MEPs recorded during peak PMBR were significantly reduced, suggesting cortical inhibition. While all three PMBR phases exhibited reduced cortical excitability, a trend toward amplitude-dependent inhibition was observed. Conclusions: This study confirms that PMBR is linked to reduced cortical excitability, validating its role as a marker of motor cortical inhibition. These results enhance the understanding of beta oscillations in motor control and suggest that further research on altered PMBR could be crucial for understanding neurological and psychiatric disorders.</p>

	<p>Objective: We investigated the effect of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) on intracranial aneurysms (IAs) by analyzing single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) based on genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. HMGB1 mRNA and protein expression levels in plasma were also analyzed. Methods: This study was a comprehensive analysis of a GWAS dataset, including 250 patients with IAs and 294 controls. The HMGB1 gene region was targeted within SNP rs3742305 &amp;amp;plusmn; 10 kbp. Multivariate logistic regression analysis determined its association with IAs after adjusting for relevant clinical factors. HMGB1 mRNA expression was analyzed in the plasma of 24 patients selected from the GWAS dataset. The HMGB1 protein was analyzed by Western blotting. Results: A total of seven polymorphisms, including rs1360485, rs185382445, rs2039338, rs1045411, rs3742305, rs2249825, and rs189034241, were observed. Two SNPs, including rs1045411 (UTR-3) and rs3742305 (intron), showed strong linkage disequilibrium (r2 = 0.99). However, none of the seven SNPs associated with IAs had an adjusted p-value of &amp;amp;lt; 0.0016 on multiple comparison analysis. HMGB1 mRNA levels (2&amp;amp;minus;&amp;amp;Delta;Ct) did not differ significantly between patients with IAs and the control subjects [1.07 (1.00&amp;amp;ndash;1.15) in patients with IAs vs. 1.05 (0.94&amp;amp;ndash;1.12) in controls; p = 0.67)]. Also, no significant difference in the degree of plasma HMGB1 protein expression was seen between the two groups (p = 0.82). Conclusions: The number of SNPs associated with HMGB1 and the degree of HMGB1 mRNA and protein expression were not significantly different between patients diagnosed with IAs and the controls.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Detailed morphometric analysis of an aneurysm and the related vascular bifurcation are critical factors when determining rupture risk and planning treatment for unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs). The standard visualization of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and its 3D reconstruction on a 2D monitor provide precise measurements but are subject to variability based on the rater. Visualization using virtual (VR) and augmented reality platforms can overcome those limitations. It is, however, unclear whether accurate measurements of the aneurysm and adjacent arterial branches can be obtained on VR models. This study aimed to assess interrater reliability and compare measurements between 3D VR, standard 2D DSA, and 3D DSA reconstructions, evaluating the reliability and accuracy of 3D VR as a measurement tool. Methods: A pool of five neurosurgeons performed three individual analyses on each of the ten UIA cases, measuring them in completely immersed 3D VR and the standard on-screen format (2D DSA and 3D reconstruction). This resulted in three independent measurements per modality for each case. Interrater reliability of measurements and morphology characterization, comparative differences, measurement duration, and VR user experience were assessed. Results: Interrater reliability for 3D VR measurements was significantly higher than for 3D DSA measurements (3D VR mean intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]: 0.69 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.22 vs. 3D DSA mean ICC: 0.36 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.37, p = 0.042). No significant difference was observed between 3D VR and 2D DSA (3D VR mean ICC: 0.69 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.22 vs. 2D DSA mean ICC: 0.43 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.31, p = 0.12). A linear mixed-effects model showed no effect of 3D VR and 3D DSA (95% CI = &amp;amp;minus;0.26&amp;amp;ndash;0.28, p = 0.96) or 3D VR and 2D DSA (95% CI = &amp;amp;minus;0.02&amp;amp;ndash;0.53, p = 0.066) on absolute measurements of the aneurysm in the anteroposterior, mediolateral, and craniocaudal dimensions. Conclusions: 3D VR technology allows for reproducible, accurate, and reliable measurements comparable to measurements performed on a 2D screen. It may also potentially improve precision for measurements of non-planar aneurysm dimensions.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Headaches in Moyamoya angiopathy are common but poorly understood. We aimed to investigate if headaches in Moyamoya angiopathy improve after revascularization surgery and whether this is associated with improvement in cerebrovascular reactivity on MRI (CVR-MRI). Methods: We included consecutive adult patients with Moyamoya angiopathy who had chart data on headaches, CVR-MRI, and underwent extracranial&amp;amp;ndash;intracranial bypass surgery between January 2010 and September 2022 at a tertiary neurovascular referral center. Clinical and CVR-MR imaging data of all patients were collected through systematic chart review, complemented by standard-of-care headache questionnaires from patients who were operated between 2018 and 2022. We evaluated headache features and explored the association between headaches and CVR before and after revascularization surgery. Results: Fifty-nine patients were included (mean age 47 &amp;amp;plusmn; 14 years, 43 females (73%)); among them, 41/59 (69%) reported headaches pre-surgery. Headache improved in 28/41 (68%) patients after revascularization surgery with a reduction in pain severity (median VAS-score from 5/10 to 2.5/10; p = 0.002), analgesic use (from 84% to 40%; p = 0.007), and sick leave (from 60% to 16%; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Improvement in headaches was associated with improvement in CVR (OR 5.3; 95% CI: 1.2&amp;amp;ndash;23.5) and sick leave reduction (OR 1.4; 95% CI: 1.6&amp;amp;ndash;121.4). Conclusions: Headaches in Moyamoya angiopathy are common and disabling. They may improve in most patients after revascularization surgery and seem to be associated with improvement in CVR, supporting the hypothesis of a potential vascular origin of the headaches.</p>

	<p>Background: Recent evidence in systems neuroscience suggests that lighting conditions affect the whole chain of brain processing, from retina to high-level cortical networks, for perceptual and cognitive function. Here, visual adaptation levels to three different environmental lighting conditions, (1) darkness, (2) daylight, and (3) prolonged exposure to very bright light akin to sunlight, were simulated in lab to investigate the effects of light adaptation levels on classic cases of subjective contrast, assimilation, and contrast-induced relative depth in achromatic, i.e., ON&amp;amp;ndash;OFF pathway mediated visual configurations. Methods: After adaptation/exposure to a given lighting condition, configurations were shown in grouped and ungrouped conditions in random order to healthy young humans in computer-controlled two-alternative forced-choice procedures that consisted of deciding, as quickly as possible, which of two background patterns in a given configuration of achromatic contrast appeared lighter, or which of two foreground patterns appeared to stand out in front, as if it were nearer to the observer. Results: We found a statistically significant effect of the adaptation levels on the consciously perceived subjective contrast (F(2,23) = 20.73; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and the relative depth (F(2,23) = 12.67; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), a statistically significant interaction between the adaptation levels and the grouping factor (F(2,23) = 4.73; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) on subjective contrast, and a statistically significant effect of the grouping factor on the relative depth (F(2,23) = 13.71; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Conclusions: Visual adaption to different lighting conditions significantly alters the conscious perception of contrast and assimilation, classically linked to non-linear functional synergies between ON and OFF processing channels in the visual brain, and modulates the repeatedly demonstrated effectiveness of luminance contrast as a depth cue; the physically brighter pattern regions in the configurations are no longer consistently perceived as nearer to a conscious observer under daylight and extreme bright light adapted (rod-saturated) conditions.</p>

                <p>Conscious reportability of visual input is associated with a bimodal neural response in the primary visual cortex (V1): an early-latency response coupled to stimulus features and a late-latency response coupled to stimulus report or detection. This late wave of activity, central to major theories of consciousness, is thought to be driven by the prefrontal cortex (PFC), responsible for "igniting" it. Here we analyzed two electrophysiological studies in mice performing different stimulus detection tasks and characterized neural activity profiles in three key cortical regions: V1, posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and PFC. We then developed a minimal network model, constrained by known connectivity between these regions, reproducing the spatiotemporal propagation of visual- and report-related activity. Remarkably, while PFC was indeed necessary to generate report-related activity in V1, this occurred only through the mediation of PPC. PPC, and not PFC, had the final veto in enabling the report-related late wave of V1 activity.</p>

                <p>Recording and analysis of neural activity are often biased toward detecting sparse subsets of highly active neurons, masking important signals carried in low-magnitude and variable responses. To investigate the contribution of seemingly noisy activity to odor encoding, we used mesoscale calcium imaging from mice of both sexes to record odor responses from the dorsal surface of bilateral olfactory bulbs (OBs). The outer layer of the mouse OB is comprised of dendrites organized into discrete "glomeruli," which are defined by odor receptor-specific sensory neuron input. We extracted activity from a large population of glomeruli and used logistic regression to classify odors from individual trials with high accuracy. We then used add-in and dropout analyses to determine subsets of glomeruli necessary and sufficient for odor classification. Classifiers successfully predicted odor identity even after excluding sparse, highly active glomeruli, indicating that odor information is redundantly represented across a large population of glomeruli. Additionally, we found that random forest (RF) feature selection informed by Gini inequality (RF Gini impurity, RFGI) reliably ranked glomeruli by their contribution to overall odor classification. RFGI provided a measure of "feature importance" for each glomerulus that correlated with intuitive features like response magnitude. Finally, in agreement with previous work, we found that odor information persists in glomerular activity after the odor offset. Together, our findings support a model of OB odor coding where sparse activity is sufficient for odor identification, but information is widely, redundantly available across a large population of glomeruli, with each glomerulus representing information about more than one odor.</p>

                <p>Oligodendrocyte myelination and remyelination after injury are intricately regulated by various intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including transcriptional regulators. Among these, the zinc-finger protein ZFP488 is an oligodendrocyte-enriched transcriptional regulator that promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation in the developing neural tube and in oligodendroglial cell lines. However, the specific in vivo genetic requirements for ZFP488 during oligodendrocyte development and remyelination have not been defined. To address this gap, we generated a lineage-traceable <I>ZFP488</I> knock-out mouse line, wherein an <I>H2b-GFP</I> reporter replaces the <I>ZFP488</I>-coding region. Using these mice of either sex, we examined the dynamics of <I>ZFP488</I> expression from the endogenous promoter in the developing central nervous system (CNS). We observed a unique expression pattern in the oligodendrocyte lineage, with <I>ZFP488</I> expression particularly enriched in differentiated oligodendrocytes. ZFP488 loss resulted in delayed myelination in the developing CNS and impaired remyelination after demyelinating injury in the brain. Integrated transcriptomic and genomic profiling further revealed that ZFP488 loss decreased the expression of myelination-associated genes but not oligodendrocyte progenitor&ndash;associated genes, suggesting that ZFP488 serves as a positive regulator of myelination by regulating maturation programs. Thus, our genetic loss-of-function study revealed that ZFP488 regulates a stage-dependent differentiation program that controls the timing of CNS myelination and remyelination.</p>

                <p>Nerve injury can induce aberrant changes in the spine; these changes are due to, or at least partly governed by, transcription factors that contribute to the genesis of neuropathic allodynia. Here, we showed that spinal nerve ligation (SNL, a clinical neuropathic allodynia model) increased the expression of the transcription factor Tbx5 in the injured dorsal horn in male Sprague Dawley rats. In contrast, blocking this upregulation alleviated SNL-induced mechanical allodynia, and there was no apparent effect on locomotor function. Moreover, SNL-induced Tbx5 upregulation promoted the recruitment and interaction of GATA4 and Brd4 by enhancing its binding activity to H3K9Ac, which was enriched at the <I>Trpv1</I> promotor, leading to an increase in TRPV1 transcription and the development of neuropathic allodynia. In addition, nerve injury-induced expression of Fbxo3, which abates Fbxl2-dependent Tbx5 ubiquitination, promoted the subsequent Tbx5-dependent epigenetic modification of TRPV1 expression during SNL-induced neuropathic allodynia. Collectively, our findings indicated that spinal Tbx5-dependent TRPV1 transcription signaling contributes to the development of neuropathic allodynia via Fbxo3-dependent Fbxl2 ubiquitination and degradation. Thus, we propose a potential medical treatment strategy for neuropathic allodynia by targeting Tbx5.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/39/e0542242024?rss=1">A Multidimensional Neural Representation of Face Impressions</a></h4>

              
                <p>From a glimpse of a face, people form trait impressions that operate as facial stereotypes, which are largely inaccurate yet nevertheless drive social behavior. Behavioral studies have long pointed to dimensions of trustworthiness and dominance that are thought to underlie face impressions due to their evolutionarily adaptive nature. Using human neuroimaging (<I>N </I>= 26, 19 female, 7 male), we identify a two-dimensional representation of faces&rsquo; inferred traits in the middle temporal gyrus (MTG), a region involved in domain-general conceptual processing including the activation of social concepts. The similarity of neural-response patterns for any given pair of faces in the bilateral MTG was predicted by their proximity in trustworthiness&ndash;dominance space, an effect that could not be explained by mere visual similarity. This MTG trait-space representation occurred automatically, was relatively invariant across participants, and did not depend on the explicit endorsement of face impressions (i.e., beliefs that face impressions are valid and accurate). In contrast, regions involved in high-level social reasoning (the bilateral temporoparietal junction and posterior superior temporal sulcus; TPJ&ndash;pSTS) and entity-specific social knowledge (the left anterior temporal lobe; ATL) also exhibited this trait-space representation but only among participants who explicitly endorsed forming these impressions. Together, the findings identify a two-dimensional neural representation of face impressions and suggest that multiple implicit and explicit mechanisms give rise to biases based on facial appearance. While the MTG implicitly represents a multidimensional trait space for faces, the TPJ&ndash;pSTS and ATL are involved in the explicit application of this trait space for social evaluation and behavior.</p>

                <p>Dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) respond to motivationally relevant cues, and circuit-specific signaling drives different aspects of motivated behavior. Orexin (ox; also known as hypocretin) and dynorphin (dyn) are coexpressed lateral hypothalamic (LH) neuropeptides that project to the VTA. These peptides have opposing effects on the firing activity of VTA<sup>DA</sup> neurons via orexin 1 (Ox1R) or kappa opioid (KOR) receptors. Given that Ox1R activation increases VTA<sup>DA</sup> firing, and KOR decreases firing, it is unclear how the coreleased peptides contribute to the net activity of DA neurons. We tested if optical stimulation of LH<SUB>ox/dyn</SUB> neuromodulates VTA<sup>DA</sup> neuronal activity via peptide release and if the effects of optically driven LH<SUB>ox/dyn</SUB> release segregate based on VTA<sup>DA</sup> projection targets including the basolateral amygdala (BLA) or the lateral or medial shell of the nucleus accumbens (lAcbSh, mAchSh). Using a combination of circuit tracing, optogenetics, and patch-clamp electrophysiology in male and female orexin<sup>cre</sup> mice, we showed a diverse response of LH<SUB>ox/dyn</SUB> optical stimulation on VTA<sup>DA</sup> neuronal firing, which is not mediated by fast transmitter release and is blocked by antagonists to KOR and Ox1R signaling. Additionally, where optical stimulation of LH<SUB>ox/dyn</SUB> inputs in the VTA inhibited firing of the majority of BLA-projecting VTA<sup>DA</sup> neurons, optical stimulation of LH<SUB>ox/dyn</SUB> inputs in the VTA bidirectionally affects firing of either lAcbSh- or mAchSh-projecting VTA<sup>DA</sup> neurons. These findings indicate that LH<SUB>ox/dyn</SUB> corelease may influence the output of the VTA by balancing ensembles of neurons within each population which contribute to different aspects of reward seeking.</p>

                <p>Growth-associated protein of 43&nbsp;kDa (GAP43) is a key cytoskeleton-associated component of the presynaptic terminal that facilitates neuroplasticity. Downregulation of GAP43 expression has been associated to various psychiatric conditions in humans and evokes hippocampus-dependent memory impairments in mice. Despite the extensive studies conducted on hippocampal GAP43 in past decades, however, very little is known about its roles in modulating the excitatory versus inhibitory balance in other brain regions. We recently generated conditional knock-out mice in which the <I>Gap43</I> gene was selectively inactivated in either telencephalic glutamatergic neurons (<I>Gap43<sup>fl/fl</sup></I>;<I>Nex1<sup>Cre</sup></I> mice, hereafter Glu-GAP43<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice) or forebrain GABAergic neurons (<I>Gap43<sup>fl/fl</sup></I>;<I>Dlx5/6<sup>Cre</sup></I> mice, hereafter GABA-GAP43<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice). Here, we show that Glu-GAP43<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> but not GABA-GAP43<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice of either sex show a striking hyperactive phenotype when exposed to a novel environment. This behavioral alteration of Glu-GAP43<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice was linked to a selective activation of dorsal-striatum neurons, as well as to an enhanced corticostriatal glutamatergic transmission and an abrogation of corticostriatal endocannabinoid-mediated long-term depression. In line with these observations, GAP43 was abundantly expressed in corticostriatal glutamatergic terminals of wild-type mice. The novelty-induced hyperactive phenotype of Glu-GAP43<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice was abrogated by chemogenetically inhibiting corticostriatal afferences with a G<SUB>i</SUB>-coupled "designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs" (DREADDs), thus further supporting that novelty-induced activity is controlled by GAP43 at corticostriatal excitatory projections. Taken together, these findings show an unprecedented regulatory role of GAP43 in the corticostriatal circuitry and provide a new mouse model with a delimited neuronal-circuit alteration for studying novelty-induced hyperactivity, a phenotypic shortfall that occurs in diverse psychiatric diseases.</p>

                <p>Understanding how spontaneous brain activity influences the response to neurostimulation is crucial for the development of neurotherapeutics and brain&ndash;computer interfaces. Localized brain activity is suggested to influence the response to neurostimulation, but whether fast-fluctuating (i.e., tens of milliseconds) large-scale brain dynamics also have any such influence is unknown. By stimulating the prefrontal cortex using combined transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography, we examined how dynamic global brain state patterns, as defined by microstates, influence the magnitude of the evoked brain response. TMS applied during what resembled the canonical Microstate C was found to induce a greater evoked response for up to 80&nbsp;ms compared with other microstates. This effect was found in a repeated experimental session, was absent during sham stimulation, and was replicated in an independent dataset. Ultimately, ongoing and fast-fluctuating global brain states, as probed by microstates, may be associated with intrinsic fluctuations in connectivity and excitation&ndash;inhibition balance and influence the neurostimulation outcome. We suggest that the fast-fluctuating global brain states be considered when developing any related paradigms.</p>

                <p>Circadian rhythms in conditioned threat extinction emerge from a tissue-level circadian timekeeper, or local clock, in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Yet it remains unclear how this local clock contributes to extinction-dependent adaptations. Here we used single-unit and local field potential analyses to interrogate neural activity in the male rat vmPFC during repeated extinction sessions at different times of day. In association with superior recall of a remote extinction memory during the circadian active phase, vmPFC putative principal neurons exhibited phasic firing that was amplified for cue presentations and diminished at transitions in freezing behavior. Coupling of vmPFC gamma amplitude to the phase of low-frequency oscillations was greater during freezing than mobility, and this difference was augmented during the active phase, highlighting a time-of-day dependence in the organization of freezing- versus mobility-associated cell assemblies. Additionally, a greater proportion of vmPFC neurons were phase-locked to low-frequency oscillations during the active phase, consistent with heightened neural excitability at this time of day. Our results suggest that daily fluctuations in vmPFC excitability precipitate enhanced neural recruitment into extinction-based cell assemblies during the active phase, providing a potential mechanism by which the vmPFC local clock modulates circuit and behavioral plasticity during conditioned threat extinction.</p>

                <p>Communication in the form of nonverbal, social vocalization, or crying is evolutionary conserved in mammals and is impaired early in human infants that are later diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Defects in infant vocalization have been proposed as an early sign of ASD that may exacerbate ASD development. However, the neural mechanisms associated with early communicative deficits in ASD are not known. Here, we expressed a constitutively active mutant of Rheb (Rheb<sup>S16H</sup>), which is known to upregulate two ASD core pathways, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and ERK1/2, in Layer (L) 2/3 pyramidal neurons of the neocortex of mice of either sex. We found that cellular mosaic expression of Rheb<sup>S16H</sup> in L2/3 pyramidal neurons altered the production of isolation calls from neonatal mice. This was accompanied by an expected misplacement of neurons and dendrite overgrowth, along with an unexpected increase in spine density and length, which was associated with increased excitatory synaptic activity. This contrasted with the known decrease in spine density in Rheb<sup>S16H</sup> neurons of 1-month-old mice. Reducing the levels of the actin cross-linking and adaptor protein filamin A (FLNA), known to be increased downstream of ERK1/2, attenuated dendrite overgrowth and fully restored spine properties, synaptic connectivity, and the production of pup isolation calls. These findings suggest that upper-layer cortical pyramidal neurons contribute to communicative deficits in a condition known to affect two core ASD pathways and that these mechanisms are regulated by FLNA.</p>

                <p>The lateral habenula (LHb) has emerged as a pivotal brain region implicated in depression, displaying hyperactivity in human and animal models of depression. While the role of LHb efferents in depressive disorders has been acknowledged, the specific synaptic alterations remain elusive. Here, employing optogenetics, retrograde tracing, and ex vivo whole-cell patch-clamp techniques, we investigated synaptic transmission in male mice subjected to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) at three major LHb neuronal outputs: the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), the ventral tegmental area (VTA), and the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg). Our findings uncovered distinct synaptic adaptations in LHb efferent circuits in response to CSDS. Specifically, CSDS induced in susceptible mice postsynaptic potentiation and postsynaptic depression at the DRN and VTA neurons, respectively, receiving excitatory inputs from the LHb, while CSDS altered presynaptic transmission at the LHb terminals in RMTg in both susceptible and resilient mice. Moreover, whole-cell recordings at projection-defined LHb neurons indicate decreased spontaneous activity in VTA-projecting LHb neurons, accompanied by an imbalance in excitatory&ndash;inhibitory inputs at the RMTg-projecting LHb neurons. Collectively, these novel findings underscore the circuit-specific alterations in LHb efferents following chronic social stress, shedding light on potential synaptic adaptations underlying stress-induced depressive-like states.</p>

                Background Digital servitization is a strategic transformation where companies adopt a service-focused approach in response to the prevailing trend of digitalization. Utilizing digital technology, businesses manage product and service operations and develop new value propositions. Further research into digital servitization is essential for maintaining competitiveness and meeting evolving market demands globally. This study aims to comprehend the evolution of digital services from theoretical and practical viewpoints and examines how these challenges are tackled. Methods Utilizing a systematic literature review methodology, the study adopts the PRISMA approach to identify 26 pertinent articles from a pool of 340 papers obtained through a SCOPUS database search. These papers were published between 2019 and 2024 and were retrieved using the keywords (‘digitalization OR digital AND servitization OR servitization’). The selection process involved scrutinizing titles, abstracts, and keywords based on predefined criteria. Results The findings reveal that current digital servitization research emphasizes five determinant variables: digitization, servitization, manufacturing servitization, process innovation, and product innovation. Additionally, response variables influenced by digital servitization were identified, including firm competitiveness, firm performance, financial performance, firm profitability, and sustainable performance. Discussion The results of this review point to inconsistencies, underscoring the necessity for additional research into the factors influencing digital servitization across companies beyond the manufacturing sector. This highlights the importance of gaining a deeper understanding of digital servitization strategies and their impacts across various industries. By expanding the scope of research to include a broader range of sectors, researchers can provide more comprehensive insights into the complexities and nuances of digital servitization adoption. This broader perspective enables a more thorough examination of the challenges and opportunities associated with implementing digital servitization strategies, ultimately contributing to a richer understanding of its implications for businesses across diverse industries.

                <p>by Adrielli Tina Lopes Rego, Joshua Snell, Martijn Meeter</p>

Although word predictability is commonly considered an important factor in reading, sophisticated accounts of predictability in theories of reading are lacking. Computational models of reading traditionally use cloze norming as a proxy of word predictability, but what cloze norms precisely capture remains unclear. This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can fill this gap. Contextual predictions are implemented via a novel parallel-graded mechanism, where all predicted words at a given position are pre-activated as a function of contextual certainty, which varies dynamically as text processing unfolds. Through reading simulations with OB1-reader, a cognitive model of word recognition and eye-movement control in reading, we compare the model’s fit to eye-movement data when using predictability values derived from a cloze task against those derived from LLMs (GPT-2 and LLaMA). Root Mean Square Error between simulated and human eye movements indicates that LLM predictability provides a better fit than cloze. This is the first study to use LLMs to augment a cognitive model of reading with higher-order language processing while proposing a mechanism on the interplay between word predictability and eye movements.

The role of dopamine in reward expectancy has led to the hypothesis that it is crucial for forming treatment expectations and placebo effects. However, a new study in PLOS Biology presents robust evidence against the causal role of dopamine in these processes.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27081?af=R">Interferon Stimulated Gene Expression Is a Biomarker for Primary Mitochondrial Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Mitochondria are implicated in regulation of the innate immune response. We hypothesized that abnormalities in interferon signaling may contribute to pathophysiology in patients with primary mitochondrial disease (PMD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in whole blood samples from a cohort of patients with PMD.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Upregulated ISG expression was observed in a high proportion (41/55, 75%) of patients with PMD on at least 1 occasion, most frequently <i>IFI27</i> upregulation, seen in 50% of the samples. Some patients had extremely high <i>IFI27</i> levels, similar to those seen in patients with primary interferonopathies. A statistically significant correlation was observed between elevated <i>IFI27</i> gene expression and PMD, but not between <i>IFI27</i> and secondary mitochondrial dysfunction, suggesting that ISG upregulation is a biomarker of PMD. In some patients with PMD, ISG abnormalities persisted on repeat measurement over several years, indicative of ongoing chronic inflammation. Subgroup analyses suggested common ISG signatures in patients with similar mitochondrial disease mechanisms and positive correlations with disease severity among patients with identical genetic diagnoses.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Dysregulated interferon signaling is frequently seen in patients with PMD suggesting that interferon dysregulation is a contributor to pathophysiology. This may indicate a role for repurposing of immunomodulatory therapies for the treatment of PMDs by targeting interferon signaling. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <p>Genetic testing of patients with neurodevelopmental disabilities (NDDs) is critical for diagnosis, medical management, and access to precision therapies. Because genetic testing approaches evolve rapidly, professional society practice guidelines serve an essential role in guiding clinical care; however, several challenges exist regarding the creation and equitable implementation of these guidelines. In this scoping review, we assessed the current state of United States professional societies' guidelines pertaining to genetic testing for unexplained global developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and cerebral palsy. We describe several identified shortcomings and argue the need for a unified, frequently updated, and easily-accessible cross-specialty society guideline. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background Expression proteomics involves the global evaluation of protein abundances within a system. In turn, differential expression analysis can be used to investigate changes in protein abundance upon perturbation to such a system. Methods Here, we provide a workflow for the processing, analysis and interpretation of quantitative mass spectrometry-based expression proteomics data. This workflow utilises open-source R software packages from the Bioconductor project and guides users end-to-end and step-by-step through every stage of the analyses. As a use-case we generated expression proteomics data from HEK293 cells with and without a treatment. Of note, the experiment included cellular proteins labelled using tandem mass tag (TMT) technology and secreted proteins quantified using label-free quantitation (LFQ). Results The workflow explains the software infrastructure before focusing on data import, pre-processing and quality control. This is done individually for TMT and LFQ datasets. The application of statistical differential expression analysis is demonstrated, followed by interpretation via gene ontology enrichment analysis. Conclusions A comprehensive workflow for the processing, analysis and interpretation of expression proteomics is presented. The workflow is a valuable resource for the proteomics community and specifically beginners who are at least familiar with R who wish to understand and make data-driven decisions with regards to their analyses.

                Background Bacterial infections continue to pose a global health challenge, driven by antibiotic resistance and septicemia. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic utility of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) in bacterial infections versus non-infectious causes of inflammation. Methods A prospective study included 164 adult patients who were divided into two groups: a group of patients with confirmed bacterial infections and a second group of patients with other diagnoses (inflammatory pathologies, neoplasms, venous thromboembolic diseases, etc.). NLR and PLR values were compared between the bacterial infection group and the non-infectious causes group and the diagnostic performances of NLR and PLR for detecting bacterial infections were evaluated in comparison with other infection markers. Results NLR and PLR were significantly higher in bacterial infections (p < 10^-6), and NLR was correlated positively with inflammation markers. NLR and PLR demonstrated significant potential in diagnosing bacterial infections, with an AUC of 0.72 and 0.60, respectively, using the following cutoff values: 4.3 for NLR and 183 for PLR. Conclusion These findings underscore the importance of NLR and PLR as adjunctive tools for bacterial infection diagnosis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1093/v1?src=rss">The effect of chiropractic spinal manipulation on the H-reflex and muscle strength in children with cerebral palsy: A feasibility study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Children with cerebral palsy (CP) have deficits in various aspects of motor control, including motor neuron excitability, which can affect muscle strength, gait, and ability to perform activities of daily living. Previous research on chiropractic spinal manipulation in healthy adults, athletes, and a brain-injured population has indicated improvements in motor neuron excitability, muscle strength, and various aspects of motor control. Thus, chiropractic spinal manipulation may improve motor control in children with CP. Methods Children with spastic diplegic CP, aged 8-13 years, were recruited for a randomized, controlled feasibility study. Feasibility was assessed in terms of recruitment strategy and rate, data collection procedures, equipment, intervention, and compliance. Results Three children completed the data collection comprising pre- and post-measurements of the H reflex, V-wave, and muscle strength. The recruitment strategy and rate were not feasible. The data collection procedures were appropriate and complied with, except for the V-wave measurements. The H-reflex threshold decreased and s50 and slope increased in the participants who received chiropractic spinal manipulation; the opposite was seen in the control group. The changes in MVC force were inconsistent between subjects. Conclusion This study answered some important feasibility questions regarding conducting a large-scale randomized controlled study with the same design. Some aspects proved feasible, such as H-reflex recordings, and some aspects, such as recruitment methods and V-wave recordings, need to be altered for future research in this area.

                RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) can undergo phase separation and form condensates, processes that, in turn, can be critical for their functionality. In a recent study, Huang, Ellis, and colleagues show that cellular stress can trigger transient alterations in nuclear TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), leading to changes crucial for proper neuronal function. These findings have implications for understanding neurological TDP-43 proteinopathies.

                Recent research by Parks, Schneider, and colleagues demonstrates that brain states during rodent sleep can be predicted from neural activity on millisecond and micrometer scales. These findings contradict the traditional view that defines sleep by brain-wide oscillations. Instead, this work posits that nonoscillatory activity governs different brain states.

In this issue of Neuron, Scheiblich et al. reveal that TNTs selectively mediate the bidirectional transfer of cytoplasmic protein aggregates from neurons to microglia and mitochondria from microglia to neurons, thereby preserving neuronal health.

                Oncolytic herpes virotherapy shows promise for glioma treatment but lacks sufficient oncolytic activity. Chen et al. demonstrate that early HSV-1 infection reduces m6A modification through ICP0-induced degradation of METTL14 in glioma cells, thereby inhibiting ISG15-driven antiviral effects and enhancing HSV-1’s oncolytic activity, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for glioma treatment.

                Kerneur et al. pinpoint BTN2A1 as pivotal for normal and tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) plasticity, highly expressed by TAMs in solid tumors. They develop an anti-BTN2A1 antibody capable of shifting immunosuppressive M2-like macrophages to a pro-inflammatory M1-like state, unveiling essential downstream pathways crucial for such reprogramming.

                Kusuyama et al. define a mechanism for placenta-derived SOD3 to cultivate maternal behavior. Placenta-specific Sod3 knockout dams exhibited impaired maternal behavior and decreased prolactin levels. SOD3 promotes prolactin expression through the activation of an αKG/IDH/TET axis, resulting in epigenetic changes to FGF/FGFR signals in the pituitary tissue of the dam.

                The timely decay of mRNAs is essential for the embryonic development of all metazoans. Vidya et al. detail how two decapping scaffold proteins (EDC-3 and EDC-4) distinctly regulate the localization and interactions of DCAP-2, an enzyme that irreversibly catalyzes mRNA decay, into cytoplasmic condensates throughout C. elegans embryonic development.

                Linthorst et al. show that a GWAS using data from 140,000 Dutch non-invasive prenatal tests (NIPTs) identifies many loci that affect the concentration and fragmentation properties of cell-free DNA in plasma. Among these, the p.Arg206Cys variant in DNASE1L3 accounts for the most variation and poses challenges for cfDNA-based diagnostics, like NIPTs.
