              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">High-intensity interval training remodels the proteome and acetylome of human skeletal muscle</a></h4>

              
                Exercise is an effective strategy in the prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases. Alterations in the skeletal muscle proteome, including post-translational modifications, regulate its metabolic adaptations to exercise. Here, we examined the effect of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on the proteome and acetylome of human skeletal muscle, revealing the response of 3168 proteins and 1263 lysine acetyl-sites on 464 acetylated proteins. We identified global protein adaptations to exercise training involved in metabolism, excitation-contraction coupling, and myofibrillar calcium sensitivity. Furthermore, HIIT increased the acetylation of mitochondrial proteins, particularly those of complex V. We also highlight the regulation of exercise-responsive histone acetyl-sites. These data demonstrate the plasticity of the skeletal muscle proteome and acetylome, providing insight into the regulation of contractile, metabolic and transcriptional processes within skeletal muscle. Herein, we provide a substantial hypothesis-generating resource to stimulate further mechanistic research investigating how exercise improves metabolic health.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Timely coupling of sleep spindles and slow waves is linked to early amyloid-β burden and predicts memory decline</a></h4>

              
                Sleep alteration is a hallmark of ageing and emerges as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). While the fine-tuned coalescence of sleep microstructure elements may influence age-related cognitive trajectories, its association with AD processes is not fully established. Here, we investigated whether the coupling of spindles and slow waves is associated with early amyloid-beta (Aβ) brain burden, a hallmark of AD neuropathology, and cognitive change over 2 years in 100 healthy individuals in late-midlife (50-70y; 68 women). We found that, in contrast to other sleep metrics, earlier occurrence of spindles on slow-depolarisation slow waves is associated with higher medial prefrontal cortex Aβ burden (p=0.014, r²<sub>β*</sub>=0.06), and is predictive of greater longitudinal memory decline in a large subsample (p=0.032, r²<sub>β*</sub>=0.07, N=66). These findings unravel early links between sleep, AD-related processes and cognition and suggest that altered coupling of sleep microstructure elements, key to its mnesic function, contributes to poorer brain and cognitive trajectories in ageing.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">New incidence or recurrence hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in genotype 4 hepatitis C virus treated with sofosbuvir/daclatasvir with or without ribavirin [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Several studies have resulted in controversial data about the recurrence or new incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with hepatitis C who were treated with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs).   Aim: This observational study aimed to assess the occurrence rate of HCC in patients who developed a sustained virological response (SVR).. METHOD:  A six-month prospective study was done at the National Hepatology and Tropical Medicine Research Institute [NHTMRI] in Cairo, Egypt on 150 chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients treated with sofosbuvir and daclatasvir with or without ribavirin. Patients were assigned into two groups according to their laboratory values to either receive sofosbuvir/daclatasvir and ribavirin (S/D/R) or receive only sofosbuvir/daclatasvir (S/D). The main outcome measure was the occurrence of HCC. Results: SVR-12 was 100%. 8.5% of patients developed HCC in the S/D/R group, while 0% in the S/D group. Conclusion:  New incidence or recurrence of HCC may occur in CHC genotype 4 cirrhotic patients receiving sofosbuvir/daclatasvir and ribavirin (difficult to treat) although achieving SVR. The cause of HCC development in this study is cirrhosis, not the administered DAAs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Bacterial and fungal co-infections among ICU COVID-19 hospitalized patients in a Palestinian hospital: a retrospective cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Diagnosis of co-infections with multiple pathogens among hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients can be jointly challenging and essential for appropriate treatment, shortening hospital stays and preventing antimicrobial resistance. This study proposes to investigate the burden of bacterial and fungal co-infections outcomes on COVID-19 patients. It is a single center cross-sectional study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients at Beit-Jala hospital in Palestine. Methods: The study included 321 hospitalized patients admitted to the ICU between June 2020 and March 2021 aged ≥20 years, with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay conducted on a nasopharyngeal swab. The patient's information was gathered using graded data forms from electronic medical reports. Results: The diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infection was proved through the patient’s clinical presentation and positive blood or sputum culture results. All cases had received empirical antimicrobial therapy before the intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and different regimens during the ICU stay. The rate of bacterial co-infection was 51.1%, mainly from gram-negative isolates (Enterobacter species and K.pneumoniae). The rate of fungal co-infection caused by A.fumigatus was 48.9%, and the mortality rate was 8.1%. However, it is unclear if it had been attributed to SARS-CoV-2 or coincidental. Conclusions: Bacterial and fungal co-infection is common among COVID-19 patients at the ICU in Palestine, but it is not obvious if these cases are attributed to SARS-CoV-2 or coincidental, because little data is available to compare it with the rates of secondary infection in local ICU departments before the pandemic. Comprehensively, those conclusions present data supporting a conservative antibiotic administration for severely unwell COVID-19 infected patients. Our examination regarding the impacts of employing antifungals to manage COVID-19 patients can work as a successful reference for future COVID-19 therapy.

                The aim of the present study is to report the indirect evaluation of cervical stimulation considering the effect of the duration of the stimulus on the control of intraocular pressure in a patient with bilateral glaucoma with important ocular edema.  A 47-year-old woman reported the onset of pain and bilateral tearing in the eyes at 35 years of age and was diagnosed with glaucoma. The patient began clinical treatment, but intraocular pressure remained 35 to 40 mmHg even with the use of four eye medications in the form of drops. The patient reported that her vision was always blurred despite the use of the eyedrops. The patient was submitted to the Godoy & Godoy method of cervical lymphatic therapy to reduce the edema. The ophthalmologist measured her intraocular pressure every two and three days. We found that the pressure was maintained below 20 mmHg when lymphatic therapy was performed every two days, but intraocular pressure increased and the vision became blurred when therapy was performed every three days. The Godoy & Godoy method of cervical lymphatic therapy constitutes a novel lymphatic system stimulation strategy that maintains its effect on intraocular pressure for approximately 48 hours, as demonstrated through an indirect evaluation.

                Background: Because the etiopathogenesis of male infertility is multifactorial our study was designed to clarify the relationship between standard semen parameters, testicular volume, levels of reproductive hormones and the fragmentation of sperm nuclear DNA (SDF). Methods: Patients (n = 130) were clustered as subjects: 1) with an abnormal volume (utrasonography) of at least one testis (<12 mL) or with a normal volume of testes and 2) with abnormal levels of at least one of the reproductive hormones (FSH, LH, PRL, TSH, total T – electrochemiluminescence method) or with normal hormonal profiles and 3) with high level of SDF (>30%), moderate (>15–30%) or low (≤15%) (sperm chromatin dispersion test). Results: In subjects with a decreased testicular volume and in subjects with abnormal levels of reproductive hormones, decreased basic semen parameters were found. Participants with abnormal testicular volume had a higher percentage of SDF and a higher level of FSH (Mann–Whitney U test). In turn, men with a high level of SDF had lower testicular volume and conventional sperm parameters than men with a low level of SDF (Kruskal–Wallis test). Conclusions: We showed that spermatogenesis disorders coexisted with decreased testicular volume and increased FSH levels. The disorders of spermatogenesis were manifested by reduced basic sperm characteristics and a high level of sperm nuclear DNA damage.

                Primary dysmenorrhea is one of the most prevalent gynecologic condition affecting women, especially adolescent girls. Among adolescents, associated symptoms of dysmenorrhea impact the general health status, negatively influence the quality of life, resulting in school absenteeism and decreased academic performance. This study protocol was developed to estimate the prevalence of dysmenorrhea and evaluate the effectiveness of Meditation and Yoga intervention on dysmenorrhea among adolescent girls. In phase I, data will be collected from adolescent girls (N» 5000) aged between 13 and 18 years to estimate the prevalence of dysmenorrhea and in the second phase, Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial will be conducted to evaluate the impact of Meditation and Yoga on dysmenorrhea. From the first phase, those adolescent girls (N=400) with high pain intensity (numerical pain rating scale ≥ 4) from each school, with schools as clusters, will be assigned to the interventional and control arm. The interventional arm will receive the proposed Meditation and Yoga intervention for 12 weeks under supervision and the control arm will continue with standard routine care.  The outcomes such as pain intensity, stress, academic performance, self-efficacy and biomarker levels (Hb, Progesterone, Estrogen, Prostaglandins F2α and E2) will be assessed at baseline and 12 weeks after the intervention. Yoga's popularity and medical benefits have grown with the growing interest in alternative and complementary medicine. There is insufficient evidence to support yoga as a treatment for dysmenorrhea symptoms. This research contributes to the evidence on the impact of meditation and yoga on primary dysmenorrhea among adolescent girls.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Duration of dry and humidified incubation of single-step embryo culture medium and oxygen tension during sham culture do not alter medium composition. [version 4; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The extended embryo culture using single-step medium gained popularity in clinical in vitro fertilisation (IVF). However, there are concerns about the degradation of unstable medium components and their negative effects on the developing embryos. Further, dry-incubation can increase osmolality, which can in-turn enhance the concentration of constituents of the media and their stability. Hence, this study was conducted to understand the immediate changes in the culture media constituents in relation to clinically comparable situations such as single-step extended embryo culture and use of dry and humidified-incubation in two-different gaseous conditions. Methods: Commercially available single-step medium was sham-cultured in droplets under oil in two different conditions viz. dry (37°C; 6%CO 2; 5%O 2) and humidified (37°C; 6% CO 2; atmospheric O 2) for 0h, 72h, and 120h intervals. Droplets were subjected to the sensitivity-enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based profiling using 800 MHz NMR equipped with a cryogenically cooled micro-coil (1.7mm) probe. NMR profile of the embryo culture medium between the two groups were comprehensively assessed. Results: A total of ten amino acids and four energy substrates were identified from the culture medium. The medium constituents identified showed a non-significant increase in the dry-incubation group at 72h and then declined at 120h. Humidified incubation had no effects on the level of the identified medium constituents until 120h. No significant differences in the levels of medium constituents identified were observed between the dry and humidified-groups at various time-points tested. Conclusions: A non-significant variation in the levels of medium constituents observed in the dry-incubation of single-step medium most unlikely to influence a clinical outcome. However, the impact of these subtle changes on the (epi)genetic integrity of the embryos in a clinical set-up to be addressed.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evaluation of electrocardiogram: numerical vs. image data for emotion recognition system [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a physiological signal used to diagnose and monitor cardiovascular disease, usually using 2- D ECG. Numerous studies have proven that ECG can be used to detect human emotions using 1-D ECG; however, ECG is typically captured as 2-D images rather than as 1-D data. There is still no consensus on the effect of the ECG input format on the accuracy of the emotion recognition system (ERS). The ERS using 2-D ECG is still inadequately studied. Therefore, this study compared ERS performance using 1-D and 2-D ECG data to investigate the effect of the ECG input format on the ERS. Methods: This study employed the DREAMER dataset, which contains 23 ECG recordings obtained during audio-visual emotional elicitation. Numerical data was converted to ECG images for the comparison. Numerous approaches were used to obtain ECG features. The Augsburg BioSignal Toolbox (AUBT) and the Toolbox for Emotional feature extraction from Physiological signals (TEAP) extracted features from numerical data. Meanwhile, features were extracted from image data using Oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF (ORB), Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), KAZE, Accelerated-KAZE (AKAZE), Binary Robust Invariant Scalable Keypoints (BRISK), and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG). Dimension reduction was accomplished using linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and valence and arousal were classified using the Support Vector Machine (SVM). Results: The experimental results show 1-D ECG-based ERS achieved 65.06% of accuracy and 75.63% of F1 score for valence, and 57.83% of accuracy and 44.44% of F1-score for arousal. For 2-D ECG-based ERS, the highest accuracy and F1-score for valence were 62.35% and 49.57%; whereas, the arousal was 59.64% and 59.71%. Conclusions: The results indicate that both inputs work comparably well in classifying emotions, which demonstrates the potential of 1-D and 2-D as input modalities for the ERS.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">GRAPE: genomic relatedness detection pipeline [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Classifying the degree of relatedness between pairs of individuals has both scientific and commercial applications. As an example, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) may suffer from high rates of false positive results due to unrecognized population structure. This problem becomes especially relevant with recent increases in large-cohort studies. Accurate relationship classification is also required for genetic linkage analysis to identify disease-associated loci. Additionally, DNA relatives matching service is one of the leading drivers for the direct-to-consumer genetic testing market. Despite the availability of scientific and research information on the methods for determining kinship and the accessibility of relevant tools, the assembly of the pipeline, that stably operates on a real-world genotypic data, requires significant research and development resources. Currently, there is no open source end-to-end solution for relatedness detection in genomic data, that is fast, reliable and accurate for both close and distant degrees of kinship, combines all the necessary processing steps to work on real data, and is ready for production integration. To address this, we developed GRAPE: Genomic RelAtedness detection PipelinE. It combines data preprocessing, identity-by-descent (IBD) segments detection, and accurate relationship estimation. The project uses software development best practices, as well as Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) standards and tools. Pipeline efficiency is demonstrated on both simulated and real-world datasets. GRAPE is available from: https://github.com/genxnetwork/grape.

                <p>Nature Neuroscience, Published online: 30 May 2022; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-022-01103-8">doi:10.1038/s41593-022-01103-8</a></p>Sleep disruption is a common but poorly understood feature of neurodevelopmental disorders including autism spectrum disorder. A study by Bian et al. reveals that sleep disruption in adolescent mice leads to long-lasting changes in social novelty preferences. Importantly, these perturbations can be restored through balanced actions in midbrain dopamine systems.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The spatiotemporal patterns of major human admixture events during the European Holocene</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies have shown that admixture has been pervasive throughout human history. While several methods exist for dating admixture in contemporary populations, they are not suitable for sparse, low coverage ancient genomic data. Thus, we developed <i>DATES </i>that leverages ancestry covariance patterns across the genome of a single individual to infer the timing of admixture. <i>DATES</i> provides reliable estimates under various demographic scenarios and outperforms available methods for ancient DNA applications. Using <i>DATES</i> on ~1,100 ancient genomes, we reconstruct major gene flow events during European Holocene. By studying the genetic formation of Anatolian farmers, we infer that gene flow related to Iranian Neolithic farmers occurred before 9,600 BCE, predating the advent of agriculture in Anatolia. Contrary to the archaeological evidence, we estimate that early Steppe pastoralist groups (Yamnaya and Afanasievo) were genetically formed more than a millennium before the start of steppe pastoralism. Using time transect samples across sixteen regions, we provide a fine-scale chronology of the Neolithization of Europe and the rapid spread of Steppe pastoralist ancestry across Europe. Our analyses provide new insights on the origins and spread of farming and Indo-European languages, highlighting the power of genomic dating methods to elucidate the legacy of human migrations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Transcriptional regulation of Cyclophilin D by BMP/SMAD signaling and its role in osteogenic differentiation</a></h4>

              
                Cyclophilin D (CypD) promotes opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) which plays a key role in both cell physiology and pathology. It is, therefore, beneficial for cells to tightly regulate CypD and MPTP but little is known about such regulation. We have reported before that CypD is downregulated and MPTP deactivated during differentiation in various tissues. Herein, we identify BMP/Smad signaling, a major driver of differentiation, as a transcriptional regulator of the CypD gene, <i>Ppif</i>. Using osteogenic induction of mesenchymal lineage cells as a BMP/Smad activation-dependent differentiation model, we show that CypD is in fact transcriptionally repressed during this process. The importance of such CypD downregulation is evidenced by the negative effect of CypD 'rescue' via gain-of-function on osteogenesis both <i>in vitro</i> and in a mouse model . In sum, we characterized BMP/Smad signaling as a regulator of CypD expression and elucidated the role of CypD downregulation during cell differentiation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The geometry of robustness in spiking neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Neural systems are remarkably robust against various perturbations, a phenomenon that still requires a clear explanation. Here, we graphically illustrate howneural networks can become robust. We study spiking networks that generate low-dimensional representations, and we show that the neurons; subthreshold voltages are confined to a convex region in a lower-dimensional voltage subspace, which we call a 'bounding box'. Any changes in network parameters (such as number of neurons, dimensionality of inputs, firing thresholds, synapticweights, or transmission delays) can all be understood as deformations of this bounding box. Using these insights, we showthat functionality is preserved as long as perturbations do not destroy the integrity of the bounding box. We suggest that the principles underlying robustness in these networks-low-dimensional representations, heterogeneity of tuning, and precise negative feedback-may be key to understanding the robustness of neural systems at the circuit level.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">DNA-damage induced cell death in yap1;wwtr1 mutant epidermal basal cells</a></h4>

              
                In a previous study, it was reported that Yap1 and Wwtr1 in zebrafish regulates the morphogenesis of the posterior body and epidermal fin fold (Kimelman, D., et al. 2017). We report here that DNA damage induces apoptosis of epidermal basal cells (EBCs) in zebrafish <i>yap1<sup>-/-</sup>;wwtr1<sup>-/-</sup></i> embryos. Specifically, these mutant EBCs exhibit active Caspase-3, Caspase-8 and γH2AX, consistent with DNA damage serving as a stimulus of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway in epidermal cells. Live imaging of zebrafish epidermal cells reveals a steady growth of basal cell size in the developing embryo, but this growth is inhibited in mutant basal cells followed by apoptosis, leading to the hypothesis that factors underscoring cell size play a role in this DNA damage-induced apoptosis phenotype. We tested two of these factors using cell stretching and substrate stiffness assays, and found that HaCaT cells cultured on stiff substrates exhibit more numerous γH2AX foci compared to ones cultured on soft substrates. Thus, our experiments suggest that substrate rigidity may modulate genomic stress in epidermal cells, and that Yap1 and Wwtr1 promotes their survival.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Inhibitory control of frontal metastability sets the temporal signature of cognition</a></h4>

              
                Cortical dynamics are organized over multiple anatomical and temporal scales. The mechanistic origin of the temporal organization and its contribution to cognition remain unknown. Here we demonstrate the cause of this organization by studying a specific temporal signature (time constant and latency) of neural activity. In monkey frontal areas, recorded during flexible decisions, temporal signatures display specific area-dependent ranges, as well as anatomical and cell-type distributions. Moreover, temporal signatures are functionally adapted to behaviorally relevant timescales. Fine-grained biophysical network models, constrained to account for experimentally observed temporal signatures, reveal that after-hyperpolarization potassium and inhibitory GABA-B conductances critically determine areas’ specificity. They mechanistically account for temporal signatures by organizing activity into metastable states, with inhibition controlling state stability and transitions. As predicted by models, state durations non-linearly scale with temporal signatures in monkey, matching behavioral timescales. Thus, local inhibitory-controlled metastability constitutes the dynamical core specifying the temporal organization of cognitive functions in frontal areas.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Constitutive loss of DNMT3A causes morbid obesity through misregulation of adipogenesis</a></h4>

              
                DNA Methyltransferase 3 A (DNMT3A) is an important facilitator of differentiation of both embryonic and hematopoietic stem cells. Heterozygous germline mutations in <i>DNMT3A</i> lead to Tatton-Brown-Rahman Syndrome (TBRS), characterized by obesity and excessive height. While DNMT3A is known to impact feeding behavior via the hypothalamus, here we investigated a role in adipocyte progenitors utilizing heterozygous knockout mice that recapitulate cardinal TBRS phenotypes. These mice become morbidly obese due to adipocyte enlargement and tissue expansion. Adipose tissue in these mice exhibited defects in preadipocyte maturation and precocious activation of inflammatory gene networks, including interleukin-6 signaling. Adipocyte progenitor cell lines lacking DNMT3A exhibited aberrant differentiation. Furthermore, mice in which <i>Dnmt3a</i> was specifically ablated in adipocyte progenitors showed enlarged fat depots and increased progenitor numbers, partly recapitulating the TBRS obesity phenotypes. Loss of DNMT3A led to constitutive DNA hypomethylation, such that the DNA methylation landscape of young adipocyte progenitors resemble that of older wild-type mice. Together, our results demonstrate that DNMT3A coordinates both the central and local control of energy storage required to maintain normal weight and prevent inflammatory obesity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Invariant representation of physical stability in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Successful engagement with the world requires the ability to predict what will happen next. Here, we investigate how the brain makes a fundamental prediction about the physical world: whether the situation in front of us is stable, and hence likely to stay the same, or unstable, and hence likely to change in the immediate future. Specifically, we ask if judgments of stability can be supported by the kinds of representations that have proven to be highly effective at visual object recognition in both machines and brains, or instead if the ability to determine the physical stability of natural scenes may require generative algorithms that simulate the physics of the world. To find out, we measured responses in both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the brain (using fMRI) to natural images of physically stable versus unstable scenarios. We find no evidence for generalizable representations of physical stability in either standard CNNs trained on visual object and scene classification (ImageNet), or in the human ventral visual pathway, which has long been implicated in the same process. However, in frontoparietal regions previously implicated in intuitive physical reasoning we find both scenario-invariant representations of physical stability, and higher univariate responses to unstable than stable scenes. These results demonstrate abstract representations of physical stability in the dorsal but not ventral pathway, consistent with the hypothesis that the computations underlying stability entail not just pattern classification but forward physical simulation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A generalized cortical activity pattern at internally-generated mental context boundaries during unguided narrative recall</a></h4>

              
                Current theory and empirical studies suggest that humans segment continuous experiences into events based on the mismatch between predicted and actual sensory inputs; detection of these 'event boundaries' evokes transient neural responses. However, boundaries can also occur at transitions between internal mental states, without relevant external input changes. To what extent do such 'internal boundaries' share neural response properties with externally-driven boundaries? We conducted an fMRI experiment where subjects watched a series of short movies and then verbally recalled the movies, unprompted, in the order of their choosing. During recall, transitions between movies thus constituted major boundaries between internal mental contexts, generated purely by subjects' unguided thoughts. Following the offset of each recalled movie, we observed stereotyped spatial activation patterns in the default mode network, especially the posterior medial cortex, consistent across different movie contents and even across the different tasks of movie watching and recall. Surprisingly, the between-movie boundary patterns did not resemble patterns at boundaries between events within a movie. Thus, major transitions between mental contexts elicit neural phenomena shared across internal and external modes and distinct from within-context event boundary detection, potentially reflecting a cognitive state related to the flushing and reconfiguration of situation models.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Inhibition of the sodium-dependent HCO3- transporter SLC4A4, produces a cystic fibrosis-like airway disease phenotype</a></h4>

              
                Bicarbonate secretion is a fundamental process involved in maintaining acid-base homeostasis. Disruption of bicarbonate entry into airway lumen, as has been observed in cystic fibrosis, produces several defects in lung function due to thick mucus accumulation. Bicarbonate is critical for correct mucin deployment and there is increasing interest in understanding its role in airway physiology, particularly in the initiation of lung disease in children affected by cystic fibrosis, in the absence of detectable bacterial infection. The current model of anion secretion in mammalian airways consists of CFTR and TMEM16A as apical anion exit channels, with limited capacity for bicarbonate transport compared to chloride. However, both channels can couple to SLC26A4 anion exchanger to maximise bicarbonate secretion. Nevertheless, current models lack any details about the identity of the basolateral protein(s) responsible for bicarbonate uptake into airway epithelial cells. We report herein that the electrogenic, sodium-dependent, bicarbonate cotransporter, SLC4A4, is expressed in the basolateral membrane of human and mouse airways, and that it's pharmacological inhibition or genetic silencing reduces bicarbonate secretion. In fully differentiated primary human airway cells cultures, SLC4A4 inhibition induced an acidification of the airways surface liquid and markedly reduced the capacity of cells to recover from an acid load. Studies in the <i>Slc4a4</i>-null mice revealed a previously unreported lung phenotype, characterized by mucus accumulation and reduced mucociliary clearance. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the reduction of SLC4A4 function induced a CF-like phenotype, even when chloride secretion remained intact, highlighting the important role SLC4A4 plays in bicarbonate secretion and mammalian airway function.

                To characterize the process of visual search, reaction time is measured relative to stimulus onset, when the whole search field is presented in view simultaneously. Salient objects are found faster, suggesting that they are detected using peripheral vision (rather than each object being fixated in turn). This work investigated how objects are detected in the periphery when onset in the visual field is due to head movement. Is the process of target detection similarly affected by salience? We test this in 360 degree view with free head and eye movement, using a virtual reality headset with eye tracking. We presented letters and Gabor patches as stimuli in separate experiments. Four clusters were arranged horizontally such that two clusters were visible at onset either side of a fixation cross (near location) while the other two entered the field of view (FoV) when the participant made an appropriate head movement (far location). In both experiments we varied whether the target was less or more salient. We found an interesting discrepancy in that across both tasks and locations the first eye movement to land near a cluster was closer to the salient target, even though salience did not lead to a faster head movement towards a cluster at the far locations. We also found that the planning of head movement changed the landing of gaze position to be targeted more towards the centres of the clusters at the far locations, leading to more accurate initial gaze positions relative to target, regardless of salience. This suggests that the spatial information available for targeting of eye movements within a given FoV is not always available for the planning of head movements and how a target appears in view affects gaze targeting accuracy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hippocampal-medial entorhinal circuit is differently organized along the dorsoventral axis in rodents</a></h4>

              
                The general understanding of hippocampal circuits is that the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex (EC) are topographically connected through parallel identical circuits along the dorsoventral axis. Our anterograde tracing and in vitro electrophysiology data, however, show a markedly different dorsoventral organization of the hippocampal projection to the medial EC (MEC). Whereas dorsal hippocampal projections are confined to the dorsal MEC and preferentially target layer Vb (LVb) over layer Va (LVa) neurons, the ventral hippocampus innervates the entire dorsoventral extent of MEC. In the ventral MEC, these projections innervate neurons in both LVa and LVb. In contrast, in the dorsal MEC, ventral hippocampal projections target mainly LVa neurons. As LVa neurons project to telencephalic structures, our findings indicate that the ventral hippocampus regulates LVa-mediated entorhinal-neocortical output from both the dorsal and ventral MEC. Overall, the marked dorsoventral differences in hippocampal-entorhinal connectivity impose important constraints on signal flow in hippocampal-neocortical circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fixational eye movements enable robust edge detection</a></h4>

              
                Human vision relies on mechanisms that respond to luminance edges in space and time. Most edge models use orientation-selective mechanisms on multiple spatial scales and operate on static inputs assuming that edge processing occurs within a single fixational instance. Recent studies, however, demonstrate functionally relevant temporal modulations of the sensory input due to fixational eye movements. Here we propose a spatiotemporal model of human edge detection which combines elements of spatial and active vision. The model augments a spatial vision model by temporal filtering and shifts the input images over time mimicking an active sampling scheme via fixational eye movements. The first model test was White's illusion, a lightness effect that has been shown to depend on edges. The model reproduced the spatial-frequency-specific interference with the edges by superimposing narrowband noise (1-5 cpd), similar to the psychophysical interference observed in White's effect. Second, we compare the model's edge detection performance in natural images in the presence and absence of Gaussian white noise with human-labeled contours for the same (noise-free) images. Notably, the model detects edges robustly against noise in both test cases without relying on orientation-selective processes. Eliminating model components, we demonstrate the relevance of multiscale spatiotemporal filtering and scale-specific normalization for edge detection. The proposed model facilitates efficient edge detection in (artificial) vision systems and challenges the notion that orientation-selective mechanisms are required for edge detection.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multi-synaptic boutons are a feature of CA1 hippocampal connections that may underlie network synchrony</a></h4>

              
                Excitatory synapses are typically described as single synaptic boutons (SSBs), where one presynaptic bouton contacts a single postsynaptic spine. Using serial section block face scanning electron microscopy, we found that this textbook definition of the synapse does not fully apply to the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Roughly half of all excitatory synapses in the stratum oriens involved multi-synaptic boutons (MSBs), where a single presynaptic bouton containing multiple active zones contacted many postsynaptic spines (from 2 to 7) on the basal dendrites of different cells. The fraction of MSBs increased during development (from P21 to P100) and decreased with distance from the soma. Curiously, synaptic properties such as active zone (AZ) or postsynaptic density (PSD) size exhibited less within-MSB variation when compared to neighbouring SSBs, features that were confirmed by super-resolution light microscopy. Computer simulations suggest that these properties favour synchronous activity in CA1 networks.

                Reproducing high-acuity vision with an epiretinal implant will likely require inferring the natural light responses of diverse RGC types in the implanted retina, without measuring them directly. Here we demonstrate an approach that exploits intrinsic electrical features of primate RGCs. First, ON-parasol and OFF-parasol RGCs were identified with 95% accuracy using electrical features. Then, the somatic electrical footprint, predicted cell type, and average linear-nonlinear-Poisson model parameters of each cell type were used to infer a light response model for each cell. Across five retinas, these models achieved an average correlation with measured firing rates of 0.49 for white noise visual stimuli and 0.50 for natural scenes stimuli, compared to 0.65 and 0.58 respectively for models fitted to recorded light responses, an upper bound. This finding, and linear decoding of images from predicted RGC activity, suggested that the inference approach may be useful for high-fidelity sight restoration.

                The brain is a frustrated system that contains conflictual link arrangements named frustration. The frustration as a source of disorder prevents the system from settling into low energy states and provides flexibility for brain network organization. In this research, we tried to identify the pattern of frustration formation in the brain at the levels of region, connection, canonical network, and hemisphere. We found that frustration formation has not a uniform pattern. Some subcortical elements have an active role in frustration formation, despite many low contributed cortical elements. Frustrating connections are mostly between-network types and triadic frustrations are mainly formed between three regions from three distinct canonical networks. Although there were no significant differences between brain hemispheres. We also did not find any robust differences between the frustration formation patterns of various lifespan stages. Our results may be interesting for those who study the organization of brain links and promising for those who want to manipulate brain networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age and cognitive load affect muscle activation profiles in response to physical perturbations while walking</a></h4>

              
                To maintain balance during walking, the central nervous system must adjust the base of support (i.e., modulation of step length and step width) to the center of mass displacement in every step. We aimed to explore age and concurrent cognitive attention-demanding task effects on lower limb muscle fiber type recruitment in response to unexpected loss of balance during walking i.e., perturbation. Twenty young (YA) and 18 older adults (OA), (mean:27.00, SD:2.79 and mean:70.13, SD:3.95 years old, respectively) were exposed to unexpected perturbations, while walking on a treadmill, in virtual reality environment. Surface electromyography (sEMG) total spectral power for frequency bands associated with muscle fibers type I (40-60Hz), type IIa (60-150Hz) and type IIb (150-250Hz), from tibialis-anterior and vastus-lateralis muscles were analyzed. Four Generalized Estimating Equations models assessed age and cognitive attention-demanding task's load association with lower-limb muscle activation patterns resulting from perturbation in single- and double-support phases of the gait cycle. Results show that OA employ a muscle fiber type IIa dominant increase strategy while YA show muscle fiber type IIb dominant increase in muscle fiber type recruitment in response to unexpected perturbations during walking. This suggests that the ability to recruit fast-twitch muscle fibers is deteriorated with age and thus may be related to insufficient balance recovery response.

                Although spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a motor neuron disease caused by the loss of survival of motor neuron proteins, there is growing evidence that lesions in nonmotor neuron cells are involved in SMA pathogenesis. Transcriptome alterations occurring at the single-cell level in SMA spinal cord are unknown. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of the spinal cord of a severe SMA mouse model, and characterized ten cell types as well as their differentially expressed genes. Using CellChat, we found that cellular communication between different cell types in the spinal cord of SMA mice is substantially reduced. A dimensionality reduction analysis revealed 29 cell subtypes and differentially expressed genes for each subtype. Among them, the most significant change in the SMA spinal cord at the single-cell level was observed in a subpopulation of vascular fibroblasts. This subpopulation was greatly reduced, which may be responsible for vascular defects in SMA mice and may lead to widespread reductions in protein synthesis and energy metabolism. This study is the first to report a single-cell atlas of the spinal cord of mice with severe SMA, providing new insights into SMA pathogenesis.

                Altruism is critical for cooperation and productivity in human societies, but is known to vary strongly across contexts and individuals. The origin of these differences is largely unknown, but may in principle reflect variations in different types of neurocognitive processes that temporally unfold during altruistic decision making (ranging from initial perceptual processing via value computations to final integrative choice mechanisms). Here, we address this question by examining altruistic choices in different inequality contexts with computational modeling and EEG. Our results show that across all contexts and individuals, wealth distribution choices recruit a similar late decision process evident in model-predicted evidence accumulation signals over parietal regions. Contextual and individual differences in behavior related instead to initial processing of stimulus-locked inequality-related value information in centroparietal and centrofrontal sensors, as well as to gamma-band synchronization of these value-related signals with parietal response-locked evidence-accumulation signals. Our findings suggest separable biological bases for individual and contextual differences in altruism and emphasize that these reflect differences in processing of choice-relevant information.

                Age-related cortical plasticity reveals insights into the mechanisms underlying the stability and flexibility of neuronal circuits. Classical parcellation has long demonstrated the importance of microstructural features yet 3D approaches have rarely been applied to human brain organization in-vivo. We acquired functional and structural 7T-MRI and behavioral data of living younger and older adults to investigate human primary motor cortex (M1) aging, employing 3D parcellation techniques. We identify distinct cortical fields in M1 based on quantitative tissue contrast, which are, along with the myelin-poor borders between them, stable with age. We also show age-related iron accumulation, particularly in the output layer 5b and the lower limb field. Our data offers a new model of human M1 with distinct cortical fields, a mechanistic explanation for the stability of topographic organization in the context of aging and plasticity, and highlights the specific vulnerability of output signal flows to cortical plasticity.

                Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disease with the impairment of movement execution that is related to age, genetic and environmental factors. 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyri-dine (MPTP) is a neurotoxin widely used to induce PD models, but the effect of MPTP on cell-gene of PD has not been fully elucidated. By single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we uncovered the PD-specific cells and revealed remarkable changes in their cellular states, including astrocytosis, endothelial cells absence, as well as a cluster of PD-exclusive medium spiny neuron cells. Furthermore, trajectory analysis of astrocyte and endothelial cells populations predicted candidate target gene sets that might be associated with PD. Notably, the detailed regulatory roles of astrocyte-specific transcription factors Dbx2 and Sox13 in PD were first revealed in our work. Finally, we characterized the cell-cell communications of PD-specific cells and found that the overall communication strength was enhanced in PD compared with matched control, especially the signaling pathways of NRXN and NEGR. Our work provides comprehensive overview on the changes of cellular states of the MPTP-induced mouse brain.

                Glucose is the primary source of energy for the brain. However, it remains controversial whether, upon neuronal activation, glucose is primarily used by neurons for ATP production, or if it is partially oxidized in astrocytes, as proposed by the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle model for glutamatergic neurons. Thus, an in vivo picture of glucose metabolism during cognitive processes is missing. Here, we uncover in Drosophila a glia-to-neuron alanine transfer that sustains memory formation. Following associative conditioning, glycolysis in glial cells produces alanine, which is back-converted into pyruvate in mushroom body cholinergic neurons to uphold their increased mitochondrial needs. Alanine, as a mediator of glia-neuron coupling, could be an alternative to lactate in cholinergic systems. In parallel, a dedicated glial glucose transporter imports glucose specifically for long-term memory, by directly transferring it to neurons for use by the pentose phosphate pathway. Our results demonstrate in vivo the compartmentalization of glucose metabolism between neurons and glial cells during memory formation.

                The sphingolipids galactosylceramide (GalCer), sulfatide (ST) and sphingomyelin (SM) are essential for myelin stability and function. GalCer and ST are synthesized mostly from C22-C24 ceramides, generated by Ceramide Synthase 2 (CerS2). To clarify the requirement for C22-C24 sphingolipid synthesis in myelin lipid biosynthesis and stability, we generated mice lacking CerS2 specifically in myelinating cells (CerS2{Delta}O/{Delta}O). At 6 weeks of age, normal-appearing myelin had formed in CerS2{Delta}O/{Delta}O mice, however there was a reduction in myelin thickness and the percentage of myelinated axons. Pronounced loss of C22-C24 sphingolipids in myelin of CerS2{Delta}O/{Delta}O mice was compensated by greatly increased levels of C18 sphingolipids. A distinct microglial population expressing high levels of activation and phagocytic markers such as CD64, CD11c, MHC class II, and CD68 was apparent at 6 weeks of age in CerS2{Delta}O/{Delta}O mice, and had increased by 10 weeks. Increased staining for denatured myelin basic protein was also apparent in 6-week-old CerS2{Delta}O/{Delta}O mice. By 16 weeks, CerS2{Delta}O/{Delta}O mice showed pronounced myelin atrophy, motor deficits, and axon beading, a hallmark of axon stress. 90% of CerS2{Delta}O/{Delta}O mice died between 16 and 26 weeks of age. This study highlights the importance of sphingolipid acyl chain length for the structural integrity of myelin, demonstrating how a modest reduction in lipid chain length causes exposure of a denatured myelin protein epitope and expansion of phagocytic microglia, followed by axon pathology, myelin degeneration, and motor deficits. Understanding the molecular trigger for microglial activation should aid the development of therapeutics for demyelinating and neurodegenerative diseases.

	<p>There have been increasing reports of Guillain&amp;amp;ndash;Barr&amp;amp;eacute; syndrome (GBS), a rare but debilitating neurological disease, occurring post-COVID-19 vaccination. However, the outcomes and relationships between patient demographics and clinical outcomes of post-COVID-19 vaccination GBS remain unclear. To bridge this gap, our study investigates the outcomes and clinical factors associated with poorer GBS outcomes following COVID-19 vaccination. We conducted a review and pooled analysis of detailed data extracted from 57 published cases with the relevant search strategies and criteria. The groups compared included male versus female patients, 1st dose versus 2nd dose and early onset versus late onset of GBS. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to compare the vaccine type, clinical severity and post-treatment outcomes between these groups of patients. Our results highlight for the first time that females were significantly more likely to have severe clinical presentation and poorer outcomes compared to males. Additionally, viral vector vaccines were the predominant vaccine type administered in early-onset post-COVID-19-vaccination GBS and GBS occurring after the 1st vaccination dose. It was also shown that reported cases of post-vaccination GBS generally displayed a positive response to conventional treatment and had favourable post-treatment outcomes. Through this study, we have established important links and provided assuring evidence for treatment response and post-treatment outcomes of GBS occurring post-COVID-19 vaccination. While the COVID-19 vaccination brings about much greater benefits than risks, our findings provide further impetus for greater vigilance in certain patient groups and more studies to explore the mechanisms behind these links.</p>

	<p>Gliomas make up nearly 40% of all central nervous system tumors, with over 50% of those being high-grade gliomas. Emerging data suggests that electrophysiologic events in the peri-tumoral region may play a role in the behavior and progression of high-grade gliomas. While seizures in the peri-tumoral zone are well described, much larger and slowly propagating waves of spreading depolarization (SD) may potentially have roles in both non-epileptic transient neurologic deficits and tumor progression. SD has only recently been observed in pre-clinical glioma models and it is not known whether these events occur clinically. We present a case of SD occurring in a human high-grade glioma using gold-standard subdural DC ECoG recordings. This finding could have meaningful implications for both clinical symptomatology and potentially for disease progression in these patients. Our observations and hypotheses are based on analogy with a large body of evidence in stroke and acute neurological injury that have recently established SD as cause of transient neurological deficits as well as a fundamental mechanism of ischemic expansion. Whether SD could represent a mechanistic target in this process to limit such progression is a high priority for further clinical investigations.</p>

	<p>The microbiota-gut-brain axis has attracted significant attention with respect to studying the mechanisms of brain aging; however, the specific connection between gut microbiota and aging remains unclear. The abnormal expression and mutation of proteins belonging to the P4-ATPase family, including Atp11b, results in a variety of neurological diseases. The results of our analysis demonstrate that there was a shift in the abundance of certain gut microbiota in Atp11b-knockout (KO) mice. Specifically, there was an increase in pro-inflammatory bacteria that accelerate aging and a decrease in probiotics that delay aging. Consequently, an enhanced oxidative stress response was observed, which was characterized by a reduction in the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. In addition, our data demonstrate that there was a decrease in the number of cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) region of the hippocampus, and aggravation of aging-related pathological features such as senescence &amp;amp;beta;-galactosidase (SA-&amp;amp;beta;-Gal), p-HistoneH2AX (Ser139), and p16INK4. Moreover, KO mice show typical aging-associated behavior, such as memory impairment and slow pain perception. Taken together, we demonstrate a possible mechanism of aging induced by gut microbiota in Atp11b-KO mice, which provides a novel perspective for the treatment of aging through the microbiota-gut-brain axis.</p>

	<p>There exist extensive animal research and lesion studies in humans demonstrating a tight association between the hypothalamus and socioemotional behavior. However, human neuroimaging literature in this direction is still rather limited. In order to reexamine the functional role of this region in regulating human social behavior, we here provided a synthesis of neuroimaging studies showing hypothalamic activation during affiliative, cooperative interactions, and in relation to ticklish laughter and humor. In addition, studies reporting involvement of the hypothalamus during aggressive and antisocial interactions were also considered. Our systematic review revealed a growing number of investigations demonstrating that the evolutionary conserved hypothalamic neural circuity is involved in multiple and diverse aspects of human socioemotional behavior. On the basis of the observed heterogeneity of hypothalamus-mediated socioemotional responses, we concluded that the hypothalamus might play an extended functional role for species survival and preservation, ranging from exploratory and approaching behaviors promoting social interactions to aggressive and avoidance responses protecting and defending the established social bonds.</p>

	<p>It is well known that inflammation is crucial in the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases and traumatic central nervous system (CNS) injuries, and that microglia and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) play a pivotal role in neuroinflammation. Therefore, the exploration of molecular signaling pathways that are involved in the microglia/macrophage response might help us to shed light on their eventual therapeutic modulation. Interestingly, there is growing evidence showing that the Wnt family of proteins is involved in different neuropathologies that are characterized by a dysregulated neuroinflammatory response, including spinal cord injury (SCI). Here, we aimed to validate a methodology with competence to assess the physiologically relevant Wnt expression patterns of active microglia and MDMs in a rat model of SCI. For that purpose, we have selected and adapted an in vitro system of primary microglia culture that were stimulated with a lesioned spinal cord extract (SCE), together with an ex vivo protocol of flow cytometry sorting of rat microglia/MDMs at different time-points after contusive SCI. Our study demonstrates that the expression profile of Wnt-related genes in microglia/MDM cells exhibit important differences between these particular scenarios which would be in line with previous studies where similar discrepancies have been described for other molecules. Moreover, our results provide for a first experimental report of the Wnt transcriptome in rat microglia and MDMs after SCI which, together with the research platform that was used in the study, and considering its limitations, we expect might contribute to foster the research on Wnt-driven immunomodulatory therapies.</p>

	<p>Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a common facial neuropathic pain that is mainly characterized by spontaneous or induced needling or electric shock pain in the innervation area of the trigeminal nerve. It is also referred to as &amp;amp;ldquo;the cancer that never dies&amp;amp;rdquo;. The olfactory ensheathing cell (OEC) is a special glial cell in the nervous system that has a strong supportive function in nerve regeneration. Cell transplantation therapy is a useful treatment modality that we believe can be applied in TN management. In this study, OECs were transplanted into the ligation site of the infraorbital nerve of rats. We found that after the OEC transplantation, mechanical pain threshold in the face of the rats was significantly increased. Western blotting, immunofluorescence assay, and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction were performed on the trigeminal ganglia (TG) of model rats. The results revealed a decrease in the expression of P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) in the trigeminal ganglia. Our findings show that OEC transplantation has a good therapeutic effect on TN in rats, and that can reduce the expression of P2X7R in trigeminal ganglia. Therefore, we think that OEC transplantation may be a suitable treatment for TN.</p>

	<p>We present a rare case of intracranial solitary plasmacytoma arising in brain parenchyma in the basal nuclei. Clinical management and autopsy results of the case are described. Background: Intracranial plasmacytomas arising from brain parenchyma are extremely rare, and data from the literature are limited. Primary intracranial plasmacytomas are rare because plasma cells are not found in the brain in normal conditions. Commonly, intracranial plasmacytoma is associated with multiple myeloma, which is why multiple myeloma must be ruled out to diagnose solitary intracranial plasmacytoma. Considering that solitary plasmacytoma and multiple myeloma have some histopathological similarities, it is important to differentiate them because their respective treatments and prognoses are different. Imaging features of primary extramedullary plasmacytoma are nonspecific but are compatible with solid tumors with invariable enhancement. Plasmacytoma was aggressive because it was not diagnosed after the first MRI, but 1.5 months later, MRI showed a large object. We present a rare case of intracranial solitary plasmacytoma arising in brain parenchyma in the basal nuclei.</p>

	<p>The Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is characterized by a difficulty in expressing and interpreting others&amp;amp;rsquo; emotions. In particular, people with ASD have difficulties when interpreting emotions encoded in facial expressions. In the past, music interventions have been shown to improve autistic individuals&amp;amp;rsquo; emotional and social skills. The present study describes a pilot study to explore the usefulness of music as a tool for improving autistic children&amp;amp;rsquo;s emotion recognition in facial expressions. Twenty-five children (mean age = 8.8 y, SD = 1.24) with high-functioning ASD and normal hearing participated in the study consisting of four weekly sessions of 15 min each. Fifteen participants were randomly divided into an experimental group (N = 14) and a control group (N = 11). During each session, participants in the experimental group were exposed to images of facial expressions for four emotions (happy, sad, angry, and fear). Images were shown in three conditions, with the second condition consisting of music of congruent emotion with the shown images. Participants in the control group were shown only images in all three conditions. For six participants in each group, EEG data were acquired during the sessions, and instantaneous emotional responses (arousal and valence values) were extracted from the EEG data. Inter- and intra-session emotion identification improvement was measured in terms of verbal response accuracy, and EEG response differences were analyzed. A comparison of the verbal responses of the experimental group pre- and post-intervention showed a significant (p = 0.001) average improvement in emotion identification accuracy responses of 26% (SD = 3.4). Furthermore, emotional responses of the experimental group at the end of the study showed a higher correlation with the emotional stimuli being presented, compared with their emotional responses at the beginning of the study. No similar verbal responses improvement or EEG-stimuli correlation was found in the control group. These results seem to indicate that music can be used to improve both emotion identification in facial expressions and emotion induction through facial stimuli in children with high-functioning ASD.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Connecting Covert Attention and Visual Perception to the Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Alpha Band Activity, Cross-Frequency Coupling (CFC), and Functional Connectivity using Multivariate Pattern Analysis (MVPA)</a></h4>

              
                Some evidence suggests that alpha activity is directly related to the baseline firing rate of sensory neurons which alters the probability of responding to a stimulus. Other evidence points to alpha indirectly modulating cortical excitability through its interactions with gamma oscillations. A third possibility is that alpha-based functional connectivity better explains attentional modulation and perceptual responses. To test this, alpha amplitude, CFC, and functional connectivity measures were extracted from EEG data recorded while participants performed a cued orientation perception task. Using pre-target data, the spatiotemporal activity of each metric was submitted to a SVM classifier to determine which activity pattern best distinguished trials with covert attention from trials without. The same metrics were submitted to SVR to find the activity that best predicted task performance. Results indicate the best metric for classifying trials with and without covert attention was alpha amplitude. This indicates that, prior to target onset, alpha amplitude alone is most sensitive to the presence of covert attention. In contrast, none of the metrics were strong predictors of task performance. Overall, our results support the idea that alpha activity is directly related to changes in the baseline firing rate of sensory neurons which changes responsiveness but not performance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Peripheral ghrelin administration prevents the behavioral effects of restraint stress in mice: possible implication of PVNCRH neurons.</a></h4>

              
                Ghrelin is a gut-derived hormone that is secreted during conditions of negative caloric balance and acts as a key modulator of feeding, increasing food intake and affecting several physiological systems such as metabolism, behavior and the control of endocrine and autonomic functions. Previous studies showed that ghrelin participates in the stress response, acting on hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus neurons that express corticotropin-releasing hormone (PVNCRH neurons). In the present study, we investigated the effects of ghrelin administration on the behavioral responses to restraint stress in mice. In their homecage, C57Bl6 mice in basal conditions expressed the behaviors of surveying, walking, rearing, grooming and, to a lesser extent, digging, climbing and freezing. Restraint stress increased the time spent in grooming without significant changes in other behaviors. Ghrelin administration did not affect behavior in control mice, but it reversed the effect of restraint stress on grooming. Chemogenetic activation of PVNCRH neurons by clozapine N-Oxide (CNO) administration in hM3Dq DREADD mice increased grooming, while ghrelin mitigated this effect. In addition, CNO administration decreased walking and rearing, both in the presence or absence of ghrelin. Food intake was increased by ghrelin administration, however, it was not affected by stress or CNO. These results indicate that ghrelin decreases the activity of PVNCRH neurons, partially preventing the behavioral effects of restraint stress. The inhibitory input to PVNCRH neurons probably arrives from other nuclei, since GABAergic neurons were not identified in the PVN neurons of these mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Seeing social: A neural signature for conscious perception of social interactions</a></h4>

              
                Percepts of ambiguous information are subjective and depend on observers traits and mental states. Social information is some of the most ambiguous content we encounter in our daily lives, yet in experimental contexts, percepts of social interactions--i.e., whether an interaction is present and if so, the nature of that interaction--are often dichotomized as correct or incorrect based on experimenter-assigned labels. Here, we investigated the behavioral and neural correlates of conscious social perception using a large dataset in which neurotypical individuals viewed animations of geometric shapes during fMRI and indicated whether they perceived a social interaction or random motion. Critically, rather than experimenter-assigned labels, we used observers own reports of "Social" or "Non-social" to classify percepts and characterize brain activity, including leveraging a particularly ambiguous animation perceived as "Social" by some observers but "Non-social" by others to control for visual input. Observers were biased toward perceiving information as social (versus non-social), and activity across much of the brain was higher during animations ultimately perceived as social. Using "Unsure" reports, we identified several regions that responded parametrically to perceived socialness. Neural responses to social versus nonsocial content diverged early both in time and in the cortical hierarchy. Lastly, individuals with higher internalizing trait scores showed both a higher response bias towards social and an inverse relationship with activity in default-mode and limbic regions while scanning for social information. Findings underscore the subjective nature of social perception and the importance of using observer reports to study percepts of social interactions.

Significance StatementSimple animations involving two or more geometric shapes have been used as a gold standard to understand social cognition and impairments thereof. Yet experimenter-assigned labels of what is social versus non-social are frequently used as a ground truth, despite the fact that percepts of such ambiguous social stimuli are highly subjective. Here, we used behavioral and fMRI data from a large sample of neurotypical individuals to show that participants responses reveal subtle behavioral biases, help us study neural responses to social content more precisely, and covary with internalizing trait scores. Our findings underscore the subjective nature of social perception and the importance of considering observer reports in studying its behavioral and neural dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The encoding of touch by somatotopically aligned dorsal column subdivisions</a></h4>

              
                The somatosensory system decodes a range of tactile stimuli to generate a coherent sense of touch. Discriminative touch of the body depends on signals conveyed from peripheral mechanoreceptors to the brain via the spinal cord dorsal column and its brainstem target the dorsal column nuclei (DCN). Models of somatosensation emphasize that fast-conducting low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) innervating the skin drive the DCN. However, post-synaptic dorsal column neurons (PSDCs) within the spinal cord dorsal horn also collect mechanoreceptor signals and form a second major input to the DCN. The significance of PSDCs and their contributions to the coding of touch have remained unclear since their discovery. Here, we show that direct LTMR inputs to the DCN convey vibrotactile stimuli with high temporal precision, whereas PSDCs primarily encode touch onset and the intensity of sustained contact into the high force range. LTMR and PSDC signals topographically re-align in the DCN to preserve precise spatial detail. Different DCN neuron subtypes have specialized responses that are generated by unique combinations of LTMR and PSDC inputs. Thus, signals encoding different tactile features are conveyed by subdivisions of the dorsal column pathway and differentially converge in the DCN to generate unique ascending signals suited to distinct sensory processing streams.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A developmental pathway for epithelial-to-motoneuron transformation in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Motoneurons and motoneuron-like pancreatic beta cells arise from radial glia and ductal cells, both tube-lining progenitors that share molecular regulators. To uncover programs underlying motoneuron formation, we studied a similar, cell-division-independent transformation of the C. elegans tube-lining Y cell into the PDA motoneuron. We find that lin-12/Notch acts through ngn-1/Ngn and its regulator hlh-16/Olig to control transformation timing. lin-12 loss blocks transformation, while lin-12(gf) promotes precocious PDA formation. Early basal expression of both ngn-1/Ngn and hlh-16/Olig depends on sem-4/Sall and egl-5/Hox. Later, coincident with Y-cell morphological changes, ngn-1/Ngn expression is upregulated in a sem-4/Sall and egl-5/Hox-dependent but hlh-16/Olig-independent manner. Subsequently, Y-cell retrograde extension forms an anchored process priming PDA axon extension. Extension requires ngn-1-dependent expression of the cytoskeleton organizers UNC-119, UNC-44/ANK, and UNC-33/CRMP, which also, unexpectedly, activate PDA terminal-gene expression. Our findings reveal key cell-division-independent regulatory events leading to motoneuron generation, suggesting a conserved pathway for epithelial-to-motoneuron/motoneuron-like differentiation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Disruption of place cell remapping by scopolamine during aversive learning</a></h4>

              
                We performed in-vivo calcium imaging of hippocampal place cells in freely behaving rats (n=14) to investigate whether the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) antagonist scopolamine, which is known to impair aversive learning, also disrupts place cell remapping that occurs during such learning. CA1 neurons were imaged using a large-field-of view version of the UCLA miniscope (MiniLFOV) while rats performed a shock avoidance task on a rectangular maze. Drug-free avoidance training and extinction caused place cells to remap near the shocked location, in accordance with prior studies. Systemic pre-training injections of scopolamine (1 mg/kg) did not impair immediate shock avoidance, and also did not disrupt spatial tuning properties or shock-evoked responses of place cells during training. However, the drug impaired 48 h retention of avoidance and also prevented place cells from remapping near the shocked location. In addition, when rats navigated the maze on scopolamine, CA1 population vectors showed degraded between-session similarity with drug-free maze visits on prior days, suggesting that mAChR antagonism acutely degraded the fidelity with which stored hippocampal representations were retrieved. Based upon these results, we propose that scopolamine causes amnesia by degrading the dynamics of hippocampal memory retrieval at the population level, thereby shielding stored memory representations from being modified by experience to encode new memories of events that occur under the influence of the drug.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural Dynamics of Interoceptive Attention and Awareness: A Within-Participant fMRI Study</a></h4>

              
                Interoception, the representation of the body's internal state, serves as a foundation for emotion, motivation, and wellbeing. Yet despite its centrality in human experience, the neural mechanisms of interoception are poorly understood. The Interoceptive/Exteroceptive Attention Task (IEAT) is a novel neuroimaging paradigm that compares behavioral tracking of the respiratory cycle (Active Interoception) to tracking of a visual stimulus (Active Exteroception). Twenty-two healthy participants attended two separate scanning sessions (N=44 scans) during a randomized control trial of Mindful Awareness in Body-oriented Therapy (MABT). Compared to Active Exteroception, Active Interoception led to widespread cortical deactivation. Greater self-reported interoceptive awareness (MAIA scale) predicted sparing from deactivation along the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and left lateral prefrontal cortex. The right insula- typically described as a primary interoceptive cortex- was only specifically implicated by its deactivation during a paced respiration condition (Active Matching), relative to both Active Exteroception and Interoception. Instead, psychophysiological interaction analysis characterized Active Interoception as promoting greater ACC connectivity with lateral frontal and parietal regions commonly referred to as the Dorsal Attention Network. By comparing attention between highly accessible interoceptive and exteroceptive stimuli, these findings recast interoceptive attention as broadly inhibitory, linking greater interoceptive awareness to spared cortical inhibition within well-characterized attentional networks. In contrast to a literature that relates detection of liminal signals such as the heartbeat to anterior insula activity, attention towards accessible body sensations such as the breath may lead to a context of cortical inhibition in which sensory signals from the body may be better discerned.

                In this study, we used an oddball EEG bicycle paradigm to study how changes in urban environments elicit changes in EEG markers. Participants completed an auditory oddball task while riding in three different cycling lane environments. A low traffic condition where participants rode in a fully separated bike lane alongside a quiet residential street, an intermediate traffic condition where participants rode alongside a busy residential street in a painted lane, and a heavy traffic condition where participants rode alongside fast/heavy traffic on a shared-use path. Relative to the low traffic, heavy traffic was associated with faster reaction time and a trend towards reduced accuracy, and increased N1 amplitude evoked by the standard tones. We attribute this difference in N1 amplitude to different attentional demands evoked by the different traffic conditions. In this fashion, heavy traffic requires greater auditory filtering. Furthermore, we found no differences in P3 amplitude associated with the traffic conditions. We discuss the implications of mobile paradigms to study attention in real-world settings.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transmembrane protein 184B (TMEM184B) promotes expression of synaptic gene networks in the mouse hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                In Alzheimers Disease (AD) and other dementias, hippocampal synaptic dysfunction and loss contribute to the progression of memory impairment. Recent analysis of human AD transcriptomes has provided a list of gene candidates that may serve as drivers of disease. One such candidate is the membrane protein TMEM184B. To evaluate whether TMEM184B contributes to neurological impairment, we asked whether loss of TMEM184B in mice causes gene expression or behavior alterations, focusing on the hippocampus. Because one major risk factor for AD is age, we compared young adult (5-month-old) and aged (15-month-old) wild type and Tmem184b-mutant mice to assess the dual contributions of age and genotype. TMEM184B loss altered expression of pre- and post-synaptic transcripts by 5 months and continued through 15 months, specifically affecting genes involved in synapse assembly and neural development. Wnt-activated enhancer elements were enriched among differentially expressed genes, suggesting an intersection with this pathway. Few differences existed between young adult and aged mutants, suggesting that transcriptional effects of TMEM184B loss are relatively constant. To understand how TMEM184B disruption may impact behaviors, we evaluated memory using the novel object recognition test and anxiety using the elevated plus maze. Young adult Tmem184b-mutant mice show normal object discrimination, suggesting a lack of memory impairment at this age. However, mutant mice showed decreased anxiety, a phenotype seen in neurodevelopmental disorders. Taken together, our data suggest that TMEM184B is required for proper synaptic gene expression and function but may not be causal for AD and related dementias.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Gcm: a novel anti-inflammatory transcriptional cascade conserved from flies to humans</a></h4>

              
                Innate immunity is an ancestral process that can induce pro- and anti-inflammatory states. A major challenge is to characterise the transcriptional cascades that modulate the response to chronic and acute inflammatory challenges. The Drosophila melanogaster Gcm transcription factor represents an interesting candidate for its potential anti-inflammatory role. Here we explore its evolutionary conservation and its mode of action. We found that the murine ortholog Gcm2 (mGcm2) is expressed upon aging, which is considered as a state of chronic inflammation. mGcm2 is found in a subpopulation of microglia, the innate immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS). Its expression is also induced by a lyso-phosphatidylcholine (LPC)-induced CNS demyelination (acute inflammation) and mGcm2 conditional knock out mice show an increased inflammatory phenotype upon aging or LPC injection. In agreement with the role of this transcriptional cascade in inflammation, the human ortholog hGCM2 is expressed in active demyelinating lesions of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients. Finally, Drosophila gcm expression is induced upon aging as well as during an acute inflammatory response and its overexpression decreases the inflammatory phenotype. Altogether, our data show that the inducible Gcm pathway is highly conserved from flies up to humans and represents a potential therapeutic anti-inflammatory target in the control of the inflammatory response.

                Alpha-synuclein (aSyn) is a pre-synaptic monomeric protein that can form aggregates in neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD), Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and in oligodendrocytes in multiple system atrophy (MSA). Although the accumulation of aSyn in astrocytes has previously been described in PD, PDD and DLB, the biochemical properties of aSyn in this type of pathology and its topographical distribution have not been studied in detail. Here, we present a systematic investigation of aSyn astrocytic pathology, using an expanded toolset of antibodies covering the entire sequence and known post-translational modifications (PTMs) of aSyn in Lewy body (LB) disorders, including sporadic PD, PDD, DLB, familial PD with SNCA G51D mutation and SNCA duplication, and in MSA. Astrocytic aSyn was mainly detected in the limbic cortical regions of LB disorders, but were absent in key pathological regions of MSA. These astrocytic aSyn accumulations were detected only with aSyn antibodies against the mid N-terminal and non-amyloid component (NAC) regions covering aSyn residues 34-99. The astroglial accumulations were negative to canonical aSyn aggregation markers, including p62, ubiquitin and aSyn pS129, but positive for phosphorylated and nitrated forms of aSyn at Tyrosine 39 (Y39), and mostly not resistant to proteinase K. Our findings suggest that astrocytic aSyn accumulations are a major part of aSyn pathology in LB disorders, and possess a distinct sequence and PTM signature that is characterized by both N- and C-terminal truncations and modifications at Y39. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of aSyn accumulation made solely from N- and C-terminally cleaved aSyn species and the first report demonstrating that astrocytic aSyn exists as a mixture of Y39 phosphorylated and nitrated species. These observations underscore the critical importance of systematic characterization of aSyn accumulation in different cell types as a necessary step to capturing the diversity of aSyn species and pathology in the brain. Our findings combined with further studies on the role of astrocytic pathology in the progression of LB disorders can pave the way towards identifying novel disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Plasticity-induced actin polymerization in the dendritic shaft regulates intracellular AMPA receptor trafficking</a></h4>

              
                AMPA-type receptors (AMPARs) are rapidly inserted into synapses undergoing long-term potentiation (LTP) to increase synaptic transmission, but how AMPAR-containing vesicles are selectively trafficked to these synapses during LTP is not known. Here we developed a strategy to label AMPAR GluA1 subunits expressed from the endogenous loci of rat hippocampal neurons such that the motion of GluA1-containing vesicles in time-lapse sequences can be characterized using single-particle tracking and mathematical modeling. We find that GluA1-containing vesicles are confined and concentrated near sites of stimulation-induced plasticity. We show that confinement is mediated by actin polymerization, which hinders the active transport of GluA1-containing vesicles along the length of the dendritic shaft by modulating the rheological properties of the cytoplasm. Actin polymerization also facilitates myosin-mediated transport of GluA1-containing vesicles to exocytic sites. We conclude that neurons utilize F-actin to increase vesicular GluA1 reservoirs and promote exocytosis proximal to the sites of neuronal activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Syntaxin1 Ser14 Phosphorylation is Required for Non-Vesicular Dopamine Release</a></h4>

              
                Amphetamine (AMPH), a psychostimulant commonly prescribed for the treatment of neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders, has a high liability for abuse. The abuse and psychomotor stimulant properties of AMPH are primarily associated with its ability to increase dopamine (DA) neurotransmission. This increase is mediated, in large part, by non-vesicular DA release (DA efflux). DA efflux is the result of reversal of the DA transporter (DAT) promoted by AMPH. Syntaxin 1 (Stx1) is a SNARE protein that plays a pivotal role in vesicular release. Previously, we have shown that Stx1 also interacts with the distal DAT N-terminus, an event promoted by AMPH. Stx1 is phosphorylated at Ser14 by casein kinase II (CK2). Using Drosophila Melanogaster as an animal model, we show that this phosphorylation event is critical for non-vesicular DA release and regulates the expression of AMPH preference as well as the ability of AMPH to promote mating drive. We also show that reverse transport of DA mediated by DAT underlies these complex behaviors promoted by AMPH. Our molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the phosphorylated DAT/Stx1 complex demonstrate that the phosphorylation state of these proteins plays a key role in allowing DAT to dwell in an efflux-willing state. This state also supports constitutive DA efflux (CDE), an event that occurs in the absence of AMPH. The DAT-Stx1 phosphorylated complex is characterized by the breakdown of two key salt bridges in DAT, K66-D345 and E428-R445, which are critical for the formation of the intracellular (IC) gate and for transport function. The breaking of these salt bridges leads to an opening and hydration of the DAT intracellular vestibule, allowing DA to bind from the cytosol, a mechanism that we hypothesize leads to CDE. We further determine the importance of Stx1 phosphorylation in CDE by pharmacologically inhibiting CK2 with CX-4945, a molecule currently in phase II clinical trials for cancer treatment. CX-4945 treatment prevented the expression of CDE in isolated Drosophila Melanogaster brains as well as behaviors associated with CDE. Thus, our results suggest that Stx1 phosphorylation is a possible pharmacological target for the treatment of AMPH abuse.

                Sensory neurons gather information about mechanical forces from both the environment and internal organs to regulate physiology. PIEZO2 is a mechanosensory ion channel critical for touch, proprioception and bladder stretch sensation, yet its broad expression in sensory neurons and elsewhere suggests it may have undiscovered physiological roles. To fully understand mechanosensory physiology, we must know where and when PIEZO2-expressing neurons detect force. The fluorescent styryl dye FM 1-43 was shown to permeate several ion channels in cell culture and label sensory neurons. Surprisingly, we find that the vast majority of FM 1-43 somatosensory neuron labeling in vivo is dependent on PIEZO2-activity within nerve endings. We illustrate the potential of FM 1-43 by using it to identify novel Piezo2-expressing urethral neurons that are engaged by urination. These data reveal that FM 1-43 is a functional probe for mechanosensitivity via PIEZO2 activation in vivo and will facilitate the characterization of known and novel mechanosensory processes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Seeing and Extrapolating motion trajectories share common informative activation patterns in primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                The natural environment is dynamic and moving objects become constantly occluded, engaging the brain in a challenging completion process to estimate where and when the object might reappear. Although motion extrapolation is critical in daily life - imagine crossing the street while an approaching car is occluded by a larger standing vehicle - its neural underpinnings are still not well understood. While the engagement of low-level visual cortex during dynamic occlusion has been postulated, most of the previous group-level fMRI-studies failed to find evidence for an involvement of low-level visual areas during occlusion. In this fMRI-study, we therefore used individually-defined retinotopic maps and multivariate pattern analysis to characterize the neural basis of visible and occluded motion in humans. To this end, participants learned velocity-direction pairings (slow motion-upwards; fast motion-downwards or vice versa) during a training phase without occlusion and judged the stimulus direction, based on its velocity, during a following test phase with occlusion. We find that occluded motion direction can be predicted from the activity patterns during visible motion within low-level visual areas, supporting the notion of a mental representation of motion trajectory in these regions during occlusion.

Highlights* Dynamically occluded information is processed in low-level visual cortex
* Specific regions inside low-level visual areas encode visible and dynamically occluded information
* Overlap of visible and occluded informative activity patterns in the visual field suggest shared computational circuits in primary visual cortex

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functional imaging and quantification of multi-neuronal olfactory responses in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Many animals perceive odorant molecules by collecting information from ensembles of olfactory neurons. These neurons employ receptors that are tuned to recognize odorant molecules by chemical binding affinity. Olfactory systems are able, in principle, to detect and discriminate large numbers of odorants by using combinatorial coding strategies. Multineuronal imaging, combined with high-throughput stimulus delivery, allow for the comprehensive measurement of ensemble-level sensory representations. Here, we used microfluidics and multineuronal imaging to study olfactory representations at the sensory periphery of the nematode C. elegans. The collective activity of chemosensory neurons in C. elegans reveals high-dimensional representations of olfactory information across a broad space of odorant molecules. We reveal diverse tuning properties and dose-response curves across chemosensory neurons and across odorant molecules. We describe the unique contribution of each sensory neuron to an ensemble-level olfactory code, and show how the encoding of a set of natural stimuli, nematode pheromones, differs from the encoding of small volatile organic molecules. The integrated activity of the sensory periphery of C. elegans contains sufficient information to robustly encode the intensity and identity of a broad panel of odorants.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Orientation control strategies and adaptation to a visuomotor perturbation in rotational hand movements</a></h4>

              
                Computational approaches to biological motor control are used to discover the building blocks of human motor behavior. Models explaining features of human hand movements have been studied thoroughly, yet only a few studies attempted to explain the control of the orientation of the hand; instead, they mainly focus on the control of hand translation, predominantly in a single plane. In this study, we aimed to establish a basic understanding of the way humans control the orientation of their hands. We developed a quaternion-based score that quantifies the geodicity of rotational hand movements and evaluated it experimentally. In the first experiment participants performed a simple orientation-matching task with a robotic manipulator. We found that rotations are generally performed by following a geodesic in the quaternion hypersphere, which suggests that, similarly to translation, the orientation of the hand is centrally controlled. We also established a baseline for the study of human response to perturbed visual feedback of the orientation of the hand. In the subsequent second experiment we studied the adaptation of participants to visuomotor rotation that is applied on the hand's rotation, and the transfer of the adaptation to a different initial orientation. We observed partial adaptation to the perturbation. The patterns of the transfer of the adaptation to a different initial orientation were consistent with the representation of the orientation in extrinsic coordinates. The results of the two experiments raise questions regarding the nature of central control of hand orientation. Discussion and intuitions from these results can be of benefit for many applications that involve fine manipulation of rigid bodies, such as teleoperation and neurorehabilitation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Response of sleep slow oscillations to acoustic stimulation is evidenced by distinctive synchronization processes</a></h4>

              
                Closed loop acoustic stimulation (CLAS) during sleep has shown to boost slow wave (SW) amplitude and spindle power. Moreover, sleep SW are suggested to be classified based on different processes of neuronal synchronization. Following this, different types of SW events may have distinct functional roles and be differentially affected by external stimuli. However, the SW synchronization processes affected by CLAS are not well understood. Here, we studied the effect of CLAS on the dissociation of SW events based on two features of neuronal synchronization in the EEG (topological spread and wave slope). We evaluated and classified individual SW events of fourteen healthy subjects during a CLAS stimulated (STM) and a control night (CNT). Three main categories of SW events were found denoting (C1) steep-slope SW with global spread, (C2) flat-slope waves with localized spread and homeostatic regulation, and (C3) multipeaked flat-slope events with global spread. Comparing between conditions, we found a consistent increase of event proportion and trough amplitudes for C1 events during the time of stimulation. Furthermore, we found similar increases in post-stimulus spectral power in {theta}, {beta} and {sigma} frequencies for CNT vs STIM condition independently of sleep stage or SW categories. However, topological analysis showed differentiated spatial dynamics in N2 and N3 for SW categories and the co-occurrence with spindle events. Our findings reveal the nature of post-stimulus SW and suggest that CLAS boosts SW amplitudes by increasing neuronal synchronization of wave troughs, leading thus the post-stimulus SW-spindle co-occurrence.

                Secretin activates brown adipose tissue (BAT) and induces satiation in both mice and humans. However, the exact brain mechanism of this satiety inducing, secretin-mediated gut-BAT-brain axis is unknown. In this placebo-controlled, single-blinded neuroimaging study, firstly using [18F]FDG-PET measures (n = 15), we established that secretin modulated brain glucose consumption through the BAT-brain axis. Predominantly, we found that BAT and caudate glucose uptake levels were negatively correlated (r = -0.54, p = 0.037) during secretin but not placebo condition. Then, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI; n = 14), we found that secretin down-regulated the brain response to appetizing food images and improved inhibitory control. Finally, in a PET-fMRI fusion analysis (n = 10), we disclosed the patterned correspondence between caudate glucose uptake and neuroactivity to reward and inhibition, showing that the secretin-induced neurometabolic coupling pattern promoted satiation. These findings suggest that secretin modulates the BAT-brain metabolic crosstalk and subsequent neurometabolic coupling to induce satiation, bearing potential clinical benefits for treating eating disorders.

Significance of the studySecretin activates brown adipose tissue and induces satiation, but the underlying brain mechanisms are still unclear. This placebo-controlled PET-fMRI study uses brain metabolic and BOLD measures to dissect the modulatory effects of secretin on brain functions associative to satiation. Findings show that secretin i) modulates caudate glucose metabolism via the BAT-brain axis, ii) enhances BOLD response in inhibitory control, and iii) reduces reward-related BOLD response. Further evidence shows that these measured effects are tightly linked via the secretin-mediated brain neurometabolic coupling. This study significantly advances our knowledge on how secretin leads to satiation and highlights the potential role of secretin in treating eating disorders and obesity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Gaze onsets during naturalistic infant-caregiver interaction associate with 'sender' but not 'receiver' neural responses, and do not lead to changes in inter-brain synchrony.</a></h4>

              
                Temporal coordination during infant-caregiver social interaction is thought to be crucial for supporting early language acquisition and cognitive development. Despite a growing prevalence of theories suggesting that increased inter-brain synchrony associates with many key aspects of social interactions such as mutual gaze, little is known about how this arises during development. Here, we investigated the role of mutual gaze onsets as a potential driver of inter-brain synchrony. We extracted dual EEG activity around naturally occurring gaze onsets during infant-caregiver social interactions in N=55 dyads (mean age 12 months). We differentiated between two types of gaze onset, depending on each partners role.  Sender gaze onsets were defined at a time when either the adult or the infant made a gaze shift towards their partner at a time when their partner was either already looking at them (mutual) or not looking at them (non-mutual).  Receiver gaze onsets were defined at a time when their partner made a gaze shift towards them at a time when either the adult or the infant was already looking at their partner (mutual) or not (non-mutual). Contrary to our hypothesis we found that, during a naturalistic interaction, both mutual and non-mutual gaze onsets were associated with changes in the sender, but not the receivers brain activity and were not associated with increases in inter-brain synchrony above baseline. Further, we found that mutual, compared to non-mutual gaze onsets were not associated with increased inter brain synchrony. Overall, our results suggest that the effects of mutual gaze are strongest at the intra-brain level, in the  sender but not the  receiver of the mutual gaze.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Change point estimation by the mouse medial frontal cortex during probabilistic reward learning</a></h4>

              
                There are often sudden changes in the state of environment. For a decision maker, accurate prediction and detection of change points are crucial for optimizing performance. Still unclear, however, is whether rodents are simply reactive to reinforcements, or if they can be proactive to estimate future change points during value-based decision making. In this study, we characterize head-fixed mice performing a two-armed bandit task with probabilistic reward reversals. Choice behavior deviates from classic reinforcement learning, but instead suggests a strategy involving belief updating, consistent with the anticipation of change points to exploit the task structure. Excitotoxic lesion and optogenetic inactivation implicate the anterior cingulate and premotor regions of medial frontal cortex. Specifically, over-estimation of hazard rate arises from imbalance across frontal hemispheres during the time window before the choice is made. Collectively, the results demonstrate that mice can capitalize on their knowledge of task regularities, and this estimation of future changes in the environment may be a main computational function of the rodent dorsal medial frontal cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Human ability to initiate reflexive eye movements towards unseen targets without the primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Blindsight patients who have a visual field loss due to a lesion in primary visual cortex (V1) can shift their gaze to stimuli presented in their blind visual field, but the extent to which this is a residual capacity that is not affected by the lesion or caused by neural reorganization is open. Using retinotopically navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of primary visual cortex (V1; Experiment 1, N = 9) and metacontrast masking (Experiment 2, N = 13), we examined the ability of neurologically healthy individuals to make saccadic eye movements to visual stimuli they report being unconscious of. In both experiments we observed that participants could initiate saccades towards targets they reported not seeing, but in TMS experiment, this happened only on a small proportion ([~]8%) of unconscious trials. Because saccades towards reportedly unconscious stimuli could be initiated despite V1 TMS, the results suggest that the process may be independent of V1. That said, signal detection theoretic measures suggested that in the TMS experiment, saccades towards reportedly unconscious stimuli may have been based on weak conscious experiences. With both TMS and metacontrast masking, reduced visibility of stimuli was associated with slower and less precise gaze shift. Our results indicate that in neurologically healthy individuals, visual stimuli can trigger saccadic gaze shifts even when the target is reported not consciously perceived, although the reliability, accuracy, and speed of such saccades is inferior when compared to saccades initiated in response to consciously perceived targets.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Signal Transformations and New Timing Rules of Hippocampal CA3 to CA1 Synapses</a></h4>

              
                The synapse is the fundamental unit of communication in the nervous system. Determining how information is transferred across the synaptic interface is one of the most complex endeavors in neuroscience, owing to the large number of contributing factors and events. An approach to solving this problem involves collapsing across these complexities to derive concise mathematical formulas that fully capture the governing dynamics of synaptic transmission. We investigated the feasibility of deriving such a formula - an input-output transformation function for the CA3 to CA1 node of the hippocampus -- using the Volterra expansion technique for nonlinear system identification. The entirety of the field EPSP in the apical dendrites of mouse brain slices was described with >94% accuracy by a 2nd order equation that captured the linear and nonlinear influence of past inputs on current outputs. This function generalized to cases not included in its derivation and uncovered previously undetected timing rules. The basal dendrites expressed a substantially different transfer function and evidence was obtained that, unlike the apical system, a 3rd order system or higher will be needed for complete characterization. Collectively, these results describe a readily implemented and unusually sensitive means for evaluating the effects of pharmacological treatments and disease related conditions on synaptic dynamics. At scale, the approach will also provide information needed for the construction of biologically realistic models of brain networks.

	<p>Our brain continuously interacts with the body as we engage with the world. Although we are mostly unaware of internal bodily processes, such as our heartbeats, they may be influenced by and in turn influence our perception and emotional feelings. Although there is a recent focus on understanding cardiac interoceptive activity and interaction with brain activity during emotion processing, the investigation of cardiac&amp;amp;ndash;brain interactions with more ecologically valid naturalistic emotional stimuli is still very limited. We also do not understand how an essential aspect of emotions, such as context familiarity, influences affective feelings and is linked to statistical interaction between cardiac and brain activity. Hence, to answer these questions, we designed an exploratory study by recording ECG and EEG signals for the emotional events while participants were watching emotional movie clips. Participants also rated their familiarity with the stimulus on the familiarity scale. Linear mixed effect modelling was performed in which the ECG power and familiarity were considered as predictors of EEG power. We focused on three brain regions, including prefrontal (PF), frontocentral (FC) and parietooccipital (PO). The analyses showed that the interaction between the power of cardiac activity in the mid-frequency range and the power in specific EEG bands is dependent on familiarity, such that the interaction is stronger with high familiarity. In addition, the results indicate that arousal is predicted by cardiac&amp;amp;ndash;brain interaction, which also depends on familiarity. The results support emotional theories that emphasize context dependency and interoception. Multimodal studies with more realistic stimuli would further enable us to understand and predict different aspects of emotional experience.</p>

	<p>Inter-brain synchronization is primarily investigated during social interactions but had not been examined during coupled muscle action between two persons until now. It was previously shown that mechanical muscle oscillations can develop coherent behavior between two isometrically interacting persons. This case study investigated if inter-brain synchronization appears thereby, and if differences of inter- and intrapersonal muscle and brain coherence exist regarding two different types of isometric muscle action. Electroencephalography (EEG) and mechanomyography/mechanotendography (MMG/MTG) of right elbow extensors were recorded during six fatiguing trials of two coupled isometrically interacting participants (70% MVIC). One partner performed holding and one pushing isometric muscle action (HIMA/PIMA; tasks changed). The wavelet coherence of all signals (EEG, MMG/MTG, force, ACC) were analyzed intra- and interpersonally. The five longest coherence patches in 8&amp;amp;ndash;15 Hz and their weighted frequency were compared between real vs. random pairs and between HIMA vs. PIMA. Real vs. random pairs showed significantly higher coherence for intra-muscle, intra-brain, and inter-muscle-brain activity (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001 to 0.019). Inter-brain coherence was significantly higher for real vs. random pairs for EEG of right and central areas and for sub-regions of EEG left (p = 0.002 to 0.025). Interpersonal muscle-brain synchronization was significantly higher than intrapersonal one, whereby it was significantly higher for HIMA vs. PIMA. These preliminary findings indicate that inter-brain synchronization can arise during muscular interaction. It is hypothesized both partners merge into one oscillating neuromuscular system. The results reinforce the hypothesis that HIMA is characterized by more complex control strategies than PIMA. The pilot study suggests investigating the topic further to verify these results on a larger sample size. Findings could contribute to the basic understanding of motor control and is relevant for functional diagnostics such as the manual muscle test which is applied in several disciplines, e.g., neurology, physiotherapy.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Human genomics established that pathogenic variation in diverse genes can underlie a single disorder. For example, hereditary spastic paraplegia is associated with &gt;80 genes, with frequently only few affected individuals described for each gene. Herein, we characterize a large cohort of individuals with biallelic variation in <i>ENTPD1</i>, a gene previously linked to spastic paraplegia 64 (Mendelian Inheritance in Man # 615683).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Individuals with biallelic <i>ENTPD1</i> variants were recruited worldwide. Deep phenotyping and molecular characterization were performed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 27 individuals from 17 unrelated families were studied; additional phenotypic information was collected from published cases. Twelve novel pathogenic <i>ENTPD1</i> variants are described (NM 001776.6): c.398_399delinsAA; p.(Gly133Glu), c.540del; p.(Thr181Leufs*18), c.640del; p.(Gly216Glufs*75), c.185 T &gt; G; p.(Leu62*), c.1531 T &gt; C; p.(*511Glnext*100), c.967C &gt; T; p.(Gln323*), c.414-2_414-1del, and c.146 A &gt; G; p.(Tyr49Cys) including 4 recurrent variants c.1109 T &gt; A; p.(Leu370*), c.574-6_574-3del, c.770_771del; p.(Gly257Glufs*18), and c.1041del; p.(Ile348Phefs*19). Shared disease traits include childhood onset, progressive spastic paraplegia, intellectual disability (ID), dysarthria, and white matter abnormalities. <i>In vitro</i> assays demonstrate that <i>ENTPD1</i> expression and function are impaired and that c.574-6_574-3del causes exon skipping. Global metabolomics demonstrate <i>ENTPD1</i> deficiency leads to impaired nucleotide, lipid, and energy metabolism.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The <i>ENTPD1</i> locus trait consists of childhood disease onset, ID, progressive spastic paraparesis, dysarthria, dysmorphisms, and white matter abnormalities, with some individuals showing neurocognitive regression. Investigation of an allelic series of <i>ENTPD1</i> (1) expands previously described features of <i>ENTPD1</i>-related neurological disease, (2) highlights the importance of genotype-driven deep phenotyping, (3) documents the need for global collaborative efforts to characterize rare autosomal recessive disease traits, and (4) provides insights into disease trait neurobiology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Long-range alpha-synchronisation as control signal for BCI: A feasibility study</a></h4>

              
                Shifts in spatial attention are associated with variations in alpha-band (, 8-14 Hz) activity, specifically in inter-hemispheric imbalance. The underlying mechanism is attributed to local -synchronisation, which regulates local inhibition of neural excitability, as well as fronto-parietal synchronisation reflecting long-range communication. The direction-specific nature of this neural correlate brings forward its potential as a control signal in brain-computer interfaces (BCI). In the present study we explored whether long-range -synchronisation presents lateralised patterns dependent on voluntary attention orienting, and whether these patterns can be picked up at single-trial level to provide a control signal for active BCI. We collected electroencephalography (EEG) data from a cohort of healthy adults (n = 10) while performing a covert visuospatial attention (CVSA) task. The data show lateralised patterns of -band phase coupling between frontal and parieto-occipital regions after target presentation, replicating previous findings. This pattern, however, was not evident during the cue-target orienting interval, the ideal time window for BCI. Furthermore, decoding the direction of attention trial-by-trial from cue-locked synchronisation with support vector machine (SVM) was at chance-level. The present findings suggest limitations of EEG to detect long-range -synchronisation in attentional orienting at the single-trial and, thus, its limitation as a reliable signal for BCI control.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Taste cues elicit prolonged modulation of feeding behavior in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Taste cues regulate immediate feeding behavior, but their ability to modulate future behavior has been less well-studied. Pairing one taste with another can modulate subsequent feeding responses through associative learning, but this requires simultaneous exposure to both stimuli. We investigated whether exposure to one taste modulates future responses to other tastes even when they do not overlap in time. Using Drosophila, we found that brief exposure to sugar enhanced future feeding responses, whereas bitter exposure suppressed them. This modulation relies on neural pathways distinct from those that acutely regulate feeding or mediate learning-dependent changes. Sensory neuron activity was required not only during initial taste exposure but also afterward, suggesting that ongoing sensory activity may maintain experience-dependent changes in downstream circuits. Thus, the brain stores a memory of each taste stimulus after it disappears, enabling animals to integrate information as they sequentially sample different taste cues that signal local food quality.

                Microelectrode arrays (MEA) hold great promise for a broad range of applications that require reliable char-acterization of the growth and function of neurons in culture. Widespread adoption of this platform depends on analytical methods to extract meaning from highly variable and noisy observations. In analyzing a comprehensive database of MEA recordings, we discovered that 22% of the electrodes presented systematic patterns of under- or non-detection of spike activity. Going undetected, principal components analysis (PCA) of these data reveal trends that would have lead to incorrect biological interpretations. We fully document these defective or biased electrodes, and distinguish two forms of defectiveness, via rep-resentations that aid in detecting them. We also showcase our approach for analyzing these data that permit for post-analytic review and correction. Repeating our PCA on cleaned data, we discover a more complex interplay of biological variability. Finally, we make a case for transparency in data reporting and propose best practices for experimental and analysis phases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differences in non-linearities determine retinal cell types</a></h4>

              
                Classifying neurons in different types is still an open challenge. In the retina, recent works have taken advantage of the ability to record a large number of cells to classify ganglion cells into different types based on functional information. While the first attempts in this direction used the receptive field properties of each cell to classify them, more recent approaches have proposed to cluster ganglion cells directly based on their response to standard stimuli. These two approaches have not been compared directly. Here we recorded the responses of a large number of ganglion cells and compared two methods for classifying them into types, one based on the receptive field properties, and the other one using their responses to standard stimuli. We show that the stimulus based approach allows separating more types than the receptive field-based method, leading to a better classification. This better granularity is due to the fact that the stimulus-based method takes into account not only the linear part of ganglion cell function, but also non-linearities. A careful characterization of non-linear processing is thus key to allow functional classification of sensory neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Unifying model for three forms of contextual modulation including feedback input from higher visual areas</a></h4>

              
                Neural responses to a localized visual stimulus are modulated by the content of its surrounding. This phenomenon manifests in several forms of contextual modulation, including three interrelated properties of the visual cortex: surround suppression, inverse response and surround facilitation. We devise a unified biologically realistic circuit model accounting for all these phenomena and show that i) surround suppression in L2/3 is only partially due to the recruitment of lateral inhibition; ii) long-range feedback projections are necessary for inverse response and iii) the width of the response profile in the feedback layer determines inverse size tuning. The model predicts the modulations induced by silencing somatostatin-expressing cells or higher visual areas or changing the stimulus contrast. These predictions are consistent with the experimental observations when available and can be tested in existing setups otherwise. We then show the robustness of the identified mechanisms in a model with three interneuron subclasses, built to fit the classical responses and able to predict inverse size-tuning curves.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A topography-based predictive framework for naturalistic viewing fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Recent work has shown great interest in understanding individual differences in complex brain function under naturalistic viewing (NV) conditions. However, methods specifically designed for achieving this goal remain limited. Here, we propose a novel approach, called TOpography-based Predictive Framework (TOPF), to investigate individual differences in evoked brain activity on NV fMRI data. Specifically, TOPF identifies individual-specific evoked activity topographies in a data-driven manner and examines their behavioural relevance using a machine learning predictive framework. Our results show that these topographies successfully predict individual phenotypes across cognition, emotion and personality on unseen subjects, and the identified predictive brain regions are neurobiologically interpretable. Further, the prediction accuracy exceeds that of the commonly-used functional connectivity-based features. Conceptually, we highlight the importance of examining multivariate evoked activity patterns for studying brain-behaviour relationships. In summary, we provide a powerful tool for understanding individual differences and brain-behaviour relationships on NV fMRI data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reduced memory precision in older age is associated with functional and structural differences in the angular gyrus</a></h4>

              
                Growing evidence indicates decreased fidelity of mnemonic representations to play a role in age-related episodic memory deficits, yet the brain mechanisms underlying such reductions remain unexplored. Using functional and structural neuroimaging and a continuous report task we examined how changes in two key nodes of the posterior-medial memory network, the hippocampus and the angular gyrus, might underpin loss of memory precision in older age. An age-related reduction in activity reflecting successful memory retrieval was observed in the hippocampus, whereas activity associated with graded variation in memory precision was decreased in the angular gyrus. Grey matter volume of the angular gyrus further predicted individual differences in memory precision in older age, beyond variation in successful memory retrieval. These findings highlight the importance of functional and structural integrity of the angular gyrus in constraining memory precision in older age, advancing current understanding of hippocampal and parietal contributions to age-related episodic memory decline.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High frequency DBS-like optogenetic stimulation of nucleus accumbens dopamine D2 receptor-containing neurons attenuates cocaine reinstatement in male rats</a></h4>

              
                Background: Previous work indicated that deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus accumbens shell in male rats attenuated reinstatement of cocaine seeking, an animal model of craving. However, the potential differential impact of DBS on specific populations of neurons to drive the suppression of cocaine seeking is unknown. Medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens are differentiated by expression of dopamine D1 receptors (D1DRs) or D2DRs, activation of which promotes or inhibits cocaine-related behaviors, respectively. The advent of transgenic rat lines expressing Cre recombinase selectively in D1DR-containing or D2DR-containing neurons, when coupled with Cre-dependent virally mediated gene transfer of channelrhodopsin (ChR2), enabled mimicry of DBS in a selective subpopulation of neurons during complex tasks. Hypothesis: We tested the hypothesis that high frequency DBS-like optogenetic stimulation of D1DR-containing neurons in the accumbens shell would potentiate, whereas stimulation of D2DR-containing neurons in the accumbens shell would attenuate, cocaine-primed reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Results: Results indicated that high frequency, DBS-like optogenetic stimulation of D2DR-containing neurons attenuated reinstatement of cocaine seeking in male rats, whereas DBS-like optogenetic stimulation of D1DR-containing neurons did not alter cocaine-primed reinstatement. Surprisingly, DBS-like optogenetic stimulation did not alter reinstatement of cocaine seeking in female rats. In rats which only expressed eYFP, intra-accumbens optogenetic stimulation did not alter cocaine reinstatement relative to sham stimulation, indicating that the effect of DBS-like stimulation to attenuate cocaine reinstatement is mediated specifically by ChR2 rather than consequent to prolonged light delivery. Conclusions: These results suggest that DBS of the accumbens attenuates cocaine-primed reinstatement in male rats through the selective manipulation of D2DR-containing neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An essential experimental control for functional connectivity mapping with optogenetics</a></h4>

              
                To establish functional connectivity between two candidate neurons that might form a circuit element, a common approach is to activate an optogenetic tool such as Chrimson in the candidate pre-synaptic neuron and monitor fluorescence of the calcium-sensitive indicator GCaMP in a candidate post-synaptic neuron. While performing such experiments, we found that low levels of leaky Chrimson expression can lead to strong artifactual GCaMP signals in presumptive postsynaptic neurons even when Chrimson is not intentionally expressed in any particular neurons. Withholding all-trans retinal, the chromophore required as a co-factor for Chrimson response to light, eliminates GCaMP signal but does not provide an experimental control for leaky Chrimson expression. Leaky Chrimson expression appears to be an inherent feature of current Chrimson transgenes, since artifactual connectivity was detected with Chrimson transgenes integrated into three different genomic locations (two insertions tested in larvae; a third insertion tested in the adult fly). These false-positive signals may complicate the interpretation of functional connectivity experiments. We illustrate how a no-Gal4 negative control improves interpretability of functional connectivity assays. We also propose a simple but effective procedure to identify experimental conditions that minimize potentially incorrect interpretations caused by leaky Chrimson expression.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The right inferior frontal gyrus as pivotal node and effective regulator of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical response inhibition circuit in humans</a></h4>

              
                The involvement of specific basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits in response inhibition has been extensively mapped in animal models. However, the pivotal nodes and directed casual regulation within this inhibitory circuit in humans remains controversial. Here, we capitalize on the recent progress in robust and biologically plausible directed causal modelling (DCM-PEB) and a large response inhibition dataset (n=218; 104 males) acquired with concomitant functional fMRI to determine key nodes, their causal regulation and modulation via biological variables (sex) and inhibitory performance in the inhibitory circuit encompassing the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG), caudate nucleus (rCau), globus pallidum (rGP) and thalamus (rThal). The entire neural circuit exhibited high intrinsic connectivity and response inhibition critically increased causal projections from the rIFG to both rCau and rThal. Direct comparison further demonstrated that response inhibition induced an increasing rIFG inflow and increased the causal regulation of this region over the rCau and rThal. In addition, sex and performance influenced the architecture of the regulatory circuits such that women displayed increased rThal self-inhibition and decreased rThal to GP modulation, while better inhibitory performance was associated with stronger rThal to rIFG communication. Furthermore, control analyses did not reveal a similar key communication in a left lateralized model. Together these findings indicate a pivotal role of the rIFG as input and causal regulator of subcortical response inhibition nodes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Development and validation of an expanded antibody toolset that captures alpha-synuclein pathological diversity in Lewy body diseases</a></h4>

              
                The abnormal aggregation and accumulation of alpha-synuclein (aSyn) in the brain is a defining hallmark of synucleinopathies. An increasing number of studies show that aSyn in pathological aggregates exists as a complex mixture of various post-translationally modified forms and conformations. The distribution of these different species changes during disease progression and varies among the different synucleinopathies. Current approaches for detecting aSyn in human tissues and disease models rely on a limited set of antibodies that have not been thoroughly assessed for their ability to capture the diversity of aSyn proteoforms and aggregation states, and thus are unlikely to provide a complete estimation of aSyn pathology in the brain. To address these challenges, we developed, validated, and characterized an expanded set of antibodies that target different sequences and post-translational modifications (PTMs) along the entire length of aSyn, and recognize all conformations of the protein (monomers, oligomers and fibrils). We demonstrate that the use of multiple antibodies targeting different regions on aSyn is necessary to reveal the heterogeneity of aSyn pathology in human Lewy body disease (LBD) brains, and in neuronal and animal models of aSyn aggregation and inclusion formation. We also present, for the first time, the profiling of aSyn pathology using antibodies against all its key post-translationally modified forms across sporadic and familial LBDs. The antibody validation pipeline we describe here paves the way for a more systematic investigation of the diversity of aSyn pathology in the human brain and peripheral tissues, and in cellular and animal models of synucleinopathies.

                To elucidate the role of the basal ganglia during REM sleep movements in Parkinson's disease (PD) we recorded pallidal neural activity from four PD patients. Unlike desynchronization commonly observed during wakeful movements, beta oscillations (13-35 Hz) synchronized during REM sleep movements; furthermore, high-frequency oscillations (150-350 Hz) synchronized during movement irrespective of sleep-wake states. Our results demonstrate differential engagement of the basal ganglia during REM sleep and awake movements.

	<p>Recent studies demonstrated that pyroptosis plays a crucial role in shaping the tumor-immune microenvironment. However, the influence of pyroptosis on lower-grade glioma regarding immunotherapy and targeted therapy is still unknown. This study analyzed the variations of 33 pyroptosis-related genes in lower-grade glioma and normal tissues. Our study found considerable genetic and expression alterations in heterogeneity among lower-grade gliomas and normal brain tissues. There are two pyroptosis phenotypes in lower-grade glioma, and they exhibited differences in cell infiltration characteristics and clinical characters. Then, a PyroScore model using the lasso-cox method was constructed to measure the level of pyroptosis in each patient. PyroScore can refine the lower-grade glioma patients with a stratified prognosis and a distinct tumor immune microenvironment. Pyscore may also be an effective factor in predicting potential therapeutic benefits. In silico analysis showed that patients with a lower PyroScore are expected to be more sensitive to targeted therapy and immunotherapy. These findings may enhance our understanding of pyroptosis in lower-grade glioma and might help optimize risk stratification for the survival and personalized management of lower-grade glioma patients.</p>

	<p>Gait deficits are often persistent after stroke, and current rehabilitation methods do not restore normal gait for everyone. Targeted methods of focused gait therapy that meet the individual needs of each stroke survivor are needed. Our objective was to develop and test a combination protocol of simultaneous brain stimulation and focused stance phase training for people with chronic stroke (&amp;amp;gt;6 months). We combined Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) with targeted stance phase therapy using Virtual Reality (VR)-assisted treadmill training and overground practice. The training was guided by motor learning principles. Five users (&amp;amp;gt;6 months post-stroke with stance phase gait deficits) completed 10 treatment sessions. Each session began with 30 min of VR-assisted treadmill training designed to apply motor learning (ML)-based stance phase targeted practice. During the first 15 min of the treadmill training, bihemispheric tDCS was simultaneously delivered. Immediately after, users completed 30 min of overground (ML)-based gait training. The outcomes included the feasibility of protocol administration, gait speed, Timed Up and Go (TUG), Functional Gait Assessment (FGA), paretic limb stance phase control capability, and the Fugl&amp;amp;ndash;Meyer for lower extremity coordination (FMLE). The changes in the outcome measures (except the assessments of stance phase control capability) were calculated as the difference from baseline. Statistically and clinically significant improvements were observed after 10 treatment sessions in gait speed (0.25 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.11 m/s) and FGA (4.55 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.08 points). Statistically significant improvements were observed in TUG (2.36 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.81 s) and FMLE (4.08 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.82 points). A 10-session intervention combining tDCS and ML-based task-specific gait rehabilitation was feasible and produced clinically meaningful improvements in lower limb function in people with chronic gait deficits after stroke. Because only five users tested the new protocol, the results cannot be generalized to the whole population. As a contribution to the field, we developed and tested a protocol combining brain stimulation and ML-based stance phase training for individuals with chronic stance phase deficits after stroke. The protocol was feasible to administer; statistically and/or clinically significant improvements in gait function across an array of gait performance measures were observed with this relatively short treatment protocol.</p>

                Background:  Unintended pregnancy predisposes women of child-bearing age to risk factors like maternal deaths, poor child outcomes, mental illness because of stress, risky abortion, and vertical transmission of HIV. According to the Kenya Demographic Health Survey in 2014, 34% of the pregnancies were unintended and in the year 2020 it rose to 41.9% (Monitoring, 2020).  Determinants of unintended pregnancy among women attending antenatal clinics in Kenya is diverse and is poorly understood due to no representative information. The objective of the study was to determine the factors associated with unintended pregnancy among women attending antenatal clinic particularly their individual factors, family planning practices and health facility-based factors. Method:  A cross-sectional study design. Data was collected using a structured administered questionnaire from 227 participants. The proportion and determinants of unintended pregnancy was derived using bivariate analysis and multivariate logistic regressions.  Results: In this study, a third (29.9%) of the pregnant women reported that their existing gravidity was unintended. Individual factors such as age less than 25 years [AOR 8.1 (95% CI 1.4-48.6)), p=0.001], use of contraceptive method [AOR 7.9 (95% CI 2.5-25.0), p<0.001] and the woman being the sole decision-maker on when to get pregnant [AOR 3.8 (95% CI 1.3-11.2), p=0.014] were significantly associated with unintended pregnancy. Conclusion: The study area had quite a significant proportion of unintended pregnancy underscoring the need for health facilities to enhance targeted contraceptive counselling during antenatal and postnatal clinics. Reinforcing effective utilization of family planning services in the pursuit to decrease unintended pregnancy not only in Nairobi but also in Kenya.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Designing optimal allocations for cancer screening using queuing network models</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Justin Dean, Evan Goldberg, Franziska Michor</p>

Cancer is one of the leading causes of death, but mortality can be reduced by detecting tumors earlier so that treatment is initiated at a less aggressive stage. The tradeoff between costs associated with screening and its benefit makes the decision of whom to screen and when a challenge. To enable comparisons across screening strategies for any cancer type, we demonstrate a mathematical modeling platform based on the theory of queuing networks designed for quantifying the benefits of screening strategies. Our methodology can be used to design optimal screening protocols and to estimate their benefits for specific patient populations. Our method is amenable to exact analysis, thus circumventing the need for simulations, and is capable of exactly quantifying outcomes given variability in the age of diagnosis, rate of progression, and screening sensitivity and intervention outcomes. We demonstrate the power of this methodology by applying it to data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program. Our approach estimates the benefits that various novel screening programs would confer to different patient populations, thus enabling us to formulate an optimal screening allocation and quantify its potential effects for any cancer type and intervention.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Assessing the impact of lateral flow testing strategies on within-school SARS-CoV-2 transmission and absences: A modelling study</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Trystan Leng, Edward M. Hill, Robin N. Thompson, Michael J. Tildesley, Matt J. Keeling, Louise Dyson</p>

Rapid testing strategies that replace the isolation of close contacts through the use of lateral flow device tests (LFTs) have been suggested as a way of controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission within schools that maintain low levels of pupil absences. We developed an individual-based model of a secondary school formed of exclusive year group bubbles (five year groups, with 200 pupils per year) to assess the likely impact of strategies using LFTs in secondary schools over the course of a seven-week half-term on transmission, absences, and testing volume, compared to a policy of isolating year group bubbles upon a pupil returning a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. We also considered the sensitivity of results to levels of participation in rapid testing and underlying model assumptions. While repeated testing of year group bubbles following case detection is less effective at reducing infections than a policy of isolating year group bubbles, strategies involving twice weekly mass testing can reduce infections to lower levels than would occur under year group isolation. By combining regular testing with serial contact testing or isolation, infection levels can be reduced further still. At high levels of pupil participation in lateral flow testing, strategies replacing the isolation of year group bubbles with testing substantially reduce absences, but require a high volume of testing. Our results highlight the conflict between the goals of minimising within-school transmission, minimising absences and minimising testing burden. While rapid testing strategies can reduce school transmission and absences, they may lead to a large number of daily tests.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A phenomenological computational model of the evoked action potential fitted to human cochlear implant responses</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ángel Ramos-de-Miguel, José M. Escobar, David Greiner, Domingo Benítez, Eduardo Rodríguez, Albert Oliver, Marcos Hernández, Ángel Ramos-Macías</p>

There is a growing interest in biomedical engineering in developing procedures that provide accurate simulations of the neural response to electrical stimulus produced by implants. Moreover, recent research focuses on models that take into account individual patient characteristics.
We present a phenomenological computational model that is customized with the patient’s data provided by the electrically evoked compound action potential (ECAP) for simulating the neural response to electrical stimulus produced by the electrodes of cochlear implants (CIs). The model links the input currents of the electrodes to the simulated ECAP.
Potentials and currents are calculated by solving the quasi-static approximation of the Maxwell equations with the finite element method (FEM). In ECAPs recording, an active electrode generates a current that elicits action potentials in the surrounding auditory nerve fibers (ANFs). The sum of these action potentials is registered by other nearby electrode. Our computational model emulates this phenomenon introducing a set of line current sources replacing the ANFs by a set of virtual neurons (VNs). To fit the ECAP amplitudes we assign a suitable weight to each VN related with the probability of an ANF to be excited. This probability is expressed by a cumulative beta distribution parameterized by two shape parameters that are calculated by means of a differential evolution algorithm (DE). Being the weights function of the current density, any change in the design of the CI affecting the current density produces changes in the weights and, therefore, in the simulated ECAP, which confers to our model a predictive capacity.
The results of the validation with ECAP data from two patients are presented, achieving a satisfactory fit of the experimental data with those provided by the proposed computational model.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Discovering sparse control strategies in neural activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Edward D. Lee, Xiaowen Chen, Bryan C. Daniels</p>

Biological circuits such as neural or gene regulation networks use internal states to map sensory input to an adaptive repertoire of behavior. Characterizing this mapping is a major challenge for systems biology. Though experiments that probe internal states are developing rapidly, organismal complexity presents a fundamental obstacle given the many possible ways internal states could map to behavior. Using <i>C. elegans</i> as an example, we propose a protocol for systematic perturbation of neural states that limits experimental complexity and could eventually help characterize collective aspects of the neural-behavioral map. We consider experimentally motivated small perturbations—ones that are most likely to preserve natural dynamics and are closer to internal control mechanisms—to neural states and their impact on collective neural activity. Then, we connect such perturbations to the local information geometry of collective statistics, which can be fully characterized using pairwise perturbations. Applying the protocol to a minimal model of <i>C. elegans</i> neural activity, we find that collective neural statistics are most sensitive to a few principal perturbative modes. Dominant eigenvalues decay initially as a power law, unveiling a hierarchy that arises from variation in individual neural activity and pairwise interactions. Highest-ranking modes tend to be dominated by a few, “pivotal” neurons that account for most of the system’s sensitivity, suggesting a sparse mechanism of collective control.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Uncertainty–guided learning with scaled prediction errors in the basal ganglia</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Moritz Moeller, Sanjay Manohar, Rafasl Bogacz</p>

To accurately predict rewards associated with states or actions, the variability of observations has to be taken into account. In particular, when the observations are noisy, the individual rewards should have less influence on tracking of average reward, and the estimate of the mean reward should be updated to a smaller extent after each observation. However, it is not known how the magnitude of the observation noise might be tracked and used to control prediction updates in the brain reward system. Here, we introduce a new model that uses simple, tractable learning rules that track the mean and standard deviation of reward, and leverages prediction errors scaled by uncertainty as the central feedback signal. We show that the new model has an advantage over conventional reinforcement learning models in a value tracking task, and approaches a theoretic limit of performance provided by the Kalman filter. Further, we propose a possible biological implementation of the model in the basal ganglia circuit. In the proposed network, dopaminergic neurons encode reward prediction errors scaled by standard deviation of rewards. We show that such scaling may arise if the striatal neurons learn the standard deviation of rewards and modulate the activity of dopaminergic neurons. The model is consistent with experimental findings concerning dopamine prediction error scaling relative to reward magnitude, and with many features of striatal plasticity. Our results span across the levels of implementation, algorithm, and computation, and might have important implications for understanding the dopaminergic prediction error signal and its relation to adaptive and effective learning.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Neural networks enable efficient and accurate simulation-based inference of evolutionary parameters from adaptation dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Grace Avecilla, Julie N. Chuong, Fangfei Li, Gavin Sherlock, David Gresham, Yoav Ram</p>

The rate of adaptive evolution depends on the rate at which beneficial mutations are introduced into a population and the fitness effects of those mutations. The rate of beneficial mutations and their expected fitness effects is often difficult to empirically quantify. As these 2 parameters determine the pace of evolutionary change in a population, the dynamics of adaptive evolution may enable inference of their values. Copy number variants (CNVs) are a pervasive source of heritable variation that can facilitate rapid adaptive evolution. Previously, we developed a locus-specific fluorescent CNV reporter to quantify CNV dynamics in evolving populations maintained in nutrient-limiting conditions using chemostats. Here, we use CNV adaptation dynamics to estimate the rate at which beneficial CNVs are introduced through de novo mutation and their fitness effects using simulation-based likelihood–free inference approaches. We tested the suitability of 2 evolutionary models: a standard Wright–Fisher model and a chemostat model. We evaluated 2 likelihood-free inference algorithms: the well-established Approximate Bayesian Computation with Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC) algorithm, and the recently developed Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE) algorithm, which applies an artificial neural network to directly estimate the posterior distribution. By systematically evaluating the suitability of different inference methods and models, we show that NPE has several advantages over ABC-SMC and that a Wright–Fisher evolutionary model suffices in most cases. Using our validated inference framework, we estimate the CNV formation rate at the <i>GAP1</i> locus in the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> to be 10<sup>−4.7</sup> to 10<sup>−4</sup> CNVs per cell division and a fitness coefficient of 0.04 to 0.1 per generation for <i>GAP1</i> CNVs in glutamine-limited chemostats. We experimentally validated our inference-based estimates using 2 distinct experimental methods—barcode lineage tracking and pairwise fitness assays—which provide independent confirmation of the accuracy of our approach. Our results are consistent with a beneficial CNV supply rate that is 10-fold greater than the estimated rates of beneficial single-nucleotide mutations, explaining the outsized importance of CNVs in rapid adaptive evolution. More generally, our study demonstrates the utility of novel neural network–based likelihood–free inference methods for inferring the rates and effects of evolutionary processes from empirical data with possible applications ranging from tumor to viral evolution.

                Background: The COVID-19 pandemic had a considerable impact on the lives of the world's population, which led to the closure of educational institutions including in Mozambique.  In March 2020, the state emergency forced students and professors to change in-person classes to online learning because of the pandemic.   Objectives: To access students’ capacities in terms of technological resources to participate in the 5th-year online classes of the Eduardo Mondlane University Medical School and the difficulties they encountered throughout the year. Additionally, psychological symptoms associated with confinement and how that affected participation in psychiatry and mental health classes were assessed.   Methods: A cross sectional social online questionnaire survey was conducted among 32 students enrolled in the 5th-year psychiatry and mental health classes of the Eduardo Mondlane University Medical School during May and June 2021.   Results: A total of 47 students were invited to participate in this survey, of which 32 students (68%) participated. Of the participants, 16.7% reported the presence of psychological symptoms associated with confinement. All students could participate in online classes using cell phones, computers, and tablets. However, 34.4% did not have a laptop.  In this study, 87.5% of the respondents reported poor internet quality, and 12.5% ​​of students did not have internet and had to join colleagues to participate in classes and to interact with the members of their groups. Most of the students (90.6%) were not prepared or knew how to use google classroom, Skype, and Zoom, before the lockdowns.   Conclusions: The study suggests that the abrupt and radical change from in-person teaching and learning methods to remote online methods showed the weaknesses of students in terms of resources (computers, tablets, internet) and knowledge for the implementation of online classes. Psychological symptoms were present but did not affect student participation in remote psychiatry and mental health classes.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Temporal lobe epilepsy is characterized by hippocampal neuronal death in CA1 and hilus. Dentate gyrus granule cells survive but show dispersion of the compact granule cell layer. This is associated with decrease of the glycoprotein Reelin, which regulates neuron migration and dendrite outgrow. Reelin-deficient (reeler) mice show no layering, their granule cells are dispersed throughout the dentate gyrus. We studied granule cell dendritic orientation and distribution of postsynaptic spines in reeler mice and two mouse models of temporal lobe epilepsy, namely the p35 knockout mice, which show Reelin-independent neuronal migration defects, and mice with unilateral intrahippocampal kainate injection. Granule cells were Golgi-stained and analyzed, using a computerized camera lucida system. Granule cells in naive controls exhibited a vertically oriented dendritic arbor with a small bifurcation angle if positioned proximal to the hilus and a wider dendritic bifurcation angle, if positioned distally. P35 knockout- and kainate-injected mice showed a dispersed granule cell layer, granule cells showed basal dendrites with wider bifurcation angles, which lost position-specific differences. Reeler mice lacked dendritic orientation. P35 knockout- and kainate-injected mice showed increased dendritic spine density in the granule cell layer. Molecular layer dendrites showed a reduced spine density in kainate-injected mice only, whereas in p35 knockouts no reduced spine density was seen. Reeler mice showed a homogenous high spine density. We hypothesize that granule cells migrate in temporal lobe epilepsy, develop new dendrites which show a spread of the dendritic tree, create new spines in areas proximal to mossy fiber sprouting, which is present in p35 knockout- and kainate-injected mice and loose spines on distal dendrites if mossy cell death is present, as it was in kainate-injected mice only. These results are in accordance with findings in epilepsy patients.</p>

                Background: Rhizocephalan barnacles stand out in the diverse world of metazoan parasites. The body of a rhizocephalan female is modified beyond revealing any recognizable morphological features, consisting of the interna, the system of rootlets, and the externa, a sac-like reproductive body. Moreover, rhizocephalans have an outstanding ability to control their hosts, literally turning them into “zombies”. Despite all these amazing traits, there is no genomic and transcriptomic data about any Rhizocephala. Methods: We collected transcriptomes from four body parts of an adult female rhizocephalan Peltogaster reticulata: externa and main, growing, and thoracic parts of the interna. We used all prepared data for the de novo assembly of the reference transcriptome. Next, a set of encoded proteins was determined, the expression levels of protein-coding genes in different parts of the parasite body were calculated and lists of enriched bioprocesses were identified. We also in silico identified and analyzed sets of potential excretory / secretory proteins. Finally, we applied phylostratigraphy and evolutionary transcriptomics approaches to our data.  Results: The assembled reference transcriptome included transcripts of 12,620 protein-coding genes and was the first for both P. reticulata and Rhizocephala. Based on the results obtained, the spatial heterogeneity of protein-coding genes expression in different regions of P. reticulata adult female body was established. The results of both transcriptomic analysis and histological studies indicated the presence of germ-like cells in the lumen of the interna. The potential molecular basis of the interaction between the nervous system of the host and the parasite's interna was also determined. Given the prolonged expression of development-associated genes, we suggest that rhizocephalans “got stuck in the metamorphosis”, even in their reproductive stage. Conclusions: The results of the first comparative transcriptomic analysis for Rhizocephala not only clarified but also expanded the existing ideas about the biology of this amazing parasites.

                Background: The artistic techniques necessary to fabricate facial prostheses mainly depend on individual skill and are not a resource easily reproduced. Digital technology has contributed to improved outcomes, often combining analog and new digital techniques in the same workflow. Methods: This article aims to present an innovative workflow to produce a final colored 3D printed and facial prosthesis by UV-map color translation into colored resin 3D printing. A modified +ID Methodology was used to obtain 3D models with the calibrated 3D printable patient’s skin color. No hands-on physical molding, manual sculpture, or intrinsic silicone coloration was used. Results: The outcome resulted in acceptable aesthetics, adaptation, and an approximate color match after extrinsic coloration. The patient reported good comfort and acceptance. Conclusions: A direct resin 3D printed prosthesis may be a viable alternative, especially for rapid delivery as an immediate prosthesis or an option when there is no experienced anaplastogist to manufacture a conventional prosthesis.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A cyto-, myelo-, and chemoarchitectonic analysis of the pallial telencephalon of the tree pangolin is provided. As certain portions of the pallial telencephalon have been described previously (olfactory pallium, hippocampal formation, and amygdaloid complex), we focus on the claustrum and endopiriform nuclear complex, the white matter and white matter interstitial cells, and the areal organization of the cerebral cortex. Our analysis indicates that the organization of the pallial telencephalon of the tree pangolin is similar to that observed in many other mammals, and specifically quite similar to the closely related carnivores. The claustrum of the tree pangolin exhibits a combination of insular and laminar architecture, while the endopiriform nuclear complex contains three nuclei, both reminiscent of observations made in other mammals. The population of white matter interstitial cells resembles that observed in other mammals, while a distinct laminated organization of the intracortical white matter was revealed with parvalbumin immunostaining. The cerebral cortex of the tree pangolin presented with indistinct laminar boundaries as well as pyramidalization of the neurons in both layers 2 and 4. All cortical regions typically found in mammals were present, with the cortical areas within these regions often corresponding to what has been reported in carnivores. Given the similarity of the organization of the pallial telencephalon of the tree pangolin to that observed in other mammals, especially carnivores, it would be reasonable to assume that the neural processing afforded the tree pangolin by these structures does not differ dramatically to that of other mammals.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase moonlights as a ribosome binding modulator of Gcn2 activity during oxidative stress</a></h4>

              
                Regulation of translation is a fundamental facet of the cellular response to rapidly changing external conditions. Specific RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) co-ordinate the translational regulation of distinct mRNA cohorts during stress. To identify RBPs with previously under-appreciated roles in translational control, we used polysome profiling and mass spectrometry to identify and quantify proteins associated with translating ribosomes in unstressed yeast cells and during oxidative stress and amino acid starvation, which both induce the integrated stress response (ISR). Over 800 proteins were identified across polysome gradient fractions, including ribosomal proteins, translation factors and many others without previously described translation-related roles, including numerous metabolic enzymes. We identified variations in patterns of polysome enrichment in both unstressed and stressed cells and identified proteins enriched in heavy polysomes during stress. Genetic screening of polysome-enriched RBPs identified the cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase, Aat2, as a ribosome-associated protein whose deletion conferred growth sensitivity to oxidative stress. Loss of Aat2 caused aberrantly high activation of the ISR via enhanced eIF2a phosphorylation and <i>GCN4</i> activation. Importantly, non-catalytic <i>AAT2</i> mutants retained polysome association and did not show heightened stress sensitivity. Aat2 therefore has a separate ribosome-associated translational regulatory or 'moonlighting' function that modulates the ISR independent of its aspartate aminotransferase activity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Higher-order olfactory neurons in the lateral horn support odor valence and odor identity coding in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Understanding neuronal representations of odor-evoked activities and their progressive transformation from the sensory level to higher brain centers features one of the major aims in olfactory neuroscience. Here, we investigated how odor information is transformed and represented in higher-order neurons of the lateral horn, one of the higher olfactory centers implicated in determining innate behavior, using <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. We focused on a subset of third-order glutamatergic lateral horn neurons (LHNs) and characterized their odor coding properties in relation to their presynaptic partner neurons, the projection neurons (PNs) by two-photon functional imaging. We show that odors evoke reproducible, stereotypic, and odor-specific response patterns in LHNs. Notably, odor-evoked responses in these neurons are valence-specific in a way that their response amplitude is positively correlated with innate odor preferences. We postulate that this valence-specific activity is the result of integrating inputs from multiple olfactory channels through second-order neurons. GRASP and micro-lesioning experiments provide evidence that glutamatergic LHNs obtain their major excitatory input from uniglomerular PNs, while they receive an odor-specific inhibition through inhibitory multiglomerular PNs. In summary, our study indicates that odor representations in glutamatergic LHNs encode hedonic valence and odor identity and primarily retain the odor coding properties of second-order neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Motor cortex activity across movement speeds is predicted by network-level strategies for generating muscle activity</a></h4>

              
                Learned movements can be skillfully performed at different paces. What neural strategies produce this flexibility? Can they be predicted and understood by network modeling? We trained monkeys to perform a cycling task at different speeds, and trained artificial recurrent networks to generate the empirical muscle-activity patterns. Network solutions reflected the principle that smooth well-behaved dynamics require low trajectory tangling. Network solutions had a consistent form, which yielded quantitative and qualitative predictions. To evaluate predictions, we analyzed motor cortex activity recorded during the same task. Responses supported the hypothesis that the dominant neural signals reflect not muscle activity, but network-level strategies for generating muscle activity. Single-neuron responses were better accounted for by network activity than by muscle activity. Similarly, neural population trajectories shared their organization not with muscle trajectories, but with network solutions. Thus, cortical activity could be understood based on the need to generate muscle activity via dynamics that allow smooth, robust control over movement speed.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Unique neural coding of crucial versus irrelevant plant odors in a hawkmoth</a></h4>

              
                The sense of smell is pivotal for nocturnal moths to locate feeding and oviposition sites. However, these crucial resources are often rare and their bouquets are intermingled with volatiles emanating from surrounding ‘background’ plants. Here, we asked if the olfactory system of female hawkmoths, <i>Manduca sexta</i>, could differentiate between crucial and background cues. To answer this question, we collected nocturnal headspaces of numerous plants in a natural habitat of <i>M. sexta</i>. We analyzed the chemical composition of these headspaces and used them as stimuli in physiological experiments at the antenna and in the brain. The intense odors of floral nectar sources evoked strong responses in virgin and mated female moths, most likely enabling the localization of profitable flowers at a distance. Bouquets of larval host plants and most background plants, in contrast, were subtle, thus potentially complicating host identification. However, despite being subtle, antennal responses and brain activation patterns evoked by the smell of larval host plants were clearly different from those evoked by other plants. Interestingly, this difference was even more pronounced in the antennal lobe of mated females, revealing a status-dependent tuning of their olfactory system towards oviposition sites. Our study suggests that female moths possess unique neural coding strategies to find not only conspicuous floral cues but also inconspicuous bouquets of larval host plants within a complex olfactory landscape.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Electrocorticography is superior to subthalamic local field potentials for movement decoding in Parkinson’s disease</a></h4>

              
                Brain signal decoding promises significant advances in the development of clinical brain computer interfaces (BCI). In Parkinson’s disease (PD), first bidirectional BCI implants for adaptive deep brain stimulation (DBS) are now available. Brain signal decoding can extend the clinical utility of adaptive DBS but the impact of neural source, computational methods and PD pathophysiology on decoding performance are unknown. This represents an unmet need for the development of future neurotechnology. To address this, we developed an invasive brain-signal decoding approach based on intraoperative sensorimotor electrocorticography (ECoG) and subthalamic LFP to predict grip-force, a representative movement decoding application, in 11 PD patients undergoing DBS. We demonstrate that ECoG is superior to subthalamic LFP for accurate grip-force decoding. Gradient boosted decision trees (XGBOOST) outperformed other model architectures. ECoG based decoding performance negatively correlated with motor impairment, which could be attributed to subthalamic beta bursts in the motor preparation and movement period. This highlights the impact of PD pathophysiology on the neural capacity to encode movement vigor. Finally, we developed a connectomic analysis that could predict grip-force decoding performance of individual ECoG channels across patients by using their connectomic fingerprints. Our study provides a neurophysiological and computational framework for invasive brain signal decoding to aid the development of an individualized precision-medicine approach to intelligent adaptive DBS.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Oct4 differentially regulates chromatin opening and enhancer transcription in pluripotent stem cells</a></h4>

              
                The transcription factor Oct4 is essential for the maintenance and induction of stem cell pluripotency, but its functional roles are not fully understood. Here, we investigate the functions of Oct4 by depleting and subsequently recovering it in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and conducting a time-resolved multiomics analysis. Oct4 depletion leads to an immediate loss of its binding to enhancers, accompanied by a decrease in mRNA synthesis from its target genes that are part of the transcriptional network that maintains pluripotency. Gradual decrease of Oct4 binding to enhancers does not immediately change the chromatin accessibility but reduces transcription of enhancers. Conversely, partial recovery of Oct4 expression results in a rapid increase in chromatin accessibility, whereas enhancer transcription does not fully recover. These results indicate different concentration-dependent activities of Oct4. Whereas normal ESC levels of Oct4 are required for transcription of pluripotency enhancers, low levels of Oct4 are sufficient to retain chromatin accessibility, likely together with other factors such as Sox2.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ventral forebrain organoids derived from individuals with schizophrenia recapitulate perturbed striatal gene expression dynamics of the donor's brains</a></h4>

              
                Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a brain disorder originating during neurodevelopment with complex genetic and environmental etiologies. Despite decades of clinical evidence of altered striatal function in affected patients, its cellular and molecular underpinnings remain unclear. Here, to explore neurodevelopmental alterations in the striatum associated with SCZ, we established a method for the differentiation of iPS cells into ventral forebrain organoids. Given substantial genetic heterogeneity among individuals, which can obscure disease-associated phenotypes, we generated organoids from postmortem dural fibroblast-derived iPS cells of 3 patients and 4 healthy control individuals with nonoverlapping polygenic risk score (PRS) for SCZ and whose genotype and postmortem caudate transcriptomic data were profiled in the Brainseq neurogenomics consortium. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses of the organoids revealed differences in developmental trajectory between SCZ cases and controls in which inhibitory neurons from patients exhibited accelerated maturation. Furthermore, we found a significant overlap of genes upregulated in the inhibitory neurons in SCZ organoids with upregulated genes in postmortem caudate tissues from patients with SCZ compared with control individuals, including the donors of our iPS cell cohort. Our findings suggest that striatal neurons in the patients with SCZ carry abnormalities that originated during early brain development and a ventral forebrain striatal organoid model can recapitulate those neurodevelopmental phenotypes in a dish.

                Dentate gyrus (DG) is a critical structure involved in spatial memory and adult neurogenesis, two distinct processes dynamically regulated by local circuits comprising diverse populations of DG cells. It remains unknown how these DG cells are orchestrated to regulate these distinct hippocampal functions. Here we report activation of a cholinergic circuit from the Diagonal Band of Broca to DG promotes quiescent radial neural stem cell (rNSC) activation and spatial memory. Furthermore, single-nucleus RNA-sequencing reveals broad transcriptomic changes across DG mature and adult-born cells in response to cholinergic-circuit activation. Notably, neuronal populations exhibit cholinergic-activity-induced molecular changes related to synaptic functions crucial for spatial memory; while rNSCs exhibit changes related to structural remodeling and neurogenic proliferation crucial for hippocampal neurogenesis. Electrophysiology and NicheNet analyses reveal granule cells, endothelial cells, and astrocytes as potential intermediaries for cholinergic regulation of rNSCs. Our findings reveal cell-type-specific signaling mechanisms underlying cholinergic regulation of distinct DG functions.

	<p>This study evaluated the therapeutic effects of surgical treatment of cystic pituitary prolactin-secreting macroadenomas. The clinical data of 42 patients with cystic pituitary prolactin-secreting macroadenomas were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into medication plus surgery and surgery alone groups based on the regularity of bromocriptine treatment before surgery. Both groups underwent extra-pseudocapsular transsphenoidal surgery for tumor resection, and postoperative images and clinical follow-up were retrospectively reviewed. We also evaluated patients who opted for long-term treatment with bromocriptine. In the medication plus surgery group, the long-term surgical cure rate and comprehensive remission rate were 33.3% and 41.7%, while in the surgery alone group they were 69.2% and 80.8%, respectively. No severe or permanent complications occurred, and the surgical complication morbidity rate was 10.5%. The rate of tumor progression during the long-term follow-up was 33.3% and 7.7% in the medication plus surgery and surgery alone groups, respectively. The time required for prolactin levels to return to normal in the surgery alone group was significantly faster and the proportion that returned to normal was significantly higher. Direct surgical treatment after diagnosis combined with postoperative individualized bromocriptine adjuvant therapy had better efficacy in patients with cystic pituitary prolactin-secreting macroadenomas, but its long-term effectiveness requires further follow-up.</p>

	<p>Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate ten exercise interventions (YOGA: yoga training, RT: resistance training, AQU: aquatic training, TAI: Taiji Qigong training, TRD: treadmill training, VR: virtual reality training, DANCE: musical dance training, WKT: walking training, CYC: cycling training, BDJ: Baduanjin Qigong training) on motor function in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) patients. Design: Through searching PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and CNKI, only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were collected to study the effects of the ten exercise interventions on motor function in patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. The included studies were evaluated for methodological quality by the Cochrane bias risk assessment tool. Results: The RCTs were collected between the earliest available date and April 2022. Sixty RCTs were included and the total sample size used in the study was 2859. The results of the network meta-analysis showed that DANCE can significantly improve patients&amp;amp;rsquo; Berg Balance Scale (BBS) (SUCRA = 78.4%); DANCE can significantly decline patients&amp;amp;rsquo; Unified Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Rating Scale score (UPDRS) (SUCRA = 72.3%) and YOGA can significantly decline patients&amp;amp;rsquo; Timed-Up-and-Go score (TUGT) (SUCRA = 78.0%). Conclusion: Based on the network meta-analysis and SUCRA ranking, we can state that dance, yoga, virtual reality training and resistance training offers better advantages than other exercise interventions for patients&amp;amp;rsquo; motor function.</p>

	<p>Tic disorders are neurological disorders that are prone to fluctuation and recurrence. It is important to study the factors related to disease recurrence and to subsequently provide suggestions for clinical treatment. A retrospective study was conducted to assess patients with recurrent and non-recurring tic disorders diagnosed in the Pediatric Tic Disorder Clinic of the First Affiliated Hospital of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, China, and to extract various factors&amp;amp;mdash;such as fetal status; medication, allergy, and family history; social and psychological factors; blood lead content; electroencephalogram (EEG); disease duration; type of tics; and disease severity&amp;amp;mdash;and identify factors associated with recurrence. The recurrence rate of tic disorders was approximately 45.10% in this study. The childbirth conditions, surgery/trauma, respiratory tract infection, allergy, stress, consumption of tiapride, and severity of tic disorders were factors related to and affected disease recurrence.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Difficulty hearing in noise is exacerbated in older adults. Older adults are more likely to have audiometric hearing loss, although some individuals with normal pure-tone audiograms also have difficulty perceiving speech in noise. Additional variables also likely account for speech understanding in noise. It has been suggested that one important class of variables is the ability to process auditory information once it has been detected. Here, we tested a set of these &amp;amp;ldquo;suprathreshold&amp;amp;rdquo; auditory processing abilities and related them to performance on a two-part test of speech understanding in competition with and without spatial separation of the target and masking speech. Testing was administered in the Portable Automated Rapid Testing (PART) application developed by our team; PART facilitates psychoacoustic assessments of auditory processing. (2) Methods: Forty-one individuals (average age 51 years), completed assessments of sensitivity to temporal fine structure (TFS) and spectrotemporal modulation (STM) detection via an iPad running the PART application. Statistical models were used to evaluate the strength of associations between performance on the auditory processing tasks and speech understanding in competition. Age and pure-tone-average (PTA) were also included as potential predictors. (3) Results: The model providing the best fit also included age and a measure of diotic frequency modulation (FM) detection but none of the other potential predictors. However, even the best fitting models accounted for 31% or less of the variance, supporting work suggesting that other variables (e.g., cognitive processing abilities) also contribute significantly to speech understanding in noise. (4) Conclusions: The results of the current study do not provide strong support for previous suggestions that suprathreshold processing abilities alone can be used to explain difficulties in speech understanding in competition among older adults. This discrepancy could be due to the speech tests used, the listeners tested, or the suprathreshold tests chosen. Future work with larger numbers of participants is warranted, including a range of cognitive tests and additional assessments of suprathreshold auditory processing abilities.</p>

	<p>Neurocognitive screening instruments usually require printed sheets and additional accessories, and can be unsuitable for low-threshold use during ward rounds or emergency workup, especially in patients with motor impairments. Here, we test the utility of a newly developed neuropsychology pocketcard set for point-of-care testing. For aphasia and neglect assessment, modified versions of the Language Screening Test and the Bells Test were validated on 63 and 60 acute stroke unit patients, respectively, against expert clinical evaluation and the original pen-and-paper Bells Test. The pocketcard aphasia test achieved an excellent area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.88&amp;amp;ndash;1, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Using an optimal cut-off of &amp;amp;ge;2 mistakes, sensitivity was 91% and specificity was 81%. The pocketcard Bells Task, measured against the clinical neglect diagnosis, achieved higher sensitivity (89%) and specificity (88%) than the original paper-based instrument (78% and 75%, respectively). Separately, executive function tests (modified versions of the Trail Making Test [TMT] A and B, custom Stroop color naming task, vigilance &amp;amp;lsquo;A&amp;amp;rsquo; Montreal Cognitive Assessment item) were validated on 44 inpatients with epilepsy against the EpiTrack&amp;amp;reg; test battery. Pocketcard TMT performance was significantly correlated with the original EpiTrack&amp;amp;reg; versions (A: r = 0.64, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001; B: r = 0.75, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). AUCs for the custom Stroop task, TMT A and TMT B for discriminating between normal and pathological EpiTrack&amp;amp;reg; scores were acceptable, excellent and outstanding, respectively. Quick point-of-care testing using a pocketcard set is feasible and yields diagnostically valid information.</p>

	<p>Children tend to rely on semantics rather than syntax during sentence comprehension. In transitive sentences, with no reliance on semantics, the syntax-based strategy becomes critical. We aimed to describe developmental changes of brain mechanisms for syntax processing in typically developing (TD) four to six year old&amp;amp;rsquo;s. A specially designed sentence-picture matching task using active (AV) and passive (PV) voice enforced children to use grammar cues for sentence comprehension. Fifty children with above &amp;amp;gt;60% level of accuracy in PV sentences comprehension demonstrated brain sensitivity to voice grammar markers-inflections of the second noun phrase (NP2), which was expressed in a greater event-related potentials (ERP) amplitude to PV vs. AV sentences in four-, five-, and six-year-old children. The biphasic positive-negative component at 200&amp;amp;ndash;400 ms was registered in the frontocentral and bilateral temporoparietal areas. Only in six-year-old children P600 was registered in the right temporoparietal area. LAN-like negativity seems to be a mechanism for distinguishing AV from PV in the early stages of mastering syntax processing of transitive sentences in four to five year old children. Both behavioral and ERP results distinguished six-year-olds from four-year-old&amp;amp;rsquo;s and five-year-old&amp;amp;rsquo;s, reflecting the possible transition to the &amp;amp;ldquo;adult-like&amp;amp;rdquo; syntax-based thematic role assignment.</p>

	<p>Intraoperative hypothermia is very common and leads to memory decline. The hippocampus is responsible for memory formation. As a functional core area, the cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) region of the hippocampus contains abundant blood vessels and is susceptible to ischemia. The aim of the study was to explore vascular function and neuronal state in the CA1 region of rats undergoing intraoperative hypothermia. The neuronal morphological change and activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) expression were evaluated by haematoxylin-eosin staining and immunofluorescence respectively. Histology and immunohistochemistry were used to assess vascular function. Results showed that intraoperative hypothermia inhibited the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and caused reactive oxygen species accumulation. Additionally, the phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells was transformed from contractile to synthetic, showing a decrease in smooth muscle myosin heavy chain and an increase in osteopontin. Ultimately, vascular dysfunction caused neuronal pyknosis in the CA1 region and reduced memory-related Arc expression. In conclusion, neuronal disorder in the CA1 region was caused by intraoperative hypothermia-related vascular dysfunction. This study could provide a novel understanding of the effect of intraoperative hypothermia in the hippocampus, which might identify a new research target and treatment strategy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients' quality of life and its related factors: A cross-sectional study of the Jordanian population [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death globally, mostly in low- and middle-income countries. It is estimated that 6.5% of Jordanians under 50 and 37.5% of those over 70 years of age are affected. The country's air pollution levels surpass recommended levels, increasing the disease incidence and burden on individuals and the health system. COPD is a long-term, severe, and exhausting condition. In Jordan, patients are highly dependent and frequent users of the healthcare services; therefore, their Quality of Life (QoL) is highly influenced by the health care they receive. The QoL of COPD patients must be studied to devise interventions that can help patients cope with this disease and for healthcare systems to improve their service.  Method: A cross-sectional correlational study of 200 COPD patients. The Arabic WHO Quality of Life Questionnaire Short Form was used to collect data.   Results: The mean COPD patient QoL score was 10.66 (SD=1.58), showing poor QoL perception. The physical domain had the lowest perceived QoL (10.232, SD=1.912), while the environmental domain had the highest (10.948, SD=1.636). Unmarried, non-smokers, and employed had better QoL (M=11.04, M=10.92, M=12.04). Age categories 50-61 exhibited greater mean QoL than age category 61 or higher (M=11.44, M=10.84, M=10.08). Private health services are characterized by short waiting times, availability of different diagnostic and treatment services, and skilled staff was related to better QoL.  Conclusions: QoL for COPD patients seems to be an area requiring urgent attention from Health service providers and planners. Patients should be adequately supported and cared for to have a good QoL. In Jordan, COPD patients' QoL is highly influenced by lack of physical activity, emotional distress, and anxiety. Therefore, better health care services is needed to address all these areas adequately.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A re-analysis of data from Sullins, Rosik, and Santero (2021): are sexual orientation change efforts (SOCE) helpful for those who don't change? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background.  Sullins, Rosik, and Santero (2021) evaluated a convenience sample of 125 men who had undergone sexual orientation change efforts (SOCE) and they made their data available for independent analysis.     Methods:  Data from Sullins et al. (2021) were reanalyzed in ten new ways.  Several new typologies and variables were created.  Paired sample t-tests, correlations, regression analyses, repeated measures analyses with time x group interactions, and chi-square tests were used to evaluate ten novel hypotheses. Results:  Using parametric statistics, we found similar results to Sullins et al. (2021) where they had used nonparametric statistics.  Regression analyses found that lower initial SSI and higher SSB predicted more change.  Using a new typology for marital status, it was found that those who became engaged/got married during SOCE had the largest gains in OSB compared to other categories of marital status.   Using the typology of change, it was found that some men who became stronger for SSA, SSI, and SSB nevertheless reported high levels of helpfulness for SOCE.  Harms from SOCE seem to be minimal compared to the positives reported for young adults.  SOCE effectiveness did not appear to change with time since therapy, lending less support to a recall bias argument.  Congruence between SSA and SSI, may, in some cases, reduce the apparent effectiveness of SOCE  Conclusion:  While the sample’s results cannot be generalized outside of highly religious men with initially higher levels of SSA and SSB than SSI, these results differ from many contemporary assertions that SOCE cannot ever be effective and is inherently harmful, or that SSA is inherently immutable.  Therefore, calls to ban SOCE legally appear to be founded upon incomplete or inaccurate data and thus premature, while more higher quality research is yet needed regarding SOCE.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Usefulness of vaccine boosters for Covid-19 in Italy and in UK and comparison between in intensive care admissions and deaths of vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. Surprises and implications [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: There is insufficient clarity about the different outcomes between unvaccinated and vaccinated people hospitalized with Covid-19, with reference to the variables “Intensive Care Unit” and “Deaths”. Moreover, it is unclear the real effectiveness of the vaccine boosters on the risks of infection and Covid-19 deaths, beyond the first few months after the booster. To verify the hypotheses that repeated vaccinations might expose to a progressively greater risk of severe Covid-19, and of a growing weakening of the immune response, primarily against infection, as the distance from the booster dose increases. Methods: Through an analysis of the official Italian data we calculated significant differences, percentage variations and trends in the variables “Intensive Care Units” and “Deaths” in hospitalized patients among four groups with different vaccination status, and between the Unvaccinated and Vaccinated groups. Through analyses of the UK Security Agency data in the weekly COVID-19 vaccine surveillance reports we explored the vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infections and against COVID-19 deaths in relation to the time elapsed from the booster doses. Results: Repeated vaccinations seem to expose the recipients to a growing risk of severe Covid-19, and fewer vaccinations might be enough to protect persons at greater risk. The vaccine effectiveness against infection vanished and reversed in the medium term, and vaccinated persons with three doses become increasingly more infected versus unvaccinated persons. Conclusions: The starting hypotheses have been supported, together with the need to combine carefully rethought vaccination campaigns with the implementation of other strategies, with the achievement of a healthy living and working environment, healthy lifestyles, and effective, safe and sustainable care.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Glycine encephalopathy, also known as nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH), is an inherited neurometabolic disorder with variable clinical course and severity, ranging from infantile epileptic encephalopathy to psychiatric disorders. A precise phenotypic characterization and an evaluation of predictive approaches are needed.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Longitudinal clinical and biochemical data of 25 individuals with NKH from the patient registry of International Working Group on Neurotransmitter related Disorders were studied with in silico analyses, pathogenicity scores and molecular modeling of <i>GLDC</i> and <i>AMT</i> variants.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Symptom onset (p&lt;0<sub>·</sub>01) and diagnosis occur earlier in life in severe NKH (p&lt;0<sub>·</sub>01). Presenting symptoms affect the age at diagnosis. Psychiatric problems occur predominantly in attenuated NKH. Onset-age ≥3 months (66% specificity, 100% sensitivity, AUC = 0·87) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/plasma glycine ratio ≤0<sub>·</sub>09 (57% specificity, 100% sensitivity, AUC = 0·88) are sensitive indicators for attenuated NKH while CSF glycine concentration ≥116<sub>·</sub>5 μmol/L (100% specificity, 93% sensitivity, AUC = 0·97) and CSF/plasma glycine ratio ≥0<sub>·</sub>15 (100% specificity, 64% sensitivity, AUC = 0·88) are specific for severe forms. A ratio threshold of 0<sub>·</sub>128 discriminates the overlapping range. We present ten new <i>GLDC</i> variants. Two mild variants resulted in attenuated, while two severe variants or one mild and one severe variant lead to severe phenotype. Based on clinical, biochemical and genetic parameter we propose a severity prediction model.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) Opportunities in Health Education (HE) in a mandatory social isolation context [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Routine care for prevention and health promotion has reduced significantly due to the Covid-19 pandemic and mandatory social isolation measures. In this context, it is necessary to identify and describe Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) that provide opportunities for health education, promotion, and prevention aimed at the general population. The study is a systematic review of MOOCs on health education, health promotion, and prevention for the general population in a pandemic context. Methods: We developed a search for MOOC courses aimed at the general population on health education, health promotion, and prevention in different available MOOC platforms. We executed a descriptive analysis of the main characteristics of the selected MOOCs. Terms such as healthy living, physical activity, healthy eating, mental health, and variants aimed at the general population were explored. We did not include advanced or specialized studies aimed only at professionals that required prior knowledge. A descriptive analysis of the main characteristics of the selected MOOCs was performed. Results: There were 117 MOOCs chosen on health education, promotion, and prevention for the general population. Coursera (40.3%) was the platform that offered the highest quantity of MOOCs; more than half of the MOOCs were in English (52.9%). The median (interquartile range) duration of the selected MOOCs was 11 (6–15) hours. The predominant themes were "Health promotion" (43%) and "Food and nutrition" (31%), and the origin was mainly from Europe (37.8%). Conclusions: Potentially MOOCs could improve access to massive open online public health courses. Adaptation to different languages and topics needed for each context could increase access to important health promotion messages, even outside of "times of pandemic and enforced social isolation".

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Investigating the structural changes due to adenosine methylation of the Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpes virus ORF50 transcript</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Konstantin Röder, Amy M. Barker, Adrian Whitehouse, Samuela Pasquali</p>

Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) is a human oncovirus. KSHV relies on manipulating the host cell N6-methyl adenosine (m6A) RNA modification pathway to enhance virus replication. Methylation within a RNA stem loop of the open reading frame 50 (ORF50) increases transcript stability via the recruitment of the m6A reader, SND1. In this contribution we explore the energy landscapes of the unmethylated and methylated RNA stem loops of ORF50 to investigate the effect of methylation on the structure of the stem loop. We observe a significant shift upon methylation between an open and closed configuration of the top of the stem loop. In the unmethylated stem loop the closed configuration is much lower in energy, and, as a result, exhibits higher occupancy.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Analysing and meta-analysing time-series data of microbial growth and gene expression from plate readers</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Luis Fernando Montaño-Gutierrez, Nahuel Manzanaro Moreno, Iseabail L. Farquhar, Yu Huo, Lucia Bandiera, Peter S. Swain</p>

Responding to change is a fundamental property of life, making time-series data invaluable in biology. For microbes, plate readers are a popular, convenient means to measure growth and also gene expression using fluorescent reporters. Nevertheless, the difficulties of analysing the resulting data can be a bottleneck, particularly when combining measurements from different wells and plates. Here we present omniplate, a Python module that corrects and normalises plate-reader data, estimates growth rates and fluorescence per cell as functions of time, calculates errors, exports in different formats, and enables meta-analysis of multiple plates. The software corrects for autofluorescence, the optical density’s non-linear dependence on the number of cells, and the effects of the media. We use omniplate to measure the Monod relationship for growth of budding yeast in raffinose, showing that raffinose is a convenient carbon source for controlling growth rates. Using fluorescent tagging, we study yeast’s glucose transport. Our results are consistent with the regulation of the hexose transporter (HXT) genes being approximately bipartite: the medium and high affinity transporters are predominately regulated by both the high affinity glucose sensor Snf3 and the kinase complex SNF1 via the repressors Mth1, Mig1, and Mig2; the low affinity transporters are predominately regulated by the low affinity sensor Rgt2 via the co-repressor Std1. We thus demonstrate that omniplate is a powerful tool for exploiting the advantages offered by time-series data in revealing biological regulation.
