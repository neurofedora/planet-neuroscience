              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The impact of clinical pharmacist-led health education on the disease course of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients: an interventional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A multitude of health care professionals, including pharmacists, are needed in managing a complex and silent disease like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS). These health care professionals can increase patients’ health awareness regarding the prevention and the management of the disease. The current study aimed to evaluate the impact of clinical pharmacist education, counseling and follow up on the management of NAFLD with MetS. Methods: This study recruited 102 patients with NAFLD and MetS. Participants received regular health education sessions concerning the disease and recommended lifestyle (diet and exercise) and were followed by clinical pharmacist for 6 months. At the end of the study, participants were divided into two groups; those compliant with education and follow up session (compliant group; n=61); and those attending > 60% but not completing whole sessions (non-compliant group; n=41). Anthropometric measures, liver function, lipid profile, homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), biochemical NAFLD score, radiological liver steatosis and fibrosis grade changes were recorded at baseline and endpoint. Results: The compliant group showed a more significant decrease in weight (p=0.003), low density lipoprotein (LDL) (p=0.009), and very LDL (p<0.001), and a more significant increase in high density lipoprotein (HDL) (p=0.010) compared with the non-compliant group. Moreover, the compliant group showed a statistically significant higher number of patients achieving normalization of total cholesterol (p=0.002), HDL (p=0.004), waist circumference (p=0.004), improvement of body mass index category (p=0.008), liver steatosis grade (p=0.009), liver fibrosis grade (p<0.001), and absence of dyspeptic symptoms (p=0.0010) and hepatomegaly (p= 0.027) compared with the non-compliant group. Fasting blood glucose (p=0.209), fasting insulin (p=0.179), and HOMA-IR score (p=0.193) showed non-significant difference between both groups at endpoint. Conclusion: The educational intervention of a clinical pharmacist showed significant positive impact on ameliorating metabolic syndrome parameters and achieving desired NAFLD therapeutic outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">miND (miRNA NGS Discovery pipeline): a small RNA-seq analysis pipeline and report generator for microRNA biomarker discovery studies [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                In contrast to traditional methods like real-time polymerase chain reaction, next-generation sequencing (NGS), and especially small RNA-seq, enables the untargeted investigation of the whole small RNAome, including microRNAs (miRNAs) but also a multitude of other RNA species. With the promising application of small RNAs as biofluid-based biomarkers, small RNA-seq is the method of choice for an initial discovery study. However, the presentation of specific quality aspects of small RNA-seq data varies significantly between laboratories and is lacking a common (minimal) standard. The miRNA NGS Discovery pipeline (miND) aims to bridge the gap between wet lab scientist and bioinformatics with an easy to setup configuration sheet and an automatically generated comprehensive report that contains all essential qualitative and quantitative results that should be reported. Besides the standard steps like preprocessing, mapping, visualization, and quantification of reads, the pipeline also incorporates differential expression analysis when given the appropriate information regarding sample groups. Although miND has a focus on miRNAs, other RNA species like tRNAs, piRNA, snRNA, or snoRNA are included and mapping statistics are available for further analysis. miND has been developed and tested on a multitude of data sets with various RNA sources (tissue, plasma, extracellular vesicles, urine, etc.) and different species. miND is a Snakemake based pipeline and thus incorporates all advantages using a flexible workflow management system. Reference databases are downloaded, prepared and built with an included (but separate) workflow and thus can easily be updated to the most recent version but also stored for reproducibility. In conclusion, the miND pipeline aims to streamline the bioinformatics processing of small RNA-seq data by standardizing the processing from raw data to a final, comprehensive and reproducible report.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Can enhancement and suppression concurrently guide attention? An assessment at the individual level [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Although people can pay attention to targets while ignoring distractors, previous research suggests that target enhancement and distractor suppression work separately and independently. Here, we sought to replicate previous findings and re-establish their independence. Methods: We employed an internet-based psychological experiment. We presented participants with a visual search task in which they searched for a specified shape with or without a singleton. We replicated the singleton-presence benefit in search performance, but this effect was limited to cases where the target color was fixed across all trials. In a randomly intermixed probe task (30% of all trials), the participants searched for a letter among colored probes; we used this task to assess how far attention was separately allocated toward the target or distractor dimensions. Results: We found a negative correlation between target enhancement and distractor suppression, indicating that the participants who paid closer attention to target features ignored distractor features less effectively and vice versa. Averaged data showed no benefit from target color or cost from distractor color, possibly because of the substantial differences in strategy across participants. Conclusions: These results suggest that target enhancement and distractor suppression guide attention in mutually dependent ways and that the relative contribution of these components depends on the participants’ search strategy.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Recommendations for the formatting of Variant Call Format (VCF) files to make plant genotyping data FAIR [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                In this opinion article, we discuss the formatting of files from (plant) genotyping studies, in particular the formatting of (meta-) data in Variant Call Format (VCF) files. The flexibility of the VCF format specification facilitates its use as a generic interchange format across domains but can lead to inconsistency between files in the presentation of metadata. To enable fully autonomous machine actionable data flow, generic elements need to be further specified. We strongly support the merits of the FAIR principles and see the need to facilitate them also through technical implementation specifications. VCF files are an established standard for the exchange and publication of genotyping data. Other data formats are also used to capture variant call data (for example, the HapMap format and the gVCF format), but none currently have the reach of VCF. In VCF, only the sites of variation are described, whereas in gVCF, all positions are listed, and confidence values are also provided. For the sake of simplicity, we will only discuss VCF and our recommendations for its use. However, the part of the VCF standard relating to metadata (as opposed to the actual variant calls) defines a syntactic format but no vocabulary, unique identifier or recommended content. In practice, often only sparse (if any) descriptive metadata is included. When descriptive metadata is provided, proprietary metadata fields are frequently added that have not been agreed upon within the community which may limit long-term and comprehensive interoperability. To address this, we propose recommendations for supplying and encoding metadata, focusing on use cases from the plant sciences. We expect there to be overlap, but also divergence, with the needs of other domains.

                In this essay, we argue that colleges of education, particularly those at research-intensive institutions, favor simplistic notions of scholarly impact and that this trend has concerning implications for the field, for researchers, and for the public at large. After describing the challenges and shortcomings of the current models of research assessment in education, we outline an alternative proposal in which trustworthiness and usability of research would complement traditional metrics of scholarly relevance. This proposal encourages a twofold approach to research assessment that involves (1) a more thorough analysis of the limitations and problems generated by the use of simplistic notions of scholarly impact, and (2) a commitment to the implementation of more equitable systems based on a broader range of assessment measures to assess faculty research contributions.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Conditioning Lesion Response in Dorsal Root Ganglion Neurons Is Inhibited in Oncomodulin Knock-Out Mice</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Regeneration can occur in peripheral neurons after injury, but the mechanisms involved are not fully delineated. Macrophages in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) are involved in the enhanced regeneration that occurs after a conditioning lesion (CL), but how macrophages stimulate this response is not known. Oncomodulin (Ocm) has been proposed as a proregenerative molecule secreted by macrophages and neutrophils, is expressed in the DRG after axotomy, and stimulates neurite outgrowth by DRG neurons in culture. Wild-type (WT) and <I>Ocm</I> knock-out (KO) mice were used to investigate whether Ocm plays a role in the CL response in DRG neurons after sciatic nerve transection. Neurite outgrowth was measured after 24 and 48 h in explant culture 7 d after a CL. Sciatic nerve regeneration was also measured <I>in vivo</I> 7 d after a CL and 2 d after a subsequent sciatic nerve crush. The magnitude of the increased neurite outgrowth following a CL was significantly smaller in explants from <I>Ocm</I> KO mice than in explants from WT mice. <I>In vivo</I> after a CL, increased regeneration was found in WT animals but not in KO animals. Macrophage accumulation and levels of <I>interleukin-6</I> (<I>IL-6</I>) mRNA were measured in axotomized DRG from WT and <I>Ocm</I> KO animals, and both were significantly higher than in sham-operated ganglia. At 6 h after axotomy, <I>Il</I>-6 mRNA was higher in WT than in <I>Ocm</I> KO mice. Our data support the hypothesis that Ocm plays a necessary role in producing a normal CL response and that its effects possibly result in part from stimulation of the expression of proregenerative macrophage cytokines such as IL-6.</p>

                Sufficiency measures are potentially decisive for the decarbonisation of energy systems but rarely considered in energy policy and modelling. Just as efficiency and renewable energies, the diffusion of demand-side solutions to climate change also relies on policy-making. Our extensive literature review of European and national sufficiency policies fills a gap in existing databases. We present almost 300 policy instruments clustered into relevant categories and publish them as "Energy Sufficiency Policy Database". This paper provides a description of the data clustering, the set-up of the database and an analysis of the policy instruments. A key insight is that sufficiency policy includes much more than bans of products or information tools leaving the responsibility to individuals. It is a comprehensive instrument mix of all policy types, not only enabling sufficiency action, but also reducing currently existing barriers. A policy database can serve as a good starting point for policy recommendations and modelling, further research is needed on barriers and demand-reduction potentials of sufficiency policy instruments.

                The Neuroimaging Data Model (NIDM) is a series of specifications for describing all aspects of the neuroimaging data lifecycle from raw data to analyses and provenance. NIDM uses community-driven terminologies along with unambiguous data dictionaries within a Resource Description Framework (RDF) document to describe data and metadata for integration and query. Data from different studies, using locally defined variable names, can be retrieved by linking them to higher-order concepts from established ontologies and terminologies. Through these capabilities, NIDM documents are expected to improve reproducibility and facilitate data discovery and reuse. PyNIDM is a Python toolbox supporting the creation, manipulation, and querying of NIDM documents. Using the query tools available in PyNIDM, users are able interrogate datasets to find studies that have collected variables measuring similar phenotypic properties. This, in turn, facilitates the transformation and combination of data across multiple studies. The focus of this manuscript is the linear regression tool which is a part of the PyNIDM toolbox and works directly on NIDM documents. It provides a high-level statistical analysis that aids researchers in gaining more insight into the data that they are considering combining across studies. This saves researchers valuable time and effort while showing potential relationships between variables. The linear regression tool operates through a command-line interface integrated with the other tools (pynidm linear-regression) and provides the user with the opportunity to specify variables of interest using the rich query techniques available for NIDM documents and then conduct a linear regression with optional contrast and regularization.

                Introduction: Faith and systems of beliefs are known to impact not only the emotional, but also the immunological state of believers in ways that we are just starting to understand. Moreover, clinical implications of previous studies are limited.  The aim of the “HEALING” (Hospital-based Ecumenical and Linguistic Immuno-NeuroloGic) Study was to examine immunological and neurological changes in hospitalized patients after meeting a chaplain coupled with biblical readings. Methods: Hospitalized patients were pre-screened to find those who were the most in need of an intervention. A passage from the Bible was read to them during a meeting with the chaplain at the bedside (n= 20) or in the chapel (n= 18). No meeting occurred in the randomized control group (n=19). Blood samples were taken 30 minutes prior, and 60 minutes after the meeting to measure white blood cells (WBC), interferon gamma (IFN-γ), immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgA, IgG, and complement 3 (C3). A subgroup of the visited patients was subjected to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), where they were played an audiotape of readings of the same passage from the Bible (n=21). Results: Lymphocyte counts increased more often after the more successful visits, but the immunological changes were not significant. Conversely, a significant (pfwe=0.003) correlation was revealed between changes in lymphocytes and activation of the angular gyrus (left BA39) during fMRI, a brain area involved in word recognition. Conclusions: Although limited by the sample size and cohort study design, the findings suggest the depth of psycho-immunological changes could depend on the degree to which the chaplains’ main message is understood.

                This case report describes an unreported case of  Purtscher-like retinopathy in a patient with pulmonary adenocarcinoma. A 39-year-old man was hospitalized for exploration of a hemoptysis and bilateral blurry vision. Fundoscopic examination showed multiple areas of retinal whitening in the peripapillary area. A chest computed tomography scan then showed a ground glass opacity in the right upper lobe associated to a hilar lymphadenopathy. A thoracotomy and lung biopsy were performed concluding with the diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma. The patient was treated with high-dose corticosteroids and received Taxol-Carboplatin chemotherapy with good visual outcomes. The article discusses furthermore the importance of including pulmonary adenocarcinoma to the list of systemic conditions for Purtscher-like retinopathy.

                Background Evidence on the affordability and cost-effectiveness of interventions is critical to decision-making for clinical practice guidelines and development of national health policies. This study aimed to develop a repository of primary economic evaluations to support global maternal health guideline development and provide insights into the body of research conducted in this field. Methods A scoping review was conducted to identify and map available economic evaluations of maternal health interventions. We searched six databases (NHS Economic Evaluation Database, EconLit, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL and PsycInfo) on 20 November 2020 with no date, setting or language restrictions. Two authors assessed eligibility and extracted data independently. Included studies were categorised by subpopulation of women, level of care, intervention type, mechanism, and period, economic evaluation type and perspective, and whether the intervention is currently recommended by the World Health Organization. Frequency analysis was used to determine prevalence of parameters. Results In total 923 studies conducted in 72 countries were included. Most studies were conducted in high-income country settings (71.8%). Over half pertained to a general population of pregnant women, with the remainder focused on specific subgroups, such as women with preterm birth (6.2%) or those undergoing caesarean section (5.5%). The most common interventions of interest related to non-obstetric infections (23.9%), labour and childbirth care (17.0%), and obstetric complications (15.7%). Few studies addressed the major causes of maternal deaths globally. Over a third (36.5%) of studies were cost-utility analyses, 1.4% were cost-benefit analyses and the remainder were cost-effectiveness analyses. Conclusions This review provides a navigable, consolidated resource of economic evaluations in maternal health. We identified a clear evidence gap regarding economic evaluations of maternal health interventions in low- and middle-income countries.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">SiteMotif: A graph-based algorithm for deriving structural motifs in Protein Ligand binding sites</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Santhosh Sankar, Nagasuma Chandra</p>

Studying similarities in protein molecules has become a fundamental activity in much of biology and biomedical research, for which methods such as multiple sequence alignments are widely used. Most methods available for such comparisons cater to studying proteins which have clearly recognizable evolutionary relationships but not to proteins that recognize the same or similar ligands but do not share similarities in their sequence or structural folds. In many cases, proteins in the latter class share structural similarities only in their binding sites. While several algorithms are available for comparing binding sites, there are none for deriving structural motifs of the binding sites, independent of the whole proteins. We report the development of SiteMotif, a new algorithm that compares binding sites from multiple proteins and derives sequence-order independent structural site motifs. We have tested the algorithm at multiple levels of complexity and demonstrate its performance in different scenarios. We have benchmarked against 3 current methods available for binding site comparison and demonstrate superior performance of our algorithm. We show that SiteMotif identifies new structural motifs of spatially conserved residues in proteins, even when there is no sequence or fold-level similarity. We expect SiteMotif to be useful for deriving key mechanistic insights into the mode of ligand interaction, predict the ligand type that a protein can bind and improve the sensitivity of functional annotation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Measuring the repertoire of age-related behavioral changes in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Katherine E. Overman, Daniel M. Choi, Kawai Leung, Joshua W. Shaevitz, Gordon J. Berman</p>

Aging affects almost all aspects of an organism—its morphology, its physiology, its behavior. Isolating which biological mechanisms are regulating these changes, however, has proven difficult, potentially due to our inability to characterize the full repertoire of an animal’s behavior across the lifespan. Using data from fruit flies (<i>D. melanogaster</i>) we measure the full repertoire of behaviors as a function of age. We observe a sexually dimorphic pattern of changes in the behavioral repertoire during aging. Although the stereotypy of the behaviors and the complexity of the repertoire overall remains relatively unchanged, we find evidence that the observed alterations in behavior can be explained by changing the fly’s overall energy budget, suggesting potential connections between metabolism, aging, and behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Inferring RNA-binding protein target preferences using adversarial domain adaptation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ying Liu, Ruihui Li, Jiawei Luo, Zhaolei Zhang</p>

Precise identification of target sites of RNA-binding proteins (RBP) is important to understand their biochemical and cellular functions. A large amount of experimental data is generated by in vivo and in vitro approaches. The binding preferences determined from these platforms share similar patterns but there are discernable differences between these datasets. Computational methods trained on one dataset do not always work well on another dataset. To address this problem which resembles the classic “domain shift” in deep learning, we adopted the adversarial domain adaptation (ADDA) technique and developed a framework (RBP-ADDA) that can extract RBP binding preferences from an integration of in vivo and vitro datasets. Compared with conventional methods, ADDA has the advantage of working with two input datasets, as it trains the initial neural network for each dataset individually, projects the two datasets onto a feature space, and uses an adversarial framework to derive an optimal network that achieves an optimal discriminative predictive power. In the first step, for each RBP, we include only the in vitro data to pre-train a source network and a task predictor. Next, for the same RBP, we initiate the target network by using the source network and use adversarial domain adaptation to update the target network using both in vitro and in vivo data. These two steps help leverage the in vitro data to improve the prediction on in vivo data, which is typically challenging with a lower signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, to further take the advantage of the fused source and target data, we fine-tune the task predictor using both data. We showed that RBP-ADDA achieved better performance in modeling in vivo RBP binding data than other existing methods as judged by Pearson correlations. It also improved predictive performance on in vitro datasets. We further applied augmentation operations on RBPs with less in vivo data to expand the input data and showed that it can improve prediction performances. Lastly, we explored the predictive interpretability of RBP-ADDA, where we quantified the contribution of the input features by Integrated Gradients and identified nucleotide positions that are important for RBP recognition.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Classification of bursting patterns: A tale of two ducks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mathieu Desroches, John Rinzel, Serafim Rodrigues</p>

Bursting is one of the fundamental rhythms that excitable cells can generate either in response to incoming stimuli or intrinsically. It has been a topic of intense research in computational biology for several decades. The classification of bursting oscillations in excitable systems has been the subject of active research since the early 1980s and is still ongoing. As a by-product, it establishes analytical and numerical foundations for studying complex temporal behaviors in multiple timescale models of cellular activity. In this review, we first present the seminal works of Rinzel and Izhikevich in classifying bursting patterns of excitable systems. We recall a complementary mathematical classification approach by Bertram and colleagues, and then by Golubitsky and colleagues, which, together with the Rinzel-Izhikevich proposals, provide the state-of-the-art foundations to these classifications. Beyond classical approaches, we review a recent bursting example that falls outside the previous classification systems. Generalizing this example leads us to propose an extended classification, which requires the analysis of both fast and slow subsystems of an underlying slow-fast model and allows the dissection of a larger class of bursters. Namely, we provide a general framework for bursting systems with both subthreshold and superthreshold oscillations. A new class of bursters with at least 2 slow variables is then added, which we denote <i>folded-node bursters</i>, to convey the idea that the bursts are initiated or annihilated via a <i>folded-node</i> singularity. Key to this mechanism are so-called <i>canard</i> or <i>duck</i> orbits, organizing the underpinning excitability structure. We describe the 2 main families of folded-node bursters, depending upon the phase (active/spiking or silent/nonspiking) of the bursting cycle during which folded-node dynamics occurs. We classify both families and give examples of minimal systems displaying these novel bursting patterns. Finally, we provide a biophysical example by reinterpreting a generic conductance-based <i>episodic burster</i> as a folded-node burster, showing that the associated framework can explain its subthreshold oscillations over a larger parameter region than the fast subsystem approach.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Evolutionary information helps understand distinctive features of the angiotensin II receptors AT1 and AT2 in amniota</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rym Ben Boubaker, Asma Tiss, Daniel Henrion, Hajer Guissouma, Marie Chabbert</p>

In vertebrates, the octopeptide angiotensin II (AngII) is an important <i>in vivo</i> regulator of the cardiovascular system. It acts mainly through two G protein-coupled receptors, AT1 and AT2. To better understand distinctive features of these receptors, we carried out a phylogenetic analysis that revealed a mirror evolution of AT1 and AT2, each one split into two clades, separating fish from terrestrial receptors. It also revealed that hallmark mutations occurred at, or near, the sodium binding site in both AT1 and AT2. Electrostatics computations and molecular dynamics simulations support maintained sodium binding to human AT1 with slow ingress from the extracellular side and an electrostatic component of the binding free energy around -3kT, to be compared to around -2kT for human AT2 and the δ opioid receptor. Comparison of the sodium binding modes in wild type and mutated AT1 and AT2 from humans and eels indicates that the allosteric control by sodium in both AT1 and AT2 evolved during the transition from fish to amniota. The unusual S7.46N mutation in AT1 is mirrored by a L3.36M mutation in AT2. In the presence of sodium, the N7.46 pattern in amniota AT1 stabilizes the inward orientation of N3.35 in the apo receptor, which should contribute to efficient N3.35 driven biased signaling. The M3.36 pattern in amniota AT2 favours the outward orientation of N3.35 and the receptor promiscuity. Both mutations have physiological consequences for the regulation of the renin-angiotensin system.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Camptothecin effectively treats obesity in mice through GDF15 induction</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jun Feng Lu, Meng Qing Zhu, Bao Cai Xie, Xiao Chen Shi, Huan Liu, Rui Xin Zhang, Bo Xia, Jiang Wei Wu</p>

Elevated circulating levels of growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) have been shown to reduce food intake and lower body weight through activation of hindbrain receptor glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) receptor alpha-like (GFRAL) in rodents and nonhuman primates, thus endogenous induction of this peptide holds promise for obesity treatment. Here, through <i>in silico</i> drug-screening methods, we found that small molecule Camptothecin (CPT), a previously identified drug with potential antitumor activity, is a GDF15 inducer. Oral CPT administration increases circulating GDF15 levels in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice and genetic <i>ob/ob</i> mice, with elevated <i>Gdf15</i> expression predominantly in the liver through activation of integrated stress response. In line with GDF15’s anorectic effect, CPT suppresses food intake, thereby reducing body weight, blood glucose, and hepatic fat content in obese mice. Conversely, CPT loses these beneficial effects when <i>Gdf15</i> is inhibited by a neutralizing antibody or AAV8-mediated liver-specific knockdown. Similarly, CPT failed to reduce food intake and body weight in GDF15’s specific receptor GFRAL-deficient mice despite high levels of GDF15. Together, these results indicate that CPT is a promising anti-obesity agent through activation of GDF15-GFRAL pathway.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Association between S-COMT activity and impulsive and premeditated aggression in a population of violent offenders: preliminary results of a cross sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Aggression can be conceptualised as a physical act towards another person, verbal offenses, destructive acts towards objects, and self-inflicted harmful acts. It is highly frequent in the context of Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) and has been correlated to disturbances in the dopaminergic system. In the prefrontal cortex, the dopamine metabolism depends on catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). DRD2 receptors also play a role in the expression of aggression by modulating dopamine metabolism, in the striatum. In this study, we evaluated the association between COMT activity and type of aggression, in a sample of violent male offenders. Participants were subjected to sociodemographic, clinical, and psychometric evaluation through standardised instruments. Erythrocyte S-COMT activity was measured, and COMT and the DRD2 genotypes were analysed. Individuals displaying impulsive aggression showed lower S-COMT erythrocyte activity (p=0.026) and lower frequency of Val/Val (rs4680) genotype than individuals with premeditated aggression (p=0.047). S-COMT erythrocyte activity was positively correlated with the PCL-R total score (r=0.34; p=0.018). In conclusion, our preliminary results indicate that COMT can be associated to different aggression types in violent offenders, and it can represent a possible pharmacological target for the treatment of impulsive and premeditated aggression, in incarcerated patients.

                Background: Emvolio is a non-medical device, indigenously developed portable refrigeration for maintaining the internal temperature 2–8˚C. The Indian Patent Office has granted patent for applications such as preservation and transport of medicines, vaccines, food, beverages, dairy etc. Further, use of Emvolio can be utilized in transport and store biologicals to preserve their biochemical and cellular integrity.  The objective of this study was to evaluate the biochemical and haematological integrity of biological samples such as rat blood, serum and liver. Methods: The steady temperature was maintained inside the Emvolio, and it was compared to that of thermocol and polypropylene boxes aided with frozen gel packs. The blood and liver samples were isolated from Wistar rats and kept in Emvolio, thermocol and polypropylene boxes for 10 hrs, and the temperature was monitored. The blood parameters, namely red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC), platelets, haematocrit, haemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and red cell distribution width (RDW), serum parameters like alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, total protein, albumin, creatine kinase, blood urea nitrogen and liver parameters like superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), catalase were estimated and compared. Results: Emvolio maintained a constant inner temperature range of 2–8˚C, whereas a significant temperature variation was seen in thermocol and polypropylene boxes. There was no significant deviation in the parameters tested when samples were kept in Emvolio for six hours compared to the zero hour readings. In contrast, there was a significant deviation among the parameters for the samples kept in thermocol and polypropylene boxes for six hours compared to zero hour parameters. Conclusions: Emvolio maintained constant temperature and preserved the biological integrity of rat blood, serum and liver. Thus, Emvolio can be efficiently used as a biological sample carrier, especially in preclinical studies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">EMI radiation of power transmission lines in Malaysia [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: There has been rising concern amongst the public regarding their home's proximity to high tension power transmission lines. The primary cause of fear is the impact of the electromagnetic interference (EMI) radiation on the nearby occupants' health. Despite the presence of national permissible limits of EMI radiation, there is still lack of information with regards to the EMI radiation of the types of power lines configuration in Malaysia. Methods: The electric and magnetic fields of several selected power transmission lines were simulated using the EMFACDC software program from the recommendation ITU-T K.90. Five types of power transmission lines available in Malaysia are considered. Results: It was found that the simulated electric and magnetic field levels at all the power lines' right of way (ROW) boundary complies with the prescribed exposure limit. However, the electromagnetic fields (EMF) level increases significantly as the separation distance is reduced from 30m. For a more conservative approach, the ROW can be set at 30m across all transmission voltage level and corridor area condition. Conclusion: It can be concluded that Malaysia's power transmission lines are within the prescribed exposure limits. To further minimize the electric and magnetic field level, it is recommended that the residential building should be built at least 30 meters away from the power transmission lines, especially for the 275kV double circuit, 275/132kV quadruple circuit, and 500kV double circuit lines.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Lupeol and pristimerin do not inhibit activation of the human sperm CatSper Ca(2+)-channel [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Opposing findings have been published on the regulation of the sperm-specific Ca2+ channel CatSper (cation channel of sperm) in human sperm cells by the plant triterpenoids lupeol and pristimerin. While the original study on this topic found these triterpenoids to act as potent inhibitors of human CatSper, subsequent studies have failed to replicate such an inhibitory effect. It has been suggested that these issues could in part be due to purity issues and/or batch variation between the plant-derived extracts of lupeol and pristimerin obtained for the studies. The aim of this study was to elucidate this controversy by investigating the batches of lupeol and pristimerin used in our previous study with state-of-the-art 1H-, 13C- and 2D-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods to reveal potential purity and/or batch variation issues. When comparing the NMR-spectra obtained from 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR with previously published NMR-spectra for lupeol and pristimerin, we could confirm that both the lupeol and pristimerin batch were ≥95 % pure. These results confirm the validity of the findings in our previous study for lupeol and pristimerin, showing that lupeol and pristimerin do not inhibit activation of CatSper in human sperm. In conclusion, using 1H-, 13C- and 2D-NMR methods, we confirm that the lupeol and pristimerin batches used in our previous study were ≥95 % pure and thereby fail to identify any purity issues and/or batch variation that could explain the observed inability of lupeol and pristimerin to inhibit activation of CatSper in human sperm.

This coupling of the transcript of a short-lived mitochondrial protein to the movement of its target organelles ensures the functionality of the PINK1-dependent degradation of damaged mitochondria in distal parts of the cell.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Colicin E1 opens its hinge to plug TolC</a></h4>

              
                The double membrane architecture of Gram-negative bacteria forms a barrier that is impermeable to most extracellular threats. Bacteriocin proteins evolved to exploit the accessible, surface-exposed proteins embedded in the outer membrane to deliver cytotoxic cargo. Colicin E1 is a bacteriocin produced by, and lethal to, <i>Escherichia coli</i> that hijacks the outer membrane proteins TolC and BtuB to enter the cell. Here we capture the colicin E1 translocation domain inside its membrane receptor, TolC, by high-resolution cryoEM to obtain the first reported structure of a bacteriocin bound to TolC. Colicin E1 binds stably to TolC as an open hinge through the TolC pore-an architectural rearrangement from colicin E1's unbound conformation. This binding is stable in live <i>E. coli </i>cells as indicated by single-molecule fluorescence microscopy. Finally, colicin E1 fragments binding to TolC plug the channel, inhibiting its native efflux function as an antibiotic efflux pump and heightening susceptibility to three antibiotic classes. In addition to demonstrating that these protein fragments are useful starting points for developing novel antibiotic potentiators, this method could be expanded to other colicins to inhibit other outer membrane protein functions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Nanoscale binding site localization by molecular distance estimation on native cell surfaces using topological image averaging</a></h4>

              
                Antibody binding to cell surface proteins plays a crucial role in immunity, and the location of an epitope can altogether determine the immunological outcome of a host-target interaction. Techniques available today for epitope identification are costly, time-consuming, and unsuited for high-throughput analysis. Fast and efficient screening of epitope location can be useful for the development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and vaccines. Cellular morphology typically varies, and antibodies often bind heterogeneously across a cell surface, making traditional particle-averaging strategies challenging for accurate native antibody localization. In the present work, we have developed a method, SiteLoc, for imaging-based molecular localization on cellular surface proteins. Nanometer-scale resolution is achieved through localization in one dimension, namely, the distance from a bound ligand to a reference surface. This is done by using topological image averaging. Our results show that this method is well suited for antibody binding site measurements on native cell surface morphology and that it can be applied to other molecular distance estimations as well.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">In vivo fluorescence lifetime imaging of macrophage intracellular metabolism during wound responses in zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                The function of macrophages in vitro is linked to their metabolic rewiring. However, macrophage metabolism remains poorly characterized in situ. Here, we used two-photon intensity and lifetime imaging of autofluorescent metabolic coenzymes, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) (NAD(P)H) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), to assess the metabolism of macrophages in the wound microenvironment. Inhibiting glycolysis reduced NAD(P)H mean lifetime and made the intracellular redox state of macrophages more oxidized, as indicated by reduced optical redox ratio. We found that TNFα+ macrophages had lower NAD(P)H mean lifetime and were more oxidized compared to TNFα− macrophages. Both infection and thermal injury induced a macrophage population with a more oxidized redox state in wounded tissues. Kinetic analysis detected temporal changes in the optical redox ratio during tissue repair, revealing a shift toward a more reduced redox state over time. Metformin reduced TNFα+ wound macrophages, made intracellular redox state more reduced and improved tissue repair. By contrast, depletion of STAT6 increased TNFα+ wound macrophages, made redox state more oxidized and impaired regeneration. Our findings suggest that autofluorescence of NAD(P)H and FAD is sensitive to dynamic changes in intracellular metabolism in tissues and can be used to probe the temporal and spatial regulation of macrophage metabolism during tissue damage and repair.

                The NLRP3 inflammasome coordinates inflammation in response to different pathogen- and damage-associated molecular patterns, being implicated in different infectious, chronic inflammatory, metabolic and degenerative diseases. In chronic tendinopathic lesions, different non-resolving mechanisms produce a degenerative condition that impairs tissue healing and which therefore complicates their clinical management. Percutaneous needle electrolysis consists of the application of a galvanic current and is an emerging treatment for tendinopathies. In the present study, we found that galvanic current activates the NLRP3 inflammasome and induces an inflammatory response that promotes a collagen-mediated regeneration of the tendon in mice. This study establishes the molecular mechanism of percutaneous electrolysis that can be used to treat chronic lesions and describes the beneficial effects of an induced inflammasome-related response.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Complex effects of kinase localization revealed by compartment-specific regulation of protein kinase A activity</a></h4>

              
                Kinase activity in signaling networks frequently depends on regulatory subunits that can both inhibit activity by interacting with the catalytic subunits and target the kinase to distinct molecular partners and subcellular compartments. Here, using a new synthetic molecular interaction system, we show that translocation of a regulatory subunit of the protein kinase A (PKA-R) to the plasma membrane has a paradoxical effect on the membrane kinase activity. It can both enhance it at lower translocation levels, even in the absence of signaling inputs, and inhibit it at higher translocation levels, suggesting its role as a linker that can both couple and decouple signaling processes in a concentration-dependent manner. We further demonstrate that superposition of gradients of PKA-R abundance across single cells can control the directionality of cell migration, reversing it at high enough input levels. Thus, complex in vivo patterns of PKA-R localization can drive complex phenotypes, including cell migration.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Humans perseverate on punishment avoidance goals in multigoal reinforcement learning</a></h4>

              
                Managing multiple goals is essential to adaptation, yet we are only beginning to understand computations by which we navigate the resource-demands entailed in so doing. Here, we sought to elucidate how humans balance reward seeking and punishment avoidance goals, and relate this to variation in its expression within anxious individuals. To do so, we developed a novel multigoal pursuit task that includes trial-specific instructed goals to either pursue reward (without risk of punishment) or avoid punishment (without the opportunity for reward). We constructed a computational model of multigoal pursuit to quantify the degree to which participants could disengage from the pursuit goals when instructed to, as well as devote less model-based resources towards goals that were less abundant. In general, participants (n=192) were less flexible in avoiding punishment than in pursuing reward. Thus, when instructed to pursue reward, participants often persisted in avoiding features that had previously been associated with punishment, even though at decision time these features were unambiguously benign. In a similar vein, participants showed no significant downregulation of avoidance when punishment avoidance goals were less abundant in the task. Importantly, we show preliminary evidence that individuals with chronic worry may have difficulty disengaging from punishment avoidance when instructed to seek reward. Taken together, the findings demonstrate that people avoid punishment less flexibly than they pursue reward. Future studies should test in larger samples whether a difficulty to disengage from punishment avoidance contributes to chronic worry.

Moreover, it is unclear to what extent other genotoxic conditions can trigger protein aggregation as well. Here, we show that targeting ATM, but also ATR or DNA topoisomerases, results in the widespread aggregation of a metastable, disease-associated subfraction of the proteome. Aggregation-prone model substrates, including Huntingtin exon 1 containing an expanded polyglutamine repeat, aggregate faster under these conditions. This increased aggregation results from an overload of chaperone systems, which lowers the cell-intrinsic threshold for proteins to aggregate. In line with this, we find that inhibition of the HSP70 chaperone system further exacerbates the increased protein aggregation. Moreover, we identify the molecular chaperone HSPB5 as a cell-specific suppressor of it. Our findings reveal that various genotoxic conditions trigger widespread protein aggregation in a manner that is highly reminiscent of the aggregation occurring in situations of proteotoxic stress and in proteinopathies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Impairing one sensory modality enhances another by reconfiguring peptidergic signalling in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                Animals that lose one sensory modality often show augmented responses to other sensory inputs. The mechanisms underpinning this cross-modal plasticity are poorly understood. We probe such mechanisms by performing a forward genetic screen for mutants with enhanced O<sub>2</sub> perception in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. Multiple mutants exhibiting increased O<sub>2</sub> responsiveness concomitantly show defects in other sensory responses. One mutant, <i>qui-1</i>, defective in a conserved NACHT/WD40 protein, abolishes pheromone-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in the ADL pheromone-sensing neurons. At the same time, ADL responsiveness to pre-synaptic input from O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons is heightened in <i>qui-1</i>, and other sensory defective mutants, resulting in enhanced neurosecretion although not increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses. Expressing <i>qui-1</i> selectively in ADL rescues both the <i>qui-1</i> ADL neurosecretory phenotype and enhanced escape from 21% O<sub>2</sub>. Profiling ADL neurons in <i>qui-1</i> mutants highlights extensive changes in gene expression, notably of many neuropeptide receptors. We show that elevated ADL expression of the conserved neuropeptide receptor NPR-22 is necessary for enhanced ADL neurosecretion in <i>qui-1</i> mutants, and is sufficient to confer increased ADL neurosecretion in control animals. Sensory loss can thus confer cross-modal plasticity by changing the peptidergic connectome.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mechanisms of distributed working memory in a large-scale network of macaque neocortex</a></h4>

              
                Neural activity underlying working memory is not a local phenomenon but distributed across multiple brain regions. To elucidate the circuit mechanism of such distributed activity, we developed an anatomically constrained computational model of large-scale macaque cortex. We found that mnemonic internal states may emerge from inter-areal reverberation, even in a regime where none of the isolated areas is capable of generating self-sustained activity. The mnemonic activity pattern along the cortical hierarchy indicates a transition in space, separating areas engaged in working memory and those which do not. A host of spatially distinct attractor states is found, potentially subserving various internal processes. The model yields testable predictions, including the idea of counterstream inhibitory bias, the role of prefrontal areas in controlling distributed attractors, and the resilience of distributed activity to lesions or inactivation. This work provides a theoretical framework for identifying large-scale brain mechanisms and computational principles of distributed cognitive processes.

                Atmospheric Particulate Matter (PM) is one of the leading environmental risk factors for the global burden of disease. Increasing epidemiological studies demonstrated that PM plays a significant role in CNS demyelinating disorders; however, there is no direct testimony of this, and yet the molecular mechanism by which the occurrence remains unclear. Using multiple <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> strategies, in the present study we demonstrate that PM exposure aggravates neuroinflammation, myelin injury, and dysfunction of movement coordination ability via boosting microglial pro-inflammatory activities, in both the pathological demyelination and physiological myelinogenesis animal models. Indeed, pharmacological disturbance combined with RNA-seq and ChIP-seq suggests that TLR-4/NF-kB signaling mediated a core network of genes that control PM-triggered microglia pathogenicity. In summary, our study defines a novel atmospheric environmental mechanism that mediates PM-aggravated microglia pathogenic activities, and establishes a systematic approach for the investigation of the effects of environmental exposure in neurologic disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Creation of photocyclic vertebrate rhodopsin by single amino acid substitution</a></h4>

              
                Opsins are universal photoreceptive proteins in animals and can be classified into three types based on their photoreaction properties. Upon light irradiation, vertebrate rhodopsin forms a metastable active state, which cannot revert back to the original dark state via either photoreaction or thermal reaction. By contrast, after photoreception, most opsins form a stable active state which can photoconvert back to the dark state. Moreover, we recently found a novel type of opsins whose activity is regulated by photocycling. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this diversification of opsins remains unknown. In this study, we showed that vertebrate rhodopsin acquired the photocyclic and photoreversible properties upon introduction of a single mutation at position 188. This revealed that the residue at position 188 contributes to the diversification of photoreaction properties of opsins by its regulation of the recovery from the active state to the original dark state.

                We present neural models of one of humans' most astonishing cognitive feats: the ability to interpret linguistic instructions in order to perform novel tasks with just a few practice trials. Models are trained on a set of commonly studied psychophysical tasks, and receive linguistic instructions embedded by transformer architectures pre-trained on natural language processing. Our best performing models can perform an unknown task with a performance of 80% correct on average based solely on linguistic instructions (i.e. 0-shot learning), and 90% after 3 learning updates. We found that the resulting neural representations capture the semantic structure of interrelated tasks even for novel tasks, allowing for the composition of practiced skills in unseen settings. Finally, we also demonstrate how this model can generate a linguistic description of a task it has identified using motor feedback, which, when communicated to another network, leads to near perfect performance (95%). To our knowledge, this is the first experimentally testable model of how language can structure sensorimotor representations to allow for task compositionality.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Odorant receptor orthologues in conifer-feeding beetles display conserved responses to ecologically relevant odors</a></h4>

              
                Insects are able to detect a plethora of olfactory cues in the environment using a divergent family of odorant receptors (ORs). Despite the divergent nature of this family, related species frequently express several evolutionarily conserved OR orthologues. In Coleoptera, it remains unknown whether OR orthologues have conserved or divergent functions in different species. We addressed this question through functional characterization of two groups of OR orthologues in three species of the Curculionidae (weevil) family, the conifer-feeding bark beetles Ips typographus ('Ityp') and Dendroctonus ponderosae ('Dpon') (both in subfamily Scolytinae), and the pine weevil Hylobius abietis ('Habi'; Molytinae). The ORs of H. abietis were annotated from antennal transcriptomes. Results show highly conserved response specificities, with one group of orthologues (HabiOR3/DponOR8/ItypOR6) responding exclusively to 2-phenylethanol (2-PE), and the other group (HabiOR4/DponOR9/ItypOR5) responding to angiosperm green leaf volatile (GLV) alcohols. Both groups of orthologues belong to the major coleopteran OR group 2B, and share a common ancestor with OR5 in the cerambycid Megacyllene caryae, also tuned to 2-PE, suggesting a shared evolutionary history of 2-PE receptors across two beetle superfamilies. The detected compounds are ecologically relevant for conifer-feeding curculionids, and are probably linked to fitness, with GLVs being used to avoid angiosperm non-host plants, and 2-PE being important for intraspecific communication and/or playing a putative role in beetle-microbe symbioses. To our knowledge, this study is the first to reveal evolutionary conservation of OR functions across several beetle species and hence sheds new light on the functional evolution of beetle ORs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Theta-phase connectivity between medial prefrontal and posterior areas underlies novel instructions implementation</a></h4>

              
                Implementing novel instructions is a complex and uniquely human cognitive ability, that requires the rapid and flexible conversion of symbolic content into a format that enables the execution of the instructed behavior. Preparing to implement novel instructions, as opposed to their mere maintenance, involves the activation of the instructed motor plans, and the binding of the action information to the specific context in which this should be executed. Recent evidence and prominent computational models suggest that this efficient configuration of the system might involve a central role of frontal theta oscillations in establishing top-down long-range synchronization between distant and task-relevant brain areas. In the present EEG study (human subjects, 30 females, 4 males), we demonstrate that proactively preparing for the implementation of novels instructions, as opposed to their maintenance, involves a strengthened degree of connectivity in the theta frequency range between medial prefrontal and motor/visual areas. Moreover, we replicated previous results showing oscillatory features associated specifically with implementation demands, and extended on them demonstrating the role of theta oscillations in mediating the effect of task demands on behavioral performance. Taken together, these findings support our hypothesis that the modulation of connectivity patterns between frontal and task-relevant posterior brain areas is a core factor in the emergence of a behavior-guiding format from novel instructions.

                The claustrum (CLA) is a conspicuous subcortical structure interconnected with cortical and subcortical regions. However, its regional anatomy and cell-type-specific connections in the mouse remain largely undetermined. Here, we accurately delineated the boundary of the mouse CLA and quantitatively investigated its inputs and outputs brain-wide using anterograde and retrograde viral tracing and fully reconstructed single claustral principal neurons. At a population level, the CLA reciprocally connects with all isocortical modules. It also receives inputs from at least 35 subcortical structures but sends projections back to only a few of them. We found that cell types projecting to the CLA are differentiated by cortical areas and layers. We classified single CLA principal neurons into at least 9 cell types that innervate the diverse sets of functionally linked cortical targets. Axons of interneurons within the CLA arborize along almost its entire anteroposterior extent. Together, this detailed wiring diagram of the cell-type-specific connections of the mouse CLA lays a foundation for studying its functions.

                The hypothalamic neuropeptide, oxytocin (OT), exerts prominent analgesic effects via central and peripheral action. Here we discovered a novel subset of OT neurons whose projections preferentially terminate on OT receptor (OTR)-expressing neurons in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG). Using a newly generated line of transgenic rats (OTR-IRES-Cre), we determined that most of the vlPAG OTR expressing cells being targeted by OT projections are GABAergic in nature. Both optogenetically-evoked axonal OT release in the vlPAG as well as chemogenetic activation of OTR vlPAG neurons results in a long-lasting overall increase of vlPAG neuronal activity. This then leads to an indirect suppression of sensory neuron activity in the spinal cord and strong analgesia. Finally, we describe a novel OT-vlPAG-spinal cord circuit that seems critical for analgesia in the context of both inflammatory and neuropathic pain.

                Macaque inferior temporal cortex neurons respond selectively to complex visual images, with recent work showing that they are also entrained reliably by the evolving content of natural movies. To what extent does visual continuity itself shape the responses of high-level visual neurons? We addressed this question by measuring how cells in face-selective regions of the macaque temporal cortex were affected by the manipulation of a movie's temporal structure. Sampling the movie at 1s intervals, we measured neural responses to randomized, brief stimuli of different lengths, ranging from 800 ms dynamic movie snippets to 100 ms static frames. We found that the disruption of temporal continuity strongly altered neural response profiles, particularly in the early onset response period of the randomized stimulus. The results suggest that models of visual system function based on discrete and randomized visual presentations may not translate well to the brain's natural modes of operation.

                Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is characterized by alcohol use coupled with chronic relapse and involves brain regions including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). Here, we explore whether a subpopulation of BNST neurons, somatostatin (SST) expressing GABAergic neurons, play a role in an animal model of binge-like alcohol consumption, the Drinking in the Dark (DID) model. Chemogenetic activation of BNST SST neurons reduced binge alcohol consumption in female but not male SST-Cre mice, while inhibition of these neurons in the same mice had no effect. In addition, chemogenetic activation of these neurons did not cause apparent changes in models of anxiety-like behavior in either sex. Basal SST cell counts and intrinsic excitability of SST neurons were compared to attempt to understand sex differences in DREADD-induced changes in drinking, and while males had a greater number of BNST SST neurons, this effect went away when normalizing for total BNST volume. Together, these results suggest SST neurons in the BNST should be further explored as a potential neuronal subtype modulated by AUD, and for their therapeutic potential.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Detection of functional activity in brain white matter using fiber architecture informed synchrony mapping</a></h4>

              
                A general linear model is widely used for analyzing fMRI data, in which the blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signals in gray matter (GM) evoked in response to neural stimulation are modeled by convolving the time course of the expected neural activity with a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) obtained a priori. The maps of brain activity produced reflect the magnitude of local BOLD responses. However, detecting BOLD signals in white matter (WM) is more challenging as the BOLD signals are weaker and the HRF is different, and may vary more across the brain. Here we propose a model-free approach to detect changes in BOLD signals in WM by measuring task-evoked increases of BOLD signal synchrony in WM fibers. The proposed approach relies on a simple assumption that, in response to a functional task, BOLD signals in relevant fibers are modulated by stimulus-evoked neural activity and thereby show greater synchrony than when measured in a resting state, even if their magnitudes do not change significantly. This approach is implemented in two technical stages. First, for each voxel a fiber-architecture-informed spatial window is created with orientation distribution functions constructed from diffusion imaging data. This provides the basis for defining neighborhoods in WM that share similar local fiber architectures. Second, a modified principal component analysis (PCA) is used to estimate the synchrony of BOLD signals in each spatial window. The proposed approach is validated using a 3T fMRI dataset from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) at a group level. The results demonstrate that neural activity can be reliably detected as increases in fMRI signal synchrony within WM fibers that are engaged in a task with high sensitivities and reproducibility.

	<p>Driver&amp;amp;rsquo;s stress affects decision-making and the probability of risk occurrence, and it is therefore a key factor in road safety. This suggests the need for continuous stress monitoring. This work aims at validating a stress neurophysiological measure&amp;amp;mdash;a Neurometric&amp;amp;mdash;for out-of-the-lab use obtained from lightweight EEG relying on two wet sensors, in real-time, and without calibration. The Neurometric was tested during a multitasking experiment and validated with a realistic driving simulator. Twenty subjects participated in the experiment, and the resulting stress Neurometric was compared with the Random Forest (RF) model, calibrated by using EEG features and both intra-subject and cross-task approaches. The Neurometric was also compared with a measure based on skin conductance level (SCL), representing one of the physiological parameters investigated in the literature mostly correlated with stress variations. We found that during both multitasking and realistic driving experiments, the Neurometric was able to discriminate between low and high levels of stress with an average Area Under Curve (AUC) value higher than 0.9. Furthermore, the stress Neurometric showed higher AUC and stability than both the SCL measure and the RF calibrated with a cross-task approach. In conclusion, the Neurometric proposed in this work proved to be suitable for out-of-the-lab monitoring of stress levels.</p>

	<p>Long-term depression at parallel fibers-Purkinje cells (PF-PC LTD) is essential for cerebellar motor learning and motor control. Recent progress in ataxiology has identified dysregulation of PF-PC LTD in the pathophysiology of certain types of immune-mediated cerebellar ataxias (IMCAs). Auto-antibodies towards voltage-gated Ca channel (VGCC), metabotropic glutamate receptor type 1 (mGluR1), and glutamate receptor delta (GluR delta) induce dysfunction of PF-PC LTD, resulting in the development of cerebellar ataxias (CAs). These disorders show a good response to immunotherapies in non-paraneoplastic conditions but are sometimes followed by cell death in paraneoplastic conditions. On the other hand, in some types of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), dysfunction in PF-PC LTD, and impairments of PF-PC LTD-related adaptive behaviors (including vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and prism adaptation) appear during the prodromal stage, well before the manifestations of obvious CAs and cerebellar atrophy. Based on these findings and taking into account the findings of animal studies, we re-assessed the clinical concept of LTDpathy. LTDpathy can be defined as a clinical spectrum comprising etiologies associated with a functional disturbance of PF-PC LTD with concomitant impairment of related adaptative behaviors, including VOR, blink reflex, and prism adaptation. In IMCAs or degenerative CAs characterized by persistent impairment of a wide range of molecular mechanisms, these disorders are initially functional and are followed subsequently by degenerative cell processes. In such cases, adaptive disorders associated with PF-PC LTD manifest clinically with subtle symptoms and can be prodromal. Our hypothesis underlines for the first time a potential role of LTD dysfunction in the pathogenesis of the prodromal symptoms of CAs. This hypothesis opens perspectives to block the course of CAs at a very early stage.</p>

	<p>Caregivers of patients with early-onset Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (EOAD) experience higher level of burden, stress, and depression, due to premature role changes and social isolation. Moreover, the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic compelled restrictions regarding social interactions and mobility in Italy from March 2020, prompting telemedicine approaches for supporting patients and their families confined at home. We reported our experience regarding the effects of psychological phone-intervention (phone-I) on EOAD caregivers during pandemic. Twenty caregivers of EOAD patients were randomly assigned to treatment (TG) or control (CG) group. TG weekly underwent a phone-I for one month. All participants were assessed for caregiver burden and needs, anxiety and depression levels, and subjective impact of traumatic events at baseline (T0), at the fifth week (T1) and after 6 months (T2) from phone-I. We observed higher vulnerability to post-traumatic stress in TG compared to CG in all timepoints (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Decreased stress effects and caregiver burden were revealed in TG at T1 compared to T0 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), although showing an increase of these measures at T2 in the treated caregivers. Our findings suggest that although TG showed a peculiar vulnerability to post-traumatic stress, they showed increased wellbeing immediately after phone-I. However, this benefit disappeared six months later, along with the second infection wave, probably due to &amp;amp;ldquo;exhaustion stage&amp;amp;rdquo; achievement in &amp;amp;ldquo;General Adaptation Syndrome&amp;amp;rdquo;. This trend may suggest a beneficial but not solving role of a prompt phone-I on burden of caregivers of EOAD patients during the Sars-Cov-2 emergency.</p>

	<p>Therapeutic interventions are greatly needed for age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Astrocytes regulate many aspects of neuronal function including bioenergetics and synaptic transmission. Reactive astrocytes are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases due to their pro-inflammatory phenotype close association with damaged neurons. Thus, strategies to reduce astrocyte reactivity may support brain health. Caloric restriction and a ketogenic diet limit energy production via glycolysis and promote oxidative phosphorylation, which has gained traction as a strategy to improve brain health. However, it is unknown how caloric restriction affects astrocyte reactivity in the context of neuroinflammation. We investigated how a caloric restriction mimetic and glycolysis inhibitor, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), affects interleukin 1&amp;amp;beta;-induced inflammatory gene expression in human astrocytes. Human astrocyte cultures were exposed to 2-DG or vehicle for 24 h and then to recombinant IL-1&amp;amp;beta; for 6 or 24 h to analyze mRNA and protein expression, respectively. Gene expression levels of proinflammatory genes (complement component 3, IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, IL6, and TNF&amp;amp;alpha;) were analyzed by real-time PCR, immunoblot, and immunohistochemistry. As expected, IL-1&amp;amp;beta; induced elevated levels of proinflammatory genes. 2-DG reversed this effect at the mRNA and protein levels without inducing cytotoxicity. Collectively, these data suggest that inhibiting glycolysis in human astrocytes reduces IL-1&amp;amp;beta;-induced reactivity. This finding may lead to novel therapeutic strategies to limit inflammation and enhance bioenergetics toward the goal of preventing and treating neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

	<p>Introduction: We hypothesized that an endovascular electroencephalogram (eEEG) can detect subdural electrode (SDE)-detectable, scalp EEG-undetectable epileptiform discharges. The purpose of this study is, therefore, to measure SDE-detectable, scalp EEG-undetectable epileptiform discharges by an eEEG on a pig. Methods: A pig under general anesthesia was utilized to measure an artificially generated epileptic field by an eEEG that was able to be detected by an SDE, but not a scalp EEG as a primary outcome. We also compared the phase lag of each epileptiform discharge that was detected by the eEEG and SDE as a secondary outcome. Results: The eEEG electrode detected 113 (97%) epileptiform discharges (97% sensitivity). Epileptiform discharges that were localized within the three contacts (contacts two, three and four), but not spread to other parts, were detected by the eEEG with a 92% sensitivity. The latency between peaks of the eEEG and right SDE earliest epileptiform discharge ranged from 0 to 48 ms (mean, 13.3 ms; median, 11 ms; standard deviation, 9.0 ms). Conclusion: In a pig, an eEEG could detect epileptiform discharges that an SDE could detect, but that a scalp EEG could not.</p>

	<p>Cue reactivity is often used to study alcohol cues brain responses. Standardized image sets are used, but the effect of viewing people interacting with the alcohol drink remains unclear, which is associated with the factors of alcohol cues that influence the degree of response to alcohol stimuli. The present study used fMRI to investigate the reactivity of alcohol dependence (AD) inpatients to alcohol cues with or without human drinking behavior. Cues with a human interacting with a drink were hypothesized to increase sensorimotor activation. In total, 30 AD inpatients were asked to view pictures with a factorial design of beverage types (alcoholic vs. non-alcoholic beverages) and cue types (with or without drink action). Whole-brain analyses were performed. A correlation analysis was conducted to confirm whether the whole-brain analysis revealed cue-related brain activations correlated with problem drinking duration. The left lingual gyrus showed significant beverage types through cue type interaction, and the bilateral temporal cortex showed significant activation in response to alcohol cues depicting human drinking behavior. The right and left lingual gyrus regions and left temporal cortex were positively correlated with problem drinking duration. Sensorimotor activations in the temporal cortex may reflect self-referential and memory-based scene processing. Thus, our findings indicate these regions are associated with alcohol use and suggest them for cue exposure treatment of alcohol addiction.</p>

	<p>Autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED) is a rare clinical entity. Its pathogenicity, heterogenous clinical presentation in the context of secondary systemic autoimmune disease and optimal treatment avenues remain poorly understood. Vestibular impairment occurring in the context of AIED is rarely subject to detailed investigation given that the auditory symptoms and their responsiveness to immunosuppression are the focus of the few proposed diagnostic criteria for AIED. We present three cases of vestibulopathy occurring in the context of autoimmune inner ear conditions, including the first known report of autoimmune inner ear pathology arising with a temporal association to administration of the Pfizer-BioNTech SARS-CoV2 vaccination. We review the available literature pertinent to each case and summarise the key learning points, highlighting the variable presentation of vestibular impairment in AIED.</p>

	<p>The locus coeruleus (LC) is a brainstem structure that sends widespread efferent projections throughout the mammalian brain. The LC constitutes the major source of noradrenaline (NE), a modulatory neurotransmitter that is crucial for fundamental brain functions such as arousal, attention, and cognitive control. This role of the LC-NE is traditionally not believed to reflect functional influences on the frontoparietal network or the striatum, but recent advances in chemogenetic manipulations of the rodent brain have challenged this notion. However, demonstrations of LC-NE functional connectivity with these areas in the human brain are surprisingly sparse. Here, we close this gap. Using an established emotional stroop task, we directly compared trials requiring response conflict control with trials that did not require this, but were matched for visual stimulus properties, response modality, and controlled for pupil dilation differences across both trial types. We found that LC-NE functional coupling with the parietal cortex and regions of the striatum is substantially enhanced during trials requiring response conflict control. Crucially, the strength of this functional coupling was directly related to individual reaction time differences incurred by conflict resolution. Our data concur with recent rodent findings and highlight the importance of converging evidence between human and nonhuman neurophysiology to further understand the neural systems supporting adaptive and maladaptive behavior in health and disease.</p>

                <p>A surprising finding of recent studies in mouse is the dominance of widespread movement-related activity throughout the brain, including in early sensory areas. In awake subjects, failing to account for movement risks misattributing movement-related activity to other (e.g., sensory or cognitive) processes. In this article, we (1) review task designs for separating task-related and movement-related activity, (2) review three "case studies" in which <I>not</I> considering movement would have resulted in critically different interpretations of neuronal function, and (3) discuss functional couplings that may prevent us from ever fully isolating sensory, motor, and cognitive-related activity. Our main thesis is that neural signals related to movement are ubiquitous, and therefore ought to be considered first and foremost when attempting to correlate neuronal activity with task-related processes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Novel Layer 4 Corticofugal Cell Type/Projection Involved in Thalamo-Cortico-Striatal Sensory Processing</a></h4>

              
                <p>In sensory cortices, the information flow has been thought to be processed vertically across cortical layers, with layer 4 being the major thalamo-recipient which relays thalamic signals to layer 2/3, which in turn transmits thalamic information to layer 5 and 6 to then leave the cortex to reach subcortical and cortical long-range structures. Although several exceptions to this model have been described, neurons in layer 4 are still considered to establish only local (i.e., interlaminar and short-range) connections. Here, taking advantage of anatomic, electrophysiological, and optogenetic techniques, we describe, for the first time, a long-range corticostriatal class of pyramidal neurons in layer 4 (CS-L4) of the mouse auditory cortex that receive direct thalamic inputs. The CS-L4 neurons are embedded in a feedforward inhibitory circuit involving local parvalbumin neurons and establish connections in the posterior striatum in yet another feedforward inhibitory thalamo-&gt;cortico(L4)-&gt;striatal circuit which potentially contributes in controlling control the output of striatal spiny projection neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The assumption has been that layer 4 neurons are the main thalamic recipient layer, projecting to the upper cortical layer 2/3. However, no study has revealed a detailed understanding of the circuit mechanisms by which layer 4 sends a projection to a subcortical structure, such as the striatum, and differentially innervate the spiny projection neurons (SPNs) and intrastriatal parvalbumin-expressing neurons. For the first time, our results demonstrate that the auditory cortex projects to the posterior part of the dorsal striatum via pyramidal neurons located in layer 4 (CS-L4 neurons). Here we propose a new wiring diagram that implemented the old one, in which layer 4 is not only involved in the transfer of thalamic input to the upper layer 2/3, but can also exert a direct top-down control, bypassing intracortical processing of subcortical structures, such as the posterior part of the dorsal striatum. This poses a new conceptual cell element (CS-L4 neurons) for experimental and theoretical work of the cortical function.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Mlc1-Expressing Perivascular Astrocytes Promote Blood-Brain Barrier Integrity</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the mammalian brain, perivascular astrocytes (PAs) closely juxtapose blood vessels and are postulated to have important roles in the control of vascular physiology, including regulation of the blood&ndash;brain barrier (BBB). Deciphering specific functions for PAs in BBB biology, however, has been limited by the ability to distinguish these cells from other astrocyte populations. In order to characterize selective roles for PAs <I>in vivo</I>, a new mouse model has been generated in which the endogenous megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts 1 (Mlc1) gene drives expression of Cre fused to a mutated estrogen ligand-binding domain (Mlc1-T2A-CreERT2). This knock-in mouse model, which we term MLCT, allows for selective identification and tracking of PAs in the postnatal brain. We also demonstrate that MLCT-mediated ablation of PAs causes severe defects in BBB integrity, resulting in premature death. PA loss results in aberrant localization of Claudin 5 and -VE-Cadherin in endothelial cell junctions as well as robust microgliosis. Collectively, these data reveal essential functions for Mlc1-expressing PAs in regulating endothelial barrier integrity in mice and indicate that primary defects in astrocytes that cause BBB breakdown may contribute to human neurologic disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Interlaced among the billions of neurons and glia in the mammalian brain is an elaborate network of blood vessels. Signals from the brain parenchyma control the unique permeability properties of cerebral blood vessels known as the blood&ndash;brain barrier (BBB). However, we understand very little about the relative contributions of different neural cell types in the regulation of BBB functions. Here, we show that a specific subpopulation of astrocyte is essential for control of BBB integrity, with ablation of these cells leading to defects in endothelial cell junctions, BBB breakdown, and resulting neurologic deficits.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Bayesian Mapping of the Striatal Microcircuit Reveals Robust Asymmetries in the Probabilities and Distances of Connections</a></h4>

              
                <p>The striatum's complex microcircuit is made by connections within and between its D1- and D2-receptor expressing projection neurons and at least five species of interneuron. Precise knowledge of this circuit is likely essential to understanding striatum's functional roles and its dysfunction in a wide range of movement and cognitive disorders. We introduce here a Bayesian approach to mapping neuron connectivity using intracellular recording data, which lets us simultaneously evaluate the probability of connection between neuron types, the strength of evidence for it, and its dependence on distance. Using it to synthesize a complete map of the mouse striatum, we find strong evidence for two asymmetries: a selective asymmetry of projection neuron connections, with D2 neurons connecting twice as densely to other projection neurons than do D1 neurons, but neither subtype preferentially connecting to another; and a length-scale asymmetry, with interneuron connection probabilities remaining non-negligible at more than twice the distance of projection neuron connections. We further show that our Bayesian approach can evaluate evidence for wiring changes, using data from the developing striatum and a mouse model of Huntington's disease. By quantifying the uncertainty in our knowledge of the microcircuit, our approach reveals a wide range of potential striatal wiring diagrams consistent with current data.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> To properly understand a neuronal circuit's function, it is important to have an accurate picture of the rate of connection between individual neurons and how this rate changes with the distance separating pairs of neurons. We present a Bayesian method for extracting this information from experimental data and apply it to the mouse striatum, a subcortical structure involved in learning and decision-making, which is made up of a variety of different projection neurons and interneurons. Our resulting statistical map reveals not just the most robust estimates of the probability of connection between neuron types, but also the strength of evidence for them, and their dependence on distance.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cortical Granularity Shapes the Organization of Afferent Paths to the Amygdala and Its Striatal Targets in Nonhuman Primate</a></h4>

              
                <p>The prefrontal cortex (PFC) and insula, amygdala, and striatum form interconnected networks that drive motivated behaviors. We previously found a connectional trend in which granularity of the ventromedial and orbital PFC/insula predicted connections to the amygdala, and also the breadth of amygdalo-striatal efferents, including projections beyond the "classic" ventral striatum. To further interrogate connectional relationships among the cortex, amygdala, and striatum, and to further define the "limbic" (amygdala-recipient) striatum, we conducted tract tracing studies in two cohorts of macaques (male <I>n</I> = 14, female <I>n</I> = 1). We focused on the cortico-amygdalo-striatal (indirect) and cortico-"limbic" striatal (direct) paths originating in the entire PFC and insula. Larger datasets and a quantitative approach revealed "cortical rules" in which cortical granularity predicts the complexity and location of projections to both the basal nucleus of the amygdala and striatum. Remarkably, projections from "cortical-like" basal nucleus to the striatum followed similar patterns. In both "direct" and "indirect" paths to the "limbic" striatum, agranular cortices formed a "foundational," broad projection, and were joined by inputs from progressively more differentiated cortices. In amygdalo-striatal paths, the ventral basal nucleus was the "foundational" input, with progressively more dorsal basal nucleus regions gradually adding inputs as the "limbic" striatum extended caudally. Together, the "indirect" and "direct" paths followed consistent principles in which cortical granularity dictated the strength and complexity of projections at their targets. Cluster analyses independently confirmed these connectional trends, and also highlighted connectional features that predicted termination in specific subregions of the basal nucleus and "limbic" striatum.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The "limbic" system broadly refers to brain circuits that coordinate emotional responses. Here, we investigate circuits of the amygdala, which are involved in coding the emotional value of external cues, and their influence on the striatum. Regions of prefrontal cortex (PFC) and insula form gradients of overlapping inputs to the amygdala's basal nucleus, which feed forward to the striatum. Direct cortical inputs to these "amygdala-recipient" striatal areas are surprisingly organized according to similar principles but subtly shift from the "classic" ventral striatum to the caudal ventral striatum. Together, these distinct subsystems, cortico-amygdalo-striatal circuits and direct cortico-striatal circuits, provide substantial opportunity for different levels of internal, sensory, and external experiences to be integrated within the striatum, a major motor-behavioral interface.</p>

                <p>Sensory experience during a critical period alters sensory cortical responses and organization. We find that the earliest sound-driven activity in the mouse auditory cortex (ACX) starts before ear-canal opening (ECO). The effects of auditory experience before ECO on ACX development are unknown. We find that in mouse ACX subplate neurons (SPNs), crucial in thalamocortical maturation, respond to sounds before ECO showing oddball selectivity. Before ECO, SPNs are more selective to oddball sounds in auditory streams than thalamo-recipient layer 4 (L4) neurons and not after ECO. We hypothesize that SPN's oddball selectivity can direct the development of L4 responses before ECO. Exposing mice, of either sex, before ECO to a rarely occurring tone in a stream of another tone occurring frequently leads to strengthening the adult cortical representation of the rare tone, but not that of the frequent tone. Results of control exposure experiments at multiple developmental windows that also use only a single tone corroborate the observations. We further explain the strengthening of deviant inputs before ECO and not after ECO using a binary network model mimicking the hierarchical structure of subplate and L4 neurons and response properties derived from our data, with synapses following Hebbian spike time-dependent plasticity learning rule. Information-theoretic analysis with sparse coding assumptions also predicts the observations. Thus, relatively salient low probability sounds in the earliest auditory environment cause long-term changes in the ACX.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Early auditory experience can change the organization and responses of the auditory cortex in adulthood. However, little is known about how auditory experience at prenatal ages changes neural circuits and response properties. In mice at equivalent early developmental stages, we find that auditory experience of a particular kind, with a less frequently occurring sound in a stream of another sound, alters adult cortical responsiveness, specifically of the less frequent sound. However, at the previously known critical period of development, the opposite is observed, where the more frequent sound's representation is strengthened in the adult compared with the less frequent sound. We thus show that a specific type of auditory environment can influence adult auditory processing at the earliest ages.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Distorted Tonotopy Severely Degrades Neural Representations of Connected Speech in Noise following Acoustic Trauma</a></h4>

              
                <p>Listeners with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) struggle to understand speech, especially in noise, despite audibility compensation. These real-world suprathreshold deficits are hypothesized to arise from degraded frequency tuning and reduced temporal-coding precision; however, peripheral neurophysiological studies testing these hypotheses have been largely limited to in-quiet artificial vowels. Here, we measured single auditory-nerve-fiber responses to a connected speech sentence in noise from anesthetized male chinchillas with normal hearing (NH) or noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Our results demonstrated that temporal precision was not degraded following acoustic trauma, and furthermore that sharpness of cochlear frequency tuning was not the major factor affecting impaired peripheral coding of connected speech in noise. Rather, the loss of cochlear tonotopy, a hallmark of NH, contributed the most to both consonant-coding and vowel-coding degradations. Because distorted tonotopy varies in degree across etiologies (e.g., noise exposure, age), these results have important implications for understanding and treating individual differences in speech perception for people suffering from SNHL.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Difficulty understanding speech in noise is the primary complaint in audiology clinics and can leave people with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) suffering from communication difficulties that affect their professional, social, and family lives, as well as their mental health. We measured single-neuron responses from a preclinical SNHL animal model to characterize salient neural-coding deficits for naturally spoken speech in noise. We found the major mechanism affecting neural coding was not a commonly assumed factor, but rather a disruption of tonotopicity, the systematic mapping of acoustic frequency to cochlear place that is a hallmark of normal hearing. Because the degree of distorted tonotopy varies across hearing-loss etiologies, these results have important implications for precision audiology approaches to diagnosis and treatment of SNHL.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Excitable Axonal Domains Adapt to Sensory Deprivation in the Olfactory System</a></h4>

              
                <p>The axon initial segment (AIS), nodes of Ranvier, and the oligodendrocyte-derived myelin sheath have significant influence on the firing patterns of neurons and the faithful, coordinated transmission of action potentials (APs) to downstream brain regions. In the olfactory bulb (OB), olfactory discrimination tasks lead to adaptive changes in cell firing patterns, and the output signals must reliably travel large distances to other brain regions along highly myelinated tracts. Whether myelinated axons adapt to facilitate olfactory sensory processing is unknown. Here, we investigate the morphology and physiology of mitral cell (MC) axons in the olfactory system of adult male and female mice and show that unilateral sensory deprivation causes system-wide adaptations in axonal morphology and myelin thickness. MC spiking patterns and APs also adapted to sensory deprivation. Strikingly, myelination and MC physiology were altered on both the deprived and nondeprived sides, indicating system level adaptations to reduced sensory input. Our work demonstrates a previously unstudied mechanism of plasticity in the olfactory system.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Successful transmission of information from the olfactory bulb (OB) to piriform cortex through the lateral olfactory tract (LOT) relies on synchronized arrival of action potentials (APs). The coincident arrival of APs is dependent on reliable generation of APs in the axon initial segment (AIS) and fast conduction mediated by axon myelination. Here, we studied changes in mitral cell (MC) firing and AIS structure as well as changes in myelination of the LOT on unilateral olfactory deprivation in the adult mouse. Strikingly, myelination and MC physiology were altered on both the deprived and nondeprived sides, indicating system level adaptations to reduced sensory input. Our work demonstrates a previously unstudied mechanism of plasticity in the olfactory system.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Reward Value Revealed by Auction in Rhesus Monkeys</a></h4>

              
                <p>Economic choice is thought to involve the elicitation of the subjective values of the choice options. Thus far, value estimation in animals has relied on stochastic choices between multiple options presented in repeated trials and expressed from averages of dozens of trials. However, subjective reward valuations are made moment-to-moment and do not always require alternative options; their consequences are usually felt immediately. Here, we describe a Becker&ndash;DeGroot&ndash;Marschak (BDM) auction-like mechanism that provides more direct and simple valuations with immediate consequences. The BDM encourages agents to truthfully reveal their true subjective value in individual choices ("incentive compatibility"). Male monkeys reliably placed well-ranked BDM bids for up to five juice volumes while paying from a water budget. The bids closely approximated the average subjective values estimated with conventional binary choices (BCs), thus demonstrating procedural invariance and aligning with the wealth of knowledge acquired with these less direct estimation methods. The feasibility of BDM bidding in monkeys paves the way for an analysis of subjective neuronal value signals in single trials rather than from averages; the feasibility also bridges the gap to the increasingly used BDM method in human neuroeconomics.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The subjective economic value of rewards cannot be measured directly but must be inferred from observable behavior. Until now, the estimation method in animals was rather complex and required comparison between several choice options during repeated choices; thus, such methods did not respect the imminence of the outcome from individual choices. However, human economic research has developed a simple auction-like procedure that can reveal in a direct and immediate manner the true subjective value in individual choices [Becker&ndash;DeGroot&ndash;Marschak (BDM) mechanism]. The current study implemented this mechanism in rhesus monkeys and demonstrates its usefulness for eliciting meaningful value estimates of liquid rewards. The mechanism allows future neurophysiological assessment of subjective reward value signals in single trials of controlled animal tasks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Emotional Context Sculpts Action Goal Representations in the Lateral Frontal Pole</a></h4>

              
                <p>Emotional states provide an ever-present source of contextual information that should inform behavioral goals. Despite the ubiquity of emotional signals in our environment, the neural mechanisms underlying their influence on goal-directed action remains unclear. Prior work suggests that the lateral frontal pole (FPl) is uniquely positioned to integrate affective information into cognitive control representations. We used pattern similarity analysis to examine the content of representations in FPl and interconnected mid-lateral prefrontal and amygdala circuitry. Healthy participants (<I>n</I> = 37; <I>n</I> = 21 females) were scanned while undergoing an event-related Affective Go/No-Go task, which requires goal-oriented action selection during emotional processing. We found that FPl contained conjunctive emotion&ndash;action goal representations that were related to successful cognitive control during emotional processing. These representations differed from conjunctive emotion&ndash;action goal representations found in the basolateral amygdala. While robust action goal representations were present in mid-lateral prefrontal cortex, they were not modulated by emotional valence. Finally, converging results from functional connectivity and multivoxel pattern analyses indicated that FPl emotional valence signals likely originated from interconnected subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (BA25), which was in turn functionally coupled with the amygdala. Thus, our results identify a key pathway by which internal emotional states influence goal-directed behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Optimal functioning in everyday life requires behavioral regulation that flexibly adapts to dynamically changing emotional states. However, precisely how emotional states influence goal-directed action remains unclear. Unveiling the neural architecture that supports emotion&ndash;goal integration is critical for our understanding of disorders such as psychopathy, which is characterized by deficits in incorporating emotional cues into goals, as well as mood and anxiety disorders, which are characterized by impaired goal-based emotion regulation. Our study identifies a key circuit through which emotional states influence goal-directed behavior. This circuitry comprised the lateral frontal pole (FPl), which represented integrated emotion&ndash;goal information, as well as interconnected amygdala and subgenual ACC, which conveyed emotional signals to FPl.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Hyper-Rigid Phasic Organization of Hippocampal Activity But Normal Spatial Properties of CA1 Place Cells in the Ts65Dn Mouse Model of Down Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                <p>Down syndrome (DS) in humans is caused by trisomy of chromosome 21 and is marked by prominent difficulties in learning and memory. Decades of research have demonstrated that the hippocampus is a key structure in learning and memory, and recent work with mouse models of DS has suggested differences in hippocampal activity that may be the substrate of these differences. One of the primary functional differences in DS is thought to be an excess of GABAergic innervation from medial septum to the hippocampus. In these experiments, we probe in detail the activity of region CA1 of the hippocampus using <I>in vivo</I> electrophysiology in male Ts65Dn mice compared with their male nontrisomic 2N littermates. We find the spatial properties of place cells in CA1 are normal in Ts65Dn animals. However, we find that the phasic relationship of both CA1 place cells and gamma rhythms to theta rhythm in the hippocampus is profoundly altered in these mice. Since the phasic organization of place cell activity and gamma oscillations on the theta wave are thought to play a critical role in hippocampal function, the changes we observe agree with recent findings that organization of the hippocampal network is potentially of more relevance to its function than the spatial properties of place cells.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Recent evidence has disrupted the view that spatial deficits are associated with place cell abnormalities. In these experiments, we record hippocampal place cells and local field potential from the Ts65Dn mouse model of Down syndrome, and find phenomenologically normal place cells, but profound changes in the association of place cells and gamma rhythms with theta rhythm, suggesting that the overall network state is critically important for hippocampal function. These findings also agree with evidence suggesting that excess inhibitory control is the cause of hippocampal dysfunction in Down syndrome. The findings also confirm new avenues for pharmacological treatment of Down syndrome.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Collagen VI Regulates Motor Circuit Plasticity and Motor Performance by Cannabinoid Modulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Collagen VI is a key component of muscle basement membranes, and genetic variants can cause monogenic muscular dystrophies. Conversely, human genetic studies recently implicated collagen VI in central nervous system function, with variants causing the movement disorder dystonia. To elucidate the neurophysiological role of collagen VI, we generated mice with a truncation of the dystonia-related collagen &alpha;3 VI (COL6A3) C-terminal domain (CTD). These <I>Col6a3</I><sup>CTT</sup> mice showed a recessive dystonia-like phenotype in both sexes. We found that COL6A3 interacts with the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) complex in a CTD-dependent manner. <I>Col6a3</I><sup>CTT</sup> mice of both sexes have impaired homeostasis of excitatory input to the basal pontine nuclei (BPN), a motor control hub with dense COL6A3 expression, consistent with deficient endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling. Aberrant synaptic input in the BPN was normalized by a CB1R agonist, and motor performance in <I>Col6a3</I><sup>CTT</sup> mice of both sexes was improved by CB1R agonist treatment. Our findings identify a readily therapeutically addressable synaptic mechanism for motor control.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by involuntary movements. We previously identified genetic variants affecting a specific domain of the COL6A3 protein as a cause of dystonia. Here, we created mice lacking the affected domain and observed an analogous movement disorder. Using a protein interaction screen, we found that the affected COL6A3 domain mediates an interaction with the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R). Concordantly, our COL6A3-deficient mice showed a deficit in synaptic plasticity linked to a deficit in cannabinoid signaling. Pharmacological cannabinoid augmentation rescued the motor impairment of the mice. Thus, cannabinoid augmentation could be a promising avenue for treating dystonia, and we have identified a possible molecular mechanism mediating this.</p>

                <p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating dementia characterized by progressive memory loss and aggregation of amyloid-&beta; (A&beta;) protein into amyloid plaques in patient brains. Mutations in presenilin (PS) lead to abnormal generation of A&beta;, which is the major cause of familial AD (FAD), and apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) is the major genetic risk factor for sporadic AD (SAD) onset. However, whether dysfunction of PS is involved in the pathogenesis of SAD is largely unknown. We found that ApoE secretion was completely abolished in PS-deficient cells and markedly decreased by inhibition of -secretase activity. Blockade of -secretase activity by a -secretase inhibitor, DAPT, decreased ApoE secretion, suggesting an important role of -secretase activity in ApoE secretion. Reduced ApoE secretion is also observed in nicastrin-deficient cells with reduced -secretase activity. PS deficiency enhanced nuclear translocation of ApoE and binding of ApoE to importin &alpha;4, a nuclear transport receptor. Moreover, the expression of PS mutants in PS-deficient cells suppressed the restoration effects on ApoE secretion compared with the expression of wild-type PS. Plasma ApoE levels were lower in FAD patients carrying PS1 mutations compared with normal control subjects. Our findings suggest a novel role of PS contributing to the pathogenesis of SAD by regulating ApoE secretion.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Familial AD (FAD) typically results from mutations in the genes encoding amyloid precursor protein, presenilin 1 (PS1), or PS2. Many PS mutants have been found to exert impaired -secretase activity and increased amyloid-&beta; 42 (A&beta;42)/A&beta;40 ratio, which induce early amyloid deposition and FAD. On the other hand, apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) is the major genetic risk factor for sporadic AD (SAD) and contributes to AD pathogenesis because it has reduced A&beta; clearance capability compared with ApoE3 and ApoE2. FAD and SAD have long been considered to be caused by these two independent mechanisms; however, for the first time, we demonstrated that PS is essential for ApoE secretion and PS mutants affected ApoE secretion <I>in vitro</I> and in human samples, suggesting a novel mechanism by which PS is also involved in SAD pathogenesis.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Human Astrocytes Exhibit Tumor Microenvironment-, Age-, and Sex-Related Transcriptomic Signatures</a></h4>

              
                <p>Astrocytes are critical for the development and function of synapses. There are notable species differences between human astrocytes and commonly used animal models. Yet, it is unclear whether astrocytic genes involved in synaptic function are stable or exhibit dynamic changes associated with disease states and age in humans, which is a barrier in understanding human astrocyte biology and its potential involvement in neurologic diseases. To better understand the properties of human astrocytes, we acutely purified astrocytes from the cerebral cortices of over 40 humans across various ages, sexes, and disease states. We performed RNA sequencing to generate transcriptomic profiles of these astrocytes and identified genes associated with these biological variables. We found that human astrocytes in tumor-surrounding regions downregulate genes involved in synaptic function and sensing of signals in the microenvironment, suggesting involvement of peritumor astrocytes in tumor-associated neural circuit dysfunction. In aging, we also found downregulation of synaptic regulators and upregulation of markers of cytokine signaling, while in maturation we identified changes in ionic transport with implications for calcium signaling. In addition, we identified subtle sexual dimorphism in human cortical astrocytes, which has implications for observed sex differences across many neurologic disorders. Overall, genes involved in synaptic function exhibit dynamic changes in the peritumor microenvironment and aging. These data provide powerful new insights into human astrocyte biology in several biologically relevant states that will aid in generating novel testable hypotheses about homeostatic and reactive astrocytes in humans.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Astrocytes are an abundant class of cells playing integral roles at synapses. Astrocyte dysfunction is implicated in a variety of human neurologic diseases. Yet our knowledge of astrocytes is largely based on mouse studies. Direct knowledge of human astrocyte biology remains limited. Here, we present transcriptomic profiles of human cortical astrocytes, and we identified molecular differences associated with age, sex, and disease state. We found that peritumor and aging astrocytes downregulate genes involved in astrocyte&ndash;synapse interactions. These data provide necessary insight into human astrocyte biology that will improve our understanding of human disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Impaired Oligodendrocyte Maturation Is an Early Feature in SCA3 Disease Pathogenesis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Spinocerebellar ataxia Type 3 (SCA3), the most common dominantly inherited ataxia, is a polyglutamine neurodegenerative disease for which there is no disease-modifying therapy. The polyglutamine-encoding CAG repeat expansion in the <I>ATXN3</I> gene results in expression of a mutant form of the ATXN3 protein, a deubiquitinase that causes selective neurodegeneration despite being widely expressed. The mechanisms driving neurodegeneration in SCA3 are unclear. Research to date, however, has focused almost exclusively on neurons. Here, using equal male and female age-matched transgenic mice expressing full-length human mutant <I>ATXN3</I>, we identified early and robust transcriptional changes in selectively vulnerable brain regions that implicate oligodendrocytes in disease pathogenesis. We mapped transcriptional changes across early, mid, and late stages of disease in two selectively vulnerable brain regions: the cerebellum and brainstem. The most significant disease-associated module through weighted gene coexpression network analysis revealed dysfunction in SCA3 oligodendrocyte maturation. These results reflect a toxic gain-of-function mechanism, as <I>ATXN3</I> KO mice do not exhibit any impairments in oligodendrocyte maturation. Genetic crosses to reporter mice revealed a marked reduction in mature oligodendrocytes in SCA3-disease vulnerable brain regions, and ultrastructural microscopy confirmed abnormalities in axonal myelination. Further study of isolated oligodendrocyte precursor cells from SCA3 mice established that this impairment in oligodendrocyte maturation is a cell-autonomous process. We conclude that SCA3 is not simply a disease of neurons, and the search for therapeutic strategies and disease biomarkers will need to account for non-neuronal involvement in SCA3 pathogenesis.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Despite advances in spinocerebellar ataxia Type 3 (SCA3) disease understanding, much remains unknown about how the disease gene causes brain dysfunction ultimately leading to cell death. We completed a longitudinal transcriptomic analysis of vulnerable brain regions in SCA3 mice to define the earliest and most robust changes across disease progression. Through gene network analyses followed up with biochemical and histologic studies in SCA3 mice, we provide evidence for severe dysfunction in oligodendrocyte maturation early in SCA3 pathogenesis. Our results advance understanding of SCA3 disease mechanisms, identify additional routes for therapeutic intervention, and may provide broader insight into polyglutamine diseases beyond SCA3.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">FMRP Sustains Presynaptic Function via Control of Activity-Dependent Bulk Endocytosis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Synaptic vesicle (SV) recycling is essential for the maintenance of neurotransmission, with a number of neurodevelopmental disorders linked to defects in this process. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) results from a loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) encoded by the <I>FMR1</I> gene. Hyperexcitability of neuronal circuits is a key feature of FXS, therefore we investigated whether SV recycling was affected by the absence of FMRP during increased neuronal activity. We revealed that primary neuronal cultures from male <I>Fmr1</I> knock-out (KO) rats display a specific defect in activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE). ADBE is dominant during intense neuronal activity, and this defect resulted in an inability of <I>Fmr1</I> KO neurons to sustain SV recycling during trains of high-frequency stimulation. Using a molecular replacement strategy, we also revealed that a human FMRP mutant that cannot bind BK channels failed to correct ADBE dysfunction in KO neurons, however this dysfunction was corrected by BK channel agonists. Therefore, FMRP performs a key role in sustaining neurotransmitter release via selective control of ADBE, suggesting intervention via this endocytosis mode may correct the hyperexcitability observed in FXS.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) results in fragile X syndrome (FXS), however whether its loss has a direct role in neurotransmitter release remains a matter of debate. We demonstrate that neurons lacking FMRP display a specific defect in a mechanism that sustains neurotransmitter release during intense neuronal firing, called activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE). This discovery provides key insights into mechanisms of brain communication that occur because of loss of FMRP function. Importantly it also reveals ADBE as a potential therapeutic target to correct the circuit hyperexcitability observed in FXS.</p>

     alt="A common genetic variant in fatty acid amide hydrolase is linked to alterations in fear extinction neural circuitry in a racially diverse, nonclinical sample of adults"/>
<p>Genetic variation in a key neuromodulatory enzyme of the endocannabinoid system is linked to alterations in fear extinction neural circuitry. Variation in this system may help identify individuals who are at risk of developing a trauma-related disorder or may benefit from exposure-based therapies.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Poor fear extinction learning and recall are linked to the development of fear-based disorders, like posttraumatic stress disorder, and are associated with aberrant activation of fear-related neural circuitry. This includes greater amygdala activation during extinction learning and lesser hippocampal and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activation during recall. Emerging data indicate that genetic variation in fatty acid amide hydrolase (<i>FAAH</i> C385A; rs324420) is associated with increased peripheral endocannabinoid (eCB) levels and lesser threat-related amygdala reactivity. Preclinical studies link increased eCB signaling to better extinction learning and recall, thus <i>FAAH</i> C385A may protect against the development of trauma-related psychopathology by facilitating extinction learning. However, how this FAAH variant affects fear extinction neural circuitry remains unknown. In the present study, we used a novel, immersive-reality fear extinction paradigm paired with functional neuroimaging to assess <i>FAAH</i> C385A effects on fear-related neural circuitry and conditioned fear responding (US expectancy ratings, subjective units of distress, and skin conductance responding) in healthy adults from an urban area (Detroit, MI; <i>N</i> = 59; C/C = 35, A-carrier = 24). We found lesser amygdala activation in A-allele carriers, compared to C/C homozygotes, during early extinction recall. Likewise, we found lesser dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and greater hippocampus activation in early extinction learning in A-carriers compared to C/C homozygotes. We found no effects of <i>FAAH</i> C385A on vmPFC activation or behavioral fear indices. These data support and extend previous findings that FAAH genetic variation, associated with increased eCB signaling and subsequent enhanced fear extinction, may predict individual differences in successful fear learning.</p>

<p>This study leveraged data from 3,109 youth to examine associations between genotype, functional connectivity, and anxiety.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The endocannabinoid system is an important regulator of emotional responses such as fear, and a number of studies have implicated endocannabinoid signaling in anxiety. The fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) C385A polymorphism, which is associated with enhanced endocannabinoid signaling in the brain, has been identified across species as a potential protective factor from anxiety. In particular, adults with the variant FAAH 385A allele have greater fronto-amygdala connectivity and lower anxiety symptoms. Whether broader network-level differences in connectivity exist, and when during development this neural phenotype emerges, remains unknown and represents an important next step in understanding how the FAAH C385A polymorphism impacts neurodevelopment and risk for anxiety disorders. Here, we leveraged data from 3,109 participants in the nationwide Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study℠ (10.04 ± 0.62 years old; 44.23% female, 55.77% male) and a cross-validated, data-driven approach to examine associations between genetic variation and large-scale resting-state brain networks. Our findings revealed a distributed brain network, comprising functional connections that were both significantly greater (95% CI for <i>p</i> values = [&lt;0.001, &lt;0.001]) and lesser (95% CI for <i>p</i> values = [0.006, &lt;0.001]) in A-allele carriers relative to non-carriers. Furthermore, there was a significant interaction between genotype and the summarized connectivity of functional connections that were greater in A-allele carriers, such that non-carriers with connectivity more similar to A-allele carriers (i.e., greater connectivity) had lower anxiety symptoms (<i>β</i> = −0.041, <i>p</i> = 0.030). These findings provide novel evidence of network-level changes in neural connectivity associated with genetic variation in endocannabinoid signaling and suggest that genotype-associated neural differences may emerge at a younger age than genotype-associated differences in anxiety.</p>

<p>Animal models provide the ability to study prenatal cannabis exposure with control over timing and dosage but employ both injection and inhalation approaches; however, the degree of transmission of THC through placenta to fetal brain within these models is unknown.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cannabis use during pregnancy has increased over the past few decades, with recent data indicating that, in youth and young adults especially, up to 22% of people report using cannabis during pregnancy. Animal models provide the ability to study prenatal cannabis exposure (PCE) with control over timing and dosage; however, these studies utilize both injection and inhalation approaches. While it is known that Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; primary psychoactive component of cannabis) can cross the placenta, examination of the transmission and concentration of THC and its metabolites from maternal blood into the placenta and fetal brain remains relatively unknown, and the influence of route of administration has never been examined. Pregnant female rats were exposed to either vaporized THC-dominant cannabis extract for pulmonary consumption or subcutaneous injection of THC repeatedly during the gestational period. Maternal blood, placenta, and fetal brains were collected following the final administration of THC for analysis of THC and its metabolites, as well as endocannabinoid concentrations, through mass spectrometry. Both routes of administration resulted in the transmission of THC and its metabolites in placenta and fetal brain. Repeated exposure to inhaled THC vapor resulted in fetal brain THC concentrations that were about 30% of those seen in maternal blood, whereas repeated injections resulted in roughly equivalent concentrations of THC in maternal blood and fetal brain. Neither inhalation nor injection of THC during pregnancy altered fetal brain endocannabinoid concentrations. Our data provide the first characterization of maternal-fetal transmission of THC and its metabolites following both vaporized delivery and injection routes of administration. These data are important to establish the maternal-fetal transmission in preclinical injection and inhalation models of PCE and may provide insight into predicting fetal exposure in human studies.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>There is increasing evidence for the important role of gut microbiota (GMB) in the development and progression of neurologic pathologies. Some studies have shown that modifying the microbiome profile can confer benefits to patients. Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a common occurrence in the general population. Although most patients recover, in a minority, disabling symptoms can persist for several months. We carried out a review of the literature to assess the effect of mTBI on GMB and to determine whether alleviating dysbiosis can improve clinical outcomes in mTBI patients. We performed searches in Medline/PubMed and Embase using the keywords “MTBI” AND “microbiome” OR “microbiota”. Additional articles were identified by manual searches and using the Google search engine. In animal models, a clear perturbation of GMB was reported following TBI and probiotic supplementation (<i>Lactobacillus acidophilus</i> or <i>Clostridium butyricum</i>) improved neurologic function. There were no studies on changes in GMB after mTBI in humans; however, pre- or probiotic supplementation reduced the infection rate in patients with severe TBI and shortened the time spent in the intensive care unit without conferring any neurologic benefits. Thus, although the findings from animal models are promising, clinical studies are needed to determine whether therapeutic strategies that restore gut microbiome profile can improve long-term outcomes of patients with mTBI.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The human brain functional lateralization has been widely studied over the past decades, and neuroimaging studies have shown how activation of motor areas during hand movement execution (ME) is different according to hand dominance. Nevertheless, there is no research directly investigating the effects of the participant's handedness in a motor imagery (MI) and ME task in both right and left-handed individuals at the cortical and subcortical level. Twenty-six right-handed and 25 left-handed participants were studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging during the imagination and execution of repetitive self-paced movements of squeezing a ball with their dominant, non-dominant, and both hands. Results revealed significant statistical difference (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) between groups during both the execution and the imagery task with the dominant, non-dominant, and both hands both at cortical and subcortical level. During ME, left-handers recruited a spread bilateral network, while in right-handers, activity was more lateralized. At the critical level, MI between-group analysis revealed a similar pattern in right and left-handers showing a bilateral activation for the dominant hand. Differentially at the subcortical level, during MI, only right-handers showed the involvement of the posterior cerebellum. No significant activity was found for left-handers. Overall, we showed a partial spatial overlap of neural correlates of MI and ME in motor, premotor, sensory cortices, and cerebellum. Our results highlight differences in the functional organization of motor areas in right and left-handed people, supporting the hypothesis that MI is influenced by the way people habitually perform motor actions.</p>

     alt="Neural heterogeneity underlying late adolescent motivational processing is linked to individual differences in behavioral sensation seeking"/>
<p>Adolescents completed two runs of the monetary incentive delay (MID) task. Using a data-driven person-specific network connectivity approach, Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation (GIMME), we uncovered two subgroups for MID runs. During Run 01, subgroups significantly related to sensation seeking; however, during Run 02 subgroups did not significantly relate to sensation seeking.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Adolescent risk-taking, including sensation seeking (SS), is often attributed to developmental changes in connectivity among brain regions implicated in cognitive control and reward processing. Despite considerable scientific and popular interest in this neurodevelopmental framework, there are few empirical investigations of adolescent functional connectivity, let alone examinations of its links to SS behavior. The studies that have been done focus on mean-based approaches and leave unanswered questions about individual differences in neurodevelopment and behavior. The goal of this paper is to take a person-specific approach to the study of adolescent functional connectivity during a continuous motivational state, and to examine links between connectivity and self-reported SS behavior in 104 adolescents (<i>M</i>
<sub>Age</sub> = 19.3; <i>SD</i>
<sub>Age</sub> = 1.3). Using Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation (GIMME), person-specific connectivity during two neuroimaging runs of a monetary incentive delay task was estimated among 12 a priori brain regions of interest representing reward, cognitive, and salience networks. Two data-driven subgroups were detected, a finding that was consistent between both neuroimaging runs, but associations with SS were only found in the first run, potentially reflecting neural habituation in the second run. Specifically, the subgroup that had unique connections between reward-related regions had greater SS and showed a distinctive relation between connectivity strength in the reward regions and SS. These findings provide novel evidence for heterogeneity in adolescent brain-behavior relations by showing that subsets of adolescents have unique associations between neural motivational processing and SS. Findings have broader implications for future work on reward processing, as they demonstrate that brain-behavior relations may attenuate across runs.</p>

<p>Genotype differences in the serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) that reduce SERT expression levels significantly alter mitochondrial abundance and gene expression in a brain region and sex-dependent manner.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are complex conditions attributed to both genetic and environmental factors. There is a growing body of evidence showing that serotonergic signaling and mitochondrial dysfunction contribute to the pathophysiology of these disorders and are linked as signaling through specific serotonin (5-HT) receptors drives mitochondrial biogenesis. The serotonin transporter (SERT) is important in these disorders as it regulates synaptic serotonin and therapeutically is the target of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors which are a major class of anti-depressant drug. Human allelic variants of the serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) such as the S/S variant, are associated with reduced SERT expression and increased susceptibility for developing neuropsychiatric disorders. Using a rat model that is haploinsufficient for SERT and displays reduced SERT expression similar to the human S/S variant, we demonstrate that reduced SERT expression modulates mitochondrial copy number and expression of respiratory chain electron transfer components in the brain. In the frontal cortex, genotype-related trends were opposing for males and females, such that reduced SERT expression led to increased expression of the Complex I subunit <i>mt-Nd1</i> in males but reduced expression in females. Our findings suggest that SERT expression and serotonergic signaling have a role in regulating mitochondrial biogenesis and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in the brain. We speculate that the sexual dimorphism in mitochondrial abundance and gene expression contributes to the sex bias found in the incidence of neuropsychiatric disorders such as MDD and ASD.</p>

     alt="Dose-dependent effect of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein on visual function and optic nerve damage in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis"/>
<p>In rats with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, increasing myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) quantity produced optic nerve (ON) damage in a dose-dependent gradient. Visual function was measured through visual evoked potential (VEP), with final ON histology. Forty and fifty micrograms of MOG resulted in VEP latency increase, correlating with demyelination, whereas 60 µg caused VEP amplitude decrease associated with axonal loss. </p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Female Dark Agouti rats were immunized with increasing doses of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) to develop experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a preclinical model of multiple sclerosis. Typical EAE motor impairments were assessed daily and noninvasive visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were recorded at baseline and 5 weeks after immunization, with final histopathology of optic nerves (ONs). Immunized rats exhibited a relapsing-remitting clinical course. Both VEP and histological abnormalities were detected in a MOG dose-dependent gradient. Increasing MOG dosage augmented visual function impairment in EAE, which could be monitored with VEP recording to assess demyelination and axonal loss along ONs.</p>

     alt="Role of melatonin in autism spectrum disorders in a male murine transgenic model: Study in the prefrontal cortex"/>
<p>The early chronic melatonin administration modifies the expression of key molecules involved in cognitive process in a male murine transgenic model of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The results show that melatonin may be a possible adjuvant therapeutic strategy in ASDs and encourage new clinical trials.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of clinically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorders sharing common features related to impaired social and communication abilities in addition to stereotyped behaviors. ASD patients present encephalic morphological, physiological, and biomolecular alterations with low levels of melatonin due to alterations in its pathways. Therefore, even if ASDs have traditionally been framed as behavioral disorders, several lines of evidence are accumulating that ASDs are characterized by certain anatomical and physiological abnormalities, including oxidative stress and inflammation in peripheral biomarkers, but likewise present in human brain tissue also characterized by alterations in synaptic remodeling and neuromodulation. Melatonin has also protective and antioxidant properties, so we can therefore hypothesize that alterations in melatonin's pathways may be one of the causes of the symptomatology of autism. The aim of the present study was to analyze the beneficial effect induced by melatonin administration and its possible mechanism of action in a transgenic mouse model of autism, immediately after weaning. The male mice were daily treated <i>per os</i> with melatonin (10 mg/Kg/day) or vehicle for 8 weeks starting from the sixth week of life. The antioxidant modulation, the GABAergic/glutamatergic impairment, and the synaptic remodeling in the prefrontal cortex have been evaluated. Social and repetitive behaviors were also evaluated. The behavioral results showed no statistical evidences, instead the immunohistochemical results indicated the ability of melatonin to promote the activity of antioxidant system, the GABAergic/glutamatergic equilibrium, and the synaptic remodeling. The results show that melatonin may be a possible adjuvant therapeutic strategy in ASDs.</p>

     alt="Elucidation of pathological mechanism caused by human disease mutation in CaMKIIβ"/>
<p>We elucidated the pathogenic mechanism of the CaMKIIβ P213L mutation identified in a patient with neurodevelopmental disorder by next generation sequencing. The functional role of the P213 site has not been understood, but we found that the mutation at this site caused destabilization and degradation of CaMKIIβ <i>in vivo</i>, resulting in motor dysfunction of mutant mice.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Recently, we have identified CaMKIIα and CaMKIIβ mutations in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders by whole exome sequencing study. Most CaMKII mutants have increased phosphorylation of Thr286/287, which induces autonomous activity of CaMKII, using cell culture experiments. In this study, we explored the pathological mechanism of motor dysfunction observed exclusively in a patient with Pro213Leu mutation in CaMKIIβ using a mouse model of the human disease. The homozygous CaMKIIβ Pro213Leu knockin mice showed age-dependent motor dysfunction and growth failure from 2 weeks after birth. In the cerebellum, the mutation did not alter the mRNA transcript level, but the CaMKIIβ protein level was dramatically decreased. Furthermore, in contrast to previous result from cell culture, Thr287 phosphorylation of CaMKIIβ was also reduced. CaMKIIβ Pro213Leu knockin mice showed similar motor dysfunction as CaMKIIβ knockout mice, newly providing evidence for a loss of function rather than a gain of function. Our disease model mouse showed similar phenotypes of the patient, except for epileptic seizures. We clearly demonstrated that the pathological mechanism is a reduction of mutant CaMKIIβ in the brain, and the physiological aspects of mutation were greatly different between <i>in vivo</i> and cell culture.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Life expectancy in humans is increasing, resulting in a growing aging population, that is accompanied by an increased disposition to develop cognitive deterioration. Hypometabolism is one of the multiple factors related to inefficient brain function during aging. This review emphasizes the metabolic interactions between glial cells (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia) and neurons, particularly, during aging. Glial cells provide support and protection to neurons allowing adequate synaptic activity. We address metabolic coupling from the expression of transporters, availability of substrates, metabolic pathways, and mitochondrial activity. In aging, the main metabolic exchange machinery is altered with inefficient levels of nutrients and detrimental mitochondrial activity that results in high reactive oxygen species levels and reduced ATP production, generating a highly inflammatory environment that favors deregulated cell death. Here, we provide an overview of the glial-to-neuron mechanisms, from the molecular components to the cell types, emphasizing aging as the crucial risk factor for developing neurodegenerative/neuroinflammatory diseases.</p>

<p>The study investigated the anti-depressant and anxiolytic effects of different selective stimulation of ventral tegmental area dopaminergic pathways projecting through the mfb. The data suggests that different stimulation strategies can modulate various depressive- and anxiety-like phenotypes.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Major depressive disorder is one of the most common mental disorders, and more than 300 million of people suffer from depression worldwide. Recent clinical trials indicate that deep brain stimulation of the superolateral medial forebrain bundle (mfb) can have rapid and long-term antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. However, the mechanisms of action are elusive. In this study, using female rats, we demonstrate the antidepressant effects of selective optogenetic stimulation of the ventral tegmental area's dopaminergic (DA) neurons passing through the mfb and compare different stimulation patterns. Chronic mild unpredictable stress (CMUS) induced depressive-like, but not anxiety-like phenotype. Short-term and long-term stimulation demonstrated antidepressant effect (OSST) and improved anxiolytic effect (EPM), while long-term stimulation during CMUS induction prevented depressive-like behavior (OSST and USV) and improved anxiolytic effect (EPM). The results highlight that long-term accumulative stimulation on DA pathways is required for antidepressant and anxiolytic effect.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Multi-omics data integration reveals metabolome as the top predictor of the cervicovaginal microenvironment</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nicholas A. Bokulich, Paweł Łaniewski, Anja Adamov, Dana M. Chase, J. Gregory Caporaso, Melissa M. Herbst-Kralovetz</p>

Emerging evidence suggests that host-microbe interaction in the cervicovaginal microenvironment contributes to cervical carcinogenesis, yet dissecting these complex interactions is challenging. Herein, we performed an integrated analysis of multiple “omics” datasets to develop predictive models of the cervicovaginal microenvironment and identify characteristic features of vaginal microbiome, genital inflammation and disease status. Microbiomes, vaginal pH, immunoproteomes and metabolomes were measured in cervicovaginal specimens collected from a cohort (n = 72) of Arizonan women with or without cervical neoplasm. Multi-omics integration methods, including neural networks (mmvec) and Random Forest supervised learning, were utilized to explore potential interactions and develop predictive models. Our integrated analyses revealed that immune and cancer biomarker concentrations were reliably predicted by Random Forest regressors trained on microbial and metabolic features, suggesting close correspondence between the vaginal microbiome, metabolome, and genital inflammation involved in cervical carcinogenesis. Furthermore, we show that features of the microbiome and host microenvironment, including metabolites, microbial taxa, and immune biomarkers are predictive of genital inflammation status, but only weakly to moderately predictive of cervical neoplastic disease status. Different feature classes were important for prediction of different phenotypes. Lipids (e.g. sphingolipids and long-chain unsaturated fatty acids) were strong predictors of genital inflammation, whereas predictions of vaginal microbiota and vaginal pH relied mostly on alterations in amino acid metabolism. Finally, we identified key immune biomarkers associated with the vaginal microbiota composition and vaginal pH (MIF), as well as genital inflammation (IL-6, IL-10, MIP-1α).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Comparative analyses of parasites with a comprehensive database of geno-scale metabolic models</a></h4>

Protozoan parasites cause diverse diseases with large global impacts. Research on the pathogenesis and biology of these organisms is limited by economic and experimental constraints. Accordingly, studies of one parasite are frequently extrapolated to infer knowledge about another parasite, across and within genera. Model <i>in vitro</i> or <i>in vivo</i> systems are frequently used to enhance experimental manipulability, but these systems generally use species related to, yet distinct from, the clinically relevant causal pathogen. Characterization of functional differences among parasite species is confined to <i>post hoc</i> or single target studies, limiting the utility of this extrapolation approach. To address this challenge and to accelerate parasitology research broadly, we present a functional comparative analysis of 192 genomes, representing every high-quality, publicly-available protozoan parasite genome including <i>Plasmodium</i>, <i>Toxoplasma</i>, <i>Cryptosporidium</i>, <i>Entamoeba</i>, <i>Trypanosoma</i>, <i>Leishmania</i>, <i>Giardia</i>, and other species. We generated an automated metabolic network reconstruction pipeline optimized for eukaryotic organisms. These metabolic network reconstructions serve as biochemical knowledgebases for each parasite, enabling qualitative and quantitative comparisons of metabolic behavior across parasites. We identified putative differences in gene essentiality and pathway utilization to facilitate the comparison of experimental findings and discovered that phylogeny is not the sole predictor of metabolic similarity. This knowledgebase represents the largest collection of genome-scale metabolic models for both pathogens and eukaryotes; with this resource, we can predict species-specific functions, contextualize experimental results, and optimize selection of experimental systems for fastidious species.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Bayesian data assimilation for estimating instantaneous reproduction numbers during epidemics: Applications to COVID-19</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xian Yang, Shuo Wang, Yuting Xing, Ling Li, Richard Yi Da Xu, Karl J. Friston, Yike Guo</p>

Estimating the changes of epidemiological parameters, such as instantaneous reproduction number, <i>R</i><sub>t</sub>, is important for understanding the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. Current estimates of time-varying epidemiological parameters often face problems such as lagging observations, averaging inference, and improper quantification of uncertainties. To address these problems, we propose a Bayesian data assimilation framework for time-varying parameter estimation. Specifically, this framework is applied to estimate the instantaneous reproduction number <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> during emerging epidemics, resulting in the state-of-the-art ‘DARt’ system. With DARt, time misalignment caused by lagging observations is tackled by incorporating observation delays into the joint inference of infections and <i>R</i><sub>t</sub>; the drawback of averaging is overcome by instantaneously updating upon new observations and developing a model selection mechanism that captures abrupt changes; the uncertainty is quantified and reduced by employing Bayesian smoothing. We validate the performance of DARt and demonstrate its power in describing the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. The proposed approach provides a promising solution for making accurate and timely estimation for transmission dynamics based on reported data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Learning as filtering: Implications for spike-based plasticity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jannes Jegminat, Simone Carlo Surace, Jean-Pascal Pfister</p>

Most normative models in computational neuroscience describe the task of learning as the optimisation of a cost function with respect to a set of parameters. However, learning as optimisation fails to account for a time-varying environment during the learning process and the resulting point estimate in parameter space does not account for uncertainty. Here, we frame learning as filtering, i.e., a principled method for including time and parameter uncertainty. We derive the filtering-based learning rule for a spiking neuronal network—the Synaptic Filter—and show its computational and biological relevance. For the computational relevance, we show that filtering improves the weight estimation performance compared to a gradient learning rule with optimal learning rate. The dynamics of the mean of the Synaptic Filter is consistent with spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) while the dynamics of the variance makes novel predictions regarding spike-timing dependent changes of EPSP variability. Moreover, the Synaptic Filter explains experimentally observed negative correlations between homo- and heterosynaptic plasticity.

                Development of silver (Ag) modified titanium (Ti) as an antibacterial dental implant has recently been growing. Ag demonstrated an excellent antibacterial property without the risk of bacterial resistance. Hydrothermal treatment using AgNO3 solution is one of the facile and promising methods to modify Ti surface with Ag. However, the effect of high AgNO3 concentration and the absent of a toxic reduction agent has not been clearly studied. In this study, Ti surface was hydrothermally treated in 0.01 mol/L and 0.1 mol/L AgNO3 solutions at 150oC for 24 hours. Analysis of surface morphology using scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray analysis suggested the formation of non-homogenous Ag coating with a tendency to be aggregated and thicken with the increase of AgNO3 concentration. The Ag coating deposited on Ti surface were composed of mainly metallic and some oxide forms. Surface roughness of all AgNO3 treated Ti surface was comparable based on the analysis of surface roughness parameter. In conclusion, hydrothermal treatment of Ti surface in solely AgNO3 solution at high concentration produced non-homogenous Ag coating on its surface without significantly changed surface roughness.

                Adequate adoption of evidence-based practice is deeply rooted in accessing methodological quality and completeness of systematic reviews and meta-analyses reporting. Nonetheless, this assumption might be flawed if the methodological quality assessment has not been properly conducted. Taking the former statement into consideration, this correspondence article encourages the improvement of future tertiary manuscripts, especially in the field of restorative dentistry. Thus, this article addresses an overview of reviews in restorative dentistry as an example of evaluating tertiary evidence for increasing the awareness of reviewers, authors, and readers.

                Background: The study aimed to examine the effect of administering CHAGURO (a product of the combination of siamese pumpkin and tuna-based powder) on the lipid profile in prediabetes individuals with dyslipidemia. Methods: The experimental trial was conducted with two intervention groups, with each group receiving a dose of 7.5g/70kg body weight (BW)/day (low dose) and 15g/70kg BW/day (high dose) for 60 days. Respondents were randomized into intervention groups using simple randomization. Before and after the intervention, pre-test and post-test examinations were performed, factors examined included hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), lipid profile, blood pressure, food intake with the SQ-FFQ (Semi Quantitative-Food Frequency Questionnaire) interview, body mass index (BMI), and physical activity using International Physical Activity Questionnaires-Short Form (IPAQ-SF). During the intervention, blood pressure and BMI data were taken before and after the study. Statistical analysis included descriptive tests, independent and paired T-tests, and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: Compared to the baseline, HbA1c, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides in the two groups did not improve significantly by 60 days. For lipid variables, a significant improvement in the cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (chol/HDL) ratios were observed when compared against the baseline for the two groups. When comparing the changes between groups, 7.5 g of CHAGURO showed a larger improvement in HDL-C (mean differences: 1.86 mg/dL; 95% CI: -0.86-4.59), compared to 15 g of CHAGURO (mean differences: -3.62 mg/dL; 95% CI: -7.53-0.28). A significant (p<0.05) decrease in the chol/HDL ratio was observed in the 7.5 g CHAGURO group (mean differences: -0.20 mg/dL; 95% CI: -0.39-(-0.01)). Conclusions: CHAGURO can be a functional food alternative to improve the condition of prediabetes people with dyslipidemia.

                Background: Solid waste from coffee depulping process threatens the organism in environment as it produces organic pollutants. Evidence suggested that coffee by-product could valorize owing to its potential as antioxidant sources. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate antioxidant activity of coffee by-products obtained from different coffee variants (arabica and robusta) and processing methods. Methods: The systematic review was conducted as of May 29, 2021 for records published within the last ten years (2011–2021) using seven databases: Embase, Medline, BMJ, Web of Science, Science Direct, Cochrane, and PubMed. Data on type of specimen, processing methods, and antioxidant activities were collected based on PRISMA guidelines. Results: Our data suggested that aqueous extract was found to be the most common processing method used to obtain the antioxidant from various coffee by-products, followed by methanol and ethanol extract. A variety of antioxidant properties ranging from strong to low activity was found depending on the variety, type of coffee by-products (cascara, pulp, husk, silverskin, and parchment), and processing technique. Fermentation employing proper bacteria was found effective in improving the yield of bioactive compounds resulting in higher antioxidant capacity. Applications in feedstuffs, foods, beverages, and topical formulation are among the potential utilization of coffee by-products. Conclusion: Coffee by-products contain bioactive compounds possessing antioxidant properties which could be used as additives in foods, beverages, and cosmetics. In particular, their benefits in skin care products require further investigation.

                The ethics of compulsive treatment (CT) is a medical, social and legal discussion that reemerged after the ratification by 181 countries of the 2007 United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD). The optional protocol of the UN-CRPD was ratified by 86 countries aiming to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights. It also determined the need to review mental health laws as under this light treatment of persons with disabilities, particularly those with mental disorders, cannot accept the use of CT. This selective review of literature aims to clarify inputs from clinical psychiatry adding evidence to the multi-disciplinary discussion. It focuses on how patients experience CT and its impact on their mental health and treatment programs, the reasons for the use of CT versus voluntary treatment and what efforts have been made to reduce, replace and refine the presence of CT in psychiatry.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Eye image effect in the context of pedestrian safety: a French questionnaire study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Human behavior is influenced by the presence of others, which scientists also call ‘the audience effect’. The use of social control to produce more cooperative behaviors may positively influence road use and safety. This study uses an online questionnaire to test how eyes images affect the behavior of pedestrians when crossing a road. Different eyes images of men, women and a child with different facial expressions -neutral, friendly and angry- were presented to participants who were asked what they would feel by looking at these images before crossing a signalized road. Participants completed a questionnaire of 20 questions about pedestrian behaviors (PBQ). The questionnaire was received by 1,447 French participants, 610 of whom answered the entire questionnaire. Seventy-one percent of participants were women, and the mean age was 35 ± 14 years. Eye images give individuals the feeling they are being observed at 33%, feared at 5% and surprised at 26%, and thus seem to indicate mixed results about avoiding crossing at the red light. The expressions shown in the eyes are also an important factor: feelings of being observed increased by about 10-15% whilst feelings of being scared or inhibited increased by about 5% as the expression changed from neutral to friendly to angry. No link was found between the results of our questionnaire and those of the Pedestrian Behavior Questionnaire (PBQ). This study shows that the use of eye images could reduce illegal crossings by pedestrians, and is thus of key interest as a practical road safety tool. However, the effect is limited and how to increase this nudge effect needs further consideration.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Identification of potential biological targets of oxindole scaffolds via in silico repositioning strategies [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Drug repurposing is an alternative strategy to traditional drug discovery that aims at predicting new uses for already existing drugs or clinical candidates. Drug repurposing has many advantages over traditional drug development, such as reduced attrition rates, time and costs. This is especially the case considering that most drugs investigated for repurposing have already been assessed for their safety in clinical trials. Repurposing campaigns can also be designed for libraries of already synthesized molecules at different levels of biological experimentation, from null to in vitro and in vivo. Such an extension of the “repurposing” concept is expected to provide significant advantages for the identification of novel drugs, as the synthetic accessibility of the desired compounds is often one of the limiting factors in the traditional drug discovery pipeline. Methods: In this work, we performed a computational repurposing campaign on a library of previously synthesized oxindole-based compounds, in order to identify potential new targets for this versatile scaffold. To this aim, ligand-based approaches were firstly applied to evaluate the similarity degree of the investigated compound library, with respect to ligands extracted from the DrugBank, Protein Data Bank (PDB) and ChEMBL databases. In particular, the 2D fingerprint-based and 3D shape-based similarity profiles were evaluated and compared for the oxindole derivates. Results: The analyses predicted a set of potential candidate targets for repurposing, some of them emerging by consensus of different computational analyses. One of the identified targets, i.e., the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) kinase, was further investigated by means of docking calculations, followed by biological testing of one candidate. Conclusions: While the compound did not show potent inhibitory activity towards VEGFR-2, the study highlighted several other possibilities of therapeutically relevant targets that may be worth of consideration for drug repurposing.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The knowledge, attitude and practice level of dental auxiliaries regarding oral health care for pregnant patients in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The purpose of this research was to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of dental auxiliaries related to oral health care for pregnant patients in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. Methods: A cross-sectional study using a questionnaire survey was conducted. The knowledge, attitude, and practice were rated using the Likert scale out of 5. Knowledge and practice were categorized using Bloom’s cut off point methods (≥80% is good, and <80% is bad). Concerning attitude, (≥80% is positive, and <80% is negative). The questionnaires were sent to all dental hygienists and assistants (N=358), and responses were collected from 218. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software was utilixed to conduct statistical analysis. Results: Out of the 358, 218 responded (response rate = 61%). More than half of the respondents showed relatively good knowledge (57.3%). Most respondents had a positive attitude (89.4%). Regarding practice, approximately two-thirds had a good practice (67.4%). The knowledge score of hygienists was significantly higher than dental assistants, and respondents with experience in treating pregnant patients had significantly higher knowledge scores than others who did not have experience in treating pregnant patients. There is a statistically significant positive correlation between practice scores and education. Conclusions: The findings suggest the need to establish continuous education programs and for dental hygienists and dental assistants to adopt the best practice guidelines on perinatal oral health.

     alt="Neural alterations in working memory of mild-moderate TBI: An fMRI study in Malaysia"/>
<p>The conventional letter n-back task elicited stronger activation in the mild–moderate TBI participants than the guided letter n-back. In TBI, there was a right dominance for working memory (WM) in the prefrontal cortex and precentral gyrus. Meanwhile, the load-dependent processing of WM was localized to the left middle frontal gyrus.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Working memory (WM) encompasses crucial cognitive processes or abilities to retain and manipulate temporary information for immediate execution of complex cognitive tasks in daily functioning such as reasoning and decision-making. The WM of individuals sustaining traumatic brain injury (TBI) was commonly compromised, especially in the domain of WM. The current study investigated the brain responses of WM in a group of participants with mild–moderate TBI compared to their healthy counterparts employing functional magnetic resonance imaging. All consented participants (healthy: <i>n</i> = 26 and TBI: <i>n</i> = 15) performed two variations of the n-back WM task with four load conditions (0-, 1-, 2-, and 3-back). The respective within-group effects showed a right hemisphere-dominance activation and slower reaction in performance for the TBI group. Random-effects analysis revealed activation difference between the two groups in the right occipital lobe in the guided n-back with cues, and in the bilateral occipital lobe, superior parietal region, and cingulate cortices in the n-back without cues. The left middle frontal gyrus was implicated in the load-dependent processing of WM in both groups. Further group analysis identified that the notable activation changes in the frontal gyri and anterior cingulate cortex are according to low and high loads. Though relatively smaller in scale, this study was eminent as it clarified the neural alterations in WM in the mild–moderate TBI group compared to healthy controls. It confirmed the robustness of the phenomenon in TBI with the reproducibility of the results in a heterogeneous non-Western sample.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">The cerebellum on the epilepsy frontline</a></h4>

              
                In a recent study, Streng and colleagues revealed that targeted activation of a specific fastigial output of the cerebellum can powerfully inhibit hippocampal seizures in mice. This study provides insights into how the cerebellum impacts hippocampal activity and opens the way to possible applications for treating temporal lobe epilepsy.
