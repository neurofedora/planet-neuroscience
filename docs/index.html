	<p>Background: E-cigarettes, initially designed for nicotine consumption, are now increasingly being used to smoke cannabis, resulting in a growing trend known as &amp;amp;ldquo;dual vaping&amp;amp;rdquo;. This term describes individuals, referred to as &amp;amp;ldquo;dual users&amp;amp;rdquo;, who use e-cigarettes for both substances. This study aims to review and analyze existing research on dual vaping, with a focus on the associated health risks and behavioral patterns. Methods: A narrative review of the literature was conducted using PubMed. Studies focusing on individuals who use electronic cigarettes for vaping tobacco and cannabis, either chronically or episodically, were examined. Relevant articles were identified and thematically synthesized to provide a comprehensive overview of the topic. Results: Dual vaping was found to be prevalent among younger men, White and Hispanic populations, and individuals with higher economic status and educational level. The use of one substance was shown to predispose individuals to the use of the other, often leading to concurrent use of both substances. Peer influence and positive expectations regarding e-cigarettes were identified as significant predictors of dual use. Dual vapers exhibited a higher susceptibility to respiratory and systemic symptoms compared to those who exclusively vaped nicotine or cannabis. Moreover, a notable prevalence of psychiatric disorders, such as substance use disorders, anxiety, and depression, was observed in this group. Fruit-flavored e-cigarettes were the most preferred option among dual vapers when using both nicotine and cannabis. Conclusions: Current evidence is insufficient to fully elucidate the long-term impacts of dual vaping on physical and mental health, particularly when compared to individuals who have never vaped. Further studies are needed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of this behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-780/v3?src=rss">Evaluating the dynamics of fee-free higher education in South Africa: a causal loop diagram approach  [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background This research investigated the dynamics of fee-free higher education in South Africa, analysing the interplay of socioeconomic, political, and institutional factors to elucidate the complexities surrounding its implementation and impact. Using a causal loop diagram approach (CLD), the study aims to identify key factors to effective implementation, how they interact to shape the outcome of the policy, and actionable strategies to address the challenges hindering the policy sustainability. Method A participatory approach was used to developing the CLD, integrating insights from an extensive literature review and stakeholder opinion. The initial CLD was constructed based on evidence from prior research contextualizing fee-free higher education within South Africa’s unique socio-political sector. Discussions with stakeholders and experts provided critical feedback to refine the model, ensuring its relevance and accuracy. The CLD methodology was selected for its ability to illustrate complex interdependencies and systemic challenges. Results Key findings highlight the impact of funding constraints, which create reinforcing feedback loops limiting access and infrastructure improvements. Also, administrative inefficiencies within the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) result in delays and inconsistencies, reducing policy inclusivity, and decentralized implementation across institutions perpetuates disparities in quality and access. Conclusion The study concludes the urgent need for systemic reforms, including digitising financial aid processes, centralising NSFAS operations, and improving resource allocation to under-resourced institutions. Furthermore, the study aligns with global goals, particularly Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 4 (Quality Education), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), and 10 (Reduced Inequalities), as well as the African Agenda 2063’s focus on human capital development. While the findings offer valuable recommendations for policymakers, further research is needed to explore longitudinal impacts of these reforms and expand comparative analyses with other nations implementing similar policies.

                Background In this paper, we explore the Cartesian product of fuzzy PUP ideals and subalgebras within a PUP (pseudo-UP)algebra X. We investigate how fuzzy pseudo-UP ideals are affected under PUP homomorphisms, particularly focusing on the image and inverse image of the fuzzy sets K α and K v , which generalize classical fuzzy sets. These fuzzy sets aim to quantify the level of ambiguity in fuzzy situations. Methods We introduced the concept of the Cartesian product of fuzzy PUP ideals and subalgebras of PUP algebra and analyzed their properties. Specifically, we studied the behavior of fuzzy pseudo-UP ideals under PUP homomorphism, using the fuzzy sets K α and K v to model ambiguity. We also examined the strongest fuzzy PUP relation on a fuzzy PUP subalgebra and ideal of PUP algebra. Results We proved that the Cartesian product of fuzzy PUP ideals forms a fuzzy pseudo-UP ideal. This result was characterized through its level sets, providing a deeper understanding of the interaction between fuzzy PUP ideals and their algebraic structure. Additionally, the strongest fuzzy PUP relation on a fuzzy PUP subalgebra was defined, and several important properties were derived. Conclusions This work extends the concept of fuzzy PUP ideals in the context of PUP algebras and explores how fuzzy homomorphism influence their structure. Our results contribute to a better understanding of fuzzy relations in algebraic settings and open the door for further research into the properties and applications of fuzzy ideals in PUP algebras.

                Background Cataracts are an assortment of conditions causing the lens to become opaque and lose its typical transparency. Topical corticosteroids like loteprednol etabonate and dexamethasone are commonly administered to alleviate inflammation following cataract surgery. Aim of the study To compare the efficacy of loteprednol etabonate and dexamethasone in managing different clinical parameters following cataract removal, as well as their patient safety. Methods This trial was registered by local IRB at the College of Medicine/University of Baghdad on November 27, 2023, under document approval number UoB.Med.21. Patients undergoing cataract surgery were randomly assigned to two groups: group A received loteprednol etabonate 0.5% drop postoperatively for four weeks, while group B received dexamethasone 0.1% drop postoperatively for the same period. The levels of intraocular pressure (IOP), anterior chamber (AC) reaction, and scores for flare, conjunctival congestion, and pain were monitored at one and four weeks during follow-up visits. Results The visual outcomes were similar between the two groups, and both treatments were well tolerated with minor side effects. Both loteprednol etabonate and dexamethasone effectively reduced IOP, AC reaction, and grading for flare, conjunctival congestion, and pain in cataract patients. None of these clinical measures displayed any significant differences between the two drugs. Conclusion There is no significant difference between topical loteprednol etabonate 0.5% and topical dexamethasone 0.1% pertaining to clinical ocular parameters post-cataract surgery. The decision between these corticosteroids may depend on patient needs and preferences.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-113/v1?src=rss">Financial literacy among young college students: Advancements and future directions  [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract* Financial literacy is one of the most important skills that people need in the 21st century, especially the youngest, as is the case with college students and mastering personal finance skills. This topic has gained importance in recent years in the field of scientific research. The objective of this study was to identify the most relevant factors related to financial education among young university students. A systematic literature review was developed based on the parameters established by the PRISMA statement. A total of 44 datasets were analyzed to identify the most recurring factors in the literature. Finally, the validity of the most relevant issues pertaining to the subject of study were identified. Thus, two themes were evident that are still valid and the most frequent in the literature on financial literacy among university students: financial behavior and financial knowledge. It is concluded that financial Inclusion, Budgeting, Financial Attitude, and Adolescents are other topics with a promising future in future research. The results of this study provide a structured guide for future research and help to identify research gaps that can be addressed in future studies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-112/v1?src=rss">Enhancing Energy Efficiency in Micro-Apartments using Phase Change Materials: A Case Study in Alexandria, Egypt [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Adequate housing is a fundamental human need, yet in Egypt and the MENA region, they face challenges due to rising population pressures and economic difficulties. Affordable options are increasingly scarce, especially for those unable to meet housing market rates. This research explores micro-apartments as an eco-friendly solution aligned with global trends toward minimalism, offering compact living spaces of about 40 square meters. In Alexandria, where awareness is limited and energy consumption is high, the study emphasizes micro-apartments as a housing solution with the aim to improve thermal comfort and energy efficiency for the occupants using Phase Change Materials (PCMs) and passive design strategies. Methods This research evaluates micro-apartments as affordable housing in Egypt, emphasizing passive design and RT24HC Phase Change Material for wall insulation in Alexandria. A prototype is developed, and Design Builder software, using version 7.0.2.006 & Energy Plus 9.4 plugin, simulates the chosen RT24HC PCM’s energy efficiency. This methodology optimizes land use and enhances thermal comfort by integrating PCM with passive design, assessing Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfaction (PPD%) and Predicted Mean Vote (PMV). Results The results indicate that integrating the chosen Phase Change Material with passive design significantly lowers discomfort levels in micro-apartments. Four scenarios tested included: two layers of RT24HC PCM, one layer of RT24HC PCM with XPS insulation, two RT24HC PCM layers with window shading, and two RT24HC PCM layers with 1-meter overhang. The fourth scenario, achieving a 14.18% reduction in predicted discomfort (PPD%) and a Predicted Mean Vote of 1.3, highlights the potential of micro-apartments as an energy-efficient housing through effective PCM integration. Conclusion This study advocates for micro-apartment designs using RT24HC PCM tailored to Alexandria’s climate in Egypt to improve thermal comfort and reduce energy consumption. It provides insights for architects, developers, and policymakers in Egypt, highlighting the importance of PCM in sustainable urban housing solutions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-940/v2?src=rss">Integration of democratic values in natural sciences education: A Literature Review of the last 50 Years [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                This study examines how democratic values have been promoted through natural sciences education over the last 50 years, providing a comprehensive analysis based on a systematic review of relevant literature. The central problem addressed is understanding the role of natural science education in fostering democratic values such as equity, participation, critical thinking, and ethical responsibility. This research aims to identify and analyze strategies, methodologies, and transformative experiences that contribute to the promotion of democratic values. This study employs the PRISMA methodology to ensure a rigorous and structured systematic review. Data were collected from multiple databases using detailed Boolean equations. Tools such as ScientoPy and VOSviewer were used for data preprocessing, clustering, and network visualization, followed by qualitative analysis to categorize the findings. Educational programs in natural sciences have increasingly integrated democratic values, fostering a culture of inclusivity and participation; the incorporation of ICT has enhanced equity and participation, while civic education has been fundamental in developing critical and informed citizens; citizen science initiatives have empowered students to engage in democratic deliberation and address epistemic injustice; cooperative learning methods in science classes have effectively promoted gender equity and inclusion; and emphasis on sustainability and environmental justice in science education has promoted democratic values and empowered students to take action on global challenges. In conclusion, natural science education is an effective vehicle for promoting democratic values, but it is an understudied field. By integrating practices that emphasize inclusivity, critical thinking, and ethical responsibility, science education not only enhances students’ scientific understanding but also prepares them to be active, informed, and responsible citizens.

                Background Research integrity, essential for ethical scientific research, has been inadequately addressed in Ethiopia, resulting in gaps in addressing misconduct like plagiarism, falsification and fabrication. Methods An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted on a random sample of researchers. Data were collected via a self-administered, structured questionnaire, which was adapted from a similar study. The collected data were analysed using descriptive, bivariate, and multivariable logistic regression. Result A total of 244 researchers participated in the study, resulting in an 82% response rate. In our study, 37.7% of participants reported engaging in at least one form of misconduct, 95% CI [31.6%, 44.1%]. Authorship misconduct was the most common form of self-reported misconduct (47.5%), 95% CI [41.1%, 54.0%], followed by fabrication and falsification (40.6%), 95% CI [34.4%, 47.0%]. Publication pressure was significantly associated with research misconduct (AOR = 3.18; 95% CI: [1.02, 9.95]). Conclusion Research misconduct has profound implications, compromising the validity of scientific findings and eroding public trust in research. Implementing comprehensive education initiatives on responsible research practices, as well as building an all-encompassing institutional policy, can help to reduce the occurrence of misconduct.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The study of in vivo thrombus formation has principally been performed using intravital microscopy in mice and other species. These have allowed us to visualise the molecular and cellular processes that regulate thrombus formation inside the body. However current in vivo arterial thrombosis models are difficult to standardise between labs and frequently produce results that do not reliably translate successfully in human clinical trials. Here we provide a step-by-step description with accompanying video tutorials to demonstrate how to produce a 3D humanised thrombus-on-a-chip model, which uses perfusion of fluorescently-labelled human blood over a mechanically-injured human tissue engineered arterial construct (TEAC) within a 3D printed microfluidic flow chamber to replicate thrombus formation within a healthy artery. We also provide a written methodology on how to use 3D printing to produce a mechanical injury press that can reproducibly damage the TEAC as a stimulus for thrombus formation as part of a mechanical injury model. Perfusion of the uninjured TEAC with whole human blood containing DiOC6-labelled platelets without initiating notable thrombus formation. The mechanical injury press was shown to induce a reproducible puncture wound in the TEAC. Fluorescence microscopy was used to demonstrate that thrombus formation could be observed reproducibly around sites of injury. This humanised thrombosis-on-a-chip model can replace the use of animals in in vivo thrombosis models for preclinical assessment of anti-thrombotic therapies. This method also offers multiple scientific advantages: allowing new drugs to be directly tested on human blood from a diverse array of donors, facilitating use of a realistic and reproducible injury modality as well as removing the potential confounding effects of general anaesthetics in animal studies. The use of human thrombus-on-a-chip models combining TEACs offers a new methodology to reduce animal use whilst improving the predictive capabilities of preclinical trials of anti-thrombotic therapies.

                Background Stunting is a serious public health concern in Rwanda, affecting around 33.3% of children under five in 2020. The researchers have employed machine learning algorithms to predict stunting in Rwanda; however, few studies used ANNs, despite their strong capacity to predict stunting. The purpose of this study was to predict stunting in Rwanda using ANNs and the most recent DHS data from 2020. Methods DHS 2020 dataset was used to train and test an ANN model for predicting stunting in children. The dataset, which included various child, parental, and socio-demographic characteristics, was split into 80% training data and 20% testing and validation data. The model utilised a multilayer perceptron (MLP). Model performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC. Feature importances were determined and highlighted the most critical predictors of stunting. Results An overall accuracy of 72.0% on the test set was observed, with an AUC-ROC of 0.84, indicating the model’s good performance. Factors appear to contribute to stunting among the negative value aspects. First and foremost, the mother’s height is important, as a lower height suggests an increased risk of stunting in children. Positive value characteristics, on the other hand, emphasise elements that reduce the likelihood of stunting. The timing of the initiation of breastfeeding stands out as a crucial factor, showing that early breastfeeding initiation has been linked with a decreased risk of stunting. Conclusions These findings suggest that ANNs can be a useful tool for predicting stunting in Rwanda and identifying the most important associated factors for stunting. These insights can inform targeted interventions to reduce the burden of stunting in Rwanda and other low- and middle-income countries. Potential targeted interventions include nutritional support programs for pregnant and lactating mothers, and providing educational programs for parents on nutrition and hygiene.

                Background Home care services are an extension of hospital services provided by hospital staff. The hospital must conduct evaluation, coordination, and education for home care patients to ensure proper care and expedite their recovery. This service also introduces a new concept to the community, as it can help save on costs and equipment. The purpose of this study namely to determine what factors can influence patient satisfaction with home care services from previously published literature. Methods PRISMA guidelines were followed in this systematic review using three electronic databases namely ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google Scholar. There were 228 articles with the keywords Home Care Services AND Satisfaction and derivatives of these terms, full text article type, English language. Subject nursing and health professions, with open access. The data extraction process, irrelevant articles such as articles on patient satisfaction in nursing homes and outside home care were removed. PROSPERO submitted and approved the research protocol with the following number: CRD42023482315. Result Two hundred eighty-eight articles were selected, but 10 met the inclusion criteria. It was found that factors influenced patient satisfaction with home care services. Conclusion Fifteen aspects influence patient satisfaction and two aspects that influence general patient satisfaction in long-term home care. It is expected that the results of this literature review can be used as a reference for hospitals that provide home care services to pay attention to aspects that can affect satisfaction. The author realizes that the varying methods in the articles reviewed are deficiencies in the results of this study.

                Single-cell sequencing technologies offer unprecedented resolution to inspect transcriptomes and generate critical biological insights. As the number of cells and cell types increase in single-cell studies, the effort required to analyze the data surges dramatically, especially when comparative explorations need to be performed on large datasets with different cell types and various sample attributes, such as clinical samples from different age and ancestry groups. Due to the sequential nature of single-cell data analysis, many steps involving multiple method choices and parameter options need to be considered. The computational skills required for integrative and comparative analyses of large datasets with various sample attributes represent a substantial obstacle for many researchers. To address this challenge, we have developed scRICA, a systematic workflow tailored for integrative and comparative single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. This approach streamlines the analytical process, ensuring efficient utilization of computational resources and facilitating scalability for large-scale datasets. With scRICA, researchers can conduct integrative and comparative scRNA-seq analyses with ease, empowering them to derive meaningful insights from their data in a timely manner. scRICA offers a versatile approach by allowing users to input various parameter options from a metadata table, which are inherited throughout the entire analysis workflow. This functionality greatly enhances the efficiency of programming for comparative analyses involving multiple sample attributes. As an R package, scRICA provides a user-friendly interface within the R environment, making it accessible to researchers familiar with R programming. Additionally, scRICA offers a command line execution option, allowing users to seamlessly integrate it into their computational pipelines or execute analyses on High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems. This combination of features ensures flexibility, ease of use, and scalability, making scRICA a valuable tool for comprehensive and efficient single-cell RNA sequencing analysis.

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>The legacy of Santiago Ramón y Cajal, Spain’s first Nobel laureate neuroscientist recognized as the founding father of modern neuroscience, is to be preserved in a new museum in Madrid: the National Museum of Natural Sciences (MNCN), one of the most important scientific research institutes in the country sciences in the scope of natural sciences of the Spanish National Research Council. For a boy who dreamed of being an artist but started his career apprenticed to first a barber and then a cobbler, Santiago Ramón y Cajal made a distinguished mark in science. One of Cajal’s most important contributions to our understanding of the brain was his discovery of the direction of the information flow within neurons and in neural circuits, which he called the “dynamic polarization law,” without a doubt the founding principle of neurosciences. The exposition planned by the MNCN is a perfect occasion to show the academy and, it is hoped, the general public at large the beautiful organization of the nervous system as first acknowledged by modern science. With the highly motivated organizers of this well-planned initiative, neuroscientists at the Cajal Institute are confident that this sample of the Cajal legacy will also be taken as an esthetic experience for those who approach it for the first time. It might be that science and art often go together.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases are characterized by progressive neuronal loss. Previous studies using human postmortem tissues have shown the impact of neurodegenerative disorders on adult neurogenesis. The extent to which adult neural stem cells are activated in the subventricular zone and whether therapeutic treatments such as deep brain stimulation promote adult neurogenesis remains unclear. The goal of the present study is to assess adult neural stem cells activation and neurogenesis in the subventricular zone of patients with Huntington's and Parkinson's diseases who were treated or not by deep brain stimulation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Postmortem brain samples from Huntington's and Parkinson's disease patients who had received or not long-term deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus were used.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Our results indicate a significant increase in the thickness of the subventricular zone and in the density of proliferating cells and activated stem cells in the brain of Huntington's disease subjects and Parkinson's disease patients treated with deep brain stimulation. We also observed an increase in the density of immature neurons in the brain of these patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Overall, our data indicate that long-term deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus promotes cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the subventricular zone that are reduced in Parkinson's disease. Taken together, our results also provide a detailed characterization of the cellular composition of the adult human subventricular zone and caudate nucleus in normal condition and in Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases and demonstrate the plasticity of these regions in response to neurodegeneration.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to delineate synaptic density alterations in multiple system atrophy (MSA) and explore its potential role as a biomarker for MSA diagnosis and disease severity monitoring using [<sup>18</sup>F]SynVesT-1 positron emission tomography / computed tomography (PET CT).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this prospective study, 60 patients with MSA (30 patients with MSA-parkinsonian [MSA-P] subtype and 30 patients with MSA-cerebellar [MSA-C] subtype), 30 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and 30 age-matched healthy controls (HCs) underwent [<sup>18</sup>F]SynVesT-1 PET/CT for synaptic density assessment. Visual, voxel, and volumetric region of interest (VOI) analyses were used to elucidate synaptic density patterns in the MSA brain and establish diagnostic criteria. The diagnostic performances of both visual and VOI-based diagnostics were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Spearman correlation analyses were conducted to investigate the relationship between brain synaptic density and disease severity</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients with MSA displayed extensive reductions in synaptic density throughout the brain, notably affecting both primary VOIs (the cerebellum and putamen) and secondary VOIs including the medulla oblongata, ventral tegmental area, and pons. Notably, patients with MSA-C exhibited a remarkable decrease in cerebellar synaptic density, whereas patients with MSA-P demonstrated significant synaptic loss within the posterior putamen. Compared with patients with PD, the patients with MSA show a more pronounced reduction in synaptic density in infratentorial brain regions. VOI-based diagnosis significantly outperformed visual analysis in diagnosing and differentiating MSA and its subtypes. Synaptic density in primary and multiple secondary VOIs correlated significantly with motor scales in patients with MSA.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study identified widespread synaptic density reductions in MSA, particularly in the basal ganglia and infratentorial region, suggesting [<sup>18</sup>F]SynVesT-1 PET as a potential biomarker for diagnosing and evaluating the disease, and guiding synaptic restoration trials.

                Glioma patients suffer devastating neurological complications. Using mouse models, the authors show that glioma induces neuronal mTOR activity, alters translation of synaptic genes, reduces dendritic spines and inhibitory synapses, and causes hyperexcitability and stimulus-evoked discharges. Inhibiting mTOR with AZD8055 reverses these effects and normalizes neuronal activity, highlighting its therapeutic potential.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97438">Sir2 and Fun30 regulate ribosomal DNA replication timing via MCM helicase positioning and nucleosome occupancy</a></h4>

              
                The association between late replication timing and low transcription rates in eukaryotic heterochromatin is well known, yet the specific mechanisms underlying this link remain uncertain. In <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, the histone deacetylase Sir2 is required for both transcriptional silencing and late replication at the repetitive ribosomal DNA (rDNA) arrays. We have previously reported that in the absence of <i>SIR2</i>, a de-repressed RNA PolII repositions MCM replicative helicases from their loading site at the ribosomal origin, where they abut well-positioned, high-occupancy nucleosomes, to an adjacent region with lower nucleosome occupancy. By developing a method that can distinguish activation of closely spaced MCM complexes, here we show that the displaced MCMs at rDNA origins have increased firing propensity compared to the nondisplaced MCMs. Furthermore, we found that both activation of the repositioned MCMs and low occupancy of the adjacent nucleosomes critically depend on the chromatin remodeling activity of <i>FUN30</i>. Our study elucidates the mechanism by which Sir2 delays replication timing, and it demonstrates, for the first time, that activation of a specific replication origin in vivo relies on the nucleosome context shaped by a single chromatin remodeler.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89506">Systematic evaluation of intratumoral and peripheral BCR repertoires in three cancers</a></h4>

              
                The current understanding of humoral immune response in cancer patients suggests that tumors may be infiltrated with diffuse B cells of extra-tumoral origin or may develop organized lymphoid structures, where somatic hypermutation and antigen-driven selection occur locally. These processes are believed to be significantly influenced by the tumor microenvironment through secretory factors and biased cell-cell interactions. To explore the manifestation of this influence, we used deep unbiased immunoglobulin profiling and systematically characterized the relationships between B cells in circulation, draining lymph nodes (draining LNs), and tumors in 14 patients with three human cancers. We demonstrated that draining LNs are differentially involved in the interaction with the tumor site, and that significant heterogeneity exists even between different parts of a single lymph node (LN). Next, we confirmed and elaborated upon previous observations regarding intratumoral immunoglobulin heterogeneity. We identified B cell receptor (BCR) clonotypes that were expanded in tumors relative to draining LNs and blood and observed that these tumor-expanded clonotypes were less hypermutated than non-expanded (ubiquitous) clonotypes. Furthermore, we observed a shift in the properties of complementarity-determining region 3 of the BCR heavy chain (CDR-H3) towards less mature and less specific BCR repertoire in tumor-infiltrating B-cells compared to circulating B-cells, which may indicate less stringent control for antibody-producing B cell development in tumor microenvironment (TME). In addition, we found repertoire-level evidence that B-cells may be selected according to their CDR-H3 physicochemical properties before they activate somatic hypermutation (SHM). Altogether, our work outlines a broad picture of the differences in the tumor BCR repertoire relative to non-tumor tissues and points to the unexpected features of the SHM process.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96724">A septo-hypothalamic-medullary circuit directs stress-induced analgesia</a></h4>

              
                Stress is a potent modulator of pain. Specifically, acute stress due to physical restraint induces stress-induced analgesia (SIA). However, where and how acute stress and pain pathways interface in the brain are poorly understood. Here, we describe how the dorsal lateral septum (dLS), a forebrain limbic nucleus, facilitates SIA through its downstream targets in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) of mice. Taking advantage of transsynaptic viral-genetic, optogenetic, and chemogenetic techniques, we show that the dLS→LHA circuitry is sufficient to drive analgesia and is required for SIA. Furthermore, our results reveal that the dLS→LHA pathway is opioid-dependent and modulates pain through the pro-nociceptive neurons in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM). Remarkably, we found that the inhibitory dLS neurons are recruited specifically when the mice struggle to escape under restraint and, in turn, inhibit excitatory LHA neurons. As a result, the RVM neurons downstream of LHA are disengaged, thus suppressing nociception. Together, we delineate a poly-synaptic pathway that can transform escape behavior in mice under restraint to acute stress into analgesia.

">A cholinergic spinal pathway for the adaptive control of breathing</a></h4>

              
                The ability to amplify motor neuron (MN) output is essential for generating high intensity motor actions. This is critical for breathing that must be rapidly adjusted to accommodate changing metabolic demands. While brainstem circuits generate the breathing rhythm, the pathways that directly augment respiratory MN output are not well understood. Here, we mapped first-order inputs to phrenic motor neurons (PMNs), a key respiratory MN population that initiates diaphragm contraction to drive breathing. We identified a predominant spinal input from a distinct subset of genetically-defined V0C cholinergic interneurons. We found that these interneurons receive phasic excitation from brainstem respiratory centers, augment phrenic output through M2 muscarinic receptors, and are highly activated under a hypercapnia challenge. Specifically silencing cholinergic interneuron neurotransmission impairs the breathing response to hypercapnia. Collectively, our findings identify a novel spinal pathway that amplifies breathing, presenting a potential target for promoting recovery of breathing following spinal cord injury.

">A formal model of anxiety disorders based on the neural circuit dynamics of the fear and extinction circuits</a></h4>

              
                The pathophysiology of anxiety disorders is the outcome of an imbalance of the fear-anxiety circuit and the extinction circuit. We present a formal model using nonlinear dynamics and network theory, which captures the dynamic interactions of the key nodes of the anxiety and extinction networks. This rudimentary model can be modified by newer data. These core nodes consist of the cells of the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus coding negative valence, the neurons of the basal-lateral amygdala coding negative valence (Rspo2+), the anterior cingulate cortex, the ventral hippocampus neurons coding fear memories, the somatostatin expressing cells of the lateral segment of the central amygdala, the medial segment of the central nucleus of the amygdala-bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and their target nodes. The extinction network consists primarily of the paraventricular thalamic cells coding positive valence, (Ppp1r1b+) cells of the basolateral amygdala coding positive valence, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the PKC{delta} cells of the lateral segment of the central amygdala, and the intercalated cells. Human and non-human animal genetic and epigenetic studies point to deficiencies in brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophic receptor kinase tyrosine 2 production in key nodes causing reduced plasticity extinction network plasticity and leading to a weakened extinction response. We rely primarily on the neurophysiological studies of non-human animal models since nodes generating fear/anxiety and extinction responses are highly conserved across species and equivalent nodes are present within analogous circuits of the human brain. The results are confirmed, where possible by human functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. We believe this simplified model is of heurist value and can lead to a more consistent focus on physiologically based pathophysiology. This would lead to treatments to reverse the pathologic physiology produced by genetic and epigenetic abnormalities, and greater efforts to directly correct pathologic circuit activity through direct interventions such as transcranial magnetic stimulation.

">High intensity exercise before sleep boosts memory encoding the next morning</a></h4>

              
                The importance of sleep for memory consolidation has been extensively studied, but its role for memory encoding remains less well characterized. At the molecular and cellular level, the renormalization of synaptic weights during sleep has received substantial support, which is thought to free capacity to encode new information at the behavioral level. However, at the systems level and behaviorally, support for this process playing a major role for memory function remains scarce. In the current study, we investigated the utility of moderate- and high-intensity evening exercise as a low-cost low-tech intervention to modulate sleep and its influence on subsequent encoding in the morning. Our findings indicate that high-intensity interval training (HIIT) improved post-sleep memory performance with effects lasting up to 24 hours after initial encoding. In addition, we show that especially the early parts of the encoding task were affected by the HIIT intervention, which is in line with increases in synaptic homeostasis being targeted by the exercise. Intriguingly, low-performing participants seemed to benefit more from the HIIT intervention suggesting it not only as a tool for basic research but also as a candidate for applications to boost memory performance in mental disorders or in the elderly. These results provide first evidence that acute exercise can affect learning processes even hours after it occurs.

">Diversity in the impact of heterogeneities on recurrent networks performing a cognitive task</a></h4>

              
                Background and motivation: Artificial recurrent networks are widely used as models to study the complex dynamics underlying biological neural networks during execution of cognitive tasks. However, most studies assume individual units in the recurrent network to be homogeneous repeating units, whereas real neurons exhibit several forms of heterogeneities. In this study, we designed and employed a systematic framework for quantitative assessment of the impact of neural heterogeneities on recurrent networks that were trained to perform a cognitive task. Methodology: Our framework involved training of a population of recurrent networks, differing in terms of their hyperparameters, to perform a cognitive task in the presence of six graded levels of intrinsic heterogeneities. We tested the impact of heterogeneities on several performance metrics that encompassed training performance, task-execution dynamics, and resilience to different forms of post-training heterogeneities (also introduced at different levels. Results: Our population-of-networks approach demonstrate that intrinsic heterogeneities impacted network performance and dynamics in diverse ways even if they were trained with the same training algorithm, convergence criteria, and task specifications. First, our analyses unveiled pronounced network-to-network variability in the dependence of training performance on the level of heterogeneity, in terms of the number of training trials required for learning and the error values associated with task performance. Second, the impact of training heterogeneities on network dynamics during task execution also manifested substantial variability across networks. Finally, our analyses revealed a prominent impact of different forms of post-training heterogeneities on performance errors and network dynamics. We observed progressive increases in errors as well as in trajectory deviations with graded increases in post-training heterogeneities. Importantly, we observed pronounced variability in how robustness to post-training heterogeneities depended on the level of training heterogeneities. Specifically, certain networks showed enhanced robustness to post-training heterogeneities when training heterogeneities were low, whereas others showed better robustness when training heterogeneities were high. Implications: The striking nature of network-to-network variability observed in our analyses strongly advocates a complex systems viewpoint to study the impact of neural heterogeneities on circuit function. Within such a complex system framework, where several functionally specialized subsystems interact with each other in non-random ways to yield collective performance of the task, we argue that the emphasis should not be on heterogeneities in individual components of neural circuits. Instead, we emphasize the need to focus on the global structure of different forms and degrees of heterogeneities across different components and a systematic assessment of how they interact with each other towards adapting and achieving collective function.

">Neuropeptidergic circuit modulation of developmental sleep in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Sleep-wakefulness regulation dynamically evolves along development in flies, fish, and humans. While the mechanisms regulating sleep in adults are relatively well understood, little is known about their counterparts in early developmental stages. Here, we report a neuropeptidergic circuitry that modulates sleep in developing Drosophila larvae. Through an unbiased screen, we identified the neuropeptide Hugin and its receptor PK2-R1 as critical regulators of larval sleep. Our data suggest that HugPC neurons secrete Hugin peptides to activate insulin-producing cells (IPCs), which express a Hugin receptor PK2-R1. IPCs, in turn, release Drosophila insulin-like peptides (Dilps) to regulate sleep. We further show that the Hugin/PK2-R1 axis is dispensable for adult sleep control. Our findings thus reveal the neuromodulatory circuitry regulating larval sleep, highlighting differential impacts of the same modulatory axis on developmental sleep and adult sleep.

">Endothelial Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptor (S1PR) 1, a Functional S1PR in the Human Cerebrovascular Endothelium, Limits Blood Brain Barrier Permeability and Neuronal Injury following Subarachnoid Hemorrhage in Mice.</a></h4>

              
                Hypoxia-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability has been identified as a key contributor to the progression of ischemic-hypoxic brain injury and neuronal dysfunction in stroke and other cerebrovascular diseases. Emerging clinical evidence highlights that the vasoprotective signaling properties of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), mediated through its bioactive lipid component sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), may be impaired in cardiovascular and inflammatory conditions. Nonetheless, the precise contributions and mechanistic roles of S1P signaling within the cerebral microvasculature remain insufficiently characterized. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the role of S1P signaling via its endothelial receptor S1PR1 in the pathophysiology of early brain injury following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), a particularly severe form of stroke. Additionally, we sought to evaluate the relevance of the endothelial S1PR1 pathway in the human cerebrovascular endothelium, its functional role in hypoxia-induced cerebral endothelial barrier dysfunction, and its underlying molecular mechanisms. To address these objectives, we utilized endothelial-specific S1PR1 knockout mice subjected to the endovascular rupture model of aneurysmal SAH, performed mechanistic studies in primary human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells, and characterized S1PR1 expression in human brain tissue using validated protocols. Our findings reveal robust expression of S1PR1 in the cerebrovascular endothelium of both mice and humans. Functional analyses demonstrated that S1PR1 is critical for maintaining BBB integrity and mitigating neuronal injury in the context of SAH. Mechanistic in vitro studies indicated that S1PR1 exerts a vasoprotective effect by limiting hypoxia-induced BBB dysfunction in human primary brain microvascular endothelial cells through inhibition of Rho-associated kinase (ROCK)-mediated phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC), suppression of stress fiber formation and caveolin-1-dependent endosomal trafficking. These results highlight the pivotal role of endothelial S1PR1 signaling in preserving cerebral vascular integrity and provide a strong scientific foundation for developing novel therapeutic approaches targeting the S1P pathway in the endothelium to enhance neurovascular protection.

">The interplay between CB2 and NMDA receptors in Parkinsons disease</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement, causing symptoms such as tremors, stiffness, slowness, and balance problems due to the degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain. Nowadays there is no cure for PD. Alpha synuclein (-syn) aggregates, which are a hallmark of PD, are known to induce microglial activation, specifically the detrimental M1 microglial phenotype, which contributes to neuroinflammation and disease progression. Cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2R) activation has been shown to counteract neuroinflammation. CB2R is able to interact with NMDA receptors (NMDAR), which has also attracted attention in PD research due to its role in excitotoxicity. Here we aimed to study the interaction between CB2R and NMDAR in a PD context. We observed that -syn fibrils alter CB2R activation and CB2R-NMDAR heteromerization in a heterologous expression system. Furthermore, activation of CB2R counteracted NMDAR signaling. In neurons -syn fibrils decreased CB2R-NMDAR heteromer expression, while increasing CB2R signaling. Importantly, CB2R activation counteracted the -syn fibrils-induced increase in M1 activated microglia, while it favored the polarization of microglia to the beneficial M2 phenotype. These results reinforce the idea of using cannabinoids for treating PD, as they provide not only the anti-inflammatory effects of cannabinoids but also counteract the detrimental increase in NMDAR signaling present in this disease.

                The complexity of our environment poses significant challenges for adaptive behavior. Recognizing shared structures across tasks can theoretically improve learning through generalization. However, how such shared representations emerge and influence performance remains poorly understood. Contrary to expectations, our findings revealed that individuals trained on tasks with similar low-dimensional structures performed worse than those trained on dissimilar tasks. Magnetoencephalography revealed correlated neural representations in the same-structure group and anticorrelated ones in the different-structure group. Crucially, practice reduced this performance gap and shifted the neural representations of the tasks in the same-structure group towards anticorrelation, like those in the different-structure group. A neural network model trained on similar tasks replicated these findings: tasks with similar structures require more iterations to orthogonalize their representations. These results highlight a complex interplay between task similarity, neural dynamics, and behavior, challenging traditional assumptions about learning and generalization.

                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, with no effective treatment and limited clinical management. We developed a multifactorial traumatic brain injury model in piglets which mirrors the evolving pathophysiology of severe pediatric TBI, showing age-dependent hypoxic-ischemic cerebral cortical injury and matrix metalloproteinase-driven vasogenic edema, with infant piglets experiencing less tissue damage than toddler piglets. Extracellular matrix breakdown can precipitate neuronal dysfunction, disrupting chloride homeostasis and the reversal potential for GABA. We hypothesized that ongoing tissue damage might be related to markers of immature GABA, evaluated by changes to the expression and phosphorylation of sodium-potassium-2-chloride cotransporter 1 (NKCC1), potassium-chloride cotransporter 2 (KCC2), and a regulatory kinase, (STE20/SPS1-related proline-alanine-rich protein kinase) SPAK. We mapped these markers in developing swine and infant human brain, identifying a postnatal pNKCC1 decrease in human infant hippocampus, and a perinatal cortical and hippocampal GABA switch in pigs, with no change in the thalamus. In infant piglets with severe TBI, upregulation of neuronal pNKCC1 correlated with hypoxic-ischemic injury and seizure duration. We also observed dysregulation of NKCC1, KCC2, and SPAK in cortex and hippocampus in infant and toddler piglets with severe TBI, with thalamus unchanged. We noted ectopic, non-apical localization of pNKCC1 signal in choroid plexus epithelium across ages in piglets and humans with severe TBI, indicating acute dysregulation of the CSF chloride milieu. These findings position swine as a useful model for pediatric TBI research and suggest that SPAK or NKCC1 inhibition in infants may be therapeutic.

                Oligodendroglia are the responsible cells for myelination in the central nervous system and their involvement in Parkinson's disease (PD) is poorly understood. We performed snRNA-seq and image-based spatial transcriptomics of human caudate nucleus and putamen (dorsal striatum) from PD and Control brain donors to elucidate the diversity of oligodendroglia and how they are affected by the disease. We have defined fifteen subclasses, from precursor to mature cells, four of which are disease-associated. These PD-specific populations are characterized by the overexpression of heat shock proteins and distinct expression signatures, including immune responses and myelination alterations. We have also identified disruptions in cell communication and oligodendrocyte development, evidenced by changes in neurotransmitter receptors expression and cell adhesion molecules. These transcriptomic changes correlated with impaired myelin integrity and altered oligodendrocyte distribution in the striatum. Thus, we uncover oligodendroglia as a critical cell type in PD and a potential new therapeutic target.

                In the mammalian olfactory bulb (OB), gap junctions coordinate synchronous activity among mitral and tufted cells to process olfactory information. In insects, gap junctions are also present in the Antennal Lobe (AL), a structure homologous to the mammalian OB. The invertebrate gap junction protein ShakB contributes to electrical synapses between AL Projections Neurons (PNs) in Drosophila. Other gap junction proteins, including Innexin 7 (Inx7), are also expressed in the Drosophila AL, but little is known about their contribution to intercellular communication during olfactory information processing. Here we report spontaneous calcium transients in PNs grown in cell culture that are highly synchronous when these neurons are physically connected. RNAi-mediated knock down of Inx7 in cultured PNs blocks calcium transient neuronal synchronization. In vivo, downregulation of Inx7 in the AL impairs both vinegar-induced electrophysiological calcium responses and behavioral responses to this appetitive stimulus. These results demonstrate that Inx7-encoded gap junctions functionally coordinate PN activity and modulate olfactory information processing in the adult Drosophila AL.

">Long-term hippocampal low-frequency stimulation alleviates focal seizures, memory deficits and synaptic pathology in epileptic mice</a></h4>

              
                Background: Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is a prevalent form of focal epilepsy characterized by seizures originating from the hippocampus and adjacent regions. Neurostimulation presents an alternative for surgery-ineligible patients with intractable seizures. However, conventional approaches have limited efficacy and require refinement for better seizure control. While hippocampal low-frequency stimulation (LFS) has shown promising seizure reduction in animal studies and small clinical cohorts, its mechanisms, sex-specific outcomes, and long-term effects remain unknown. Objectives: We aimed to identify the long-term antiepileptic and cognitive outcomes and potential underlying mechanisms of hippocampal LFS in chronically epileptic male and female mice. Methods: We used the intrahippocampal kainate mouse model replicating the features of MTLE: spontaneous seizures, hippocampal sclerosis, and memory deficits. We applied 1 Hz electrical LFS in the sclerotic hippocampus 6 hours a day, four times a week for 5 weeks and examined its effects on epileptiform activity, spatial memory, and kainate-induced pathological features at cellular and synaptic levels. Results: Long-term hippocampal LFS consistently diminished focal seizures in epileptic male and female mice, with seizure reduction extending beyond the stimulation period. Additionally, LFS relieved spatial memory deficits and reversed pathological long-term potentiation-like changes at perforant path-dentate granule cell synapses. LFS had no significant effect on generalized convulsive seizures, anxiety-like behaviour, neurogenesis, hippocampal sclerosis, excitatory synapse marker expression, or presynaptic vesicles in perforant path fibers. Conclusion: These findings provide clinically relevant insights into the seizure type-specific effects of hippocampal LFS, which, alongside synaptic and behavioural improvements, could contribute to enhanced seizure control and quality of life in MTLE patients.

">Predictive Coding algorithms induce brain-like responses in Artificial Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                This study explores whether predictive coding (PC) inspired Deep Neural Networks can serve as biologically plausible neural network models of the brain. We compared two PC-inspired training objectives, a predictive and a contrastive approach, to a supervised baseline in a simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture. We evaluated the models on key signatures of PC, including mismatch responses, formation of priors, and learning of semantic information. Our results show that the PC-inspired models, especially a locally trained predictive model, exhibited these PC-like behaviors better than a Supervised or an Untrained RNN. Further, we found that activity regularization evokes mismatch response-like effects across all models, suggesting it may serve as a proxy for the energy-saving principles of PC. Finally, we find that Gain Control (an important mechanism in the PC framework) can be implemented using weight regularization. Overall, our findings indicate that PC-inspired models are able to capture important computational principles of predictive processing in the brain, and can serve as a promising foundation for building biologically plausible artificial neural networks. This work contributes to our understanding of the relationship between artificial and biological neural networks, and highlights the potential of PC-inspired algorithms for advancing brain modelling as well as brain-inspired machine learning.

	<p>Background/Objectives: We examined the effects of cardiovascular exercise on verbal fluency using a between-groups design. Methods: Within our experimental (i.e., exercise) group, participants performed phonemic and semantic verbal fluency tasks (VFTs) before, during, and after a vigorous 30 min bout of cycling. Participants within our control group also completed these VFTs before, during, and after a non-physical activity. We compared the VFT performance of the experimental (exercise) and control (no-exercise) groups of participants in terms of the characteristics of the words that they produced within the VFTs. In addition, we examined these aspects of VFT performance for each participant group across time within the experiment session. Conclusions: From these comparisons, we see that exercise influenced VFT performance. Most notably, participants engaged in exercise changed their VFT performance over time, while control group participants did not. Exercising participants produced more words over the course of their exercise session that contained fewer letters over time and were lower in frequency during and after exercise as compared to before exercise. Additionally, topic switches in the VFTs increased after exercise as compared to before exercise. Participants in the control group did not change their VFT performance over time according to any of these measures. These findings indicate that exercise impacted participants&amp;amp;rsquo; lexical access and that these VFT performance changes were not due to practice effects.</p>

	<p>Background: Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) represents a widely prevalent and heterogeneous neurodevelopmental condition in pediatric populations, often exhibiting a substantial propensity to persist into adulthood. ADHD is a multifaceted disorder that resists straightforward diagnostic tests. Clinicians must invest substantial time and effort to secure an accurate diagnosis and implement effective treatment. ADHD diagnosis is primarily based on psychiatric tests, as there is currently no clinically utilized objective diagnostic tool. Nonetheless, several studies in have documented endeavors to create objective instruments designed to assist in the diagnostic process of ADHD, aiming to enhance diagnostic accuracy and reduce subjectivity. Method: This research endeavor sought to establish an objective diagnostic modality for ADHD through the utilization of electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis. With the use of innovative deep learning techniques, this research seeks to improve the diagnosis of ADHD using EEG data. To capture complex patterns in EEG data, this study proposes a double-augmented attention mechanism ResNet-based model. Using an autoencoder for feature extraction, the Reptile Search Algorithm for feature selection, and a modified ResNet architecture for model training comprise the technique. Results: AUC, F1-score, accuracy, precision, recall, and other standard classifiers like Random Forest and AdaBoost were utilized to compare the model&amp;amp;rsquo;s performance. By a wide margin, the proposed ResNet model outperforms the traditional models with a 99.42% accuracy, 99.03% precision, 99.82% recall, and 99.42% F1-score. Conclusions: ROC AUC score of 0.99 for the model underscores its remarkable capability to differentiate between children with and without ADHD, thereby minimizing misclassification errors and improving diagnostic precision.</p>

	<p>This case study examined the process of integration of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and sensorimotor psychotherapy (SP) in three-phase trauma treatment with a 32-year-old female Bengali refugee with Complex Post Traumatic Disorder (C-PTSD). The treatment was provided in a Western country. The client&amp;amp;rsquo;s improvement was assessed by using self-report assessments of post-traumatic, dissociative, and depressive symptoms. Psychodiagnostics&amp;amp;rsquo; scores gathered after 2 years of treatment showed significant improvements in post-traumatic, dissociative, and depressive symptoms. Although firm conclusions cannot be drawn due to the limitations of this study, results suggest that integrating CBT and SP in a phase-trauma approach may be an effective treatment for C-PTSD in a transcultural setting. However, replicating and standardizing such preliminary results on larger samples is necessary. Background/Objectives: SP is an innovative psychotherapeutic intervention aimed at treating trauma through a bottom-up approach, however, little research exists regarding the efficacy of this psychotherapy. This case study aims to investigate the efficacy of the combination of CBT and SP in treating a C-PTSD patient in a transcultural setting. Methods: Three questionnaires were administered to investigate post-traumatic, depressive, and dissociative symptoms. Results: Clinical and psychodiagnostic outcomes highlight significant psychological improvements in the patient. Conclusions: Although any firm conclusion cannot be drawn because of various intrinsic limitations (i.e., single case study) that straiten our ability to extend these results, this case study suggests that the integration of CBT and SP may be an effective treatment for C-PTSD in a transcultural setting.</p>

">Targeted Antisense Oligonucleotide Treatment Rescues Developmental Alterations in Spinal Muscular Atrophy Organoids</a></h4>

              
                Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a severe neurological disease caused by mutations in the SMN1 gene, characterized by early onset and degeneration of lower motor neurons. Understanding early neurodevelopmental defects in SMA is crucial for optimizing therapeutic interventions. Using spinal cord and cerebral organoids generated from multiple SMA type I donors, we revealed widespread disease mechanisms beyond motor neuron degeneration. Single-cell transcriptomics uncovered pervasive alterations across neural populations, from progenitors to neurons, demonstrating SMN-dependent dysregulation of neuronal differentiation programs. Multi-electrode array analysis identified consistent hyperexcitability in both spinal and brain organoids, establishing altered electrical properties as a central nervous system-wide feature of pathogenesis. Early administration of an optimized antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that restored SMN levels rescued morphological and functional deficits in spinal cord organoids across different genetic backgrounds. Importantly, this early intervention precisely corrected aberrant splicing in newly identified SMN1 targets enriched at critical nodes of neuronal differentiation. Our findings demonstrate that early developmental defects are core features of SMA pathogenesis that can be prevented by timely therapeutic intervention, providing new insights for optimizing treatment strategies.

">7-ketocholesterol contributes to microglia-driven increases in astrocyte reactive oxygen species in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Oxidative stress is a prominent feature of Alzheimer's disease. Within this context, cholesterol undergoes oxidation, producing the pro-inflammatory product 7-ketocholesterol (7-KC). In this study, we observe elevated levels of 7-KC in the brains of the 3xTg mouse model of AD. To further understand the contribution of 7-KC on the oxidative environment, we developed a method to express a genetically encoded fluorescent hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) sensor in astrocytes, the primary source of cholesterol in the brain. With this sensor, we discovered that 7-KC increases H2O2 levels in astrocytes in vivo, but not when directly applied to astrocytes in vitro. Interestingly, when 7-KC was applied to a microglia cell line alone or mixed astrocyte and microglia cultures, it resulted in microglia activation and increased oxidative stress in astrocytes. Depletion of microglia from 3xTg mice resulted in reduced 7-KC in the brains of these mice. Taken together, these findings suggest that 7-KC, acting through microglia, contributes to increased astrocyte oxidative stress in AD. This study sheds light on the complex interplay between cholesterol oxidation, microglia activation, and astrocyte oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of AD.

">NAc-DBS selectively enhances memory updating without effect on retrieval</a></h4>

              
                Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as a widely used therapeutic option when pharmacological treatments prove ineffective or refractory for psychiatric patients. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) represents a frequently targeted site in DBS interventions due to its demonstrated safety profile and therapeutic efficacy in obsessive-compulsive disorder, major depression, and anorexia nervosa. However, limited mechanistic understanding hampers its broader clinical applicability. This study sought to delineate the distinct behavioural dimensions modulated by NAc-DBS, its impact on distinct facets of memory, and to elucidate the underlying brain-network mechanism of action. We developed a novel spatial navigation task for rats and employed a high-dimensional behavioural analysis complemented by fMRI to dissect the cognitive, behavioural and neurobiological effects of NAc-DBS. Active NAc-DBS produced a selective enhancement of long-term memory encoding without affecting memory recall or working memory. We found no effect of NAc-DBS on motor, appetitive or stress-related behaviours. Sustained neuronal activation in the NAc, septum, entorhinal and insular cortex demonstrated no desensitization to chronic NAc-DBS, which triggered a functional reorganization among dopaminergic-related structures. These findings suggest that NAc-DBS induces a functional reorganization in the mesocorticolimbic system, potentially mimicking a dopaminergic novelty signal to enhance memory updating. This provides a mechanistic basis for the therapeutic use of NAc-DBS, particularly in improving cognitive flexibility in psychiatric disorders.

">Reciprocal interaction between cortical SST and PV interneurons in regulating top-down retinothalamic refinement</a></h4>

              
                Refinement of thalamic circuits is crucial for the proper maturation of sensory circuits. In the visual system, this process is regulated by corticothalamic feedback during the experience-dependent phase of development. Yet the cortical circuits modulating this feedback remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate opposing roles for cortical somatostatin (SST) and parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in shaping retinogeniculate connectivity during the thalamic sensitive period (P20-30). Early in the refinement process, SST interneurons promote the strengthening and pruning of retinal inputs in the thalamus, as evidenced by disrupted synaptic refinement following their ablation. In contrast, PV interneurons, which mature later, act as a brake on this refinement, with their ablation leading to enhanced pruning of retinogeniculate connections. Notably, manipulating the relative balance between these inhibitory circuits can regulate sensory deprivation-induced retinogeniculate remodeling. Taken together, our findings show that cortical SST and PV interneuron circuits drive reciprocal antagonism that gate experience-dependent feedforward thalamic refinement.

">Decreased KCC2 expression in the human spinal dorsal horn associated with chronic pain and long-term opioid use</a></h4>

              
                Loss of GABAergic and glycinergic inhibitory efficacy in the spinal dorsal horn is associated with neuropathic pain and opioid-induced hyperalgesia in rodent models. Downregulation of the KCC2 chloride extrusion transporter is a key mechanism underlying this decreased inhibitory efficacy, but to-date there is no evidence supporting or opposing this hypothesis in humans. Here we demonstrate that KCC2 expression is decreased in superficial dorsal horn neurons of organ donors who died with a documented history of pain, or of long-term opioid use. We show profoundly decreased KCC2 dorsal horn membrane expression in a primary cohort associated with either chronic pain or opioid use, and in a replication cohort of mixed chronic pain and opioid use history. These results show that decreased dorsal horn inhibitory efficacy likely promotes chronic pain in humans and support the development of therapeutics augmenting KCC2 function as a treatment for chronic pain and opioid use disorders.

">Persistent interferon signaling that causes sensory neuron plasticity and pain in arthritis</a></h4>

              
                While the inflammatory processes in rheumatoid arthritis have been described, mechanisms driving pain are poorly defined. Here, we used a multitude of approaches to uncover the neural basis, mediators, intracellular signaling pathway and the mechanism of inflammatory pain. In cartilage autoantibody-induced arthritis mice, an early immune-activation and a cytokine storm were mainly driven by vascular cells and monocyte/macrophages in the dorsal root ganglion. However, persistently elevated interferons and receptor-activation of the MNK1/2-eIF4E signaling pathway at all disease phases caused sensory-motor dysfunction and pain by inducing hyperexcitability and sensitization of Gfra3+ sensory neurons. Like mice, human sensory neurons expressed interferon receptors and interferons were elevated only in individuals with painful rheumatoid arthritis. Signaling pathway inhibition in vivo reversed pain and restored limb function. The finding that joint pain before and during arthritis is caused by a defined cytokine and signaling pathway holds promise for targeted therapies for pain relief in arthritis.

">Integrative Gene Co-expression Network Analysis Reveals Protein-Coding and lncRNA Genes Associated with Alzheimer's Disease Pathology</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder involving widespread molecular disruptions, many of which remain poorly understood. While AD pathology progresses through distinct brain regions, it is unclear whether these regions are similarly affected. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as key regulators in cellular processes, but their roles in AD remain largely unexplored. A comprehensive analysis of the complex molecular interactions underlying AD, particularly the roles of lncRNAs in their interactions with protein-coding genes and the comparison of networks across brain regions, could offer valuable insights into the disease's progression and underlying mechanisms. Method: To address this, we applied consensus weighted gene co-expression network analysis using a meta-analytic approach to 396 postmortem brain RNA-seq samples to explore AD pathophysiology mechanisms. Results: Our study revealed significant network rewiring in AD, with pronounced alterations in the temporal cortex compared to the frontal cortex. While the temporal cortex showed adaptive changes in gene interactions, the frontal cortex exhibited a loss of healthy correlations, potentially reflecting different levels of disease progression. We identified key players in the temporal cortex AD network, including 46 protein-coding genes and 27 lncRNAs. Using the established functions of protein-coding genes as anchors, we provided functional annotations for over 100 lncRNAs across two brain regions, identifying potential lncRNAs involved in AD pathology and highlighting their roles in both healthy and diseased states. Conclusion: We provided novel insights into the molecular interactions underlying AD and introduced new candidate protein-coding and lncRNA genes for further experimental validation and therapeutic exploration.

">Takens' theorem to assess EEG traces: regional variations in brain dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Takens' theorem (TT) proves that the behaviour of a dynamical system can be effectively reconstructed within a multidimensional phase space. This offers a comprehensive framework for examining temporal dependencies, dimensional complexity and predictability of time series data. We applied TT to investigate the physiological regional differences in EEG brain dynamics of healthy subjects, focusing on three key channels: FP1 (frontal region), C3 (sensorimotor region), and O1 (occipital region). We provided a detailed reconstruction of phase spaces for each EEG channel using time-delay embedding. The reconstructed trajectories were quantified through measures of trajectory spread and average distance, offering insights into the temporal structure of brain activity that traditional linear methods struggle to capture. Variability and complexity were found to differ across the three regions, revealing notable regional variations. FP1 trajectories exhibited broader spreads, reflecting the dynamic complexity of frontal brain activity associated with higher cognitive functions. C3, involved in sensorimotor integration, displayed moderate variability, reflecting its functional role in coordinating sensory inputs and motor outputs. O1, responsible for visual processing, showed constrained and stable trajectories, consistent with repetitive and structured visual dynamics. These findings align with the functional specialization of different cortical areas, suggesting that the frontal, sensorimotor and occipital regions operate with autonomous temporal structures and nonlinear properties. This distinction may have significant implications for advancing our understanding of normal brain function and enhancing the development of brain-computer interfaces. In sum, we demonstrated the utility of TT in revealing regional variations in EEG traces, underscoring the value of nonlinear dynamics.

">Elaborating the connections of a closed-loop forebrain circuit in the rat: Circumscribed evidence for novel topography within a cortico-striato-pallidal triple descending projection, with thalamic feedback, to the anterior lateral hypothalamic area</a></h4>

              
                Motivated behaviors are regulated by distributed forebrain networks. Traditional approaches have often focused on individual brain regions and connections that do not capture the topographic organization of forebrain connectivity. We performed co-injections of anterograde and retrograde tract tracers in rats to provide novel high-spatial resolution evidence of topographic connections that elaborate a previously identified closed-loop forebrain circuit implicated in affective and motivational processes. The nodes of this circuit include select regions of the medial prefrontal cortex (defined here more specifically as the cingulate region, CNG), a dorsomedial portion of the nucleus accumbens (ACBdm), a portion of the medial substantia innominata (SIm), and the anterior lateral hypothalamic area (LHAa). The circuit also reportedly receives a feedback loop from the anterior region of the paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVTa). In this draft report, we provide detailed circumscribed evidence supporting these regions as interconnected nodes, and provide several novel findings concerning the topographic organization of their projections. First, we identified the ACBdm based on its unique connectivity. Anterograde labeling from anterior paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVTa) and retrograde labeling from medial substantia innominata (SIm) and lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) were restricted to the dorsomedial ACB (ACBdm). Strikingly, this labeling formed a longitudinal column extending along virtually the entire anteroposterior axis of ACBdm. Subsequent analysis revealed a convergence of ACBdm axon terminals and retrogradely labeled neurons from LHA within the anterior SIm. Furthermore, we identified cortical CNG regions related to this circuit. These regions contained retrograde labeling from both ACBdm and LHA, and anterograde labeling from PVTa. These cortical subdomains included regions previously implicated in the circuit but for which detailed organization has been unknown: (1) a region between the posterior prelimbic and infralimbic areas; (2) posterior part of basolateral and basomedial amygdalar nuclei, and (3) anterior pole of ventral subiculum. Our circumscribed findings, which await additional samples and analysis, support the existence of a topographically organized closed-loop circuit and identify two additional novel features: (1) direct evidence for an elaborate core rostrocaudal topography for a cortico-striato-pallidal motif comprising a triple descending projection to the LHA via direct, indirect, and hyperdirect pathways, and (2) a thalamic feedback system with specific projections to each cortical and striatal node of the circuit. We discuss the implications of this newly elaborated circuit for understanding the neural basis of motivational processes.

">Transcriptional and synaptic regulation of NMDA glutamate receptor-mediated hippocampal plasticity and memory</a></h4>

              
                Synapse-to-nucleus signaling regulates activity-dependent synaptic plasticity underlying memory by linking N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors (GluN) to gene transcription mediated by the transcription factor cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB), but the underlying gene programs mediating potentiation at excitatory synapses are unknown. Here, we analyzed genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) datasets of mouse and human CREB and the synaptonuclear factor CREB-regulated transcription coactivator1 (CRTC1) to identify relevant target genes and biological pathways coupling neuronal activity to synaptic function/plasticity. Our analyses indicate that CRTC1 specifically couples neuronal activity with synaptic plasticity by binding to conserved promoters of CREB target genes comprising inducible transcription factors (including c-fos, Crem, Npas4 and Nr4a1-3), and neuronal excitability and plasticity genes, including Ntrk2, Homer1, Dlg4 (PSD-95) and the NMDA receptor subunit Grin1 (GluN1). CRTC1/CREB target genes were highly enriched in gene ontology (GO) nuclear terms, including several members of the CREB family, and transcriptional modulators and repressors. Interestingly, GO enrichment and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses revealed that genes mediating synapse-to-nucleus signaling (including most known synaptonuclear factors and direct interacting modulators) are collectively regulated by CREB/CRTC1, and that protein kinase C (PKC) is a key interactor of the CRTC1/14-3-3 complex at synapses. In agreement with these in silico analyses, we show that CRTC1 regulates synaptic activity-dependent phosphorylation and synaptic recruitment of GluN1 mediated by PKC in hippocampal neurons, and that PKC activation reverses NMDA receptor-mediated currents and long-term potentiation (LTP) deficits caused by CRTC1 silencing in the hippocampus. Consistent with genomics and functional data, morphological and behavioral analyses show crucial roles of CRTC1 on dendritic spine structure, plasticity, and hippocampal-dependent associative memory. Our results support a model in which neuronal activity and synaptic inputs are integrated in the nucleus through conserved CREB/CRTC1-regulated transcriptional programs sustaining global synapse-to-nucleus signaling pathways impacting on synaptic plasticity and memory.

">Shared and individual tuning curves for social vision</a></h4>

              
                A stimulus with light is clearly visual; a stimulus with sound is clearly auditory. But what makes a stimulus "social", and how do judgments of socialness differ across people? Here, we characterize both group-level and individual thresholds for perceiving the presence and nature of a social interaction. We take advantage of the fact that humans are primed to see social interactions-e.g., chasing, playing, fighting-even in very un-lifelike stimuli such as animations of geometric shapes. Unlike prior work using these stimuli, we exploit their most advantageous property, which is that their visual features are fully parameterizable. We use this property to construct psychophysics-inspired "social tuning curves" for individual subjects. Social tuning curves are stable within individuals, unique across individuals, and show some relationship to socio-affective traits. Results support the view that social information processing begins early in the perceptual hierarchy. Further, our approach lays the foundation for a generative account of social perception in single subjects.

">A Causal and Dissociable Role for the Right Inferior Prefrontal Cortex in Empathy for Physical and Social Pain</a></h4>

              
                The right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) are key nodes in the social brain, implicated in empathy for physical and social pain. However, their causal and dissociable contributions remain unclear. In this study, 52 young adults underwent focal transcranial direct current stimulation (f-tDCS) targeting the rIFG or dmPFC in a sham-controlled, double-blind, crossover design. Participants rated the intensity of pain in images depicting social or physical pain during stimulation. Anodal stimulation to the rIFG increased ratings of physical pain and decreased ratings of social pain, suggesting dissociable roles in processing empathy for these two pain types. In contrast, dmPFC stimulation did not modulate ratings, potentially reflecting its role in higher-order social cognitive processes rather than affective empathy. The effects of rIFG stimulation on social pain were significantly stronger in the initial trials, suggesting potential habituation within the rIFG or stimulation-specific effects. These results provide causal, dissociable evidence for the rIFG's involvement in empathy, with its effects differing based on the type of pain. This supports the proposal that distinct neural processes underlie empathy for social versus physical pain.

	<p>Background/Objectives: In a tonal language like Chinese, phonologically contrasting tones signify word meanings at the syllable level. Although the development of lexical tone perception ability has been examined in many behavioral studies, its developmental trajectory from childhood to adulthood at the neural level remains unclear. This cross-sectional study aimed to examine the issue by measuring the mismatch negativity (MMN) response to a Chinese lexical tonal contrast in three groups. Methods: The MMN response to a flat-falling tonal contrast (Tone1 versus Tone4) were recorded from children (25 participants aged 6&amp;amp;ndash;8), adolescents (26 participants aged 12&amp;amp;ndash;14), and young adults (20 participants aged 18&amp;amp;ndash;24). Nonsense speech stimuli were also used by superimposing Tone1 and Tone4 on an English syllable. Results: All three groups demonstrated typical early MMN responses in both the meaningful and nonsense syllable conditions. However, the MMN amplitudes varied significantly across groups, with the child group showing smaller responses compared to the adolescent and adult groups, while the latter two groups had similar MMN amplitudes. Conclusions: Neural sensitivity to tonal contrasts is not fully mature in children and reaches a more adult-like level during adolescence, with no significant difference in sensitivity to meaningful versus nonsense syllables. These results provide new insights into the neural development of lexical tone perception in a tonal language, highlighting its maturation during adolescence in this process.</p>

	<p>Background: Many studies, for example, on taste-visual dissonance, have shown that the influence of the visual cortex on taste sensation is enormous. The presented work aims to investigate, using fNIRS, whether a taste stimulus, in this case, the taste of bitter, also causes stimulation of the visual cortex in the fNIRS study. Methods: fNIRS was used to examine 51 participants (204 examinations, 9996 records), collecting signals from the left hemisphere. Differences between the maximum and minimum changes in oxyHb concentrations (&amp;amp;Delta;oxyHb) for the areas of the brain cortex considered responsible for recording visual and gustatory signals were analyzed. Protocols I, II, III, and IV&amp;amp;mdash;activation with distillate water, coffee with lower concentration, reference (no stimulation), and coffee with higher concentration, respectively, were used. Results: We recorded high signals for teste activation on channels covering the gustatory cortex, which confirms the correctness of the choice of research method. As expected, a significant statistical difference was observed between protocols I, II, and IV and reference III (without stimulation). What seems important is the fact that we also received high signals for the channels 45&amp;amp;ndash;49, which cover the visual cortex. The statistical analysis shows no differences between protocols I, II, and IV (different taste activation&amp;amp;mdash;water, coffee A, and coffee B) for specific channels for analyzing regions of interest. As a result of the analysis of the correlation between the subjective bitterness assessment solutions and the signal &amp;amp;Delta;oxyHb height, it was observed that a statistically significant correlation, although weak, occurs only for 14 and gustatory channels, only for coffee with a higher concentration. Additionally, the only statistically significant difference between women and men was observed in Protocol I (water), where the &amp;amp;Delta;oxyHb signal was twice as high in women compared to men. Conclusions: In conclusion, we can clearly state that the senses of sight and taste work closely together. Moreover, this cooperation is not one-sided: while visual activation influences taste perception, interestingly, a taste stimulus can also generate a hemodynamic response, activating the visual cortex.</p>

	<p>Background: Perfectionism in adolescents can have both adaptive and maladaptive forms, with implications for mental health and school performance. This study aimed to investigate the relationships among perfectionism, mental health factors, and emotional regulation in adolescents and to evaluate the efficacy of psychoeducational interventions. Methods: Two studies were conducted: (1) A cross-sectional study (n = 261) examined the correlations among perfectionism, mental health factors, and emotional regulation. (2) An experimental study (n = 115) evaluated the effects of psychoeducation on perfectionism and healthy habits compared with a control group. The measures included questionnaires on perfectionism, depression, anxiety, stress, and emotional regulation. Results: Study 1 found that maladaptive perfectionism was positively correlated with depression (r = 0.52, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), anxiety (r = 0.48, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), stress (r = 0.45, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and difficulties in emotional regulation (r = 0.39, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Adaptive perfectionism was negatively correlated with deficits in emotional understanding (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.31, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Study 2 showed that psychoeducational interventions reduced maladaptive perfectionism (mean difference = &amp;amp;minus;5.7, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05, Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s d = 0.62) and depression levels (mean difference = &amp;amp;minus;3.2, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05, Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s d = 0.38) but increased stress in the experimental groups. No significant changes were observed in adaptive perfectionism or the anxiety level. Conclusions: These findings highlight the complex relationships among perfectionism, mental health, and emotional regulation in adolescents. Targeted interventions can reduce maladaptive perfectionism and its associated negative effects. Further research is needed on the long-term outcomes and refinement of interventional strategies.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The aim of this study was to explore the microstructural dynamics of the subventricular zone (SVZ) with aging and their associations with clinical disability and brain structural damage in pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>One-hundred and forty-one pediatric-onset MS patients (67 pediatric and 74 adults with pediatric-onset) and 233 healthy controls (HC) underwent neurological and 3.0 T MRI assessment. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were extracted from the SVZ and the thalamus (as control region).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In HC, SVZ FA was higher until age 40 then declined, whereas MD was lower until age 35 before rising (false discovery rate <i>p</i> value [pFDR] ≤ 0.008). Thalamic FA was higher until age 30 and then declined, whereas MD was higher until age 50 (pFDR ≤ 0.007). Pediatric MS patients showed significantly higher SVZ FA than pediatric HC (pFDR &lt; 0.001), while adult patients showed no differences compared to adult HC (pFDR ≤ 0.724). Adult patients had lower thalamic FA and higher MD (pFDR &lt; 0.001). Adults had lower SVZ FA and MD, but higher thalamic MD compared to pediatric patients (pFDR &lt; 0.001). In pediatric MS, higher SVZ FA and MD were associated with higher white matter (WM) lesion volume (LV) and choroid plexus volume and lower brain and thalamic volumes (pFDR ≤ 0.047). In adult patients, higher SVZ MD associated with higher WM LV, lower brain volumes, and lower z-SDMT (pFDR≤0.019). Thalamic microstructural abnormalities were associated with more severe disability and brain damage in both groups (pFDR ≤ 0.018).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings suggest that microstructural changes in the SVZ occur early in pediatric MS and are associated with brain structural damage but not with clinical impairment. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study assesses whether longitudinal quantitative pupillometry predicts neurological deterioration after large middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke and determines how early changes are detectable.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This prospective, single-center observational cohort study included patients with large MCA stroke admitted to Boston Medical Center's intensive care unit (2019–2024). Associations between time-to-neurologic deterioration and quantitative pupillometry, including Neurological Pupil Index (NPi), were assessed using Cox proportional hazards models with time-dependent covariates adjusted for age, sex, and Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score. Models using dilation velocity were compared with partial likelihood ratio tests. Pupillometric changes over 2-h intervals in the 12 h preceding deterioration were analyzed with linear mixed-effects modeling and Tukey's test. Matched referents (age, sex, stroke side, follow-up duration) were used for comparison. Optimal thresholds were identified using the Youden Index.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 71 patients (mean age 66.5 years; 59.2% women), 32 (45.1%) experienced deterioration. A 1-unit decrease in NPi was associated with a higher hazard of deterioration (hazard ratio 2.46; 95% confidence interval 1.68–3.61). Dilation velocity improved model performance compared to NPi alone. NPi was significantly lower at 0–2 h (3.81 vs. 4.38, p = 0.001) and 2–4 h (3.71 vs. 4.38, p &lt; 0.001) before deterioration compared to 10–12 h prior. Optimal thresholds were 4.01 for NPi, 0.49 mm/s for dilation velocity, and −0.15 change in NPi over 12 h.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Quantitative pupillometry predicts neurological deterioration in MCA stroke, with declines detectable up to 12 h prior. Dilation velocity shows promise as a novel biomarker. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <p>The long-term clinical outcomes and associated prognostic factors in contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2)-antibody diseases are unknown. A total of 75 participants with CASPR2 antibodies were longitudinally assessed for disability, quality-of-life, and chronic pain. Although most symptoms improved within 6 months of treatment, neuropathic pain and fatigue were the most immunotherapy refractory, and persisted for up to 6 years. Furthermore, these two factors—but not CASPR2 antibody levels or subclasses—independently predicted worse disability and quality-of-life at 24 months. Quality-of-life varied widely for any given modified Rankin Scale score, indicating a divergence between patient and clinician assessed outcomes. Further work should study the relative importance of these measures, and the immunopathogenesis underlying intractable symptoms. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

<p>Neuropeptides belonging to the cholecystokinin/sulfakinin (CCK/SK) family mediate satiety signals across phylogeny. In this study, a potential anatomical substrate for such satiety signals was described in the snail <i>Biomphalaria glabrata</i>. We propose that CCK/SK signals directly modulate gustatory sensory neurons that project from the lips to the brain.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Snails belonging to the genus <i>Biomphalaria</i> serve as obligatory intermediate hosts for the trematode <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i>, the causative agent for the most widespread form of schistosomiasis. The simpler nervous systems of gastropod molluscs, such as <i>Biomphalaria</i>, provide advantageous models for investigating neural responses to infection at the cellular and network levels. The present study examined neuropeptides related to cholecystokinin (CCK), a major multifunctional regulator of central nervous system (CNS) function in mammals. A neural transcriptome generated from the CNS of <i>Biomphalaria alexandrina</i> included a transcript encoding two CCK-related peptides, designated <i>Balex</i>-CCK1 (pEGEWSYDY<sub>(SO</sub>
<sub>3</sub>
<sub>H)</sub>GLGGGRF-NH<sub>2</sub>) and <i>Balex</i>-CCK2 (NYGDY<sub>(SO</sub>
<sub>3</sub>
<sub>H)</sub>GIGGGRF-NH<sub>2</sub>). Peptide expression was examined in <i>Biomphalaria glabrata</i> at the mRNA level using the hybridization chain reaction (HCR) protocol and at the protein level using an antibody against <i>Balex</i>-CCK1. Expression was detected in 60–70 neurons distributed throughout the CNS, as well as in profuse fiber systems connecting the ganglia and projecting to the periphery. CCK-like immunoreactive (CCK<sub>li</sub>) fibers were also observed on organs associated with the cardiorespiratory (nephridium, mantle, gill) and male reproductive systems. A comparison of mRNA and peptide localization suggested that CCK expression could be regulated at the level of translation. A potential role of these peptides in mediating responses to infection by larval schistosomes is discussed.</p>

                Xu et al. investigated the single-cell characteristics of pancreatic cancer liver metastasis and found that the pro-metastatic neutrophil cluster is enriched at the metastatic border. NFE2-driven neutrophil phenotypic polarization represents a critical pro-metastatic mechanism. TGF-β/SMAD3 activates NFE2, further promoting NET release at the invasive front by transcriptional regulation of PADI4.

">Biased replay of aversive and uncertain outcomes underlies irrational decision making</a></h4>

              
                Humans often make irrational decisions when facing uncertain or aversive future events despite careful deliberation. How we make choices, including irrational ones, has been the object of extensive study both behaviourally and neurally and is the focus of influential behavioural economic theories. Yet, little is known about how these (irrational) decisions are carved out in the brain. Here, using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we show that the construction and outcome evaluation of irrational decisions involves rapid, sequential state reactivation, or "replay.". During deliberation, we show that forward replay is biased towards choice options with more negative and uncertain outcomes, with this bias further amplified immediately preceding irrational choice. Likewise, post-decision evaluation relates to replay in a choice-dependent manner. Following irrational choices, relief-like signals were evident as stronger backward replay of worse counterfactual options, while after rational decisions, regret-like signals appeared as stronger backward replay of better counterfactual options. Together, these findings suggest that neural replay shapes both the formation and reflection of irrational decisions, and poise replay as a candidate mechanism underlying pervasive decision biases in humans.

">Lipid-protecting disulfide bridges are the missing molecular link between ApoE4 and sporadic Alzheimers disease in humans</a></h4>

              
                As the principal lipid transporter in the human brain, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is tasked with the transport and protection of highly vulnerable lipids required to support and remodel neuronal membranes, in a process that is dependent on ApoE receptors. Human APOE allele variants that encode proteins differing only in the number of cysteine (Cys)-to-arginine (Arg) exchanges (ApoE2 [2 Cys], ApoE3 [1 Cys], ApoE4 [0 Cys]) comprise the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimers disease (AD); however, the specific molecular feature(s) and resultant mechanisms that underlie these isoform-dependent effects are unknown. One signature feature of Cys is the capacity to form disulfide (Cys-Cys) bridges, which are required to form disulfide bridge-linked dimers and multimers. Here we propose the overarching hypothesis that the super-ability (for ApoE2), intermediate ability (for ApoE3) or inability (for ApoE4) to form lipid-protecting intermolecular disulfide bridges, is the central molecular determinant accounting for the disparate effects of APOE alleles on AD risk and amyloid-{beta} and Tau pathologies in humans. We posit that presence and abundance of Cys in human ApoE3 and ApoE2 respectively, conceal and protect vulnerable lipids transported by ApoE from peroxidation by enabling formation of ApoE homo-dimers/multimers and heteromeric ApoE complexes such as ApoE-ApoJ and ApoE-ApoD. We thus propose that the inability to form intermolecular disulfide bridges makes ApoE4-containing lipoproteins uniquely vulnerable to peroxidation and its downstream consequences. Consistent with our model, we found that brain-enriched polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing phospholipids induce disulfide-dependent dimerization and multimerization of ApoE3 and ApoE2 (but not ApoE4). By contrast, incubation with the peroxidation-resistant lipid DMPC or cholesterol alone had minimal effects on dimerization. These novel concepts and findings are integrated into our unifying model implicating peroxidation of ApoE-containing lipoproteins, with consequent ApoE receptor-ligand disruption, as the initiating molecular events that ultimately lead to AD in humans.

">Lecanemab binds to transgenic mouse model-derived amyloid-β fibril structures resembling Alzheimer	's disease type-I, type-II and Arctic folds</a></h4>

              
                Lecanemab, an Alzheimer's disease US Food and Drug Administration approved monoclonal antibody was previously reported to have a high affinity against intermediately sized amyloid-{beta} aggregates. Subsequently, it was observed by immunogold labelling that lecanemab can also bind to human type-I amyloid-{beta} fibrils. Therefore, to determine whether lecanemab binds to amyloid-{beta} fibril structures other than type-I, we performed immunogold labelling on extracted amyloid-{beta} fibril preparations from six different Alzheimer's disease mouse models whose structures were previously solved by cryo-EM. Our results show that lecanemab exhibits high binding affinity to amyloid-{beta} fibril structures that have a flexible N-terminus in common, as it is the case for type-I, type-II and murine type-III amyloid-{beta} fibril polymorphs which resemble or are identical to human structures observed in sporadic and familial cases of Alzheimer's disease, including a case with the Arctic (E22G) mutation. In contrast, only weak, if any, lecanemab binding was observed for amyloid-{beta} fibril folds with a fixed and ordered N-terminus.

">Rescue of hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory performance by Fingolimod (FTY720) in APP/PS1 model of Alzheimer's disease is accompanied by correction in metabolism of sphingolipids, polyamines, and phospholipid saturation composition</a></h4>

              
                Previously, our metabolomic, transcriptomic, and genomic studies characterized the ceramide/sphingomyelin pathway as a therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease, and we demonstrated that FTY720, a sphingosine-1-phospahate receptor modulator approved for treatment of multiple sclerosis, recovers synaptic plasticity and memory in APP/PS1 mice. To further investigate how FTY720 rescues the pathology, we performed metabolomic analysis in brain, plasma, and liver of trained APP/PS1 and wild-type mice. APP/PS1 mice showed area-specific brain disturbances in polyamines, phospholipids, and sphingolipids. Most changes were completely or partially normalized in FTY720-treated subjects, indicating rebalancing the "sphingolipid rheostat", reactivating phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis via mitochondrial phosphatidylserine decarboxylase pathway, and normalizing polyamine levels that support mitochondrial activity. Synaptic plasticity and memory were rescued, with spermidine synthesis in temporal cortex best corresponding to hippocampal CA3-CA1 plasticity normalization. FTY720 effects, also reflected in other pathways, are consistent with promotion of mitochondrial function, synaptic plasticity, and anti-inflammatory environment, while reducing pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory signals.

">Microglial SIRT2 deficiency aggravates cognitive decline and amyloid pathology in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2), a NAD+-dependent deacetylase, has been implicated in aging and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). While global SIRT2 inhibition has shown promise in reducing amyloid-beta pathology and cognitive deficits in different mouse models of AD, peripheral SIRT2 inhibition has been associated with adverse effects, such as increased inflammation. This suggests that targeted inhibition of specific cellular populations within the brain may represent a more precise and effective approach for the treatment of AD. To explore this hypothesis, we generated a conditional microglial SIRT2 knockout mouse model in the context of AD. Our results reveal that microglial SIRT2 reduction does not confer protective effects in the APP/PS1 model; rather, it aggravates cognitive decline, accelerates amyloid plaque deposition, and increases levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines at early stages of AD pathology. Transcriptomic analysis further indicates that SIRT2-deficient microglia exhibit altered expression of genes associated with aging and synaptic dysfunction. This phenotype was accompanied by increased phagocytosis of synaptic elements and impaired long-term potentiation. These findings suggest that while SIRT2 inhibition in some contexts may be beneficial, targeted inhibition within microglia could accelerate AD progression, underscoring the need for cell-specific approaches when considering SIRT2 as a therapeutic target.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Sexual minority older adults (SMOAs) report greater subjective cognitive decline (SCD) than heterosexual older adults (HOAs). This study aimed to compare the impact of multiple psycho-social risk factors on objective and subjective cognitive decline in HOAs and SMOAs. Methods: Two samples of self-identified HOAs and SMOAs were selected from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Reliable change indices for episodic and semantic memory were created to assess cognitive decline. SCD was self-reported for memory and general cognition. Depressive symptoms, loneliness, marital status and socio-economic status were investigated as risk factors. Results: No between-group differences were found in cognitive decline. Higher depression was associated with greater SCD risk and worse semantic memory decline. The latter effect was stronger in SMOAs. The findings were largely replicated in the sensitivity analysis. Conclusions: Poor mental health may represent the strongest driver of cognitive decline in SMOAs and to a greater extent than in HOAs.</p>

	<p>Background: Tramadol (TRA) is an opioid that is used to manage moderate to severe pain. Long-term use of TRA can lead to the development of opioid use disorder. Objectives: This study investigates the role of forced exercise in reducing TRA-seeking behavior. Methods: Adult male rats (240&amp;amp;ndash;260 g) were divided into five groups; the control group received vehicle injections, the TRA group received TRA (75 mg/kg, i.p) every other day for 8 days, and three TRA&amp;amp;ndash;exercise groups were forced to run on a treadmill (60 min/day, 5 days/week) for 2, 4, or 6 weeks prior to conditioning with TRA. A tramadol-conditioned place preference (CPP) procedure assessed TRA reinforcement, after which all rats were euthanized, tissue extracted, and mRNA expression for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) and interleukin 1 beta (Il-1&amp;amp;beta;) determined in hippocampus (Hipp), prefrontal cortex (PFC), and nucleus accumbens (NAc). Results: TRA-seeking behavior was seen in the TRA group and the 6 weeks forced exercise group. By contrast, forced exercise for 2 or 4 weeks attenuated TRA-seeking behavior. This attenuation was associated with a significant increase in Bdnf mRNA expression in the Hipp and NAc, but not the PFC. Additionally, the TRA-induced elevations in Il-1&amp;amp;beta; mRNA expression were reversed by all durations of exercise in Hipp. However, only 2 and 4 weeks, but not 6 weeks, of exercise reduced elevations in PFC and NAc Il-1&amp;amp;beta; expression. Conclusion: Forced exercise for 2 and 4 weeks attenuates TRA-seeking behavior partially through the regulation of Bdnf and Il-1&amp;amp;beta; mRNA expression.</p>

                <p>The subjective visual vertical (VV), the visually estimated direction of gravity, is essential for assessing vestibular function and visuospatial cognition. In this study, we aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying altered VV perception in stroke participants with unilateral spatial neglect (USN), specifically by examining their eye movement patterns during VV judgment tasks. Participants with USN demonstrated limited eye movement scanning along a rotating bar, often fixating on prominent ends, such as the top or bottom. This suggests a reflexive response to visually salient areas, potentially interfering with accurate VV perception. In contrast, participants without USN showed broader scanning around the center of the bar. Notably, participants with USN without frontal lobe lesions occasionally exhibited extended scanning that included the bar&rsquo;s center, which was associated with accurate VV judgments. These findings suggest that (1) a tendency to fixate on peripheral, prominent areas and (2) frontal lobe involvement in disengaging and redirecting spatial attention may influence VV perception in USN. Based on these results, targeted rehabilitation strategies that encourage individuals with USN to extend their visual scanning beyond prominent endpoints and include central areas could improve VV accuracy. This study highlights the specific eye movement behaviors contributing to VV misperception, emphasizing the importance of training that broadens scanning to improve VV perception effectively.</p>

                <p>A comprehensive analysis of everyday sound perception can be achieved using electroencephalography (EEG) with the concurrent acquisition of information about the environment. While extensive research has been dedicated to speech perception, the complexities of auditory perception within everyday environments, specifically the types of information and the key features to extract, remain less explored. Our study aims to systematically investigate the relevance of different feature categories: discrete sound-identity markers, general cognitive state information, and acoustic representations, including discrete sound onset, the envelope, and mel-spectrogram. Using continuous data analysis, we contrast different features in terms of their predictive power for unseen data and thus their distinct contributions to explaining neural data. For this, we analyze data from a complex audio-visual motor task using a naturalistic soundscape. The results demonstrated that the feature sets that explain the most neural variability were a combination of highly detailed acoustic features with a comprehensive description of specific sound onsets. Furthermore, it showed that established features can be applied to complex soundscapes. Crucially, the outcome hinged on excluding periods devoid of sound onsets in the analysis in the case of the discrete features. Our study highlights the importance to comprehensively describe the soundscape, using acoustic and non-acoustic aspects, to fully understand the dynamics of sound perception in complex situations. This approach can serve as a foundation for future studies aiming to investigate sound perception in natural settings.</p>

                <p>Alterations in white matter (WM) microstructure are commonly found in migraine patients. Here, we employ a longitudinal study of episodic migraine without aura using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to investigate whether such WM microstructure alterations vary through the different phases of the pain cycle. Fourteen patients with episodic migraine without aura related with menstruation were scanned through four phases of their (spontaneous) migraine cycle (interictal, preictal, ictal, and postictal). Fifteen healthy controls were studied in the corresponding phases of the menstrual cycle. Multishell dMRI data were acquired and preprocessed to obtain maps of diffusion parameters reflecting WM microstructure. After a whole-brain analysis comparing patients with controls, a region-of-interest analysis was performed to determine whether the patients&rsquo; microstructural changes varied across the migraine cycle in specific WM tracts. Compared with controls, patients showed reduced axial diffusivity (AD) in several WM tracts across the whole brain in the interictal phase and increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in commissural fibers in the ictal phase. Interestingly, AD returned to baseline levels during peri-ictal phases in specific projection and association fibers. In contrast, FA values decreased in the ictal phase away from normal values in a few commissural and projection tracts. Widespread WM fiber tracts suffer structural variations across the migraine cycle, suggesting microstructural changes potentially associated with limbic and salience functional networks and highlighting the importance of the cycle phase in imaging studies of migraine.</p>

                <p>Psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression, are highly comorbid in people with epilepsy. However, the mechanisms mediating the shared pathophysiology are currently unknown. There is considerable evidence implicating the basolateral amygdala (BLA) in the network communication of anxiety and fear, a process demonstrated to involve parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons. The loss of PV interneurons has been well described in the hippocampus of chronically epileptic mice and in postmortem human tissue of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). We hypothesize that a loss of PV interneurons in the BLA may contribute to comorbid mood disorders in epilepsy. To test this hypothesis, we employed a ventral intrahippocampal kainic acid model of TLE in mice, which exhibits profound behavioral deficits associated with chronic epilepsy. We demonstrate a loss of PV interneurons and dysfunction of the remaining PV interneurons in the BLA of chronically epileptic mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate altered principal neuron function and impaired coordination of BLA network and behavioral states in chronically epileptic mice. To determine whether the loss of PV interneurons contributes to these altered network and behavioral states, we partially ablated PV interneurons in the BLA by stereotaxically injecting AAV-Flex-DTA into the BLA of PV-Cre mice. Loss of PV interneurons in the BLA is sufficient to alter behavioral states, such as increasing avoidance behaviors and impairing fear learning. These data suggest that compromised inhibition in the BLA in chronically epileptic mice may contribute to behavioral deficits, suggesting a novel mechanism contributing to comorbid anxiety and epilepsy.</p>

                <p>Epilepsy&ndash;aphasia syndrome (EAS) is a spectrum of childhood disorders that exhibit complex comorbidities that include epilepsy and the emergence of cognitive and language disorders. CNKSR2 is an X-linked gene in which mutations are linked to EAS. We previously demonstrated Cnksr2 knock-out (KO) mice model key phenotypes of EAS analogous to those present in clinical patients with mutations in the gene. Cnksr2 KO mice have increased seizures, impaired learning and memory, increased levels of anxiety, and loss of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs). The intricate interplay between these diverse phenotypes at the brain regional and cell-type level remains unknown. Here, we leverage conditional deletion of the X-linked Cnksr2 in a neuronal cell-type manner in male mice to demonstrate that anxiety and impaired USVs track with its loss from excitatory neurons. Finally, we further narrow the essential role of Cnksr2 loss in USV deficits to excitatory neurons of the ACC, a region in mice recently implicated in USV production associated with specific emotional states or social contexts, such as mating calls, distress calls, or social bonding signals. Together, our results reveal Cnksr2-based mechanisms that underlie USV impairments that suggest communication impairments can be dissociated from seizures or anxiety. Furthermore, we highlight the cortical circuitry important for initiating USVs.</p>

                Aim To determine the influencing factors of health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) perceived by North-African children/adolescents with type-1 diabetes-mellitus (T1DM) and their parents. Methods It was a cross sectional study conducted in Tunisia. A total of 116 patients ( ie ; 43 children and 73 adolescents) and their parents were included. The Arabic validated version of the Pediatric Generic Core Quality-of-Life Inventory 4.0-Scale (PedsQL4.0) was used to evaluate the HRQoL of children/adolescents as perceived by patients and parents. The dependent data were the patients’ self-report and the parents’ proxy-report of the PedsQL4.0 total scores, and the independent data were the patients and parents characteristics. Results Patients’ PedsQL4.0 total score was influenced significantly by siblings in the family > 2; lipodystrophy, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C). The combination of these factors explained 34.84% of the PedsQL4.0 total score variability. Parents’ PedsQL4.0 total score was influenced significantly by lipodystrophy, siblings; body mass index (BMI), hypoglycemia episodes, and HbA1C. The combination of these factors explained 56.92% of the PedsQL4.0 total score variability. Conclusion T1DM patients self-reported HRQoL was influenced by siblings in the family > 2; lipodystrophy, and HbA1C. The parents’ proxy-report HRQoL was influenced by lipodystrophy, siblings, BMI, hypoglycemia episodes, and HbA1C.

                Introduction Recent reports indicate the emergence of community-acquired pneumonia associated with K64- Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae). Here, we identify the capsular types and sequence type of invasive and commensal K. pneumoniae isolates from Vietnam. Methods We included 93 K. pneumoniae isolates from patients hospitalized at the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Hanoi between 2007 and 2011; and 110 commensal isolates from throat swabs from healthy volunteers living in rural and urban Hanoi in 2012. We determined sequence types (STs) by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and capsule typing for seven K types by PCR. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using disk diffusion. Results The most common detected capsule types were K1 (39/203, 19.2%, mainly ST23) and K2 (31/203, 15.3%, multiple STs: ST65, ST86, ST380). We found significantly more K2 isolates among invasive in comparison to commensal isolates (22.6% vs 9%, p = 0.01) but no significant difference was observed between invasive and commensal K1 isolates (14.5% vs 24.7%, p = 0.075). K64 with varying sequence types were predominantly seen among invasive K. pneumoniae (8 vs. 3) and were isolated from sepsis and meningitis patients. Among K64 isolates, one was carbapenem-resistant with ST799. Conclusion Our study confirms that capsule type K64 K. pneumoniae is associated with community-acquired invasive infections in Vietnam. Research is needed to unravel the mechanisms of virulence of capsule type K64 in both community and hospital settings.

                Background Rehabilitation services are necessary for many people with disabilities to improve their functioning and be included in society. This study aimed to determine the factors associated with the use of rehabilitation services among people with disabilities in Chile in 2015. Methods This cross-sectional analysis of secondary data from Chile’s 2015 Second National Disability Study (ENDISC II) included people with disabilities aged ≥18 years. The dependent variable was the use of rehabilitation services in the previous year, and the exposure variables were sociodemographic and confounders. Poisson regression was used to determine associated factors, and prevalence ratios (PR) with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated. All results were weighted according to the ENDISC II complex sampling. Results A total of 2610 people with disabilities were included, and 19.1% used some rehabilitation services in the previous year. Educational level (PR 0.43; 95% CI 0.25–0.75), having a mental illness (PR 1.77; 95% CI 1.44–2.18), and caregiver assistance (PR 1.57; 95% CI 1.25–1.97) were factors associated with the use of rehabilitation services. Conclusions In 2015, one-fifth of people with disabilities in Chile used some rehabilitation services in the previous year. People with disabilities with lower educational levels were less likely to access these services. By contrast, people with mental illness and caregiver assistance were more likely to use rehabilitation services.

                Background Yeasts are unicellular fungi that inhabit a variety of environments including plant surfaces, water, soil, and animal hosts. However, limited research has been conducted on soil and plant associated yeasts in Africa, with most studies originating from developed regions. Methods This study explored the diversity, distribution, and phenotypic characterization of cultivable wild yeast in samples from rhizosphere soil, leaves, litter, and tree bark collected from South West Ethiopia. Yeast isolates were characterized using morphological, physiological and biochemical methods, Stress-tolerant yeast species were identified using Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF). Results Based on morphological, physiological, and biochemical analyses, a total of 15 yeast genera were identified from 23 plant species. Predominant yeast species included Candida spp., Saccharomyces spp., Meyerozyma spp., Pichia spp., Geotrichum spp., and Hanseniaspora spp. Plant species with the highest yeast diversity were Ficus vasta, Ficus exasperata, Ficus sycomorus, Cordia africana, and Ritchiea albersii. Bark samples yielded more yeast isolates than rhizosphere soil, litter, and leaves. Stress-tolerant species such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida pelliculosa, Meyerozyma guilliermondii, Pichia kluyveri, and Trichosporon asahii were identified using MALDI-TOF. Correlation analysis revealed no significant relationship between yeast populations in bark and leaf samples or between rhizosphere soil and leaves, though a weak positive correlation was found between rhizosphere soil and bark or litter. Seasonal analysis showed a strong positive correlation between yeast abundance in spring and summer, but no association between autumn and spring. Conclusion Ethiopian forests are home for various yeast species including the stress-tolerant wild yeasts. This study highlights the significant yeast diversity in Ethiopian forests, with potential applications in improving industrial fermentation processes that operate under stressful conditions.

                Background This study investigates chloride concentrations in tap water samples from Gimba city administration, using the argentometric method to assess water quality. Chloride levels are a key indicator of water treatment effectiveness, particularly the adequacy of chlorination, which is critical for preventing waterborne diseases. Methods Chloride concentrations in tap water samples from various locations in Gimba city administration, were determined using the argentometric titration method. Silver nitrate (AgNO₃) was employed as the titrant to precisely quantify chloride ions. The water samples were collected from different sites in Gimba, and chloride levels were measured to evaluate the adequacy of water treatment processes. Results The chloride concentrations across all samples ranged from 52.8 mg/L to 71.9 mg/L, well below the World Health Organization’s recommended limit for drinking water. Significant variation in chloride levels was observed, with Dembesh exhibiting the highest concentration and Medera the lowest. Conclusion The low chloride concentrations suggest insufficient chlorination at the sampling sites, which may compromise the effectiveness of water disinfection and contribute to the prevalence of waterborne diseases in the region. The study underscores the need for enhanced water treatment and disinfection practices in Gimba city to ensure safe drinking water and reduce health risks.

                Backgrounds Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant health issue in Indonesia, ranking second globally in TB incidence in 2021. Diagnosing intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) is challenging due to its symptoms, which mimic other diseases, limited laboratory tests, and the need for invasive procedures like colonoscopy. This study aimed to develop a non-invasive laboratory panel for ITB using various biomarkers. Methods A cross-sectional study from November 2020 to December 2022 was carried out at Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo National Central General Hospital. Laboratory parameters from 143 subjects were identified by Chi-square test and multiple regression analysis. The scoring system was developed based on the identified independent diagnostic parameters scored by regression coefficient β value and standard errors, with the cut-off value determined by the ROC curve. The sensitivity and specificity of the scoring system were determined using the ROC curve. Results Among 143 subjects, 22 were diagnosed with ITB and 121 Non-ITB (prevalence of 15.38%). This study was dominated by females (65.03%), with a ratio of 1.86: 1. The median age in this study was 41 years. The scoring system to differentiate ITB and Non-ITB consisted of 6 diagnostic parameters (referred to as the HEALTH scoring system) as follows: stool HBD-2 (1 and 0 points), ESR (1 and 0 points), blood ADA activity (1 and 0 points), Lymphocyte (0 and 1 point), stool TB PCR (2 and 0 points), and NLR (1 and 0 points). Subjects with scores ≥ 4 could be diagnosed as ITB. The sensitivity and specificity of the HEALTH scoring system were 68.18% and 95.04%, respectively. Conclusion This study developed and validated a laboratory panel called the HEALTH scoring system based on clinical biomarkers of stool HBD-2 level, ESR, blood ADA activity, lymphocytes, stool TB PCR, and NLR, which could be used to differentiate ITB from other gastrointestinal diseases.

                Background This study analyzed the nexus between rural household welfare and agricultural technology adoption in Ethiopia using secondary data from the Ethiopian Socioeconomic Survey (ESS). The agricultural sector plays a pivotal role in Ethiopia’s economy, contributing significantly to income, consumption, and employment. This research aims to analyze how adopting agricultural technologies such as improved seeds, fertilizers, and irrigation affects poverty and food insecurity among rural households. The research examined poverty and food insecurity levels in Ethiopia and investigates the impact of adopting agricultural technologies on rural household welfare. Methods We used both Descriptive and econometric methods, in which descriptive analysis has been used to assess poverty and food insecurity levels, and a seemingly unrelated bivariate and multivariate probit model applied to analyze the effect of agricultural technology adoption. Result From descriptive summary, it is noted that out of a total sample of the study, 47.61% (2322 out of 4877) are adopting agricultural technologies in many forms more than 70% of female-headed households are food secured and non-poor and 68% of male-headed households are food secured and nun poor. The findings from regression model indicate that access to irrigation, improved seeds, and fertilizers significantly reduces the likelihood of poverty and food insecurity among rural households. Conclusion Based on these results, policy recommendations include promoting agricultural technologies, enhancing access to credit, investing in agricultural extension services, diversifying livelihoods, improving education, and implementing targeted poverty alleviation programs. Further research is encouraged to explore the reasons behind insignificant variables and to identify additional factors affecting rural household welfare in Ethiopia.

                Background This study was designed to investigate the mediation effects of social empowerment (SE) in the relationship between perceived social support (PSS) and life satisfaction (LS) in women self-help group members. Also, this research attempted to understand the moderating effect of decision making (DM) and external communication (EC) on the relationship between the constructs. Methods To achieve the above objective, the primary data were collected from the self-help group women members by using an existing scale. In this survey, 333 participants who are members of self-help group completed the questionnaire and considered for the study. The study is non-experimental and survey-based, with no interventions or manipulations involved. In line with ethical guidelines, we obtained informed consent directly from each respondent before their participation. Conclusion The path coefficient values, t-statistics and P-Values confirmed the positive relationship between PSS->LS; PSS->SE & SE->LS in women self-group members. PLS structural equation modelling estimated by the bootstrap method revealed that SE partially mediates the relationship between PSS & LS. With regard to the interaction effect, the slope analysis and f2 effect size confirmed the moderating effect of EC in the relationship between PSS -> LS & SE -> LS.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-845/v2?src=rss">Flexible modular dwelling for rural environments; specific case: Cebadas – Ecuador [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Sustainable modular dwelling design for rural areas should focus on creating healthy and economically accessible spaces, sensitive to local needs and integrating environmental, functional, sociological and technological aspects. Flexibility is essential to reduce the initial investment and allow future transformations, optimizing the recovery and reuse of materials. These houses must be adaptable, safe and have basic services, satisfying the needs and stages of families’ development. In Ecuador, poverty and energy inefficiency worsen the quality of life in rural areas. This project in the Cebadas parish proposes modular dwelling that applies bioclimatic and sustainable criteria, using local materials to improve habitability and promote the social and economic development of the community. Method The research approach is qualitative-quantitative. Qualitative, since it is necessary to identify the qualities of the sector, bibliographic exploration of guidelines and sustainable strategies. Quantitative, to evaluate the degree of affectation through a diagnosis of the study site and to provide efficient solutions that respond to the context and social reality. Results The spaces presented in the proposal respond to the spatial need for growth and expansion of the users of the sector, through 6 basic guidelines that this type of dwelling should have: Environment, Visual, Form, Function, Bioclimatic and Materials. Conclusions The flexible modular dwelling project for rural environments addresses complex housing needs, highlighting the flexibility and adaptability of an expandable module. It includes income generation with a duplex apartment, fosters communal and cultural life with public and commercial spaces, promotes tourism and rural development with landscape design and crops. In addition, it ensures sustainability through bioclimatic strategies and responsible use of resources.

                Background This study used ChatGPT for sentiment analysis to investigate the possible links between online sentiments and COVID-19 vaccination rates. It also examines Internet posts to understand the attitudes and reasons associated with vaccine-related opinions. Methods We collected 500,558 posts over 60 weeks from the Blind platform, mainly used by working individuals, and 854 relevant posts were analyzed. After excluding duplicates and irrelevant content, attitudes toward and reasons for vaccine opinions were studied through sentiment analysis. The study further correlated these categorized attitudes with the actual vaccination data. Results The proportions of posts expressing positive, negative, and neutral attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines were 5%, 83%, and 12%, respectively. The total post count showed a positive correlation with the vaccination rate, indicating a high correlation between the number of negative posts about the vaccine and the vaccination rate. Negative attitudes were predominantly associated with societal distrust and perceived oppression. Conclusions This study demonstrates the interplay between public perceptions of COVID-19 vaccines as expressed through social media and vaccination behavior. These correlations can serve as useful clues for devising effective vaccination strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-100/v1?src=rss">Optimizing machine learning performance for medical imaging analyses in low-resource environments: The prospects of CNN-based Feature Extractors [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Machine learning (ML) algorithms have generally enhanced the speed and accuracy of image-based diagnosis, and treatment strategy planning, compared to the traditional approach of interpreting medical images by experienced radiologists. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been particularly useful in this regard. However, training CNNs come with significant time and computational cost necessitating the development of efficient solutions for deploying CNNs in low-resource environments. This study investigates the use of pre-trained CNNs as feature extractors in medical imaging analyses and highlights the key considerations to be taken into account when implementing these extractors. Methods Eight medical imaging datasets covering several diseases (e.g. breast cancer, brain tumor and malaria) were used. Five ML algorithms (k-nearest neighbours, logistic regression, naïve Bayes, random forests and light gradient boosting machine) were implemented with three pre-trained CNN models (VGG-16, EfficientNet-B0, and ResNet-50). These pre-trained models were deployed as feature extractors fed into the classifiers for image classification tasks. The performance of these classifiers was assessed using a ten-fold cross validation scheme with metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, specificity, sensitivity, AUC-ROC, Matthews’ correlation coefficient (MCC), precision, time and space complexities. Results From our experiments, we found a general improvement in ML models’ performance after feature extraction (FE). Of the three FE models tested,EfficientNet-B0 performed best in terms of predicitve performance i.e. accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, AUC-ROC, MCC, F1 score, and precision. However, VGG-16 had the best performance in terms of time and memory efficiency. Our results identify two conditions necessary for the optimal performance of the FE models; (i) balanced datasets - a set where classes or categories are represented in approximately equal proportions, (ii) big data sets - adequate number of objects for training and testing. Interestingly, the performance of the ML models did not correlate with the number of class labels i.e. the type of classification task whether binary or multi-class had no influence in the models’ performance. Of the five algorithms investigated, logistic regression benefitted the most from the adoption of the feature extractors. Conclusion Our results confirm that the use of CNNs as feature extractors offer an effective balance between high performance and computational efficiency, making them well-suited for use in low-resource environments.

                Background Contamination of Cartagena Bay, Colombia with heavy metals such as mercury (Hg) and cadmium (Cd) presents a major environmental and public health concern, particularly for human communities residing on nearby islands and coastal areas. These populations face enhanced exposure risks owing to their traditional fishing practices and continuous interactions with polluted marine environments. This study aimed to evaluate the genotoxic effects of environmental exposure to Hg and Cd in populations from the island zone of the Cartagena district, Bolívar. Methods Ninety-four individuals from the four island communities (study group) and 30 individuals from the urban area of Cartagena (control group) participated in this study. The blood samples were collected to measure total mercury (T-Hg) and Cd concentrations, and a Buccal Micronucleus Cytome (BMCyt) assay was used to evaluate exposure effects. Results Cadmiun levels in the blood of the study group were within the normal range and comparable to those of the control group (p > 0.05). However, the study group exhibited significantly higher T-Hg levels (7.34 μg/L) compared to the control group (2.01 μg/L), surpassing the accepted limit. Moreover, the study group showed a higher incidence of DNA damage and cell death biomarkers (p < 0.05). Additionally, significant correlations were observed between total blood Hg levels and the frequencies of micronuclei, karyorrhexis, and karyolysis. Conclusion These results suggest that island populations of Cartagena are exposed to high levels of Hg and exhibit genotoxic damage, indicating a problem that must be addressed.

                <p>by Jiang Mao, Constantin A Rothkopf, Alan A Stocker</p>

Sensory neurons continually adapt their response characteristics according to recent stimulus history. However, it is unclear how such a reactive process can benefit the organism. Here, we test the hypothesis that adaptation actually acts proactively in the sense that it optimally adjusts sensory encoding for future stimuli. We first quantified human subjects’ ability to discriminate visual orientation under different adaptation conditions. Using an information theoretic analysis, we found that adaptation leads to a reallocation of coding resources such that encoding accuracy peaks at the mean orientation of the adaptor while total coding capacity remains constant. We then asked whether this characteristic change in encoding accuracy is predicted by the temporal statistics of natural visual input. Analyzing the retinal input of freely behaving human subjects showed that the distribution of local visual orientations in the retinal input stream indeed peaks at the mean orientation of the preceding input history (i.e., the adaptor). We further tested our hypothesis by analyzing the internal sensory representations of a recurrent neural network trained to predict the next frame of natural scene videos (PredNet). Simulating our human adaptation experiment with PredNet, we found that the network exhibited the same change in encoding accuracy as observed in human subjects. Taken together, our results suggest that adaptation-induced changes in encoding accuracy prepare the visual system for future stimuli.

                <p>by Natalie R. Davidson, Fan Zhang, Casey S. Greene</p>

While single-cell experiments provide deep cellular resolution within a single sample, some single-cell experiments are inherently more challenging than bulk experiments due to dissociation difficulties, cost, or limited tissue availability. This creates a situation where we have deep cellular profiles of one sample or condition, and bulk profiles across multiple samples and conditions. To bridge this gap, we propose BuDDI (BUlk Deconvolution with Domain Invariance). BuDDI utilizes domain adaptation techniques to effectively integrate available corpora of case-control bulk and reference scRNA-seq observations to infer cell-type-specific perturbation effects. BuDDI achieves this by learning independent latent spaces within a single variational autoencoder (VAE) encompassing at least four sources of variability: 1) cell type proportion, 2) perturbation effect, 3) structured experimental variability, and 4) remaining variability. Since each latent space is encouraged to be independent, we simulate perturbation responses by independently composing each latent space to simulate cell-type-specific perturbation responses. We evaluated BuDDI’s performance on simulated and real data with experimental designs of increasing complexity. We first validated that BuDDI could learn domain invariant latent spaces on data with matched samples across each source of variability. Then we validated that BuDDI could accurately predict cell-type-specific perturbation response when no single-cell perturbed profiles were used during training; instead, only bulk samples had both perturbed and non-perturbed observations. Finally, we validated BuDDI on predicting sex-specific differences, an experimental design where it is not possible to have matched samples. In each experiment, BuDDI outperformed all other comparative methods and baselines. As more reference atlases are completed, BuDDI provides a path to combine these resources with bulk-profiled treatment or disease signatures to study perturbations, sex differences, or other factors at single-cell resolution.

                <p>Biallelic variants in phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis, class G (<i>PIGG</i>) cause hypotonia, intellectual disability, seizures, and cerebellar features. We present 8 patients from 6 families with a childhood-onset motor neuropathy and neurophysiology demonstrating variable motor conduction block and temporal dispersion. All individuals had a childhood onset tremor, 5 of 8 had cerebellar involvement, and 6 of 8 had childhood febrile seizures. All individuals have biallelic <i>PIGG</i> variants, including the previously reported pathogenic variant Trp505*, plus 6 novel variants. Null enzyme activity is demonstrated via <i>PIGO</i>/<i>PIGG</i> double knockout system for Val339Gly and Gly19Glu, and residual activity for Trp505* due to read-through. Emm negative blood group status was confirmed in 1 family. <i>PIGG</i> should be considered in unsolved motor neuropathy. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:388–396</p>

                <p>Mutations in colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) result in CSF1R-related disorder (CSF1R-RD). Our previous study demonstrated a proteolytic generation of a soluble CSF1R (sCSF1R) that could potentially serve as a diagnostic biomarker of CSF1R-RD. Herein, we observed that sCSF1R is released into peripheral serum as a highly glycosylated monomer in <i>Csf1r</i>
<sup>+/−</sup> mice that mimic the clinical symptoms of CSF1R-RD patients. Notably, we found that serum sCSF1R could distinguish CSF1R-RD cohorts from controls with high accuracy as evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite the advances in treatments for multiple sclerosis (MS), unremitting neurodegeneration continues to drive disability and disease progression. Smoldering/slowly expanding lesions (SELs) and dysfunction of the RNA binding protein (RBP) heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) are pathologic hallmarks of MS cortex and intricately tied to disability and neurodegeneration, respectively. We hypothesized that neuronal hnRNP A1 dysfunction contributes to neurodegeneration and is exacerbated by smoldering/SELs in progressive MS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Neuronal hnRNP A1 pathology (nucleocytoplasmic mislocalization of hnRNP A1) was examined in healthy control and MS brains using immunohistochemistry. MS cases were stratified by severity of hnRNP A1 pathology to examine the link between RBP dysfunction, demyelination, and neurodegeneration.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that smoldering/SELs were only present within a subset of MS tissues characterized by elevated neuronal hnRNP A1 pathology (MS-A1<sup>
   <i>high</i>
</sup>) in adjacent cortical gray matter. In contrast to healthy controls and MS with low hnRNP A1 pathology (MS-A1<sup>
   <i>low</i>
</sup>), MS-A1<sup>
   <i>high</i>
</sup> showed elevated markers of neurodegeneration, including neuronal loss and injury, brain atrophy, axonal loss, and axon degeneration. Additionally, we discovered a subpopulation of morphologically intact neurons lacking expression of NeuN, a neuron-specific RBP, in cortical projection neurons in MS-A1<sup>
   <i>high</i>
</sup> cases.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>hnRNP A1 dysfunction contributes to neurodegeneration and may be exacerbated by smoldering/SELs in progressive MS. The discovery of NeuN-negative neurons suggests that some cortical neurons may only be injured and not lost. By characterizing RBP pathology in MS cortex, this study has important implications for understanding the pathogenic mechanisms driving neurodegeneration, the substrate of disability and disease progression.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27105?af=R">A Prospective Multicenter Analysis of Mobile Stroke Unit Cost‐Effectiveness</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Given the high disease and cost burden of ischemic stroke, evaluating the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of new approaches to prevent and treat ischemic stroke is critical. Effective ischemic stroke management depends on timely administration of thrombolytics after stroke onset. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness associated with the use of mobile stroke units (MSUs) to expedite tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administration, as compared with standard management through emergency medical services (EMS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This study is a prospective, multicenter, alternating-week, cluster-controlled trial of MSU versus EMS. One-year and life-time cost-effectiveness analyses, using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) method, were performed from the perspective of CMS's Medicare. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) estimated using patient-reported EQ-5D-5L data were used as the effectiveness measure. Health care utilizations were converted to costs using average national Medicare reimbursements. ICERs excluding patients with pre-existing disability, and limited to stroke-related costs were also calculated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The first-year ICER for all tPA-eligible patients using total cost differences between MSU and EMS groups was $238,873/QALY; for patients without pre-existing disability was $61,199/QALY. The lifetime ICERs for all tPA-eligible patients and for those without pre-existing disability were $94,710 and $31,259/QALY, respectively. All ICERs were lower when restricted to stroke-related costs and were highly dependent on the number of patients treated per year in an MSU.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>MSUs' cost-effectiveness is borderline if we consider total first-year costs and outcomes in all tPA-eligible patients. MSUs are cost-effective to highly cost-effective when calculations are based on patients without pre-existing disability, patients' lifetime horizon, stroke-related costs, and more patients treated per year in an MSU.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to investigate the association between developmental and premorbid body composition measurements and the risk of motor neuron disease (MND).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a cohort study in the UK Biobank to assess the association of developmental body metrics and premorbid body composition measures (using 28 measurements and 7 patterns of body composition) with the risk of MND. Among participants with longitudinal measures, we compared the changes in body composition over time between individuals who later developed MND and those who remained free of MND.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among the 412,691 individuals included in this study, 549 people received an MND diagnosis during the follow-up visit. Higher birth weight was associated with an increased risk of MND among individuals born over 4 kg (hazard ratio [HR] per kg increase = 2.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.38–3.55), and taller adult height was associated with an increased risk of MND (HR per 5 cm increase = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.03–1.17). We observed that measures of elevated fat mass were associated with a lower risk of MND more than 5 years before diagnosis. A higher “leg-dominant fat distribution” pattern was associated with an increased risk whereas higher “muscle strength” was associated with a reduced risk of MND 5 years before diagnosis. Longitudinal analyses indicated a faster decline in measures of fat mass and muscle strength, as well as a shift in fat distribution from arm to leg dominant, among individuals who later developed MND, compared with others.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Body composition at early and middle age may be indicative of the risk of MND development. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:259–269</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Previous studies have observed liver abnormalities in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. This study aimed to investigate whether early signs of liver disease, measured by magnetic resonance imaging-derived iron-corrected T1-mapping (cT1), are risk factors for developing ALS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>cT1 and proton density fat fraction were measured and automatically analyzed using LiverMultiScan® software. The Fibrosis-4 index was calculated using an established formula based on age and blood markers. Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the relationship between liver disease, liver biomarkers, and incident ALS.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In a cohort of 533,707 individuals from UK Biobank, 24 ALS cases were identified among 28,328 participants with liver disease during the follow-up period. Among a total of 33,959 individuals with complete liver imaging data, 15 incident ALS cases were observed during a median follow-up period of 5.6 years. Individuals with liver disease had a higher risk of developing ALS, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 7.35 (95% CI 4.47–12.09; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). An increase in cT1 was also associated with a higher risk of ALS. After adjusting for age, sex, Townsend deprivation index, smoking status, alcohol intake frequency, body mass index, proton density fat fraction, Fibrosis-4, and metabolic syndrome, an increase in cT1 remained significantly associated with a higher risk of ALS, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 3.15 (95% CI 1.79–5.55) per 1-SD increase. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these robust results.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Liver disease activity, indicated by cT1, increases the risk of developing ALS, independent of metabolic syndrome, liver fat, or fibrosis. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:270–280</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We prospectively studied asymptomatic <i>C9orf72</i> mutation carriers, identifying those developing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or frontotemporal dementia (FTD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We enrolled 56 asymptomatic family members (AFM) with a <i>C9orf72</i> mutation (AFM C9+), 132 non-carriers (AFM C9−), and 359 population-based controls. Using 3 T magnetic resonance imaging, we measured cortical thickness, gyrification, and subcortical volumes longitudinally. Linear mixed-effects models on non-converting AFM C9+ scans (n = 107) created a reference for these measurements, establishing individual atrophy patterns. Atrophy patterns from presymptomatic phenoconverters (n = 10 scans) served as a template for group comparisons and similarity assessments. Similarity with phenoconverters was quantified using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) for cortical and Kullback–Leibler similarity (KLS) for subcortical measures. Using longitudinal similarity assessments, we predicted when participants would reach the average similarity level of phenoconverters at their first post-onset scan.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Five AFM C9+ converted to ALS or ALS-FTD. Up to 6 years before symptoms, these phenoconverters exhibited significant atrophy in frontal, temporal, parietal, and cingulate cortex, along with smaller thalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala compared to other AFM C9+. Some non-converted AFM C9+ had high DSC and KLS, approaching values of phenoconverters, whereas others, along with AFM C9− and controls, had lower values. At age 80, we predicted 27.9% (95% confidence interval, 13.2–40.1%) of AFM C9+ and no AFM C9− would reach the same DSC as phenoconverters.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Distinctive atrophy patterns are visible years before symptom onset on presymptomatic scans of phenoconverters. Combining baseline and follow-up similarity measures may serve as a promising imaging biomarker for identifying those at risk of ALS or ALS-FTD. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:281–295</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is caused by mutations in <i>ABCD1</i>, a peroxisomal gene. More than half of males with an <i>ABCD1</i> mutation develop inflammatory cerebral demyelination (cALD), but underlying mechanisms remain unknown and therapies are limited. We sought to develop and characterize a mouse model of cALD to facilitate study of disease mechanisms and therapy development.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used immunoassays and immunohistochemistry to assess novel (interleukin 18 [IL-18]) and established molecular markers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and postmortem brain tissue from cALD patients. We generated a cALD phenotype in <i>Abcd1-</i>knockout mice using a 2-hit method that combines cuprizone and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models. We then used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and immunohistochemistry to assess the fidelity of cALD molecular markers in the mice.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Human and mouse cALD lesions shared histologic features of myelin phagocytosis, myelin loss, abundant microglial activation, T and B-cell infiltration, and astrogliosis. Compared to wild-type controls, <i>Abcd1</i>-knockout mice displayed more cerebral demyelination, blood–brain barrier disruption, and perivascular immune cell infiltration. This enhanced inflammatory response was associated with higher levels of fibrin deposition, oxidative stress, demyelination, and axonal injury. IL-18 immunoreactivity co-localized with perivascular monocytes/macrophages in both human and mouse brain tissue. In cALD patients, CSF IL-18 levels correlated with MRI lesion severity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results suggest loss of <i>Abcd1</i> function in mice predisposes to more severe blood–brain barrier disruption, cerebral inflammation driven by the infiltration of peripheral immune cells, demyelination, and axonal damage, replicating human cALD features. This novel mouse model could shed light on cALD mechanisms and accelerate cALD therapy development. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:296–312</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27119?af=R">Cost‐Effectiveness of Endovascular Thrombectomy in Patients with Large Ischemic Stroke</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Whereas highly cost-effective and cost-saving for patients with small infarcts, whether endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) remains cost-effective in patients with extensive ischemic injury is uncertain.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a model-based cost-effectiveness analysis from the United States, Australian, and Spanish societal perspectives, using a 7-state Markov model, with each state defined by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. Initial probabilities at 3 months were derived from the SELECT2 trial. All other model inputs, including transition probabilities, health care and non-health care costs, and utility weights, were sourced from published literature and government websites. Our analysis included extensive sensitivity and subgroup analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>EVT in patients with large ischemic stroke improved health outcomes and was associated with lower costs from a societal viewpoint. EVT was cost-effective with a mean between-group difference of 1.24 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and a cost-saving of $23,409 in the United States, $10,691 in Australia, and $30,036 in Spain, in addition to uncosted benefits in productivity for patients and carers. Subgroup analyses were directionally consistent with the overall population, notably with preserved cost-effectiveness in older patients (≥ 70 years) and those with more severe strokes (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] ≥ 20). Sensitivity analyses were largely consistent with the base-case results.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>EVT demonstrated cost-effectiveness in patients with large core across different settings in the United States, Australia, and Spain, including older patients and those with more severe strokes. These results further support adaptation of systems of care to accommodate the expansion of thrombectomy eligibility to patients with large cores and maximize EVT benefits.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To examine the efficacy and safety of sodium oxybate versus placebo in a phase IIb randomized double-blind placebo-controlled 2-period cross-over clinical trial in patients with isolated laryngeal dystonia (LD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The study was conducted from January 2018 to December 2021, pausing during the COVID-19 pandemic, at Massachusetts Eye and Ear in 106 patients with alcohol-responsive (EtOH+) and alcohol-non-responsive (EtOH−) LD (53 to receive 1.5g of sodium oxybate first, 53 to receive matching placebo first). The primary outcome was a change from baseline in LD symptom severity 40 minutes after drug intake. Safety was based on vital signs, cognitive function, suicidality, daytime sleepiness, and adverse events. Patients, investigators, and outcome assessors were masked to study procedures.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared to baseline, EtOH+ but not EtOH− patients had a statistically significant improvement in LD symptoms following sodium oxybate versus placebo (EtOH+: 98.75% confidence interval [CI] = 0.6–26.9; <i>p</i> = 0.008; EtOH−: 98.75% CI = −6.2 to 18.7; <i>p</i> = 0.42). Statistically significant minimum drug efficacy in EtOH+ patients was found at ≥16% symptom improvement (OR = 2.09; 98.75% CI = 0.75–5.80; <i>p</i> = 0.036), with an average of 40.81% benefits (98.75% CI = 34.7–48.6). Drug efficacy waned by 300 minutes after intake without a rebound. No changes were found in cognitive function, suicidality, or vital signs. Common adverse events included mild dizziness, nausea, and daytime sleepiness.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Sodium oxybate showed clinically meaningful improvement of symptoms in EtOH+ LD patients, with acceptable tolerability. Sodium oxybate offers the first pathophysiologically relevant oral treatment for laryngeal dystonia. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:329–343</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27123?af=R">Sex Modifies the Severity and Outcome of Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The limited existing evidence on sex differences in the clinical characteristics of patients with spontaneous, non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) comes from small, single-center studies. Here, we performed an individual patient data meta-analysis of 3 randomized clinical trials and 1 multi-ethnic observational study of ICH to investigate the impact of sex on ICH severity and outcome.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Inclusion criteria in our study were a neuroimaging-confirmed ICH. We evaluated whether sex was associated with ICH severity (hematoma volume and expansion) and poor functional outcomes (modified Rankin Scale &gt;3) 3 or 6 months after the ICH.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 4,812 ICH patients were evaluated (mean age 62, 40% female). Males with ICH were younger, more likely to be smokers and have diabetes, and less likely to be on anticoagulants (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). In multivariable analyses, male sex was associated with non-lobar location (odds ratio [OR]: 1.63; 95% confidence interval [CI]: [1.39–1.92]; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), larger hemorrhages (beta: 0.16 [0.08–0.23]; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and a higher risk of hematoma expansion (OR: 1.43 [1.20–1.71]; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Despite the larger hemorrhage volume and higher risk of expansion, male sex was associated with a 24% lower risk of poor outcomes (OR: 0.76 [0.64–0.90]; <i>p</i> = 0.002).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Compared to females, males with ICH have larger bleeds and higher risk of hematoma expansion. Despite the larger bleeds and higher risk of hematoma expansion, males with ICH have lower risk of poor outcomes. Our results suggest that the biology and clinical trajectory are different in females and males with ICH, supporting sex-specific research in this condition.

<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Excitotoxicity is a common hallmark of epilepsy and other neurological diseases associated with elevated extracellular glutamate levels. Thus, here, we studied the protective effects of <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b>, a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of glutamate uptake in epilepsy models.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p><b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> was evaluated in a range of acute and chronic seizure models, while its adverse effect profile was assessed in a panel of standard tests in rodents. The effect of <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> on glutamate uptake was assessed in COS-7 cells expressing the transporter. WAY 213613, a selective competitive EAAT2 inhibitor, was used to probe the reversal of the enhanced glutamate uptake in the same transporter expression system. Confocal microscopy and Western blotting analyses were used to study a potential influence of <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> on GLT-1 expression in mice.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> showed robust protection in a panel of animal models of seizures and epilepsy, including the maximal electroshock- and 6 Hz-induced seizures, corneal kindling, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, lamotrigine-resistant amygdala kindling, as well as seizures induced by pilocarpine or Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus. Importantly, <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> displayed a favorable adverse effect profile in the rotarod, the minimal motor impairment, and the Irwin tests. <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> enhanced glutamate uptake in vitro and this effect was abolished by WAY 213613, while no influence on GLT-1 expression in vivo was observed after repeated treatment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Collectively, our results show that <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> has favorable tolerability and provides robust preclinical efficacy against seizures. Thus, allosteric enhancement of EAAT2 function could offer a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of epilepsy and potentially other neurological disorders associated with glutamate excitotoxicity.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27129?af=R">Distinct Constructs Underlie Patient‐Reported and Performance‐Rated Outcomes after Stroke</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), which capture patients' perspectives on the consequences of health and disease, are widely used in neurological care and research. However, it is unclear how PROMs relate to performance-rated impairments. Sociodemographic factors are known to affect PROMs. Direct damage to brain regions critical for self-awareness (i.e., parietal regions and the salience/ventral-attention network) may also impair self-report outcomes. This study examined the relationship between PROMs and performance-based measures in stroke survivors with arm motor impairments. We hypothesized that PROMs would be distinct from performance-based outcomes, influenced by sociodemographic factors, and linked to damage in brain circuits involved in self-perception.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We longitudinally assessed 54 stroke survivors using patient-reported and performance-rated measures at 4 timepoints. We used factor analysis to reveal the outcome battery's factorial structure. Linear regression examined the association between classes of measures and sociodemographics. Voxel-lesion-symptom-mapping, region-of-interest-based analysis, and voxel-lesion-network-mapping investigated the relationship between classes of outcomes and stroke-related injury.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Performance-based and patient-reported measures formed distinct factors, consistent across recovery phases. Higher education (β1 = 0.36, <i>p</i> = 0.02) and income adequacy (β2 = 0.48, <i>p</i> = 0.05) were associated with patient-reported, but not performance-rated outcomes. Greater parietal lobe injury, irrespective of hemisphere, was associated with worse patient-reported outcomes; greater corticospinal tract injury related to worse performance-rated outcomes. Lesions with greater functional connectivity to the salience/ventral-attention network were associated with worse patient-reported outcomes (<i>r</i> = −0.35, <i>p</i> = 0.009).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings reveal important differences between performance-rated and patient-reported outcomes, each with specific associated factors and anatomy post-stroke. Incorporating sociodemographic and neuroanatomic characteristics into neurorehabilitation strategies may inform and optimize patient outcomes. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:242–253</p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>The effects of seizure control on outcomes in persons with dementia (PWD) remain unclear. Our study aimed to investigate the impact of seizure control on mortality, function, cognition, and mood among PWD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This longitudinal, multicenter study is based on 39 Alzheimer's disease centers (ADCs) in the United States from September 2005 to December 2021. PWD were grouped by seizure status into recurrent (seizures in the past year), remote (prior seizures but none in the past year), and no seizures (controls). The primary outcome was all-cause mortality among seizure groups. We used Weibull survival analysis to assess the mortality risks by seizure status after adjusting for age, sex, education, race, ethnicity, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, degree of cognitive impairment, dominant Alzheimer's disease (AD) mutation, brain trauma, stroke, Parkinson's disease, alcohol abuse, and depression. Cognition (Clinical Dementia Rating), function (physical dependence and nursing home residence), day-to-day activities (Functional Assessment Scores), and mood (Geriatric Depression Scale) were compared among seizure groups after adjusting for dementia duration and age.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 26,501 participants, 374 (1.4%) had recurrent seizures and 510 (1.9%) had remote seizures. In multivariable survival analysis, recurrent seizures were associated with a higher mortality risk than remote and no seizures (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 95% confidence interval [95% CI]; recurrent aHR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.51 to 2.12; remote aHR = 1.17, 95% CI = 0.98 to 1.38). Median time-to-death for recurrent, remote, and no seizures was 2.4, 4.0, and 4.7 years, respectively. People with recurrent seizures had worse cognition, day-to-day function, and physical dependence than those with remote seizures and controls.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>PWD with poorly controlled recurrent seizures have worse mortality, functional, and cognitive outcomes than PWD with remote and no seizures. These findings underscore the need for timely identification and management of ongoing seizures in PWD. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:358–368</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27128?af=R">Neurologic Manifestations of Long COVID Disproportionately Affect Young and Middle‐Age Adults</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate neurologic manifestations of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Neuro-PASC) in post-hospitalization Neuro-PASC (PNP) and non-hospitalized Neuro-PASC (NNP) patients across the adult lifespan.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cross-sectional study of the first consecutive 200 PNP and 1,100 NNP patients evaluated at a Neuro-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinic between May 2020 and March 2023. Patients were divided into younger (18–44 years), middle-age (45–64 years), and older (65+ years) age groups.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Younger and middle-age individuals accounted for 142 of 200 (71%) of PNP and 995 of 1100 (90.5%) of NNP patients. Significant age-related differences in the frequencies of comorbidities and abnormal neurologic findings demonstrated higher prevalence in older patients. Conversely, 10 months from COVID-19 onset, we found significant age-related differences in Neuro-PASC symptoms indicating lower prevalence, and therefore, symptom burden, in older individuals. Moreover, there were significant age-related differences in subjective impression of fatigue (median [interquartile range (IQR)] patient-reported outcomes measurement information system [PROMIS] score: younger 64 [57–69], middle-age 63 [57–68], older 60.5 [50.8–68.3]; <i>p</i> = 0.04) and sleep disturbance (median [IQR] PROMIS score: younger 57 [51–63], middle-age 56 [53–63], older 54 [46.8–58]; <i>p</i> = 0.002) in the NNP group, commensurate with higher impairment in quality of life (QoL) among younger patients. Finally, there were significant age-related differences in objective executive function (median [IQR] National Institutes of Health [NIH] toolbox score: younger 48 [35–63], middle-age 49 [38–63], older 54.5 [45–66.3]; <i>p</i> = 0.01), and working memory (median [IQR] NIH toolbox score: younger 47 [40–53], middle-age 50 [44–57], older 48 [43–58]; <i>p</i> = 0.0002) in NNP patients, with the worst performance coming from the younger group.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Younger and middle-age individuals are disproportionally affected by Neuro-PASC regardless of acute COVID-19 severity. Although older people more frequently have abnormal neurologic findings and comorbidities, younger and middle-age patients suffer from a higher burden of Neuro-PASC symptoms and cognitive dysfunction contributing to decreased QoL. Neuro-PASC principally affects adults in their prime, contributing to profound public health and socioeconomic impacts warranting dedicated resources for prevention, diagnosis and interventions.

                Background The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected global health systems and daily life, exacerbating vulnerabilities, particularly in Indonesia. This study investigates the impact of anxiety and education level on mental health, with spiritual intelligence as an intervening variable among post-COVID-19 patients in Indonesia. Methods Utilizing a cross-sectional design, data were collected from 390 post-COVID-19 patients in Indonesia. Structured questionnaires assessed anxiety, education level, spiritual intelligence, and mental health. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the relationships among these variables. Results The findings indicate that anxiety significantly affects both spiritual intelligence and mental health, with spiritual intelligence acting as a mediating factor. Additionally, higher educational attainment is positively associated with enhanced spiritual intelligence and improved mental health outcomes. Conclusions The study underscores the importance of incorporating spiritual development practices into mental health interventions and educational programs to boost resilience and overall well-being in the post-pandemic era. While these findings are promising, the cross-sectional design limits causal inferences, and future research should consider longitudinal studies to examine these relationships over time. These practices can help mitigate the adverse effects of anxiety and educational disparities on mental health.

                Background The study analyzes the impact of public health spending on malnutrition among Peruvians, using data from the National Household Survey, the Central Reserve Bank of Peru, the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics and the Ministry of Economy and Finance from 2010. -2020. Previous studies have revealed the existing relationship of health spending with the reduction of malnutrition. Methods A quantitative approach is considered, with an explanatory type of research using panel data methodology considering the bidimensionality of the data, which allows quantifying this effect for the Peruvian case using the National Household Survey, data from the Central Reserve Bank of Peru, as well as information from the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics and the Transparency Portal of the Ministry of Economy and Finance in the period 2010-2020. Results The results show that public expenditure on health has a negative relationship with malnutrition; the rural sector has a positive relationship with malnutrition given the limitations present for access to adequate food. Similarly, the unemployment rate shows a positive relationship with malnutrition, given that being unemployed leads to a higher cause of malnutrition in the population, and the gross domestic product has a negative relationship with malnutrition, given that greater economic growth produces an impact on reducing malnutrition, with the greatest impact being on the rural population and the gross domestic product. Conclusions In the analysis period 2010-2020 in Peru, based on the panel data analysis, the impact of public health expenditure on reducing malnutrition is observed in 10 departments, achieving a reduction in malnutrition; while in 14 departments, this indicator has not been reduced.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-99/v1?src=rss">Predicting determinants of modern contraceptive use among reproductive-age women in Ethiopia using machine learning algorithm: Evidence from the Performance Monitoring and Accountability (PMA) Survey 2019 dataset [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer rev</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Globally, around 40% of women report unintended pregnancies, with approximately 214 million women in developing countries wanting to avoid pregnancy but not using any contraception. Modern contraceptives (MCs) are effective tools for preventing unintended pregnancies, controlling rapid population growth, and reducing fertility and maternal mortality rates, particularly in developing countries. Low use of contraceptives is responsible for the high fertility and maternal mortality rates in sub-Saharan African nations like Ethiopia. Thus, this study aimed to identify the determinants of modern contraceptive use among Ethiopian women of reproductive age using machine learning (ML) algorithms. Methodology The study utilized secondary data from the 2019 Performance Monitoring and Accountability (PMA) Ethiopia survey, analyzing 8,837 samples. Preprocessing steps included data cleaning, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and splitting the data, with 80% used for training and 20% for testing the algorithms. Six supervised ML algorithms were employed and assessed using confusion matrices, with information gain applied to identify critical attributes for predicting MC use. Results Only 24% of participants used modern contraceptives {95% CI (23.1%, 24.9%). Extreme gradient boosting (XGB) demonstrated the highest predictive accuracy (81.97%, 95% CI {79.06%, 82.7%}) and area under the ROC curve (76.63%), followed by logistic regression (80.52%) and support vector machines (80.41%). Key determinants of MC use included starting family planning at age 20 or older, being single, having partner approval, being the wife of the household head, age between 36–49 years, advice from healthcare providers, concerns about side effects, and having a household size of five or more. Conclusion and Recommendations The use of modern contraceptives among Ethiopian women remains low. Extreme gradient boosting proved most effective in predicting determinants of MC use. Improved counseling during ANC/PNC visits, promoting partner discussions on family planning, and addressing concerns about family size and contraceptive use are recommended strategies to enhance MC uptake.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27182?af=R">Clinical Relevance of ‘Cap’ and ‘Track’ Development after Recent Small Subcortical Infarct</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>After a recent small subcortical infarct (RSSI), some patients develop perilesional or remote hyperintensities (‘caps/tracks’) to the index infarct on T2/FLAIR MRI. However, their clinical relevance remains unclear. We investigated the clinicoradiological correlates of ‘caps/tracks’, and their impact on long-term outcomes following RSSI.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We identified participants with lacunar stroke and MRI-confirmed RSSI from 3 prospective studies. At baseline, we collected risk factors, RSSI characteristics, small vessel disease (SVD) features, and microstructural integrity on diffusion imaging. Over 1-year, we repeated MRI and recorded ‘caps/tracks’ blinded to other data. We evaluated predictors of ‘caps/tracks’, and their association with 1-year functional (modified Rankin Scale score ≥2), mobility (Timed Up-and-Go), cognitive outcomes (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA] score &lt;26), and recurrent cerebrovascular events (stroke/transient ischemic attack/incident infarct) using multivariable regression.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 185 participants, 93 (50.3%) developed ‘caps/tracks’ first detected at median 198 days after stroke. ‘Caps/tracks’ were independently predicted by baseline factors: larger RSSI, RSSI located in white matter, higher SVD score, and higher mean diffusivity in normal-appearing white matter (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval {CI}], 1.15 [1.07–1.25], 6.01 [2.80–13.57], 1.77 [1.31–2.44], 1.42 [1.01–2.03]). At 1 year, ‘cap/track’ formation was associated with worse functional outcome (OR: 3.17, 95% CI: 1.28–8.22), slower gait speed (β: 0.13, 95% CI: 0.01–0.25), and recurrent cerebrovascular events (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.05, 95% CI: 1.05–4.02), but not with cognitive impairment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>‘Caps/tracks’ after RSSI are associated with worse clinical outcomes, and may reflect vulnerability to progressive SVD-related injury. Reducing ‘caps/tracks’ may offer early efficacy markers in trials aiming to improve outcome after lacunar stroke. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95273">Unbiased identification of cell identity in dense mixed neural cultures</a></h4>

              
                Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology is revolutionizing cell biology. However, the variability between individual iPSC lines and the lack of efficient technology to comprehensively characterize iPSC-derived cell types hinder its adoption in routine preclinical screening settings. To facilitate the validation of iPSC-derived cell culture composition, we have implemented an imaging assay based on cell painting and convolutional neural networks to recognize cell types in dense and mixed cultures with high fidelity. We have benchmarked our approach using pure and mixed cultures of neuroblastoma and astrocytoma cell lines and attained a classification accuracy above 96%. Through iterative data erosion, we found that inputs containing the nuclear region of interest and its close environment, allow achieving equally high classification accuracy as inputs containing the whole cell for semi-confluent cultures and preserved prediction accuracy even in very dense cultures. We then applied this regionally restricted cell profiling approach to evaluate the differentiation status of iPSC-derived neural cultures, by determining the ratio of postmitotic neurons and neural progenitors. We found that the cell-based prediction significantly outperformed an approach in which the population-level time in culture was used as a classification criterion (96% <i>vs</i> 86%, respectively). In mixed iPSC-derived neuronal cultures, microglia could be unequivocally discriminated from neurons, regardless of their reactivity state, and a tiered strategy allowed for further distinguishing activated from non-activated cell states, albeit with lower accuracy. Thus, morphological single-cell profiling provides a means to quantify cell composition in complex mixed neural cultures and holds promise for use in the quality control of iPSC-derived cell culture models.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102618">Realistic mossy fiber input patterns to unipolar brush cells evoke a continuum of temporal responses comprised of components mediated by different glutamate receptors</a></h4>

              
                Unipolar brush cells (UBCs) are excitatory interneurons in the cerebellar cortex that receive mossy fiber (MF) inputs and excite granule cells. The UBC population responds to brief burst activation of MFs with a continuum of temporal transformations, but it is not known how UBCs transform the diverse range of MF input patterns that occur in vivo. Here, we use cell-attached recordings from UBCs in acute cerebellar slices to examine responses to MF firing patterns that are based on in vivo recordings. We find that MFs evoke a continuum of responses in the UBC population, mediated by three different types of glutamate receptors that each convey a specialized component. AMPARs transmit timing information for single stimuli at up to 5 spikes/s, and for very brief bursts. A combination of mGluR2/3s (inhibitory) and mGluR1s (excitatory) mediates a continuum of delayed, and broadened responses to longer bursts, and to sustained high frequency activation. Variability in the mGluR2/3 component controls the time course of the onset of firing, and variability in the mGluR1 component controls the duration of prolonged firing. We conclude that the combination of glutamate receptor types allows each UBC to simultaneously convey different aspects of MF firing. These findings establish that UBCs are highly flexible circuit elements that provide diverse temporal transformations that are well suited to contribute to specialized processing in different regions of the cerebellar cortex.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95485">CausalXtract, a flexible pipeline to extract causal effects from live-cell time-lapse imaging data</a></h4>

              
                Live-cell microscopy routinely provides massive amounts of time-lapse images of complex cellular systems under various physiological or therapeutic conditions. However, this wealth of data remains difficult to interpret in terms of causal effects. Here, we describe CausalXtract, a flexible computational pipeline that discovers causal and possibly time-lagged effects from morphodynamic features and cell–cell interactions in live-cell imaging data. CausalXtract methodology combines network-based and information-based frameworks, which is shown to discover causal effects overlooked by classical Granger and Schreiber causality approaches. We showcase the use of CausalXtract to uncover novel causal effects in a tumor-on-chip cellular ecosystem under therapeutically relevant conditions. In particular, we find that cancer-associated fibroblasts directly inhibit cancer cell apoptosis, independently from anticancer treatment. CausalXtract uncovers also multiple antagonistic effects at different time delays. Hence, CausalXtract provides a unique computational tool to interpret live-cell imaging data for a range of fundamental and translational research applications.

                The specific role that prolactin plays in lactational infertility, as distinct from other suckling or metabolic cues, remains unresolved. Here, deletion of the prolactin receptor (Prlr) from forebrain neurons or arcuate kisspeptin neurons resulted in failure to maintain normal lactation-induced suppression of estrous cycles. Kisspeptin immunoreactivity and pulsatile LH secretion were increased in these mice, even in the presence of ongoing suckling stimulation and lactation. GCaMP fibre photometry of arcuate kisspeptin neurons revealed that the normal episodic activity of these neurons is rapidly suppressed in pregnancy and this was maintained throughout early lactation. Deletion of Prlr from arcuate kisspeptin neurons resulted in early reactivation of episodic activity of kisspeptin neurons prior to a premature return of reproductive cycles in early lactation. These observations show dynamic variation in arcuate kisspeptin neuronal activity associated with the hormonal changes of pregnancy and lactation, and provide direct evidence that prolactin action on arcuate kisspeptin neurons is necessary for suppressing fertility during lactation in mice.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98409">Altering the redox status of Chlamydia trachomatis directly impacts its developmental cycle progression</a></h4>

              
                <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> is an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen with a unique developmental cycle. It differentiates between two functional and morphological forms: the elementary body (EB) and the reticulate body (RB). The signals that trigger differentiation from one form to the other are unknown. EBs and RBs have distinctive characteristics that distinguish them, including their size, infectivity, proteome, and transcriptome. Intriguingly, they also differ in their overall redox status as EBs are oxidized and RBs are reduced. We hypothesize that alterations in redox may serve as a trigger for secondary differentiation. To test this, we examined the function of the primary antioxidant enzyme alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit C (AhpC), a well-known member of the peroxiredoxins family, in chlamydial growth and development. Based on our hypothesis, we predicted that altering the expression of <i>ahpC</i> would modulate chlamydial redox status and trigger earlier or delayed secondary differentiation. Therefore, we created <i>ahpC</i> overexpression and knockdown strains. During <i>ahpC</i> knockdown, ROS levels were elevated, and the bacteria were sensitive to a broad set of peroxide stresses. Interestingly, we observed increased expression of EB-associated genes and concurrent higher production of EBs at an earlier time in the developmental cycle, indicating earlier secondary differentiation occurs under elevated oxidation conditions. In contrast, overexpression of AhpC created a resistant phenotype against oxidizing agents and delayed secondary differentiation. Together, these results indicate that redox potential is a critical factor in developmental cycle progression. For the first time, our study provides a mechanism of chlamydial secondary differentiation dependent on redox status.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102440">Evaluating the transcriptional regulators of arterial gene expression via a catalogue of characterized arterial enhancers</a></h4>

              
                The establishment and growth of the arterial endothelium requires the coordinated expression of numerous genes. However, regulation of this process is not yet fully understood. Here, we combined <i>in silico</i> analysis with transgenic mice and zebrafish models to characterize arterial-specific enhancers associated with eight key arterial identity genes (<i>Acvrl1</i>/<i>Alk1</i>,<i> Cxcr4, Cxcl12, Efnb2, Gja4/Cx37, Gja5/Cx40</i>,<i> Nrp1</i> and <i>Unc5b)</i>. Next, to elucidate the regulatory pathways upstream of arterial gene transcription, we investigated the transcription factors binding each arterial enhancer compared to a similar assessment of non-arterial endothelial enhancers. These results found that binding of SOXF and ETS factors was a common occurrence at both arterial and pan-endothelial enhancers, suggesting neither are sufficient to direct arterial specificity. Conversely, FOX motifs independent of ETS motifs were over-represented at arterial enhancers. Further, MEF2 and RBPJ binding was enriched but not ubiquitous at arterial enhancers, potentially linked to specific patterns of behaviour within the arterial endothelium. Lastly, there was no shared or arterial-specific signature for WNT-associated TCF/LEF, TGFβ/BMP-associated SMAD1/5 and SMAD2/3, shear stress-associated KLF4 or venous-enriched NR2F2. This cohort of well characterized and in vivo-verified enhancers can now provide a platform for future studies into the interaction of different transcriptional and signalling pathways with arterial gene expression.

	<p>Background: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is characterized by early postural instability and gait dysfunction, with frequent falls. Rehabilitation is an important therapeutic approach for motor dysfunction in patients with PSP. However, no conclusions have yet been drawn regarding the beneficial effects of rehabilitation in PSP, including the optimal duration of rehabilitation and differences in treatment effects among PSP subtypes. Herein, we investigated the effects of short-term rehabilitation and separately analyzed the effects on patients with PSP-Richardson&amp;amp;rsquo;s syndrome (RS) and PSP-progressive gait freezing (PGF). Methods: The participants underwent several therapeutic exercise programs individualized for each participant, performed over 2 weeks. Analysis was performed on 25 patients with PSP-RS and eight with PSP-PGF. Results: Short-term rehabilitation improved the Berg Balance Scale score in both the PSP-RS and PSP-PGF groups, step length on the symptom-dominant side in PSP-RS, the coefficient of variation of step length on the symptom-dominant side, and the stance phase of the Symmetry Index in PSP-PGF. Conclusions: Overall, this 2-week short-term rehabilitation intervention was shown to have beneficial effects on balance in patients with PSP-RS and PSP-PGF.</p>

	<p>Background/Aim: Currently, there are limited evidence-based protocols for improving upper extremity (UE) motor function after stroke. The Keys protocol, a distributed form of constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), delivers CIMT components in fewer hours per day over an extended period, fitting outpatient rehabilitation schedules and third-party payor models. This pilot study aimed to assess the effectiveness of the Keys protocol in enhancing UE capacity and performance poststroke. Methods: Ten adults with chronic stroke (&amp;amp;gt;6 months) participated in an 8-week intervention. The protocol included 22 supervised training sessions (1.5 h each): 4 days/week for 4 weeks, 2 days/week for weeks 5&amp;amp;ndash;6, and 1 day/week for weeks 7&amp;amp;ndash;8. Participants wore a restraint mitt on the less-affected UE during waking hours and used an adapted transfer package. Outcome measures included the Motor Activity Log (MAL), Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), Stroke Impact Scale (SIS), and Zung Depression Scale, assessed pre-treatment, mid-treatment (4 weeks), and posttreatment. Results: Significant improvements were observed in SIS Strength, ADLs/IADLs, Mobility, and Hand Function domains, exceeding MCID thresholds. Memory and Communication domains improved significantly at the 3-month follow-up. WMFT performance times improved, with fewer incomplete tasks. MAL scores for Amount of Use and Quality of Movement increased across all time points. Depressive symptoms significantly decreased posttreatment. Conclusions: The Keys protocol effectively improves UE use, motor function, mood, and quality of life, with the greatest gains observed mid-intervention. These findings support its feasibility and potential for outpatient stroke rehabilitation (ClinicalTrials.gov Registration: NCT05311384).</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Loneliness is a heterogeneous phenomenon, generally defined as an emotional experience based on the perceived distance between an individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s actual social relationships and those he or she would like to have. Adolescence is particularly vulnerable to loneliness because of the many changes in values, feelings, and emotions that characterize it. Among the aspects that may influence this feeling of discomfort, the literature identifies maladaptive personality and a dysfunctional response to traumatic events. Our study aims to identify the possible role that maladaptive personality traits and post-traumatic stress symptomatology in the form of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Disturbance in Self-Organization (DSO) may play in the perception of loneliness in adolescents: Methods: We identified a mediation model constructed through structural equation modeling (SEM) to test PTSD and DSO post-traumatic stress symptomatology as independent variables and maladaptive personality as a mediator in the relationship between these and perceptions of loneliness in a population of adolescents of both sexes, Italian high school students; Results: Our study identifies the significant role of PTSD and DSO symptomatology in influencing the state of loneliness, both directly and indirectly through maladaptive personality traits, which appear to exert a substantial influence on the perception of loneliness, potentially functioning as mediators in the relationship between the latter and PTSD/DSO symptomatology. Presumably, a maladaptive personality may complicate recovery from adverse and traumatic experiences by preventing the implementation of functional coping strategies and promoting dysfunctional responses. Conclusions: Our findings underscore the importance of researchers and clinicians adequately considering different personality traits and the early identification of post-traumatic stress symptomatology. A focus on adolescents&amp;amp;rsquo; communication and interpersonal skills and their ability to respond effectively to stressful and traumatic events may prove useful in identifying more effective strategies for preventing and managing loneliness and related distress in adolescents.</p>

	<p>Objectives: This study analyzed the effects of parachute jump stress on the executive functions and attention of cadets. Executive functions, which includes processes such as attentional control and cognitive flexibility, are crucial for soldiers, especially in situations requiring rapid decision-making. Parachute jumping, as an intense stressor, mobilizes cognitive resources, which can lead to short-term improvements in executive functions. Methods: A total of 64 cadets divided into control (N = 32) and experimental (N = 32) groups participated in the study. The experimental group performed a parachute jump and then took the Color Trails Test, assessed both before and after the jump. Results: The results showed significant improvements in executive functions, in particular, sustained and alternating attention, sequential information processing, and monitoring one&amp;amp;rsquo;s own behavior, suggesting a positive effect of stress on selected executive functions. Conclusions: The results indicate that intense, short-term stress can positively affect executive functions, although this effect may depend on the type of task and the participants&amp;amp;rsquo; experience of exposure to intense stressful stimuli. The study makes an important contribution to the design of future military training, considering the importance of mobilizing cognitive resources in response to short-term stress.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Charcot first described ALS in 1869, but the specific mechanisms that mediate the disease pathology are still not clear. Intense research efforts have provided insight into unique neuroanatomical regions, specific neuronal populations and genetic associations for ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases; however, the experimental results also suggest a convergence of these events to common toxic pathways. We propose that common toxic pathways can be therapeutically targeted, and this intervention will be effective in slowing progression and improving patient quality of life. Here, we focus on understanding the role of IL6 trans-signaling in ALS disease processes. Methods: We leveraged unique mouse models of IL6 trans-signaling that we developed that recapitulate the production of active sIL6R in a genotypic and quantitative fashion observed in humans. Given that the SOD1 transgenic mouse is one of the most highly studied and characterized models of ALS, we bred SOD1G93A mice with IL6R trans-signaling mice to determine how enhanced trans-signaling influenced symptom onset and pathological processes, including neuromuscular junction (NMJ) denervation, glial activation and motoneuron (MN) survival. Results: The results indicate that in animals with enhanced trans-signaling, symptom onset and pathological processes were accelerated, suggesting a role in disease modification. Administration of an IL6R functional blocking antibody failed to alter accelerated symptom onset and disease progression. Conclusions: Future work to investigate the site-specific influence of enhanced IL6 trans-signaling and the tissue-specific bioavailability of potential therapeutics will be necessary to identify targets for precise therapeutic interventions that may limit disease progression in the 60% of ALS patients who inherit the common Il6R Asp358Ala variant.</p>

	<p>The assessment of negative symptoms in schizophrenia has advanced since the 2006 NIMH-MATRICS Consensus Statement, leading to the development of second-generation rating scales like the Brief Negative Symptom Scale and the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms. These scales address the limitations of first-generation tools, such as the inclusion of aspects that are not negative symptoms and the lack of assessment of the subject&amp;amp;rsquo;s internal experience. However, psychometric validation of these scales is still in progress, and they are not yet recommended by regulatory agencies, thus limiting their use in clinical trials and settings. Complementing these traditional methods, remote digital phenotyping offers a novel approach by leveraging smartphones and wearable technology to capture real-time, high-resolution clinical data. Despite the potential to overcome traditional assessment barriers, challenges remain in aligning these digital measures with clinical ratings and ensuring data security. Equally important is patient acceptance, as the success of remote digital phenotyping relies on the willingness of patients to use these technologies. This review provides a critical overview of both second-generation scales and remote digital phenotyping for assessing negative symptoms, highlighting future research needs.</p>

	<p>Background: Perinatal brain injury is a leading cause of developmental disabilities, including cerebral palsy. However, further work is needed to understand early brain development in the presence of brain injury. In this case report, we examine the longitudinal neuromotor development of a term infant following a significant loss of right-hemispheric brain tissue due to a unilateral ischemic stroke. Our analysis focuses on the integrity and development of the corticospinal tract (CST) from the lesioned hemisphere. This case provides a unique opportunity to evaluate CST development after loss of the majority of the motor cortex. Methods: Evaluations were conducted when the infant was 4 (Visit-1), 18 (Visit 2), and 25 (Visit 3) months old. Assessments included magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to characterize the lesion and quantify CST structural integrity, single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS) to evaluate CST functional circuitry, and neuromotor assessments. Results: At Visit 1, bilateral CSTs were identified through diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) despite an estimated loss of 92.7% (7.3% retained) of age-typical motor cortex from the right hemisphere. Both hemispheres exhibited bilateral motor-evoked potential in response to stimulation with spTMS, which remained when reassessed at Visits 2 and 3. Longitudinal MRI showed distinct developmental trajectories of CST integrity in each hemisphere, with the lesioned hemisphere exhibiting initial increases in integrity between Visits 1 and 2 followed by a decrease in integrity between Visits 2 and 3. The non-lesioned hemisphere showed increased integrity from Visit 1 to Visit 2, which remained stable at Visit 3. Motor assessments at all visits indicated a high risk of cerebral palsy. Conclusions: This report highlights the utility of MRI and spTMS in studying neuromotor development. The findings reveal preserved functional bilateral CST circuitry despite majority loss of the right-hemispheric motor cortex as well as distinct developmental trajectories in CST integrity between hemispheres. These results underscore the potential for neural plasticity after perinatal brain injury. Clinical Trials Registration: NCT05013736.</p>

	<p>The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) has been developed and edited by the World Health Organisation and represents the global standard for recording health information and causes of death. The ICD-11 is the eleventh revision and came into effect on 1 January 2022. Perceptual disturbances refer to abnormalities in the way sensory information is interpreted by the brain, leading to distortions in the perception of reality. These can manifest as distorted perceptions or as phantom perceptions and can occur in all sensory modalities as visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory tactile, vestibular, proprioceptory or interoceptory disturbances. There are similar brain mechanisms involved in the generation of these analogous perceptual disturbances and disorders, and they are treated with similar approaches. Perceptual disturbances are highly prevalent, with large variations across the different sensory modalities. They can be associated with significant suffering and cause a high socioeconomic burden. Perceptual disturbances can be symptoms of another disease or disease entities on their own. In the context of pain, this is reflected by the distinction between secondary pain (pain as a symptom of another underlying condition) and primary pain (a disease in its own right, rather than being a symptom of another underlying condition) in the ICD-11. Such a clear distinction is not found in an entirely consistent way across the various sensory modalities. By using the example of auditory phantom perceptions, we propose a framework for the classification of sensory disorders in alignment with the classification of pain in the ICD-11. The descriptions of the sensory disturbances should include (1) a causal aspect (primary versus secondary), (2) a temporal aspect (acute vs. chronic and persistent vs. intermittent), (3) a cognitive, emotional and autonomic interpretation aspect (=suffering) and (4) a social aspect (=disability). If the latter two aspects are present, we propose that the sensory disturbance is called a sensory disorder.</p>

                <p>Short-term motor adaptation to novel movement dynamics has been shown to involve at least two concurrent learning processes: a slow process that responds weakly to error but retains information well and a fast process that responds strongly to error but has poor retention. This modeling framework can explain several properties of motion-dependent motor adaptation (e.g., 24&nbsp;h retention). An important assumption of this computational framework is that learning is only based on the experienced movement error, and the effect of noise (either internally generated or externally applied) is not considered. We examined the respective error sensitivity by quantifying adaptation in three subject groups distinguished by the noise added to the motion-dependent perturbation. We assessed the feedforward adaptive changes in motor output and examined the adaptation rate, retention, and decay of learning. Applying a two-state modeling framework showed that the applied noise during training mainly affected the fast learning process, with the slow process largely unaffected; participants in the higher noise groups demonstrated a reduced force profile following training, but the decay rate across groups was similar, suggesting that the slow process was unimpaired across conditions. Collectively, our results provide evidence that noise significantly decreases motor adaptation, but this reduction may be due to its influence over specific learning mechanisms. Importantly, this may have implications for how the motor system compensates for random fluctuations, especially when affected by brain disorders that result in movement tremor (e.g., essential tremor).</p>

                <p>Epilepsy, a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures, significantly impacts patient quality of life. Current classification methods focus primarily on clinical observations and electroencephalography (EEG) analysis, often overlooking the underlying dynamics driving seizures. This study uses surface EEG data to identify seizure transitions using a dynamical systems&ndash;based framework&mdash;the taxonomy of seizure dynamotypes&mdash;previously examined only in invasive data. We applied principal component and independent component (IC) analysis to surface EEG recordings from 1,177 seizures in 158 patients with focal epilepsy, decomposing the signals into ICs. The ICs were visually labeled for clear seizure transitions and bifurcation morphologies (BifMs), which were then examined using Bayesian multilevel modeling in the context of clinical factors. Our analysis reveals that certain onset bifurcations (saddle node on invariant circle and supercritical Hopf) are more prevalent during wakefulness compared with their reduced rate during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, particularly NREM3. We discuss the possible implications of our results in the context of modeling approaches and suggest additional avenues to continue this exploration. Furthermore, we demonstrate the feasibility of automating this classification process using machine learning, achieving high performance in identifying seizure-related ICs and classifying interspike interval changes. Our findings suggest that the noise in surface EEG may obscure certain BifMs, and we suggest technical improvements that could enhance detection accuracy. Expanding the dataset and incorporating long-term biological rhythms, such as circadian and multiday cycles, may provide a more comprehensive understanding of seizure dynamics and improve clinical decision-making.</p>

                Background Studies assessing sub-maximal aerobic capacity in non-cirrhotic chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients are scarce. This study aimed to evaluate sub-maximal aerobic capacity in CHB patients compared to apparently healthy participants (control-group). Methods A 6-min walk test was performed. The 6-min walk distance (6MWD) was recorded, along with heart-rate, oxygen hemoglobin saturation (SpO2), blood pressure, and dyspnea ( ie ; visual analogue scale) at rest (Rest) and at the end (End) of the test. Additionally, 6-min walk work (6MWW), “6MWD × body mass index (BMI), “6MWD × SpO2End”, and “estimated cardiorespiratory and muscular chain age” were calculated. Signs of physical intolerance were determined including abnormal 6MWD ( ie ; 6MWD < lower limit of normal), chronotropic insufficiency ( ie ; heart-rateEnd < 60% of maximal predicted heart-rate), high dyspnea ( ie ; dyspneaEnd > 5), and desaturation ( ie ; drop in SpO2 > 5 points). Results Compared to the control-group (n=28), the CHB-group (n=26) exhibited significantly lower 6MWD by 61 meters (13%), lower 6MWW by 5266 m.kg, lower “6MWD × BMI” by 1498 m.kg/m2, lower “6MWD × SpO2End” by 5650%, and lower heart-rateEnd by 26 bpm (12% predicted). The CHB-group included higher percentages of participants with chronotropic insufficiency (23.08% vs. 3.57% in the CG) and abnormal 6MWD (34.61% vs. 3.57% in the CG). CHB accelerated the aging of the “cardiorespiratory and muscular chain” by 11 years. Conclusion Non-cirrhotic CHB may contribute to reduced submaximal aerobic capacity and acceleration of “cardiorespiratory and muscular chain” aging. A regular physical activity program could be a valuable intervention to mitigate these effects.

                Background This study explores the influence of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices on consumer purchasing decisions in the fashion industry. It examines how corporate image and word-of-mouth (WOM) mediate the relationship between ESG practices and consumer trust, impacting purchase intent. Methods A structured questionnaire was distributed online to 393 participants aware of ESG practices, targeting Generation Z consumers. The survey assessed demographics, ESG awareness, brand image, WOM, and purchasing decisions using a Likert scale across five constructs: ESG Practices, Corporate Image, WOM, Trust, and Purchase Intention. Data were analyzed with Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) in IBM AMOS, following a two-step process: Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) for validation and path analysis for hypothesis testing. Results The findings indicate that ESG practices significantly enhance corporate image and positive WOM, which, in turn, foster consumer trust. Corporate image has a substantial impact on consumer trust (p < .001), while WOM also contributes to trust (p < .001). Trust was found to be a strong predictor of purchase intention, demonstrating the mediating role of corporate image and WOM between ESG practices and purchasing behavior. Conclusions ESG practices are critical in shaping consumer perceptions and fostering loyalty in the fashion sector. By building a trustworthy corporate image and encouraging positive WOM, fashion brands can effectively influence consumer purchasing decisions. This study highlights the competitive advantage of implementing ESG practices, particularly in appealing to Generation Z consumers who value sustainability and ethical business practices.

<p>Anxiety, but not depression scores, were significantly related to neural stress responses in a striato-limbic cluster. Moreover, relative to women, men showed stronger associations between anxiety scores and activity in striatal and temporal clusters. Baseline neural stress responses could not predict the anxiety trajectory during a particular stress phase.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Anxiety and depression disorders show high prevalence rates, and stress is a significant risk factor for both. However, studies investigating the interplay between anxiety, depression, and stress regulation in the brain are scarce. The present manuscript included 124 law students from the LawSTRESS project. Anxiety and depression symptoms were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and psychosocial stress was induced with the imaging stress paradigm Scan<i>STRESS</i>. Anxiety, but not depression scores, were significantly related to neural stress responses in a striato-limbic cluster. Moreover, relative to women, men showed stronger associations between anxiety scores and activation in striatal and temporal clusters. A bifactor model of the HADS suggested a general factor characterized by tension, nervousness, and cheerlessness, which was associated with activation changes in a similar but more circumscribed cluster than anxiety. In the LawSTRESS project, the HADS was assessed at five sampling points (1 year, 3 months, 1 week prior exam, 1 week, and 1 month thereafter), and thus an exploratory trajectory analysis could be performed. It confirmed the relationship between anxiety scores and striatal stress responses at baseline but revealed no predictive value of the neural measure across the sampling points. Our results suggest that—in healthy young participants—neural acute psychosocial stress responses in striato-limbic structures are associated with anxiety, supporting the assumption that these regions are related to individual differences in vulnerability to stress-related disorders. A correlation with depression scores could not be found, and possible explanations are discussed.</p>

The rapid advance of large-scale atlas-level single cell RNA sequences and single-cell chromatin accessibility data provide extraordinary avenues to broad and deep insight into complex biological mechanism. Leveraging the datasets and transfering labels from scRNA-seq to scATAC-seq will empower the exploration of single-cell omics data. However, the current label transfer methods have limited performance, largely due to the lower capable of preserving fine-grained cell populations and intrinsic or extrinsic heterogeneity between datasets. Here, we present a robust deep transfer model based graph convolutional network, scTGCN, which achieves versatile performance in preserving biological variation, while achieving integration hundreds of thousands cells in minutes with low memory consumption. We show that scTGCN is powerful to the integration of mouse atlas data and multimodal data generated from APSA-seq and CITE-seq. Thus, scTGCN shows high label transfer accuracy and effectively knowledge transfer across different modalities.

                <p>by Lua Koenig, Biyu J. He</p>

Perceptual awareness results from an intricate interaction between external sensory input and the brain’s spontaneous activity. Pre-stimulus ongoing activity influencing conscious perception includes both brain oscillations in the alpha (7 to 14 Hz) and beta (14 to 30 Hz) frequency ranges and aperiodic activity in the slow cortical potential (SCP, <5 Hz) range. However, whether brain oscillations and SCPs independently influence conscious perception or do so through shared mechanisms remains unknown. Here, we addressed this question in 2 independent magnetoencephalography (MEG) data sets involving near-threshold visual perception tasks in humans using low-level (Gabor patches) and high-level (objects, faces, houses, animals) stimuli, respectively. We found that oscillatory power and large-scale SCP activity influence conscious perception through independent mechanisms that do not have shared variance. In addition, through mediation analysis, we show that pre-stimulus oscillatory power and SCP activity have different relations to pupil size—an index of arousal—in their influences on conscious perception. Together, these findings suggest that oscillatory power and SCPs independently contribute to perceptual awareness, with distinct relations to pupil-linked arousal.

                Background Chronic diseases are a significant health concern in Australia. Understanding community preferences for health screening services is vital for enhancing service delivery. We conducted a study to determine community preferences for health screening services for chronic diseases in Australia using a discrete choice experiment (DCE). This paper aims to present the development of the final DCE design using priors estimated from a survey. Methods A DCE was conducted in Australia. An online survey was administered to a general Australian population over 18. The final attribute list of five attributes with three levels each was designed. A D-efficient design with 30 pair-wise choice tasks was developed using a fractional factorial design. A pre-test was conducted to assess comprehension and understanding of the online DCE survey. The pilot survey aimed to compute priors (i.e. coefficients) associated with attributes. A multinomial logit model was used to analyse the pilot DCE data. Results The survey included 30 choice tasks in three blocks, with 119 participants responding. The best DCE design was selected based on D-error, with a lower D-error indicating the most efficient design. The pilot survey results indicated a strong preference for highly accurate screening tests, with coefficients for 85% and 95% accuracy being positive. Coefficients estimated from the pilot survey were used as priors to design the DCE choice tasks for the main survey. The final DCE design showed a notable improvement in the attribute level overlap compared to the design used for the pilot survey. Conclusions A rigorous approach was taken to develop a DCE survey that could effectively determine the preferences of the community for health screening services. The resulting DCE design consisted of 30 choice tasks presented in pairs and was deemed efficient enough to gather comprehensive information in the final survey.

                Background This study investigates the impact of the 2008 constitutional change on Ecuadorians´ life satisfaction (developing country), based on the Sumak-Kawsay or “The good way of living” philosophy, with a particular focus on caring of people and mingas (community participation). Methods Through a repeated cross-sectional analysis of national survey data, this study compares the periods before (2007) and after (2014) the implementation of the 2008 constitution to examine how caring behaviors and mingas (community work) influence life satisfaction, using an ordinal logistic regression model to assess the role of this reform in shaping these effects. Results The findings reveal significant improvements in life satisfaction following the 2008’ reform, especially in the Eastern region, where community activities are prevalent, and poverty is most concentrated. These activities, including mingas, showed a positive association with an increase in life satisfaction, underscoring the role of public policies in improving public well-being. Conclusion This approach offers innovative empirical evidence on how social public policies that promote prosocial behaviors, such as solidarity and community participation, can create an environment encouraging to greater life satisfaction, particularly in less developed regions. It also underscores how social investment aimed at improving wealth distribution can positively influence collaborative behaviors.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27168?af=R">Diagnosing Epilepsy with Normal Interictal EEG Using Dynamic Network Models</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Whereas a scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) is important for diagnosing epilepsy, a single routine EEG is limited in its diagnostic value. Only a small percentage of routine EEGs show interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) and overall misdiagnosis rates of epilepsy are 20% to 30%. We aim to demonstrate how network properties in EEG recordings can be used to improve the speed and accuracy differentiating epilepsy from mimics, such as functional seizures – even in the absence of IEDs.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this multicenter study, we analyzed routine scalp EEGs from 218 patients with suspected epilepsy and normal initial EEGs. The patients’ diagnoses were later confirmed based on an epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) admission. About 46% ultimately being diagnosed with epilepsy and 54% with non-epileptic conditions. A logistic regression model was trained using spectral and network-derived EEG features to differentiate between epilepsy and non-epilepsy. Of the 218 patients, 90% were used for training and 10% were held out for testing. Within the training set, 10-fold cross validation was performed. The resulting tool was named “EpiScalp.”</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>EpiScalp achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.940, an accuracy of 0.904, a sensitivity of 0.835, and a specificity of 0.963 in classifying patients as having epilepsy or not.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>EpiScalp provides an accurate diagnostic aid from a single initial EEG recording, even in more challenging epilepsy cases with normal initial EEGs. This may represent a paradigm shift in epilepsy diagnosis by deriving an objective measure of epilepsy likelihood from previously uninformative EEGs. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>
