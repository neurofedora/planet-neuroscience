                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The neurophysiological processes reflecting body illusions such as the rubber hand remain debated. Previous studies investigating the neural responses evoked by the illusion-inducing stimulation have provided diverging reports as to when these responses reflect the illusory state of the artificial limb becoming embodied. One reason for these diverging reports may be that different studies contrasted different experimental conditions to isolate potential correlates of the illusion, but individual contrasts may reflect multiple facets of the adopted experimental paradigm and not just the illusory state. To resolve these controversies, we recorded EEG responses in human participants and combined multivariate (cross-)classification with multiple Illusion and non-Illusion conditions. These conditions were designed to probe for markers of the illusory state that generalize across the spatial arrangements of limbs or the specific nature of the control object (a rubber hand or participant&rsquo;s real hand), hence which are independent of the precise experimental conditions used as contrast for the illusion. Our results reveal a parcellation of evoked responses into a temporal sequence of events. Around 125 and 275 ms following stimulus onset, the neurophysiological signals reliably differentiate the illusory state from non-Illusion epochs. These results consolidate previous work by demonstrating multiple neurophysiological correlates of the rubber hand illusion and illustrate how multivariate approaches can help pinpointing those that are independent of the precise experimental configuration used to induce the illusion.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Bacterial and fungal co-infections among ICU COVID-19 hospitalized patients in a Palestinian hospital: a retrospective cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Diagnosis of co-infections with multiple pathogens among hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients can be jointly challenging and essential for appropriate treatment, shortening hospital stays and preventing antimicrobial resistance. This study proposes to investigate the burden of bacterial and fungal co-infections outcomes on COVID-19 patients. It is a single center cross-sectional study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients at Beit-Jala hospital in Palestine. Methods: The study included 321 hospitalized patients admitted to the ICU between June 2020 and March 2021 aged ≥20 years, with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay conducted on a nasopharyngeal swab. The patient's information was gathered using graded data forms from electronic medical reports. Results: The diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infection was proved through the patient’s clinical presentation and positive blood or sputum culture results. All cases had received empirical antimicrobial therapy before the intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and different regimens during the ICU stay. The rate of bacterial co-infection was 51.1%, mainly from gram-negative isolates (Enterobacter species and K.pneumoniae). The rate of fungal co-infection caused by A.fumigatus was 48.9%, and the mortality rate was 8.1%. However, it is unclear if it had been attributed to SARS-CoV-2 or coincidental. Conclusions: Bacterial and fungal co-infection is common among COVID-19 patients at the ICU in Palestine, but it is not obvious if these cases are attributed to SARS-CoV-2 or coincidental, because little data is available to compare it with the rates of secondary infection in local ICU departments before the pandemic. Comprehensively, those conclusions present data supporting a conservative antibiotic administration for severely unwell COVID-19 infected patients. Our examination regarding the impacts of employing antifungals to manage COVID-19 patients can work as a successful reference for future COVID-19 therapy.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Pre-Clinical Study: Immunohistochemical evaluation of matrix metalloproteinase-13 on rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) socket healing after application of platelet-rich fibrin with and without hydroxyapatite [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Tissue engineering technology has been used globally and proven to accelerate wound healing. This study aimed to analyse the effect of adding hydroxyapatite (HA) as a scaffold to platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) as a growth factor in accelerating the wound healing process as seen from the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13). Methods: This research is an animal experiment conducted on 18 rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus). Rabbits were randomly divided into the following three groups of treatment: (G1) the application of PRF group, (G2) the application of PRF+HA group and (C) the control group without any application. Furthermore, each treatment group was split randomly into three groups of observation time. Periodontal tissue biopsy was performed to analyse the histopathological features that were examined on the basis of the level of MMP-13 immunoexpression. Results: MMP-13 immunoexpression in the PRF+HA group showed better histoscore results, indicating a substantial reduction in MMP-13 values compared with other groups. The healing process was shown to increase with increasing observation time (p<0.05), and the PRF+HA group outperformed the PRF and control groups. On day 3, MMP-13 exhibited a dark brown colour of Immunohistochemistry (IHC), which indicated an increase in the expression value of MMP-13 in the early stages of healing, namely, inflammation. On day 14, light brown IHC was seen, especially in group 2, as a reference that the remodeling process had begun. Conclusions: This study indicates that the application of HA can accelerate the socket healing process by decreasing the level of immunoexpression of MMP-13. HA is an alloplastic material that has inherent bioactive properties that support osteoconduction, which functions as a scaffold in the form of a fibrin matrix that can bind MMPs so that it can accelerate the wound healing process.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Foundation in Law students’ reading awareness of the case law genre [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A text of different genre might pose a different problem to students and different genre requires different approach in understanding and comprehending it. Developing the expertise in reading legal texts at an early stage of learning will be very beneficial to the students of law.  This study examines the level of pre-university/foundation in law students’ awareness for the case law genre, and the aim of this study is to investigate the extent of awareness of the case law genre among the foundation in law students.  Methods: Five students who were pursuing their study in the foundation/pre-university level were selected as the subjects in this study.  Qualitative data were obtained through the think-aloud procedure and questionnaire which was administered after the think-aloud procedure. The transcription of each student’s verbal reports was scrutinised for evidence of genre awareness while the answers given in the questionnaire were used to support the findings of the study.  Genre analysis of 4-Move structure was used to identify the students’ level of awareness. Results: The findings indicate that the students were aware of the case law genre. However, they displayed a mixed-level of awareness. Conclusion: It is hoped that this study can provide some insights into the reading behaviour of law students especially when reading case law. Knowing and understanding the case law structure is integral for law students, and analysing students understanding of reading case law can help both the students and English for Academic Purposes (EAP) educators.

                Background: The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of a newly developed computer-assisted instructional package for life skills (CAIFLS) specifically designed to raise awareness of risky sexual behaviors among Thai early adolescents in Bangkok. Methods:  The research process included two phases: (1) the development and (2) the use and evaluation of the newly developed CAIFLS package. First, 5 teachers and 5 Grade 7 students of a Bangkok school were interviewed to collect information needed for the development of CAIFLS. The second phase was to implement learning activities through CAIFLS with a total of 87 Bangkok school students, consisting of 44 students for the experimental group who received CAIFLS for 4 sessions, and 43 students for the control group who received routine class lecture. CAIFLS instructions, lesson plans and worksheets were designed as the experiment methods. Then questionnaires of life skills assessments and student satisfaction were used to investigate the effects and the student satisfaction of CAIFLS.  Results: The findings revealed that the efficiency values of the CAIFLS package were 80.2/82.5, higher than the set criteria of 80/80. Mean scores on life skills for the experimental group significant increased (p < .05), which was higher than the control group. The students also showed their satisfaction of CAIFLS at a high level (M = 4.20, S.D. = 0.29) Conclusions: CAIFLS can be used as an effective learning tool to enhance life skills to prevent risky sexual behaviors among Thai early adolescents.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Experimental-analytical approach to assessing mechanosensitive cartilage blood marker kinetics in healthy adults: dose-response relationship and interrelationship of nine candidate markers [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: To determine the suitability of selected blood biomarkers of articular cartilage as mechanosensitive markers and to investigate the dose-response relationship between ambulatory load magnitude and marker kinetics in response to load.  Methods: Serum samples were collected from 24 healthy volunteers before and at three time points after a 30-minute walking stress test performed on three test days. In each experimental session, one of three ambulatory loads was applied: 100% body weight (BW); 80%BW; 120%BW. Serum concentrations of COMP, MMP-3, MMP-9, ADAMTS-4, PRG-4, CPII, C2C and IL-6 were assessed using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. A two-stage analytical approach was used to determine the suitability of a biomarker by testing the response to the stress test (criterion I) and the dose-response relationship between ambulatory load magnitude and biomarker kinetics (criterion II).  Results. COMP, MMP-3 and IL-6 at all three time points after, MMP-9 at 30 and 60 minutes after, and ADAMTS-4 and CPII at immediately after the stress test showed an average response to load or an inter-individual variation in response to load of up to 25% of pre-test levels. The relation to load magnitude on average or an inter-individual variation in this relationship was up to 8% from load level to load level. There was a positive correlation for the slopes of the change-load relationship between COMP and MMP-3, and a negative correlation for the slopes between COMP, MMP-3 and IL-6 with MMP-9, and COMP with IL6.  Conclusions: COMP, MMP-3, IL-6, MMP-9, and ADAMTS-4 warrant further investigation in the context of articular cartilage mechanosensitivity and its role in joint degeneration and OA. While COMP seems to be able to reflect a rapid response, MMP-3 seems to reflect a slightly longer lasting, but probably also more distinct response. MMP-3 showed also the strongest association with the magnitude of load.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The activity of human enhancers is modulated by the splicing of their associated lncRNAs</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jennifer Yihong Tan, Ana Claudia Marques</p>

Pervasive enhancer transcription is at the origin of more than half of all long noncoding RNAs in humans. Transcription of enhancer-associated long noncoding RNAs (elncRNA) contribute to their cognate enhancer activity and gene expression regulation in <i>cis</i>. Recently, splicing of elncRNAs was shown to be associated with elevated enhancer activity. However, whether splicing of elncRNA transcripts is a mere consequence of accessibility at highly active enhancers or if elncRNA splicing directly impacts enhancer function, remains unanswered. We analysed genetically driven changes in elncRNA splicing, in humans, to address this outstanding question. We showed that splicing related motifs within multi-exonic elncRNAs evolved under selective constraints during human evolution, suggesting the processing of these transcripts is unlikely to have resulted from transcription across spurious splice sites. Using a genome-wide and unbiased approach, we used nucleotide variants as independent genetic factors to directly assess the causal relationship that underpin elncRNA splicing and their cognate enhancer activity. We found that the splicing of most elncRNAs is associated with changes in chromatin signatures at cognate enhancers and target mRNA expression. We provide evidence that efficient and conserved processing of enhancer-associated elncRNAs contributes to enhancer activity.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">An empirical examination of customer advocacy influenced by engagement behaviour and predispositions of FinTech customers in India [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The extensive adoption and usage of emerging technologies furthered by the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has reduced direct face to face communications. New FinTech (financial technology) apps and technologies are flooding the Indian digital payments market and competitors are striving hard to attract and retain their customers. Especially when customer engagement behaviours (CEBs) are digital in nature, it is essential to gauge the intrinsically driven customer motivations which drive a positive CEB. The objective of this paper was to empirically test the influence of customer-based antecedents such as emotions, moral identity, self-concept, communal focus, perceived cost and perceived benefits on non-transactional experiential customer engagement behaviours (CEBs) and CEB’s effect on customer advocacy in the FinTech industry. Methods: Data from 380 financial app users in south India were gathered by administering a survey that captured customer predispositions, CEBs, and customer advocacy. Structural equation modelling (SEM) using smart PLS (partial least squares) 3.0 was applied to test the theoretical model. Results: Results indicate that CEB fully mediates the relationship between self-concept and customer advocacy. The positive CEBs get formed through customer predispositions leading to referral/advocacy behaviours. Conclusions: This paper provides directions for FinTech practitioners, marketers, technologists, and academicians to devise marketing strategies customized to customer needs and factors. This is one of the first research studies to demonstrate and empirically validate the CEB model for the FinTech industry during the COVID-19 pandemic.

                Background: Extreme poverty can result in people barely surviving with poor living standards to the extent of living on the streets, often in fear. With limited access to healthcare services and a clean environment, they are more vulnerable to life adversities. Highly stressful living conditions like these can cause mental illnesses such as depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, psychological distress, and others. Purpose: This research aimed to investigate factors that led to the development of mental illness among homeless people under extreme poverty. Design/methodology/approach: This was a qualitative case study that involved a face-to-face interview with a key informant at the Pertubuhan Kebajikan Villa Harapan Melaka (Villa Harapan). Villa Harapan is a licensed caretaker centre established by the Department of Welfare, Melaka that provides shelter to homeless people with mental illness. Findings: Homeless people suffered from mental disturbances due to loss of jobs, lack of income, broken families, separation from their children, and other vulnerabilities. They are not getting appropriate care and attention for their problem and sickness. Non-supportive family, extreme poverty, and chronic stress were the main factors that led to mental illness among Villa Harapan residents. Research limitations: The study focused on the mental illness of dispossessed people who were brought to Villa Harapan by the Welfare Department. Originality/value: This was an empirical case study on mental illness among homeless people at a care centre known as Villa Harapan.

                Background: Baylor College of Medicine provides a classroom-based implicit bias workshop to all third-year medical students to increase students’ awareness of their unconscious bias and develop strategies for reducing health care disparities. The workshop meets our immediate goals and objectives. However, we are unsure if the benefit would be long-term or diminish over time. Methods: To examine the concept retention from the implicit bias classroom workshop, we administered a self-developed seven-item seven-point Likert-scale survey to our medical students at pre-, post-, and one-year post-workshop attendance. Results: The data set was comprised of survey results from two cohorts of our third and fourth-year medical students from 2018 to 2020 and included 289 completed records at three measurement points. The data included: Student Identifiers, Sex, Race/Ethnicity, Student Enrollment Type, Cohort, and three repeated measures results for each of the seven items, which were documented in wide format. The data may be of interest to those who wish to examine how factors including elapsed time, race, and sex may associate with attitudes and understandings of implicit bias following related training, and those interested in analytical methods on longitudinal research in general.

                Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a major public health crisis worldwide. In less than 12 months since the World Health Organization declared the outbreak, several different COVID-19 vaccines have been approved and deployed mostly in developed countries since January 2021. However, hesitancy to accept the newly developed vaccines is a well-known public health challenge that needs to be addressed. The aim of this study was to measure willingness and hesitancy toward COVID-19 vaccines among health care practitioners' (HCPs) in Saudi Arabia.   Methods: A cross-sectional study using an online self-reported survey was conducted among HCPs in Saudi Arabia between April 4th to April 25th 2021 using snowball sampling. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to identify the possible factors affecting HCPs’ willingness and hesitancy to receive COVID-19 vaccines.   Results: Out of 776 participants who started the survey, 505 (65%) completed it and were included in the results. Among all HCPs, 47 (9.3%) either said “no” to receive the vaccine [20 (4%)] or were hesitant to receive it [27 (5.3%)]. Of the total number of the HCPs, 376 (74.5%) already received the COVID-19 vaccine, and 48 (9.50%) were registered to receive it. The main reason of agreement to receive the COVID-19 vaccine was “wanting to protect self and others from getting the infection” (24%).   Conclusion: Our findings have shown that hesitancy toward receiving COVID-19 vaccines among HCPs in Saudi Arabia is limited and therefore may not be a serious issue. The outcomes of this study may help to understand factors that lead to vaccine hesitancy in Saudi Arabia and help public health authorities to design targeted health education interventions aiming to increase uptake of these vaccines.

                Introduction: Acne is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the pilosebaceous unit with differential pathogenesis. To elucidate the roles of hormones in acne pathogenesis, we conducted a study to evaluate the serum testosterone, estradiol, progesterone levels in women with acne vulgaris. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study, and 175 women with acne vulgaris were examined; their serum estradiol, progesterone, testosterone were analyzed by chemiluminescence technique and compared with the healthy control group. Results: Increased serum hormone levels in women with acne vulgaris were accounted for 29.7%, and hyperandrogenism was accounted for 16.0% of cases. We found significant differences in testosterone levels (mean value, 55.67±25.56 versus 38.37±10.16 ng/dL, p<0.05) respectively in the acne group and the control group. However, the estradiol level of the acne group (323.15±93.31 pmol/L) was lower than the control group (370.94±58.88 pmol/L) with p<0.05). No statistically significant differences were found for progesterone (0.60±0.38 versus 0.50±0.15 ng/mL, p>0.05) levels. Moreover, we did not find the relationship between serum hormone levels and the severity of acne vulgaris. Conclusion: This study showed that the female acne vulgaris patients may have high serum testosterone levels and low serum estradiol levels compared with those of female controls. However, hormone alterations had no correlation with the acne grades.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effect of whitening toothpaste on surface roughness and microhardness of human teeth: a systematic review and meta-analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Whitening toothpastes exert a whitening effect on teeth through higher surface cleaning effectiveness resulting from the abrasive properties of the paste or specific chemical components. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conceptualized to examine the relationship between whitening toothpastes and surface roughness as well as microhardness of human teeth and to clarify the evidence base available around this relationship by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies in this topic area, looking at in vitro randomized control trials. Methods: Criteria for including studies in the review were done based on population, intervention, comparison, outcomes and study and studies were identified from electronic databases. Covidence® was used for data screening and data extraction. The CONSORT tool was used for checking relevant content and methodology used in each of the papers reviewed. Systematic review was done followed by meta-analysis, using Review Manager. Results: A total of 125 articles were obtained on key word search. After duplicate removal and title screening, 17 articles were eligible for full text review. Finally, 7 studies were included for systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted on 4 studies. The forest plot for surface roughness showed that that the meta-analytic effect was statistically significant with surface roughness value being higher in the intervention group. The forest plot for microhardness showed that the meta-analytic effect was statistically significant with the microhardness value being lesser in the intervention group. Conclusions: Although whitening toothpastes typically can lighten tooth color by about one or two shades, there is some evidence to show that these toothpastes also affect the mineral content of teeth by increasing surface roughness and reducing microhardness. More evidence and further research are needed to identify the type of whitening agent which will whiten the tooth effectively while maintaining the integrity of the tooth structure.

                McCubbrey et al. show that efferocytosis elicits accumulation of intracellular polyamines, spermidine and spermine, in engulfing macrophages. Efferocytosis does not increase polyamine synthesis but triggers endocytic import of polyamines. Blocking endocytic import prevents polyamine accumulation after efferocytosis and reduces the ability of efferocytosis to suppress IL-1β and IL-6.

                Kusi et al. show that the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) initiates cell-level epigenome fluctuations in the chromatin regulatory landscape, accompanied by loss of lineage fidelity.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Seipin localizes at endoplasmic-reticulum-mitochondria contact sites to control mitochondrial calcium import and metabolism in adipocytes</a></h4>

              
                Combot et al. demonstrate that seipin is enriched at ER-mitochondria contact sites and that seipin deficiency leads to defective mitochondrial calcium import accompanied by a reduction in ATP production. In mice, inducible seipin deletion from adipocytes leads to early mitochondrial dysfunction, which probably contributes to the pathogenesis of seipin-related lipodystrophy.

                Using the highly diverse bacterial flagellin gene as the marker in long-read sequencing, Hu et al. develop a protocol for profiling strain composition in microbiomes at a high resolution and illuminate detailed population structure and major E. coli strain turnover in human gut.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Mice hypomorphic for Pitx3 show robust entrainment of circadian behavioral and metabolic rhythms to scheduled feeding</a></h4>

              
                Scarpa et al. demonstrate that, despite what had been reported by Del Río-Martín et al. (2019), Pitxak mutant mice do indeed entrain behavior and metabolism to scheduled feeding. Key methodological differences between these studies are discussed, and long-term, calorie-restricted feeding conditions are essential for proper visualization of behavioral entrainment to scheduled feeding. It is remarkable that, despite having so few dopamine neurons in their substantia nigra and almost completely lacking lenses and retinal function, the Pitx3ak mutants can maintain circadian rhythms and entrain to feeding.

                Fernández-Pérez et al. respond to the Matters Arising article by Scarpa et al., published concurrently in Cell Reports, and report defective dopamine innervation in Pitx3ak mice and confirm resistance of cyclic behavioral and metabolic outputs to entrainment by time-restricted feeding. Differences including the introduction of calorie restriction and exercise may account for discrepant results between both studies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Stable flow-induced expression of KLK10 inhibits endothelial inflammation and atherosclerosis</a></h4>

              
                Atherosclerosis preferentially occurs in arterial regions exposed to disturbed blood flow (<i>d-flow</i>), while regions exposed to stable flow (<i>s-flow</i>) are protected. The proatherogenic and atheroprotective effects of <i>d-flow</i> and <i>s-flow</i> are mediated in part by the global changes in endothelial cell gene expression, which regulates endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and atherosclerosis. Previously, we identified Kallikrein-Related Peptidase 10 (<i>Klk10</i>, a secreted serine protease) as a flow-sensitive gene in mouse arterial endothelial cells, but its role in endothelial biology and atherosclerosis was unknown. Here, we show that KLK10 is upregulated under <i>s-flow </i>conditions and downregulated under <i>d-flow </i>conditions using <i>in vivo&amp; </i>mouse models and <i>in vitro</i> studies with cultured endothelial cells (ECs). Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and scATAC sequencing (scATACseq) study using the partial carotid ligation mouse model showed flow-regulated <i>Klk10</i> expression at the epigenomic and transcription levels. Functionally, KLK10 protected against <i>d-flow</i>-induced permeability dysfunction and inflammation in human artery ECs (HAECs), as determined by NFkB activation, expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) and intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), and monocyte adhesion. Further, treatment of mice <i>in vivo</i> with rKLK10 decreased arterial endothelial inflammation in <i>d-flow</i> regions. Additionally, rKLK10 injection or ultrasound-mediated transfection of <i>Klk10</i>-expressing plasmids inhibited atherosclerosis in <i>Apoe</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Moreover, KLK10 expression was significantly reduced in human coronary arteries with advanced atherosclerotic plaques compared to those with less severe plaques. KLK10 is a flow-sensitive endothelial protein that serves as an anti-inflammatory, barrier-protective, and anti-atherogenic factor.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Comment on ‘SARS-CoV-2 suppresses anticoagulant and fibrinolytic gene expression in the lung’</a></h4>

              
                Mast et al. analyzed transcriptome data derived from RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of COVID-19 patient bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples, as compared to BALF RNA-seq samples from a study investigating microbiome and inflammatory interactions in obese and asthmatic adults (Mast et al., 2021). Based on their analysis of these data, Mast et al. concluded that mRNA expression of key regulators of the extrinsic coagulation cascade and fibrinolysis were significantly reduced in COVID-19 patients. Notably, they reported that the expression of the extrinsic coagulation cascade master regulator Tissue Factor (F3) remained unchanged, while there was an 8-fold upregulation of its cognate inhibitor Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI). From this they conclude that “pulmonary fibrin deposition does not stem from enhanced local [tissue factor] production and that counterintuitively, COVID-19 may dampen [tissue factor]-dependent mechanisms in the lungs”. They also reported decreased Activated Protein C (aPC) mediated anticoagulant activity and major increases in fibrinogen expression and other key regulators of clot formation. Many of these results are contradictory to findings in most of the field, particularly the findings regarding extrinsic coagulation cascade mediated coagulopathies. Here, we present a complete re-analysis of the data sets analyzed by Mast et al. This re-analysis demonstrates that the two data sets utilized were not comparable between one another, and that the COVID-19 sample set was not suitable for the transcriptomic analysis Mast et al. performed. We also identified other significant flaws in the design of their retrospective analysis, such as poor-quality control and filtering standards. Given the issues with the datasets and analysis, their conclusions are not supported.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Humans optimally anticipate and compensate for an uneven step during walking</a></h4>

              
                The simple task of walking up a sidewalk curb is actually a dynamic prediction task. The curb is a disturbance that could cause a loss of momentum if not anticipated and compensated for. It might be possible to adjust momentum sufficiently to ensure undisturbed time of arrival, but there are infinite possible ways to do so. Much of steady, level gait is determined by energy economy, which should be at least as important with terrain disturbances. It is, however, unknown whether economy also governs walking up a curb, and whether anticipation helps. Here we show that humans compensate with an anticipatory pattern of forward speed adjustments, predicted by a criterion of minimizing mechanical energy input. The strategy is mechanistically predicted by optimal control for a simple model of bipedal walking dynamics, with each leg's push-off work as input. Optimization predicts a tri-phasic trajectory of speed (and thus momentum) adjustments, including an anticipatory phase. In experiment, human subjects ascend an artificial curb with the predicted tri-phasic trajectory, which approximately conserves overall walking speed relative to undisturbed flat ground. The trajectory involves speeding up in a few steps before the curb, losing considerable momentum from ascending it, and then regaining speed in a few steps thereafter. Descending the curb entails a nearly opposite, but still anticipatory, speed fluctuation trajectory, in agreement with model predictions that speed fluctuation amplitudes should scale linearly with curb height. The fluctuation amplitudes also decrease slightly with faster average speeds, also as predicted by model. Humans can reason about the dynamics of walking to plan anticipatory and economical control, even with a sidewalk curb in the way.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Assessment of neurovascular coupling and cortical spreading depression in mixed mouse models of atherosclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease</a></h4>

              
                Neurovascular coupling is a critical brain mechanism whereby changes to blood flow accompany localised neural activity. The breakdown of neurovascular coupling is linked to the development and progression of several neurological conditions including dementia. In this study, we examined cortical haemodynamics in mouse preparations that modelled Alzheimer’s disease (J20-AD) and atherosclerosis (PCSK9-ATH) between 9 and 12 m of age. We report novel findings with atherosclerosis where neurovascular decline is characterised by significantly reduced blood volume, altered levels of oxyhaemoglobin and deoxyhaemoglobin, in addition to global neuroinflammation. In the comorbid mixed model (J20-PCSK9-MIX), we report a 3 x increase in hippocampal amyloid-beta plaques. A key finding was that cortical spreading depression (CSD) due to electrode insertion into the brain was worse in the diseased animals and led to a prolonged period of hypoxia. These findings suggest that systemic atherosclerosis can be detrimental to neurovascular health and that having cardiovascular comorbidities can exacerbate pre-existing Alzheimer’s-related amyloid-plaques.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Allele-specific endogenous tagging and quantitative analysis of β-catenin in colorectal cancer cells</a></h4>

              
                Wnt signaling plays important roles in development, homeostasis, and tumorigenesis. Mutations in β-catenin that activate Wnt signaling have been found in colorectal and hepatocellular carcinomas. However, the dynamics of wild-type and mutant forms of β-catenin are not fully understood. Here, we genome-engineered fluorescently tagged alleles of endogenous β-catenin in a colorectal cancer cell line. Wild-type and oncogenic mutant alleles were tagged with different fluorescent proteins, enabling the analysis of both variants in the same cell. We analyzed the properties of both β-catenin alleles using immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy approaches, revealing distinctly different biophysical properties. In addition, activation of Wnt signaling by treatment with a GSK3β inhibitor or a truncating <i>APC</i> mutation modulated the wild-type allele to mimic the properties of the mutant β-catenin allele. The one-step tagging strategy demonstrates how genome engineering can be employed for the parallel functional analysis of different genetic variants.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Directed evolution of the rRNA methylating enzyme Cfr reveals molecular basis of antibiotic resistance</a></h4>

              
                Alteration of antibiotic binding sites through modification of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a common form of resistance to ribosome-targeting antibiotics. The rRNA-modifying enzyme Cfr methylates an adenosine nucleotide within the peptidyl transferase center, resulting in the C-8 methylation of A2503 (m<sup>8</sup>A2503). Acquisition of <i>cfr</i> results in resistance to eight classes of ribosome-targeting antibiotics. Despite the prevalence of this resistance mechanism, it is poorly understood whether and how bacteria modulate Cfr methylation to adapt to antibiotic pressure. Moreover, direct evidence for how m<sup>8</sup>A2503 alters antibiotic binding sites within the ribosome is lacking. In this study, we performed directed evolution of Cfr under antibiotic selection to generate Cfr variants that confer increased resistance by enhancing methylation of A2503 in cells. Increased rRNA methylation is achieved by improved expression and stability of Cfr through transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms, which may be exploited by pathogens under antibiotic stress as suggested by natural isolates. Using a variant that achieves near-stoichiometric methylation of rRNA, we determined a 2.2 Å cryo-electron microscopy structure of the Cfr-modified ribosome. Our structure reveals the molecular basis for broad resistance to antibiotics and will inform the design of new antibiotics that overcome resistance mediated by Cfr.

Here we show, using a hamster model, that the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to an acute inflammatory response and lung pathologies, while the late phase of infection causes cardiovascular complications (CVC) characterized by ventricular wall thickening associated with increased ventricular mass/ body mass ratio and interstitial coronary fibrosis. Molecular profiling further substantiated our findings of CVC, as SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters showed elevated levels of serum cardiac Troponin-I (cTnI), cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and long-chain fatty acid triglycerides. Serum metabolomics profiling of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters identified N-acetylneuraminate, a functional metabolite found to be associated with CVC, as a metabolic marker was found to be common between SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters and COVID-19 patients. Together, we propose hamsters as a suitable animal model to study post-COVID sequelae associated with CVC which could be extended to therapeutic interventions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Clathrin-independent endocytic retrieval of SV proteins mediated by the clathrin adaptor AP-2 at mammalian central synapses</a></h4>

              
                Neurotransmission is based on the exocytic fusion of synaptic vesicles (SVs) followed by endocytic membrane retrieval and the reformation of SVs. Conflicting models have been proposed regarding the mechanisms of SV endocytosis, most notably clathrin/adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2)-mediated endocytosis and clathrin-independent ultrafast endocytosis. Partitioning between these pathways has been suggested to be controlled by temperature and stimulus paradigm. We report on the comprehensive survey of six major SV proteins to show that SV endocytosis in mouse hippocampal neurons at physiological temperature occurs independent of clathrin while the endocytic retrieval of a subset of SV proteins including the vesicular transporters for glutamate and GABA depend on sorting by the clathrin adaptor AP-2. Our findings highlight a clathrin-independent role of the clathrin adaptor AP-2 in the endocytic retrieval of select SV cargos from the presynaptic cell surface and suggest a revised model for the endocytosis of SV membranes at mammalian central synapses.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Aging is associated with increased brain iron through cortex-derived hepcidin expression</a></h4>

              
                Iron is an essential molecule for biological processes, but its accumulation can lead to oxidative stress and cellular death. Due to its oxidative effects, iron accumulation is implicated in the process of aging and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanism for this increase in iron with aging, and whether this increase is localized to specific cellular compartment(s), are not known. Here, we measured the levels of iron in different tissues of aged mice, and demonstrated that while cytosolic non-heme iron is increased in the liver and muscle tissue, only the aged brain cortex exhibits an increase in both the cytosolic and mitochondrial non-heme iron. This increase in brain iron is associated with elevated levels of local hepcidin mRNA and protein in the brain. We also demonstrate that the increase in hepcidin is associated with increased ubiquitination and reduced levels of the only iron exporter, ferroportin-1 (FPN1). Overall, our studies provide a potential mechanism for iron accumulation in the brain through increased local expression of hepcidin, and subsequent iron accumulation due to decreased iron export. Additionally, our data support that aging is associated with mitochondrial and cytosolic iron accumulation only in the brain and not in other tissues.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">ACE2 pathway regulates thermogenesis and energy metabolism</a></h4>

              
                Identification of key regulators of energy homeostasis holds important therapeutic promise for metabolic disorders, such as obesity and diabetes. ACE2 cleaves angiotensin II (Ang II) to generate Ang-(1-7) which acts mainly through the Mas1 receptor. Here, we identify ACE2 pathway as a critical regulator in the maintenance of thermogenesis and energy expenditure. We found that ACE2 is highly expressed in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and that cold stimulation increases ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) levels in BAT and serum. <i>Ace2</i> knockout mice (<i>Ace2<sup>-/y</sup></i>) and <i>Mas1</i> knockout mice (<i>Mas1<sup>-/-</sup></i>) displayed impaired thermogenesis. Mice transplanted with brown adipose tissue from <i>Mas1</i><sup>-/-</sup> display metabolic abnormalities consistent with those seen in the <i>Ace2</i> and <i>Mas1</i> knockout mice. In contrast, impaired thermogenesis of <i>Lepr<sup>db/db</sup></i> obese diabetic mice and high-fat diet-induced obese mice were ameliorated by overexpression of <i>Ace2</i> or continuous infusion of Ang-(1-7). Activation of ACE2 pathway was associated with improvement of metabolic parameters, including blood glucose, lipids and energy expenditure in multiple animal models. Consistently, ACE2 pathway remarkably enhanced the browning of white adipose tissue. Mechanistically, we showed that ACE2 pathway activated Akt/FoxO1 and PKA pathway, leading to induction of UCP1 and activation of mitochondrial function. Our data propose that adaptive thermogenesis requires regulation of ACE2 pathway and highlight novel potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of metabolic disorders.

                Parkinson's Disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic cells of the substantia nigra pars compacta . Even though successful transplantation of dopamine-producing cells into the striatum exhibits favourable effects in animal models and clinical trials; transplanted cell survival is low. Since every transplant elicits an inflammatory response which can affect cell survival and differentiation, we aimed to study in vivo and in vitro the impact of the pro-inflammatory environment on human dopaminergic precursors. We first observed that transplanted human dopaminergic precursors into the striatum of immunosuppressed rats elicited an early and sustained activation of astroglial and microglial cells after 15 days post-transplant. This long-lasting response was associated with Tumor necrosis factor alpha expression in microglial cells. In vitro conditioned media from activated BV2 microglial cells increased cell death, decreased Tyrosine hydroxylase -positive cells and induced morphological alterations on human neural stem cells-derived dopaminergic precursors at two differentiation stages: 19 days and 28 days. Those effects were ameliorated by inhibition of Tumor necrosis factor alpha, a cytokine which was previously detected in vivo and in conditioned media from activated BV-2 cells. Our results suggest that a pro-inflammatory environment is sustained after transplantation under immunosuppression, providing a window of opportunity to modify this response to increase transplant survival and differentiation. In addition, our data show that the microglia-derived pro-inflammatory microenvironment has a negative impact on survival and differentiation of dopaminergic precursors. Finally, Tumor necrosis factor alpha plays a key role in these effects, suggesting that this cytokine could be an interesting target to increase the efficacy of human dopaminergic precursors transplantation in Parkinson's Disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Altered retinal structure and function in Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3</a></h4>

              
                Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of a polyglutamine (polyQ)-encoding CAG repeat in the ATXN3 gene. Because the ATXN3 protein regulates photoreceptor ciliogenesis and phagocytosis, we aimed to explore whether expanded polyQ ATXN3 impacts retinal function and integrity in SCA3 patients and transgenic mice. We evaluated the retinal structure and function in five patients with Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 and in a transgenic mouse model of this disease (YACMJD84.2, Q84) using, respectively, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and electroretinogram (ERG). We further determined in the transgenic mice: a) the retinal expression pattern of ATXN3 and assessed the distribution of cones and rods by immunofluorescence (IF); and b) the retinal ultrastructure by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Some patients with Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 in our cohort revealed: i) reduced central macular thickness indirectly correlated with disease duration; ii) decreased thickness of the macula and the ganglion cell layer, and reduced macula volume inversely correlated with disease severity (SARA score); and iii) electrophysiological dysfunction of cones, rods, and inner retinal cells. Transgenic mice replicated the human OCT and ERG findings with aged homozygous Q84/Q84 mice showing a stronger phenotype accompanied by further thinning of the outer nuclear layer and photoreceptor layer and highly reduced cone and rod activities, thus supporting severe retinal dysfunction in these mice. In addition, Q84 mice showed progressive accumulation of ATXN3-positive aggregates throughout several retinal layers and depletion of cones alongside the disease course. TEM analysis of aged Q84/Q84 mouse retinas supported the IF ATXN3 aggregation findings by revealing the presence of high number of negative electron dense puncta in ganglion cells, inner plexiform and inner nuclear layers, and further showed thinning of the outer plexiform layer, thickening of the retinal pigment epithelium and elongation of apical microvilli. Our results indicate that retinal alterations detected by non-invasive eye examination using OCT and ERG could represent a biological marker of disease progression and severity in patients with Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Efficient coding of natural scenes improves neural system identification</a></h4>

              
                Neural system identification aims at learning the response function of neurons to arbitrary stimuli using experimentally recorded data, but typically does not leverage coding principles such as efficient coding of natural environments. Visual systems, however, have evolved to efficiently process input from the natural environment. Here, we present a normative network regularization for system identification models by incorporating, as a regularizer, the efficient coding hypothesis, which states that neural response properties of sensory representations are strongly shaped by the need to preserve most of the stimulus information with limited resources. Using this approach, we explored if a system identification model can be improved by sharing its convolutional filters with those of an autoencoder which aims to efficiently encode natural stimuli. To this end, we built a hybrid model to predict the responses of retinal neurons to noise stimuli. This approach did not only yield a higher performance than the stand-alone system identification model, it also produced more biologically-plausible filters. We found these results to be consistent for retinal responses to different stimuli and across model architectures. Moreover, our normatively regularized model performed particularly well in predicting responses of direction-of-motion sensitive retinal neurons. In summary, our results support the hypothesis that efficiently encoding environmental inputs can improve system identification models of early visual processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Humanized CYP2C19 transgenic mouse as an animal model of cerebellar ataxia</a></h4>

              
                Background: Animal models are essential for understanding etiology and pathophysiology of movement disorders. Previously, we have found that mice transgenic for the human CYP2C19 gene, expressed in the liver and developing brain, exhibit altered neurodevelopment associated with impairments of their motor function and emotionality. Objectives: To characterize motoric phenotype of the CYP2C19 transgenic mice and validate its usefulness as an animal model of ataxia. Methods: The rotarod and beam-walking tests were utilized to quantify the functional alterations induced by motoric phenotype. Dopaminergic system was assessed by tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry and by chromatographic quantification of the whole-brain dopamine levels. Beam-walking test was also repeated after the treatment with the dopamine receptor antagonists, ecopipam and raclopride. The volumes of 20 brain regions in the CYP2C19 transgenic mice and controls were quantified by 9.4T gadolinium-enhanced postmortem structural neuroimaging. Results: CYP2C19 transgenic mice were found to exhibit abnormal, unilateral ataxia-like gait, clasping reflex and 5.6-fold more paw-slips using the beam-walking test (p<0.0001, n=89); the phenotype was more pronounced in younger animals. Hyperdopaminergism was observed in the CYP2C19 mice; however, the motoric impairment was not ameliorated by dopamine receptor antagonists and there was also no midbrain dopamine neuron loss in CYP2C19 mice. However, in these mice, cerebellar volume was drastically decreased (-11.8% [95%CI: -14.7, -9.0], q<0.0001, n=59), whereas a moderate decrease in hippocampal volume was observed (-4.2% [95%CI: -6.4%, -1.9%], q=0.015, n=59). Conclusions: Humanized CYP2C19 transgenic mice exhibit altered motoric function and functional motoric impairments; this phenotype is likely caused by an aberrant cerebellar development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Local interactions between steady-state visually evoked potentials at nearby flickering frequencies</a></h4>

              
                Steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) are widely used to index top-down cognitive processing in human electroencephalogram (EEG) studies. Typically, two stimuli flickering at different temporal frequencies (TFs) are presented, each producing a distinct response in the EEG at its flicker frequency. However, how SSVEP responses in EEG are modulated in the presence of a competing flickering stimulus just due to sensory interactions is not well understood. We have previously shown in local field potentials (LFP) recorded from awake monkeys that when two overlapping full screen gratings are counter-phased at different TFs, there is an asymmetric SSVEP response suppression, with greater suppression from lower TFs, which further depends on the relative orientations of the gratings (stronger suppression and asymmetry for parallel compared to orthogonal gratings). Here, we first confirmed these effects in both male and female human EEG recordings. Then, we mapped the response suppression of one stimulus (target) by a competing stimulus (mask) over a much wider range than the previous study. Surprisingly, we found that the suppression was not stronger at low frequencies in general, but systematically varied depending on the target TF, indicating local interactions between the two competing stimuli. These results were confirmed in both human EEG and monkey LFP and electrocorticogram (ECoG) data. Our results show that sensory interactions between multiple SSVEPs are more complex than shown previously and are influenced by both local and global factors, underscoring the need to cautiously interpret the results of studies involving SSVEP paradigms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Atlasing white matter and grey matter joint contributions to resting-state networks in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Over the past two decades, the study of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has revealed the existence of multiple brain areas displaying synchronous functional blood oxygen level-dependent signals (BOLD) - resting-state networks (RSNs). The variation in functional connectivity between the different areas of a resting-state network or between multiple networks, have been extensively studied and linked to cognitive states and pathologies. However, the white matter connections supporting each network remain only partially described. In this work, we developed a data-driven method to systematically map the white and grey matter contributing to resting-state networks. Using the Human Connectome Project, we generated an atlas of 30 resting-state networks, each with two maps: white matter and grey matter. By integrating structural and functional neuroimaging data, this method builds an atlas that unlocks the joint anatomical exploration of white and grey matter to resting-state networks. The method also allows highlighting the overlap between networks, which revealed that most (89%) of the brain's white matter is shared amongst multiple networks, with 16% shared by at least 7 resting-state networks. These overlaps, especially the existence of regions shared by numerous networks, suggest that white matter lesions in these areas might strongly impact the correlations and the communication within resting-state networks. We provide an open-source software to explore the joint contribution of white and grey matter to RSNs and facilitate the study of the impact of white matter damage on RSNs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A theory of cortical map formation in the visual brain</a></h4>

              
                The cerebral cortex receives multiple afferents from the thalamus that segregate by stimulus modality forming cortical maps for each sense. In vision, the primary visual cortex also maps the multiple dimensions of the stimulus in patterns that vary across species for reasons unknown. Here we introduce a general theory of cortical map formation, which proposes that map diversity emerges from variations in sampling density of sensory space across species. In the theory, increasing afferent sampling density enlarges the cortical domains representing the same visual point allowing the segregation of afferents and cortical targets by additional stimulus dimensions. We illustrate the theory with a computational model that accurately replicates the maps of different species through afferent segregation followed by thalamocortical convergence pruned by visual experience. Because thalamocortical pathways use similar mechanisms for axon sorting and pruning, the theory may extend to other sensory areas of the mammalian brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Establishment of a hypoxia ischemia reperfusion brain damagemodel in neonatal rats</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Rice-Vannucci model has been widely used as HIE(Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy ) animal model in the past forty years, but it does not mimic reperfusion injury that occurs during HIE. The aim of the present study was to establish a new neonatal rat model by simulating hypoxia ischemia reperfusion brain damage (HIRBD) through "common carotid artery (CCA) muscle bridge". Methods: Sixty 7-day-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to group A (HIRBD groups, n=36), group B (Rice-Vannucci group, n=12), and group C (sham-operated group, n=12). Rats in group A were assigned to 3 subgroups (A1-A3, 12 animals/subgroup). Dynamic changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) were evaluated by the laser speckle imaging system. The status of the CCA was observed under a stereomicroscope. Changes in body weight, gross morphology as well as pathological sections of brain tissue were examined to evaluate the feasibility of the model. Results: The results indicated that CCA muscle bridge successfully blocked the CBF. CBF was restored after removal of the CCA muscle bridge in HIRBD groups. The CCA was in good condition after removing the muscle bridge, and blood supply was not affected. Changes in body weight, gross morphology and pathological sections of brain tissue indicated that ischemia reperfusion induced by the CCA muscle bridge method caused varying degrees of brain damage. Conclusion: CCA muscle bridge method is effective for establishing a reliable, stable, and reproducible neonatal rat model for study of HIRBD.

                Stress is an unavoidable condition in human life. Stressful events experienced during development, including in utero, have been suggested as one major pathophysiological mechanism for developing vulnerability towards neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders in adulthood. One cardinal feature of such disorders is impaired cognitive ability, which may in part rely on abnormal structure and function of the hippocampus. In the hippocampus, the dentate gyrus is a site of continuous neurogenesis, a process that has been recently implicated in spatial pattern separation, a cognitive phenomenon that serves to reduce the degree of overlap in the incoming information to facilitate its storage with minimal interference. We previously reported that adult neurogenesis is altered by prenatal stress allowing us to hypothesize that prenatal stress may possibly lead to impairment in pattern separation. To test this hypothesis, both control (C) and prenatally stressed (PS) adult mice were tested for metric and contextual discrimination abilities. We report for the first time that prenatal stress impairs pattern separation process, a deficit that may underlie their cognitive alterations and that may result in defective behaviors reminiscent of psychiatric illness such as post-traumatic stress disorder.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A striatal plasticity that supports the long-term preservation of motor function in Parkinsonian mice.</a></h4>

              
                Motor deficits of Parkinsons disease (PD) such as rigidity, bradykinesia and akinesia result from a progressive loss of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons. No therapies exist that slow their degeneration and the most effective treatments for the motor symptoms: L-dopa -the precursor to dopamine, and deep brain stimulation can produce dyskinesias and are highly invasive, respectively. Hence, alternative strategies targeted to slow the progression or delay the onset of motor symptoms are still highly sought. Here we report the identification of a long-term striatal plasticity mechanism that delays for several months, the onset of motor deficits in a mouse PD model. Specifically, we show that a one-week transient daily elevation of midbrain dopamine neuron activity during depletion preserves the connectivity of direct but not indirect pathway projection neurons. The findings are consistent with the balance theory of striatal output pathways and suggest a novel approach for treating the motor symptoms of PD.

                Sudden unexpected death of epilepsy (SUDEP) is the key cause of of death in patients with epilepsy. Due to the complicated pathogenesis of SUDEP, however, the exact mechanism of SUDEP remains elusive. Currently, although it is recognized that the seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) may be a main cause for SUDEP, other factors resulting in SUDEP can not be excluded e.g arrhythmias. Our previous findings indicated that the incidence of seizure-induced respiratory arrest S-IRA and SUDEP evoked by acoustic stimulation or pentetrazol (PTZ) injection was significantly reduced by atomoxetine, a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI), suggesting that noradrenergic neurotransmission modulates S-IRA and SUDEP. Given that norepinephrine acts on the central and peripheral target to modulate respiratory and circulation function by targeting adrenergic receptor  and beta (a-AR and {beta}-AR) and the arrhythmias can be contributed to SUDEP. Meanwhile, to further test whether cardiac factors are implicated in S-IRA and SUDEP, we choose esmolol hydrochloride, a selective antagonist of beta-1 adrenergic receptor ({beta}1-AR) to test it in our models. Our findings demonstrated that the lower incidence of S-IRA and SUDEP evoked by acoustic stimulation in DBA/1 mice by administration with atomoxetine was significantly reversed by intraperitoneal (IP) of esmolol hydrochloride. Importantly, the data of electrocardiogram (ECG) showed that the cardiac arrhythmia evoked by acoustic stimulation including the ventricular tachycardia, ventricular premature beat and atrioventricular block and administration of atomoxetine significantly reduced theses arrhythmias and the incidence of S-IRA and SUDEP in our models. Thus, the dysfunction of respiratory and circulation may be implicated in the pathogenesis of S-IRA and SUDEP hand in hand and enhancing central norepinephrinergic neurotransmission contributes to inhibition of seizure-induced respiratory arrest by targeting {beta}1-AR locating in the cardiomyocytes. Our findings will show a new light on decoding the pathogenesis of SUDEP.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Short periods of bipolar anodal TDCS induce no instantaneous dose-dependent increase in cerebral blood flow in the targeted human motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                Background: Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (aTDCS) of primary motor hand area (M1-HAND) can enhance corticomotor excitability. Yet, it is still unknown which current intensity produces the strongest effect on regional neural activity. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combined with pseudo-continuous Arterial Spin Labeling (pc-ASL MRI) can map regional cortical blood flow (rCBF) and may thus be useful to probe the relationship between current intensity and neural response at the individual level. Objective: Here we employed pc-ASL MRI to map acute rCBF changes during short-duration aTDCS of left M1-HAND. Using the rCBF response as a proxy for regional neuronal activity, we investigated if short-duration aTDCS produces an instantaneous dose-dependent rCBF increase in the targeted M1-HAND that may be useful for individual dosing. Methods: Nine healthy right-handed participants received 30 seconds of aTDCS at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mA with the anode placed over left M1-HAND and cathode over the right supraorbital region. Concurrent pc-ASL MRI at 3 T probed TDCS-related rCBF changes in the targeted M1-HAND. Movement-induced rCBF changes were also assessed. Results: Apart from a subtle increase in rCBF at 0.5 mA, short-duration aTDCS did not modulate rCBF in the M1-HAND relative to no-stimulation periods. None of the participants showed a dose-dependent increase in rCBF during aTDCS, even after accounting for individual differences in TDCS-induced electrical field strength. In contrast, finger movements led to robust activation of left M1-HAND before and after aTDCS. Conclusion: Short-duration bipolar aTDCS does not produce instantaneous dose-dependent rCBF increases in the targeted M1-HAND at conventional intensity ranges. Therefore, the regional hemodynamic response profile to short-duration aTDCS may not be suited to inform individual dosing of TDCS intensity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Accurate sex classification from neural responses to sexual stimuli</a></h4>

              
                Sex differences in brain activity evoked by sexual stimuli remain elusive despite robust evidence for stronger enjoyment of and interest towards sexual stimuli in men than in women. To test whether visual sexual stimuli evoke different brain activity patterns in men and women, we measured haemodynamic brain activity induced by visual sexual stimuli in two experiments in 91 subjects (46 males). In one experiment, the subjects viewed sexual and non-sexual film clips and dynamic annotations for nudity in the clips was used to predict their hemodynamic activity. In the second experiment, the subjects viewed sexual and non-sexual pictures in an event-related design. Males showed stronger activation than females in the visual and prefrontal cortices and dorsal attention network in both experiments. Furthermore, using multivariate pattern classification we could accurately predict the sex of the subject on the basis of the brain activity elicited by the sexual stimuli. The classification generalized across the experiments indicating that the sex differences were consistent across the experiments. Eye tracking data obtained from an independent sample of subjects (N = 110) showed that men looked longer than women at the chest area of the nude female actors in the film clips. These results indicate that visual sexual stimuli evoke discernible brain activity patterns in men and women which may reflect stronger attentional engagement with sexual stimuli in men than women.

                Drug addiction is characterized by neuroadaptations in mesocorticolimbic networks regulating reward and inhibitory control. The habenula (Hb) is central to adaptive reward and aversion-driven behaviors, serving as a hub connecting emotion/cognitive processing regions including the prefrontal cortex (PFC). However, its role in human drug addiction has not been fully explored. Using diffusion tractography, we detailed PFC structural connectivity with three regions, namely the Hb, ventral tegmental area (VTA), and anterior thalamus (AT), and quantified the tract-specific microstructural integrity using diffusion tensor imaging within the anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC) in healthy and cocaine-addicted individuals. White matter microstructure in cocaine-addicted individuals was uniquely impaired in PFC-Hb projections in the ALIC, distinguishable from adjacent PFC-VTA and PFC-AT projections, with more pronounced abnormalities in short-term abstinence. These findings extend preclinical evidence of PFC-Hb circuit impairments in addiction and contextualize the plausible existence of a similar PFC-Hb connection in the human brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Experimenter sex modulates mouse biobehavioural and pharmacological responses</a></h4>

              
                Differential rodent responses to the sex of human experimenters could have far reaching consequences in preclinical studies. Here, we show that the sex of human experimenters affects mouse behaviours and responses to the rapid-acting antidepressant ketamine and its bioactive metabolite (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine. We found that mice manifest aversion to human male odours, preference to female odours, and increased susceptibility to stress when handled by male experimenters. This male induced aversion and stress susceptibility is mediated by the activation of brain corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurons projecting from the entorhinal cortrex to hippocampal area CA1. We further establish that exposure to male scent prior to ketamine administration activates CRF neurons projecting from the entorhinal cortex to hippocampus, and that CRF is necessary and sufficient for the in vivo and in vitro actions of ketamine. Further understanding of the specific and quantitative contributions of the sex of human experimenters to different experimental outcomes in rodents may lead not only to reduced heterogeneity between studies, but also increased capability to uncover novel biological mechanisms.

                When viewing the actions of others, we not only see patterns of body movements, but we also "see" the intentions and social relations of people, enabling us to understand the surrounding social environment. Previous research has shown that experienced forensic examiners, Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) operators, convey superior performance in identifying and predicting hostile intentions from surveillance footages than novices. However, it remains largely unknown what visual content CCTV operators actively attend to when viewing surveillance footage, and whether CCTV operators develop different strategies for active information seeking from what novices do. In this study, we conducted computational analysis for the gaze-centered stimuli captured by experienced CCTV operators and novices' eye movements when they viewed the same surveillance footage. These analyses examined how low-level visual features and object-level semantic features contribute to attentive gaze patterns associated with the two groups of participants. Low-level image features were extracted by a visual saliency model, whereas object-level semantic features were extracted by a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), AlexNet, from gaze-centered regions. We found that visual regions attended by CCTV operators versus by novices can be reliably classified by patterns of saliency features and DCNN features. Additionally, CCTV operators showed greater inter-subject correlation in attending to saliency features and DCNN features than did novices. These results suggest that the looking behavior of CCTV operators differs from novices by actively attending to different patterns of saliency and semantic features in both low-level and high-level visual processing. Expertise in selectively attending to informative features at different levels of visual hierarchy may play an important role in facilitating the efficient detection of social relationships between agents and the prediction of harmful intentions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Estradiol mediates stress-susceptibility in the male brain</a></h4>

              
                In susceptible populations, stress is a major risk factor for the development of mental disorders, including depression. Estradiol, often considered a female hormone, is distributed in the male brain via aromatization of testosterone. The role of estrogen receptors (ERs) in male stress susceptibility and depression is not well understood. We found that absence of ER{beta} is associated with susceptibility to stress in male mice and that activity of ER{beta}-projecting neurons from the basolateral amygdala to nucleus accumbens is reduced in hypogonadal mice subjected to stress, while activation of this circuit reverses stress-induced maladaptive behaviors. We identified that absence of estradiol, but not testosterone per se, underlies stress susceptibility and that brain-selective delivery of estradiol prevents the development of depression-related behaviors. Our findings provide evidence for an estrogen-based mechanism underlying stress susceptibility and offer an unexpected therapeutic strategy for treating depression in males.

                The nature and distribution of the synaptic changes that underlie memory are not well understood. We examined the synaptic plasticity behind context fear learning and found that conditioning produced potentiation of excitatory synapses specifically onto the basolateral amygdala neurons activated during learning. This synaptic potentiation lasted at least 7 days, and its disruption impaired memory recall. High frequency optogenetic stimulation of the CS and US-activated ensembles or biochemical induction of synaptic potentiation in US-responsive neurons alone was sufficient to produce a context fear association without prior associative training. These results suggest that plasticity of CS inputs onto US-responsive amygdala neurons is a necessary and sufficient step in forming context fear associations, and that context discrimination is determined by the CS-specific amygdala inputs activated during retrieval.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Long-term two-photon imaging of spinal cord in freely behaving mice</a></h4>

              
                The spinal cord is critical to integrating peripheral information under sensory-guided motor behaviors in health and disease. However, the cellular activity underlie spinal cord function in freely behaving animals is not clear. Here, we developed a new method for imaging the spinal cord at cellular and subcellular resolution over weeks under naturalistic conditions. The method involves an improved surgery to reduce spinal movement, and the installation of a miniaturized two-photon microscope to obtain high-resolution imaging in moving mice. In vivo calcium imaging demonstrated that dorsal horn neurons show a sensorimotor program-dependent synchronization and heterogeneity under distinct cutaneous stimuli in behaving mice. The long-term imaging of sensory neurons revealed that in the spinal cord, healthy mice demonstrated stereotyped responses. However, in a neuropathic pain model, plasticity changes and neuronal sensitization were observed. We provide a practical method to study the function of spinal cord on sensory perception and disorders in freely behaving mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Chronic Ca2+ imaging of cortical neurons with long-term expression of GCaMP-X</a></h4>

              
                Dynamic Ca2+ signals reflect acute changes in membrane excitability (e.g. sensory response), and also mediate intracellular signaling cascades normally of longer time scales (e.g., Ca2+- dependent neuritogenesis). In both cases, chronic Ca2+ imaging has been often desired, but largely hindered by unexpected cytotoxicity intrinsic to GCaMP, a popular series of genetically-encoded Ca2+ indicators. Here, we demonstrate that the recently developed GCaMP-X outperforms GCaMP in long-term probe expression and/or chronic Ca2+ imaging. GCaMP-X shows much improved compatibility with neurons and thus more reliable than GCaMP as demonstrated in vivo by acute Ca2+ responses to whisker deflection or spontaneous Ca2+ fluctuations over an extended time frame. Chronic Ca2+ imaging data ([&ge;]1 month) are acquired from the same set of cultured cortical neurons, unveiling that spontaneous/local Ca2+ activities would progressively develop into autonomous/global Ca2+ oscillations. Besides the morphological indices of neurite length or soma size, the major metrics of oscillatory Ca2+, including rate, amplitude, synchrony among different neurons or organelles have also been examined along with the developmental stages. Both neuritogenesis and Ca2+ signals are dysregulated by GCaMP in virus-infected or transgenic neurons, in direct contrast to GCaMP-X without any noticeable side-effect. Such in vitro data altogether consolidate the unique importance of oscillatory Ca2+ to activity-dependent neuritogenesis, as one major factor responsible for the distinctions between GCaMP vs GCaMP-X in vivo. For the first time with GCaMP-X of long-term expression in neurons, spontaneous and sensory-evoked Ca2+ activities are imaged and evaluated both in vitro and in vivo, providing new opportunities to monitor neural development or other chronic processes concurrently with Ca2+ dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Withdrawal from repeated nicotine vapor exposure increases somatic signs of physical dependence, anxiety-like behavior, and brain reward thresholds in adult male rats.</a></h4>

              
                In recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in nicotine vapor consumption via electronic nicotine delivery systems (i.e., e-cigarettes), particularly in adolescents. While recent work has focused on the health effects of nicotine vapor exposure, its effects on the brain and behavior remain unclear. In this study, we assessed the effects that cessation from repeated nicotine vapor exposure had on behavioral and neuronal measures of withdrawal. For Experiment 1, fifty-six adult male rats were tested for plasma cotinine levels, somatic withdrawal signs, and anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze, immediately following precipitated withdrawal from repeated exposure to 12 or 24 mg/mL nicotine vapor. In Experiment 2, twelve adult male rats were tested for intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) across 14 days of exposure to 24 mg/mL nicotine vapor and across the 14 days immediately following nicotine exposure. Results revealed that plasma cotinine, somatic signs, anxiety-like behavior, and ICSS stimulation thresholds were all observed to be elevated during withdrawal in the 24 mg/mL nicotine group, when compared to vehicle controls (50/50 vegetable glycerin/propylene glycol). The data suggest that cessation from repeated nicotine vapor exposure using our preclinical model leads to nicotine dependence and withdrawal, and demonstrates that the vapor system described in these experiments is a viable pre-clinical model of e-cigarette use in humans. Further characterization of the mechanisms driving nicotine vapor abuse and dependence is needed to improve policies and educational campaigns related to e-cigarette use.

                Differences in the correlated activity of networked brain regions have been reported in individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) but an overreliance on the null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) framework limits the identification and characterization of disorder-relevant relationships. In this preregistered study, we applied a Bayesian statistical framework as well as NHST to the analysis of resting-state fMRI scans from females with GAD and demographically matched healthy comparison females. Eleven a-priori hypotheses about functional correlativity (FC) were evaluated using Bayesian (multilevel model) and frequentist (t-test) inference. Reduced FC between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the posterior-mid insula (PMI) was confirmed by both statistical approaches. FC between the vmPFC-anterior insula, the amygdala-PMI, and the amygdala-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) region pairs did not survive multiple comparison correction using the frequentist approach. However, the Bayesian model provided evidence for these region pairs having decreased FC in the GAD group. Leveraging Bayesian modeling, we demonstrate decreased FC of the vmPFC, insula, amygdala, and dlPFC in females with GAD. Exploiting the Bayesian framework revealed FC abnormalities between region pairs excluded by the frequentist analysis, as well as other previously undescribed regions, demonstrating the benefits of applying this statistical approach to resting state FC data.

                Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) is an electrochemical method used to detect dopamine on a subsecond time scale. Recordings using FSCV in freely behaving animals revolutionized the study of behaviors associated with motivation and learning. Despite this advance, FSCV cannot distinguish between catecholamines, which limits its use to brain regions where dopamine is the predominant neurotransmitter. It has also been difficult to detect dopamine in vivo in some striatal subregions with FSCV. Recently, fluorescent biosensors for dopamine were developed, allowing for discrimination between catecholamines. However, the performance of these biosensors relative to FSCV has not been determined. Thus, we compared fluorescent photometry responses of the dopamine biosensor, dLight, with FSCV. We also used dLight photometry to assess changes in tonic and phasic dopamine, which has not been possible with FSCV. Finally, we examined dopamine dynamics during Pavlovian conditioning in striatal subregions, including the dorsolateral striatum where dopamine measurements are challenging with FSCV.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Thalamo-Prefrontal Connectivity Correlates with Early Command-Following After Severe Traumatic Brain injury</a></h4>

              
                Recovery of consciousness after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is heterogeneous and difficult to predict. Structures such as the thalamus and prefrontal cortex are thought to be important in facilitating consciousness. We sought to investigate whether the integrity of thalamo-prefrontal circuits, assessed via diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), was associated with the return of goal-directed behavior after severe TBI. We classified a cohort of severe TBI patients (N = 25, 20 males) into Early and Late/Never outcome groups based on their ability to follow commands within 30 days post-injury. We assessed connectivity between whole thalamus, and mediodorsal thalamus (MD), to prefrontal cortex (PFC) subregions including dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC), medial PFC (mPFC), anterior cingulate (ACC), and orbitofrontal (OFC) cortices. We found that the integrity of thalamic projections to PFC subregions (L OFC, L and R ACC, and R mPFC) was significantly associated with Early command-following. This association persisted when the analysis was restricted to prefrontal-mediodorsal (MD) thalamus connectivity. In contrast, dlPFC connectivity to thalamus was not significantly associated with command-following. Using the integrity of thalamo-prefrontal connections, we created a linear regression model that demonstrated 72% accuracy in predicting command-following after a leave-one-out analysis. Together, these data support a role for thalamo-prefrontal connectivity in the return of goal-directed behavior following TBI.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The dorsal hippocampus' role in context-based timing in rodents</a></h4>

              
                To act proactively, we must predict when future events will occur. Individuals generate temporal predictions using cues that indicate an event will happen after a certain duration elapses. Neural models of timing focus on how the brain represents these cue-duration associations. However, these models often overlook the fact that situational factors frequently modulate temporal expectations. For example, in realistic environments, the intervals associated with different cues will often covary due to a common underlying cause. According to the 'common cause hypothesis,' observers anticipate this covariance such that, when one cue's interval changes, temporal expectations for other cues shift in the same direction. Furthermore, as conditions will often differ across environments, the same cue can mean different things in different contexts. Therefore, updates to temporal expectations should be context-specific. Behavioral work supports these predictions, yet their underlying neural mechanisms are unclear. Here, we asked whether the dorsal hippocampus mediates context-based timing, given its broad role in context-conditioning. Specifically, we trained rats with either hippocampal or sham lesions that two cues predicted reward after either a short or long duration elapsed (e.g., tone-8s / light-16s). Then, we moved rats to a new context and extended the long-cue's interval (e.g., light-32s). This caused rats to respond later to the short cue, despite never being trained to do so. Importantly, when returned to the initial training context, sham rats shifted back toward both cues' original intervals. In contrast, lesion rats continued to respond at the long cue's newer interval. Surprisingly, they still showed contextual modulation for the short cue, responding earlier like shams. These data suggest the hippocampus only mediates context-based timing if a cue is explicitly paired and/or rewarded across distinct contexts. Furthermore, as lesions did not impact timing measures at baseline or acquisiton for the long cue's new interval, our data suggests that the hippocampus only modulates timing when context is relevant.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The hippocampus as a sorter and reverberatory integrator of sensory inputs</a></h4>

              
                In entorhinal-hippocampal networks, the trisynaptic pathway, including the CA3 recurrent circuit, processes episodes of context and space. Recurrent connectivity can generate reverberatory activity, an intrinsic activity pattern of neurons that occurs after sensory inputs have ceased. However, the role of reverberatory activity in memory encoding remains incompletely understood. Here we demonstrate that in mice, synchrony between conditioned stimulus (CS) and unconditioned stimulus (US)-responsible cells occurs during the reverberatory phase, lasting for approximately 15 s, but not during CS and US inputs, in the CA1 and the reverberation is crucial for the linking of CS and US in the encoding of delay-type cued-fear memory. Retrieval-responsive cells developed primarily during the reverberatory phase. Mutant mice lacking N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NRs) in CA3 showed a cued-fear memory impairment and a decrease in synchronized reverberatory activities between CS- and US-responsive CA1 cells. Optogenetic CA3 silencing at the reverberatory phase during learning impaired cued-fear memory. Our findings suggest that reverberation recruits future retrieval-responsive cells via synchrony between CS- and US-responsive cells. The hippocampus uses reverberatory activity to link CS and US inputs, and avoid crosstalk during sensory inputs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Closed-loop recruitment of striatal parvalbumin interneurons prevents the onset of compulsive behaviors</a></h4>

              
                A prominent electrophysiological feature of compulsive behaviours is striatal hyperactivity; but its underlying dysfunctional cellular mechanisms still need to be characterized. Within the striatum, parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PVI) exert a powerful feedforward inhibition essential for the regulation of striatal activity. To investigate the potential implication of striatal PVI in aberrant repetitive behaviors, we used the Sapap3 mutant mice which exhibit compulsive-like behaviours characterized by excessive self-grooming. When striatal PVI in the centromedial striatum of Sapap3 mice were we optogenetically activated, we first showed that the number of compulsive-like events were greatly reduced. To investigate further the critical time-window when striatal PVI needed to be recruited for the behavioural regulation of compulsive-like grooming, we then designed a novel closed-loop stimulation pipeline. We identified a transient 1-4 Hz oscillations in the orbitofrontal cortex that temporally predicted grooming onsets. Exploiting this delta band signal as a biomarker, we were able to provide on-demand stimulation of striatal PVI shortly before predicted grooming events. This targeted closed-loop optogenetics approach greatly reduced grooming events and demonstrated that the recruitment of striatal PVI regulated the initiations of compulsive-like behaviours.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">TCF7L2 acts as a molecular switch in midbrain to control mammal vocalization through a transcriptional repression mechanism</a></h4>

              
                Vocalization is an essential medium for sexual and social signaling in birds and mammals. Periaqueductal gray (PAG) a conserved midbrain structure is believed to be responsible for innate vocalizations, but its molecular regulation remains largely unknown. Here, through a mouse forward genetic screening we identified one of the key Wnt/{beta}-catenin effectors TCF7L2/TCF4 controls ultrasonic vocalization (USV) production and syllable complexity during maternal deprivation and sexual encounter. Expression of TCF7L2 in PAG excitatory neurons is necessary for the complex trait, while TCF7L2 loss reduces neuronal gene expressions and synaptic transmission in PAG. TCF7L2-mediated vocal control is independent of its {beta}-catenin-binding domain but dependent of its DNA binding ability. Patient mutations associated with severe speech delay disrupt the transcriptional repression effect of TCF7L2, while mice carrying those mutations display severe USV impairments. Therefore, we conclude that TCF7L2 orchestrates gene expression in midbrain to control vocal production through a transcriptional repression mechanism.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Uncertainty-guided learning with scaled prediction errors in the basal ganglia</a></h4>

              
                To accurately predict rewards associated with states or actions, the variability of observations has to be taken into account. In particular, when the observations are noisy, the individual rewards should have less influence on tracking of average reward, and the estimate of the mean reward should be updated to a smaller extent after each observation. However, it is not known how the magnitude of the observation noise might be tracked and used to control prediction updates in the brain reward system. Here, we introduce a new model that uses simple, tractable learning rules that track the mean and standard deviation of reward, and leverages prediction errors scaled by uncertainty as the central feedback signal. We provide a normative analysis, comparing the performance of the new model with that of conventional models in a value tracking task. We find that the new model has an advantage over conventional models when tested across various levels of observation noise. Further, we propose a possible biological implementation of the model in the basal ganglia circuit. The scaled prediction error feedback signal is consistent with experimental findings concerning dopamine prediction error scaling relative to reward magnitude, and the update rules are found to be consistent with many features of striatal plasticity. Our results span across the levels of implementation, algorithm, and computation, and might have important implications for understanding the dopaminergic prediction error signal and its relation to adaptive and effective learning.

<p>Cholinergic projections from the medial habenula (MHb) to the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) have been studied for their complex contributions to nicotine addiction and have been implicated in nicotine reinforcement, aversion, and withdrawal. While it has been established that MHb cholinergic projections corelease glutamate, no direct evidence has demonstrated a role for this glutamate projection in nicotine consumption. In the present study, a novel floxed <I>Slc17a7</I> [vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1)] mouse was generated and used to create conditional knock-out (cKO) mice that lack VGLUT1 in MHb cholinergic neurons. Loss of <I>Slc17a7</I> expression in ventral MHb cholinergic neurons was validated using fluorescent <I>in situ</I> hybridization, and immunohistochemistry was used to demonstrate a corresponding reduction of VGLUT1 protein in cholinergic terminals in the IPN. We also used optogenetics-assisted electrophysiology to evoke EPSCs in IPN and observed a reduction of glutamatergic currents in the cKO, supporting the functional disruption of VGLUT1 in MHb to IPN synapses. cKO mice exhibited no gross phenotypic abnormalities and displayed normal thigmotaxis and locomotor behavior in the open-field assay. When trained to lever press for food, there was no difference between control and cKO. However, when tested in a nicotine self-administration procedure, we found that the loss of VGLUT1-mediated glutamate corelease led to increased responding for nicotine. These findings indicate that glutamate corelease from ventral MHb cholinergic neurons opposes nicotine self-administration, and provide additional support for targeting this synapse to develop potential treatments for nicotine addiction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Phase-Synchronized Stimulus Presentation Augments Contingency Knowledge and Affective Evaluation in a Fear-Conditioning Task</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Memory often combines information from different sensory modalities. Animal studies show that synchronized neuronal activity in the theta band (4&ndash;8 Hz) binds multimodal associations. Studies with human participants have likewise established that theta-phase synchronization augments the formation of declarative video&ndash;tone pair memories. Another form of associative learning, classical fear conditioning, models nondeclarative, emotional memory with distinct neuronal mechanisms. Typical fear-conditioning tasks pair a conditioned stimulus (CS) in one modality with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) in another. The present study examines the effects of CS&ndash;US synchronization in the theta band on fear memory formation in humans. In a fear generalization procedure, we paired one of five visual gratings of varying orientation (CS) with an aversive auditory US. We modulated the luminance of the CS and the volume of the US at a rate of 4 Hz. To manipulate the synchrony between visual and auditory input during fear acquisition, one group (<I>N</I> = 20) received synchronous CS&ndash;US pairing, whereas the control group (<I>N</I> = 20) received the CS&ndash;US pairs out of phase. Phase synchronization improved CS&ndash;US contingency knowledge and facilitated CS discrimination in terms of rated valence and arousal, resulting in narrower generalization across the CS gratings compared with the out-of-phase group. In contrast, synchronization did not amplify conditioned responding in physiological arousal (skin conductance) and visuocortical engagement (steady-state visually evoked potentials) during acquisition, although both measures demonstrated tuning toward the CS<sup>+</sup>. Together, these data support a causal role of theta-phase synchronization in affective evaluation and contingency report during fear acquisition.</p>

                A 57-year-old male who had been working in masonry for 33 years was hospitalized for renal function decline associated with exertional dyspnea. He presented with hypertension and limb edema. Urinalysis revealed an active urine sediment with glomerular proteinuria at 1.5 g/24h and the renal biopsy identified mesangial IgA Nephropathy. Chest tomography scans showed signs of silicosis. The patient received Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors with stable renal function. To our knowledge, the association of silicosis-IgA nephropathy has rarely been reported in the literature. This case highlights the effect of chronic exposure to silica dust and its association with both silica and renal disease.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Enhancing innovative delivery in schools using design thinking [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                The pandemic has created challenges in all sectors of the economy and education. Traditional teaching approaches seem futile in the new context, thus the need to constantly reinvent the delivery to meet the fast-paced changes in the education domain. Hence, Design Thinking (DT) is an alternative approach that might be useful in the given context. DT is known to be a human-centric approach to innovative problem-solving processes. DT could be employed in the delivery process to develop twenty-first-century skills and enhance creativity and innovation, in an attempt to identify alternative solutions. The study explores the role of design thinking (DT) in the form of empathy, thinking process, gamified lessons and curriculum enhancement, which leads to innovative delivery among teachers. It enhances and facilitates innovative content delivery by leveraging creativity. The study targeted 131 teachers, whereby 61 are primary school teachers and 70 are secondary school teachers. A questionnaire constituting of 23 close-ended questions using the 5-point Likert scale was used to collect data. Data was analyzed using SmartPLS to establish relationships between DT and Innovative Delivery in schools. The data was further analyzed to seek co-relations between the DT steps and the successful transformation of content delivery by teachers. The study established a framework for the application of design thinking for teachers as the primary support in developing activities for their students. It shows that thinking process, gamifying lessons and curriculum enhancement have positive significance in innovative delivery, whereas empathy did not show a significant positive relationship. The outcome of this study will help fill the gap towards creating an interesting method of delivery in schools and constantly innovating the method to suit the evolving generation. This insight is crucial for the Ministry of Education and policymakers to enhance teachers’ ability to innovatively deliver content to students.

                Background: The study sought to explore the lived experiences of individuals having served in the Armed Forces of Saudi Arabia, as they made the transition to civilian life and sought new employment opportunities.     Methods: Researchers carried out qualitative research in the form of narrative inquiry. Narratives were collected from eleven in-depth interviews conducted in Saudi Arabia in 2021, allowed for insight into participant experiences. Existing literature on military retirement was also investigated. Results: Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed concurrently using thematic analysis to identify patterns or themes. The researchers adopted thematic synthesis as an analytical framework though which descriptive themes from the literature on military retirement were generated. Overall, this approach allowed for the comparison of themes in literature with those of narrative interviews. Conclusion: The study identified challenges encountered by veterans during the resettlement and transitional phase from military to civilian life. There was a general consensus, however, that military life equips individuals with valuable skills that are transferrable to successful post-military employment, known as Positive Transferable Adaptability for Employability (PTAE), (Mottershead, 2019), which can greatly empower those making the transition. These findings led the researchers to develop a new model for veteran career paths that meet the contemporary employment needs of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: the REVERE Transition Model, which identifies six career paths.

                Background: Horses are herd animals that have been domesticated in the last century. In several countries, an overview of risk factors and clinical evaluation in horses with colic has not been well‐described. This study aimed to evaluate risk factors and hematological profiles in horses associated with colic in Gresik, East Java, Indonesia. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed during April - October 2019. A total of 115 horses were diagnosed based on physical examination, clinical symptoms, and rectal examination. A questionnaire was asked to the horse-owners to analyze the risk factors while the clinical examination was performed and blood samples were collected for pre-treatment and 14 days post-treatment. Hematological profile was evaluated from a whole blood sample. Serum cortisol, plasma epinephrine, and norepinephrine concentrations were also evaluated after separating the aliquots.  Results: Of the 115 horses, 96 were diagnosed with colic. The horses with colic showed a significant association between cases with gender (p<0.021), breed (p<0.000), wheat bran feeding (p<0.015), concentrate feeding (p<0.003), anthelmintics administration (p<0.000), gastrointestinal parasites (p<0.000), dental diseases (p<0.024), previous exposure to colic (p<0.000), body condition score (p<0.000), and access to water per day (p<0.000). Based on whole blood and serum evaluation, there were ameliorated significantly on the hematological profile (p<0.01), serum cortisol (p<0.05), and plasma epinephrine (p<0.01) at 14 days post-treatment. Conclusion: This study has identified factors associated with colic in Delman horses. The study provides crucial information to investigate cases of colic and to contribute the development of healthcare strategies during treatment and clinical evaluation.

                This paper investigates the effects of screen time on child development and cognition and the setting of ‘safe’ screen time limits for young children, specifically children aged 6-to-12 years. Guidelines on screen time vary across constituencies, and the debate around screen time is contentious with many questions yet to be answered. A review of literature was undertaken to compare current screen time recommendations against the evidence from Neuroscience, Psychiatry, Psychology and Pediatrics that quantify screen time effects on the children's brain development. Based on this comparison, conclusions are made that can guide education policies around ‘remote learning’ and ‘home schooling’ to align them with the available research on the effects of screen time on children and inform a re-evaluation of the role of parents and educators in the setting of ‘safe’ limits on screen time.

                Background: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) has a poor prognosis and is a major cause of mortality and suffering in Thailand’s Northeastern (Isaan) Region.   Methods: This prospective cohort study aimed to compare the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among 72 newly diagnosed CCA patients; 42 patients who received cannabis treatment (CT) and 30 patients who received a standard palliative care treatment (ST). The study was carried out between 1st September 2019 to 31st October 2020.  Data were collected from patients from oncology clinics of six hospitals in five provinces of northeast Thailand. The HRQoL was measured at baseline, and at 2 and 4 months after diagnosis by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Core Quality of Life questionnaires QLQ-C30, and QLQ-BIL21. The Mann-Whitney U-test was performed to compare quality of life scores between the two patient groups and Wilcoxon signed rank test was performed to compare within groups QoL scores at pre-treatment, and 2 and 4 month follow-ups. Results: Global health status and functional scales, for both groups were high at pre-treatment. At 2 and 4 month follow-up, CT group patients had consistent statistically significantly better Palliative Performance Scale (PPS), and QoL scores, and many symptom scores than the ST group.   Conclusions: Medicinal cannabis may increase QoL for advanced CCA patients. Our findings support the importance of early access to palliative cannabis care clinic before the terminal and acceleration phase close to death.

                Background: FabB (3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase 1) is part of the fatty acid synthesis II pathway found in bacteria and a potential target for antibiotics. The enzyme catalyses the Claisen condensation of malonyl-ACP (acyl carrier protein) with acyl-ACP via an acyl-enzyme intermediate. Here, we report the crystal structure of the intermediate-mimicking Pseudomonas aeruginosa FabB (PaFabB) C161A variant. Methods: His-tagged PaFabB C161A was expressed in E. coli Rosetta DE3 pLysS cells, cleaved by TEV protease and purified using affinity and size exclusion chromatography. Commercial screens were used to identify suitable crystallization conditions which were subsequently improved to obtain well diffracting crystals. Results: We developed a robust and efficient system for recombinant expression of PaFabB C161A. Conditions to obtain well diffracting crystals were established. The crystal structure of PaFabB C161A was solved by molecular replacement at 1.3 Å resolution. Binding site comparison between PaFabB and PaFabF revealed a conserved malonyl binding site but differences in the fatty acid binding channel. Conclusions: The PaFabB C161A crystal structure can be used as a template to facilitate the design of FabB inhibitors.

                Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by widespread clinical manifestations and immunological disorders. A myriad of ocular manifestations can be seen in patients with SLE. The most vision-threatening complication is vaso-occlusive retinopathy including retinal vein occlusion (RVO). RVO associated with SLE is well described in the literature and its association with antiphospholipid antibodies is recognized. However, RVO as the initial manifestation of SLE is scarcely reported. Herein, we report the first case of recurrent RVO as the revealing manifestation of SLE in a 40-year-old male patient. He had two consecutive episodes of decreased vision. Ophthalmologic examination disclosed a branch retinal vein occlusion the first time and a central retinal vein occlusion the second time. The diagnosis of SLE was established based on clinical and immunological criteria. He was prescribed antiplatelet therapy, hydroxychloroquine at 5.5 mg/kg/day, and intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibodies regimen. He slowly improved under treatment.

                Background: This research was developed to study the epidemiology of anisometropia. It aims to estimate the prevalence of anisometropia in Portuguese children and adolescents at various educational stages, studying its association with sociodemographic variables. Methods: Observational cross sectional study envolving 749 children and adolescents (from 3 to 16 years old) from the central region of Portugal. The refraction was performed with a paediatric, open field auto refractometer (PlusOptix), without cycloplegia and under binocular conditions, to determine the rate of anisometropia and its association with gender, study cycle and area of residence. Results: The prevalence of anisometropia in the studied sample was 6.1%, varying from 2.9% in pre-school education to 9.4% in the 3rd study cycle. Myopic anisometropia was the most prevalent and hyperopic and astigmatic anisometropia showed identical proportions of occurrence. No statistical differences were found between genders or between areas of residence regarding the rate of anisometropia. Regarding spherical equivalent anisometropia, there was a pattern of variation that increased with the cycle of studies (× 2 (3)= 10.918; p = 0.012), with myopic anisometropia being the main contributor to this variation. Conclusions: This study found an increase in anisometropia with the educational stage. The high rate of anisometropia found in adolescents (9.4%) as well as the progressive increase in this rate throughout school progress (from 2.9% to 9.4%) suggests the need to extend the detection strategies of this condition beyond childhood.

                <p>Current therapeutic development in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) relies on individual randomized clinical trials to test a specific investigational product in a single patient population. This approach has intrinsic limitations, including cost, time, and lack of flexibility. Adaptive platform trials represent a novel approach to investigate several interventions for a single disease in a continuous manner. Already in use in oncology, this approach is now being employed more often in neurology. Here, we describe a newly launched platform trial for ALS. The Healey ALS Platform Trial is testing multiple investigational products concurrently in people with ALS, with the goal of rapidly identifying novel treatments, biomarkers, and trial endpoints.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Lateral versus posterior surgical approach for the treatment of supracondylar humeral fractures in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Supracondylar humeral fracture (SHF) is the most common type of fracture in children. Moreover, lateral and posterior surgical approaches are the most frequently chosen approaches for open reduction surgery in displaced SHF when C-arm is unavailable. However, previous literature showed mixed findings regarding functional and cosmetic outcomes. Currently, no systematic review and meta-analysis has compared these two procedures.  Methods: Our protocol was registered at PROSPERO (registration number CRD42021213763). We conducted a comprehensive electronic database search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL. Two independent reviewers screened the title and abstract, followed by full-text reading and study selection based on eligibility criteria. The quality of the selected studies was analyzed with the ROBINS-I tool. Meta-analysis was carried out to compare the range of motion (functional outcome) and cosmetic outcome according to Flynn’s criteria. This systematic review was conducted based on PRISMA and Cochrane handbook guidelines.  Results: Our initial search yielded 163 studies, from which we included five comparative studies comprising 231 children in the qualitative and quantitative analysis. The lateral approach was more likely to result in excellent (OR 1.69, 95% CI [0.97-2.93]) and good (OR 1.12, 95% CI [0.61-2.04]) functional outcomes and less likely to result in fair (OR 0.84, 95% CI [0.34-2.13]) and poor (OR 0.42, 95% CI [0.1-1.73]) functional outcomes compared to the posterior approach. In terms of cosmetic results, both approaches showed mixed findings. The lateral approach was more likely to result in excellent (OR 1.11, 95% CI [0.61-2.02]) and fair (OR 1.18, 95% CI [0.49-2.80]) but less likely to result in good (OR 0.79, 95% CI [0.40-1.55]) cosmetic outcomes. However, none of these analyses were statistically significant (p> 0.05).  Conclusion: Lateral and posterior surgical approaches resulted in satisfactory functional and cosmetic outcomes. The two approaches are comparable for treating SHF in children when evaluated with Flynn’s criteria.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Self-organization of collective escape in pigeon flocks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Marina Papadopoulou, Hanno Hildenbrandt, Daniel W. E. Sankey, Steven J. Portugal, Charlotte K. Hemelrijk</p>

Bird flocks under predation demonstrate complex patterns of collective escape. These patterns may emerge by self-organization from local interactions among group-members. Computational models have been shown to be valuable for identifying what behavioral rules may govern such interactions among individuals during collective motion. However, our knowledge of such rules for collective escape is limited by the lack of quantitative data on bird flocks under predation in the field. In the present study, we analyze the first GPS trajectories of pigeons in airborne flocks attacked by a robotic falcon in order to build a species-specific model of collective escape. We use our model to examine a recently identified distance-dependent pattern of collective behavior: the closer the prey is to the predator, the higher the frequency with which flock members turn away from it. We first extract from the empirical data of pigeon flocks the characteristics of their shape and internal structure (bearing angle and distance to nearest neighbors). Combining these with information on their coordination from the literature, we build an agent-based model adjusted to pigeons’ collective escape. We show that the pattern of turning away from the predator with increased frequency when the predator is closer arises without prey prioritizing escape when the predator is near. Instead, it emerges through self-organization from a behavioral rule to avoid the predator independently of their distance to it. During this self-organization process, we show how flock members increase their consensus over which direction to escape and turn collectively as the predator gets closer. Our results suggest that coordination among flock members, combined with simple escape rules, reduces the cognitive costs of tracking the predator while flocking. Such escape rules that are independent of the distance to the predator can now be investigated in other species. Our study showcases the important role of computational models in the interpretation of empirical findings of collective behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Asymmetries around the visual field: From retina to cortex to behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Eline R. Kupers, Noah C. Benson, Marisa Carrasco, Jonathan Winawer</p>

Visual performance varies around the visual field. It is best near the fovea compared to the periphery, and at iso-eccentric locations it is best on the horizontal, intermediate on the lower, and poorest on the upper meridian. The fovea-to-periphery performance decline is linked to the decreases in cone density, retinal ganglion cell (RGC) density, and V1 cortical magnification factor (CMF) as eccentricity increases. The origins of polar angle asymmetries are not well understood. Optical quality and cone density vary across the retina, but recent computational modeling has shown that these factors can only account for a small percentage of behavior. Here, we investigate how visual processing beyond the cone photon absorptions contributes to polar angle asymmetries in performance. First, we quantify the extent of asymmetries in cone density, midget RGC density, and V1 CMF. We find that both polar angle asymmetries and eccentricity gradients increase from cones to mRGCs, and from mRGCs to cortex. Second, we extend our previously published computational observer model to quantify the contribution of phototransduction by the cones and spatial filtering by mRGCs to behavioral asymmetries. Starting with photons emitted by a visual display, the model simulates the effect of human optics, cone isomerizations, phototransduction, and mRGC spatial filtering. The model performs a forced choice orientation discrimination task on mRGC responses using a linear support vector machine classifier. The model shows that asymmetries in a decision maker’s performance across polar angle are greater when assessing the photocurrents than when assessing isomerizations and are greater still when assessing mRGC signals. Nonetheless, the polar angle asymmetries of the mRGC outputs are still considerably smaller than those observed from human performance. We conclude that cone isomerizations, phototransduction, and the spatial filtering properties of mRGCs contribute to polar angle performance differences, but that a full account of these differences will entail additional contribution from cortical representations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Profiling transcription factor activity dynamics using intronic reads in time-series transcriptome data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yan Wu, Lingfeng Xue, Wen Huang, Minghua Deng, Yihan Lin</p>

Activities of transcription factors (TFs) are temporally modulated to regulate dynamic cellular processes, including development, homeostasis, and disease. Recent developments of bioinformatic tools have enabled the analysis of TF activities using transcriptome data. However, because these methods typically use exon-based target expression levels, the estimated TF activities have limited temporal accuracy. To address this, we proposed a TF activity measure based on intron-level information in time-series RNA-seq data, and implemented it to decode the temporal control of TF activities during dynamic processes. We showed that TF activities inferred from intronic reads can better recapitulate instantaneous TF activities compared to the exon-based measure. By analyzing public and our own time-series transcriptome data, we found that intron-based TF activities improve the characterization of temporal phasing of cycling TFs during circadian rhythm, and facilitate the discovery of two temporally opposing TF modules during T cell activation. Collectively, we anticipate that the proposed approach would be broadly applicable for decoding global transcriptional architecture during dynamic processes.

                <p>by Benjamin Martin, Pablo D. Dans, Milosz Wieczór, Nuria Villegas, Isabelle Brun-Heath, Federica Battistini, Montserrat Terrazas, Modesto Orozco</p>

We have used a variety of theoretical and experimental techniques to study the role of four basic amino acids–Arginine, Lysine, Ornithine and L-2,4-Diaminobutyric acid–on the structure, flexibility and sequence-dependent stability of DNA. We found that the presence of organic ions stabilizes the duplexes and significantly reduces the difference in stability between AT- and GC-rich duplexes with respect to the control conditions. This suggests that these amino acids, ingredients of the primordial soup during abiogenesis, could have helped to equalize the stability of AT- and GC-rich DNA oligomers, facilitating a general non-catalysed self-replication of DNA. Experiments and simulations demonstrate that organic ions have an effect that goes beyond the general electrostatic screening, involving specific interactions along the grooves of the double helix. We conclude that organic ions, largely ignored in the DNA world, should be reconsidered as crucial structural elements far from mimics of small inorganic cations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Interpretable machine learning for high-dimensional trajectories of aging health</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Spencer Farrell, Arnold Mitnitski, Kenneth Rockwood, Andrew D. Rutenberg</p>

We have built a computational model for individual aging trajectories of health and survival, which contains physical, functional, and biological variables, and is conditioned on demographic, lifestyle, and medical background information. We combine techniques of modern machine learning with an interpretable interaction network, where health variables are coupled by explicit pair-wise interactions within a stochastic dynamical system. Our dynamic joint interpretable network (DJIN) model is scalable to large longitudinal data sets, is predictive of individual high-dimensional health trajectories and survival from baseline health states, and infers an interpretable network of directed interactions between the health variables. The network identifies plausible physiological connections between health variables as well as clusters of strongly connected health variables. We use English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA) data to train our model and show that it performs better than multiple dedicated linear models for health outcomes and survival. We compare our model with flexible lower-dimensional latent-space models to explore the dimensionality required to accurately model aging health outcomes. Our DJIN model can be used to generate synthetic individuals that age realistically, to impute missing data, and to simulate future aging outcomes given arbitrary initial health states.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A lexical approach for identifying behavioural action sequences</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gautam Reddy, Laura Desban, Hidenori Tanaka, Julian Roussel, Olivier Mirat, Claire Wyart</p>

Animals display characteristic behavioural patterns when performing a task, such as the spiraling of a soaring bird or the surge-and-cast of a male moth searching for a female. Identifying such recurring sequences occurring rarely in noisy behavioural data is key to understanding the behavioural response to a distributed stimulus in unrestrained animals. Existing models seek to describe the dynamics of behaviour or segment individual locomotor episodes rather than to identify the rare and transient sequences of locomotor episodes that make up the behavioural response. To fill this gap, we develop a lexical, hierarchical model of behaviour. We designed an unsupervised algorithm called “BASS” to efficiently identify and segment recurring behavioural action sequences transiently occurring in long behavioural recordings. When applied to navigating larval zebrafish, BASS extracts a dictionary of remarkably long, non-Markovian sequences consisting of repeats and mixtures of slow forward and turn bouts. Applied to a novel chemotaxis assay, BASS uncovers chemotactic strategies deployed by zebrafish to avoid aversive cues consisting of sequences of fast large-angle turns and burst swims. In a simulated dataset of soaring gliders climbing thermals, BASS finds the spiraling patterns characteristic of soaring behaviour. In both cases, BASS succeeds in identifying rare action sequences in the behaviour deployed by freely moving animals. BASS can be easily incorporated into the pipelines of existing behavioural analyses across diverse species, and even more broadly used as a generic algorithm for pattern recognition in low-dimensional sequential data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Analysis of ancestry heterozygosity suggests that hybrid incompatibilities in threespine stickleback are environment dependent</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ken A. Thompson, Catherine L. Peichel, Diana J. Rennison, Matthew D. McGee, Arianne Y. K. Albert, Timothy H. Vines, Anna K. Greenwood, Abigail R. Wark, Yaniv Brandvain, Molly Schumer, Dolph Schluter</p>

Hybrid incompatibilities occur when interactions between opposite ancestry alleles at different loci reduce the fitness of hybrids. Most work on incompatibilities has focused on those that are “intrinsic,” meaning they affect viability and sterility in the laboratory. Theory predicts that ecological selection can also underlie hybrid incompatibilities, but tests of this hypothesis using sequence data are scarce. In this article, we compiled genetic data for F<sub>2</sub> hybrid crosses between divergent populations of threespine stickleback fish (<i>Gasterosteus aculeatus</i> L.) that were born and raised in either the field (seminatural experimental ponds) or the laboratory (aquaria). Because selection against incompatibilities results in elevated ancestry heterozygosity, we tested the prediction that ancestry heterozygosity will be higher in pond-raised fish compared to those raised in aquaria. We found that ancestry heterozygosity was elevated by approximately 3% in crosses raised in ponds compared to those raised in aquaria. Additional analyses support a phenotypic basis for incompatibility and suggest that environment-specific single-locus heterozygote advantage is not the cause of selection on ancestry heterozygosity. Our study provides evidence that, in stickleback, a coarse—albeit indirect—signal of environment-dependent hybrid incompatibility is reliably detectable and suggests that extrinsic incompatibilities can evolve before intrinsic incompatibilities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Stem cell therapy in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive motor neuron disease leading to loss of upper and lower motor neurons at both spinal and bulbar levels.   For patients with ALS rehabilitation is important to maintain functional independence, ensure safety and optimize quality of life but is not curative. Stem cell therapy (SCT) provides a new approach to treat previously incurable diseases although peer reviewed published evidence has shown no benefit in ALS for slowing disease progression or functional loss.   This case report presents a patient with ALS who underwent SCT but deteriorated rapidly after the procedure. Whether the deterioration was due to the natural progress of the disease or expedited by SCT remains unknown. The ethical considerations of how marketing influences healthcare and individuals’ decisions in desperate situations along with reasons for taking desperate measures are discussed.  Patient education and open communication with ALS patients are imperative in gaining patient satisfaction and overcoming ill effects that marketing could have on unconventional methods of intervention. Raising awareness about the availability and access to multidisciplinary care, the timing of decisions with regards to symptom management and end of life care have proven to enhance the quality of life for such patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effects of exercise-based prehabilitation in children undergoing elective surgeries: a systematic review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Prehabilitation is a therapeutic strategy involving preoperative physical exercises, nutritional support, and stress and anxiety reduction. This approach has been gaining popularity and has been seeing effective results in adults in terms of improving pre and postoperative outcomes. The purpose of this review was to summarise the evidence about the effects of exercise-based prehabilitation programs on various outcome measures in children post elective surgeries.­­ Methods: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, PEDro, CINAHL/EBSCO and EMBASE electronic databases were searched from inception to June 2021. Based on the inclusion criteria, titles and abstracts were independently screened by the authors. After that, a data extraction table of the selected studies which included the participants, type, and details of exercise intervention, outcome measures and results were analysed after which the quality assessment of the studies was done. Results: The search yielded 2219 articles of which three articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria with two studies being randomized controlled trials and one being a quasi-experimental pre-post type of study. One randomized controlled trial was on the effects of exercise-based prehabilitation in reducing pulmonary complications post cardiac surgeries in children and the other two studies were on the effects of prehabilitation on functional capacity & pulmonary function. All the three articles found that exercise-based prehabilitation had a positive effect on children’s post-surgery. Conclusion: Although there is a paucity of evidence-based literature, we conclude based on the existing literature retrieved by our review that exercise-based prehabilitation improves postoperative outcomes and helps in reducing postoperative complications in children undergoing various surgeries.

                Backgroundː Numerous in vivo human cohort studies have suggested that the apolipoprotein B100/apolipoprotein AI (ApoB100/ApoAI) ratio might be a risk factor in coronary heart disease. The aim of this study was to measure ApoB100/ApoAI ratio changes in cell secretions by incubating HepG2 cells with various amounts of glucose in vitro. Methods ː HepG2 cells were cultured in low-, normal- or high-glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (1, 4.5 and 10g/L, respectively). Levels of ApoAI and ApoB100 were measured with commercial sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (cat#: H0123 and H0124) from ShangHai MEIXUAN Biological Science and Technology Ltd (Shanghai, China). Experiments were repeated six times for each assay. Resultsː The results showed that ApoB100/ApoAI ratio have positive correlations with the glucose concentration increase. Conclusionsː A higher concentration of glucose induced an undesirable ApoB100/ApoAI ratio change, which suggests a new regulatory pathway in lipoprotein catabolism and provides a cell model for further mechanism study. This finding may lead to novel therapeutic ways for diagnosis and treatment for coronary artery disease.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to identify the risk of bleeding events and potential risk factors within 90 days in patients who carried <i>CYP2C19</i> loss-of-function alleles and received dual antiplatelet therapy after minor stroke or transient ischemic attack.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 6,412 patients were enrolled from the CHANCE-2 (Clopidogrel with Aspirin in High-Risk Patients with Acute Non-disabling Cerebrovascular Events II) trial. The main outcome was any bleeding within 90 days defined by the criteria from GUSTO (Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 250 (3.9%) bleeding events were reported, which occurred mainly within the 21 days of dual antiplatelet therapy (200 cases, 3.1%). Minor bleeding of the skin bruises, epistaxis, and gum bleeding were most frequent. Multivariate analysis showed that treatment with ticagrelor-aspirin compared with clopidogrel-aspirin was associated with increased bleeding (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.68–2.89, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Current smoking was associated with a lower risk of bleeding (HR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.52–0.95, <i>p</i> = 0.02). Additionally, ticagrelor-aspirin compared with clopidogrel-aspirin was associated with higher risk of bleeding in patients aged &lt;65 years (HR = 2.87, 95% CI = 1.95–4.22) and those without diabetes mellitus (HR = 2.65, 95% CI = 1.88–3.73; <i>p</i> for interaction = 0.04 and 0.03, respectively).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Bleeding events mostly occurred within the 21-day dual antiplatelet therapy stage and were generally mild. The risk of bleeding was greater in nonsmoking patients, and was associated with treatment with ticagrelor-aspirin compared with clopidogrel-aspirin, particularly in patients aged &lt;65 years and nondiabetic patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Comparison of accidental pediatric scald burns in a tertiary care center: hot cauldron burns versus accidental spill burns [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Scald burns result from exposure to high-temperature fluids and are more common in the pediatric age group. They occur mainly by two mechanisms: (i) spill and (ii) immersion (hot cauldron) burns. These two patterns differ in clinical characteristics and outcomes. Scalds cause significant morbidity and mortality in children. The objective of this study was to compare accidental spill burns and hot cauldron burns in a hospital setting. Methods: An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted by reviewing the secondary data of scald cases admitted during the years 2019 and 2020 in a burn-dedicated tertiary care center. Total population sampling was adopted. Data analysis was done partly using SPSS, version-23, and Stata-15. Mann Whitney U-test and Chi-square/Fisher's exact test were done appropriately to find associations between different variables. Binary regression analysis was performed taking mortality events as the outcome of interest. Results: Out of 108 scald cases, 43 (39.8%) had hot cauldron burns and 65 (60.2%) had accidental spill burns. Overall mortality was 16 (14.8%), out of which hot cauldron burns and accidental spill burns comprised 12 (75.0%) and 4 (25.0%), respectively. Binary logistic regression analysis showed the type of scald, age, and Baux score found to be associated with mortality. Every one-year increment in age had a 29% lower odds of occurrence of mortality event (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50-0.99, p=0.042). Likewise, every one-point increment in Baux score was associated with 19% higher odds of mortality (adjusted OR, 1.190; 95% CI, 1.08-1.32; p<0.001). Conclusions: Accidental spill burn was more common but mortality was significantly higher for hot cauldron burns. The risk of mortality was significantly higher in burn events occurring outside the house, and burns involving back, buttocks, perineum, and lower extremities.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Myelin regeneration in the human central nervous system relies on progenitor cells within the tissue parenchyma, with possible contribution from previously myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLs). In multiple sclerosis, a demyelinating disorder, variables affecting remyelination efficiency include age, severity of initial injury, and progenitor cell properties. Our aim was to investigate the effects of age and differentiation on the myelination potential of human OL lineage cells.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We derived viable primary OL lineage cells from surgical resections of pediatric and adult brain tissue. Ensheathment capacity using nanofiber assays and transcriptomic profiles from RNA sequencing were compared between A2B5+ antibody-selected progenitors and mature OLs (non-selected cells).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We demonstrate that pediatric progenitor and mature cells ensheathed nanofibers more robustly than did adult progenitor and mature cells, respectively. Within both age groups, the percentage of fibers ensheathed and ensheathment length per fiber were greater for A2B5+ progenitors. Gene expression of OL progenitor markers <i>PDGFRA</i> and <i>PTPRZ1</i> were higher in A2B5+ versus A2B5− cells and in pediatric A2B5+ versus adult A2B5+ cells. The p38 MAP kinases and actin cytoskeleton-associated pathways were upregulated in pediatric cells; both have been shown to regulate OL process outgrowth. Significant upregulation of “cell senescence” genes was detected in pediatric samples; this could reflect their role in development and the increased susceptibility of pediatric OLs to activating cell death responses to stress.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings identify specific biological pathways relevant to myelination that are differentially enriched in human pediatric and adult OL lineage cells and suggest potential targets for remyelination enhancing therapies. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Blindsight is a disorder where brain injury causes loss of conscious but not unconscious visual perception. Prior studies have produced conflicting results regarding the neuroanatomical pathways involved in this unconscious perception.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a systematic literature search to identify lesion locations causing visual field loss in patients with blindsight (n = 34) and patients without blindsight (n = 35). Resting state functional connectivity between each lesion location and all other brain voxels was computed using a large connectome database (n = 1,000). Connections significantly associated with blindsight (vs no blindsight) were identified.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Functional connectivity between lesion locations and the ipsilesional medial pulvinar was significantly associated with blindsight (family wise error <i>p</i> = 0.029). No significant connectivity differences were found to other brain regions previously implicated in blindsight. This finding was independent of methods (eg, flipping lesions to the left or right) and stimulus type (moving vs static).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Connectivity to the ipsilesional medial pulvinar best differentiates lesion locations associated with blindsight versus those without blindsight. Our results align with recent data from animal models and provide insight into the neuroanatomical substrate of unconscious visual abilities in patients. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Fatigue is a frequent and severe symptom in multiple sclerosis (MS), but its pathophysiological origin remains incompletely understood. We aimed to examine the predictive value of subcortical gray matter volumes for fatigue severity at disease onset and after 4 years by applying structural equation modeling (SEM).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This multicenter cohort study included 601 treatment-naive patients with MS after the first demyelinating event. All patients underwent a standardized 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol. A subgroup of 230 patients with available clinical follow-up data after 4 years was also analyzed. Associations of subcortical volumes (included into SEM) with MS-related fatigue were studied regarding their predictive value. In addition, subcortical regions that have a central role in the brain network (hubs) were determined through structural covariance network (SCN) analysis.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Predictive causal modeling identified volumes of the caudate (s [standardized path coefficient] = 0.763, <i>p</i> = 0.003 [left]; s = 0.755, <i>p</i> = 0.006 [right]), putamen (s = 0.614, <i>p</i> = 0.002 [left]; s = 0.606, <i>p</i> = 0.003 [right]) and pallidum (s = 0.606, <i>p</i> = 0.012 [left]; s = 0.606, <i>p</i> = 0.012 [right]) as prognostic factors for fatigue severity in the cross-sectional cohort. Moreover, the volume of the pons was additionally predictive for fatigue severity in the longitudinal cohort (s = 0.605, <i>p</i> = 0.013). In the SCN analysis, network hubs in patients with fatigue worsening were detected in the putamen (<i>p</i> = 0.008 [left]; <i>p</i> = 0.007 [right]) and pons (<i>p</i> = 0.0001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We unveiled predictive associations of specific subcortical gray matter volumes with fatigue in an early and initially untreated MS cohort. The colocalization of these subcortical structures with network hubs suggests an early role of these brain regions in terms of fatigue evolution. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                Ma proposes a functional subdivision of the somatosensory system into two branches that respond to external threats and internal body injuries, respectively. The conflation of these behavioral responses may contribute to the poor translation of therapies from preclinical pain studies.

                Glycan-engineering of immunogens is one vaccine design strategy to focus antibodies to select epitopes. Konrath et al. create an automated pipeline to screen SARS-CoV-2 RBD for PNGS. PNGS-modified RBDs elicit enhanced ACE2-directed responses and higher neutralization. Multivalent display of glycan-engineered RBDs delivered via nucleic acid provide single-dose protection from challenge.
