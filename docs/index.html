              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14157">Predicting Perceptual Boundaries in Auditory Streaming using Delay Differential Equations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.14157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auditory streaming enables the brain to organize sequences of sounds into perceptually distinct sources, such as following a conversation in a noisy environment. A typical experiment for investigating perceptual boundaries and bistability is to present a subject with a stream containing two alternating tone stimuli. We investigate a model for the processing of such a stream consisting of two identical neural populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The populations are coupled via delayed cross-inhibition and periodically forced with sharp step-type signals (the two-tone stream). We track how the perception boundary depends on threshold selection and establish how boundaries between three different auditory perceptions (single tone versus two tones versus bistability between both perceptions) relate to bifurcations such as symmetry breaking. We demonstrate that these transitions are governed by symmetry-breaking bifurcations and that the perceptual classification based on neural thresholds is highly sensitive to threshold choice. Our analysis reveals that a fixed threshold is insufficient to capture the true perceptual boundaries and proposes a variable-threshold criterion, informed by the amplitude dynamics of neural responses. Finally, we illustrate how key stimulus parameters such as tone duration, delay, and internal time scale shape the boundaries of auditory perceptual organization in the plane of the two most commonly varied experimental parameters, the representation rate, and the difference in tone frequency. These findings offer mechanistic insight into auditory perception dynamics and provide a refined framework for linking neural activity to perceptual organization.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14375">Modeling Language Evolution Using a Spin Glass Approach</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.14375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of natural languages poses a riddle to any theoretical perspective based on efficiency considerations. If languages are already optimally effective means of organization and communication of thought, why do they change? And if they are driven to become optimally effective in the future, why do they change so slowly, and why do they diversify, rather than converge towards an optimum? We look here at the hypothesis that disorder, rather than efficiency, may play a dominant role. Most traditional approaches to study diachronic language dynamics emphasize lexical data, but a crucial contribution to the effectiveness of a thought-coding device is given by its core structure, its syntax. Based on the reduction of syntax to a set of binary parameters, we introduce here a model of natural language change in which diachronic dynamics are mediated by disordered interactions between parameters, even in the idealized limit of identical external inputs. We show in which region of `phase space' such dynamics show the glassy features that are observed in natural languages. In particular, syntactic vectors remain trapped in glassy metastable (tendentially stable) states when the degree of asymmetry in the disordered interactions is below a critical value, consistent with studies of spin glasses with asymmetric interactions. We further show that an added Hopfield-type memory term, would indeed, if strong enough, stabilize syntactic configurations even above the critical value, but losing the multiplicity of stable states. Finally, using a notion of linguistic distance in syntactic space we show that a phylogenetic signal may remain among related languages, despite their gradually divergent syntax, exactly as recently pointed out for real-world languages. These statistical results appear to generalize beyond the dataset of 94 syntactic parameters across 58 languages, used in this study.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14573">Baseline behaviour in human vision</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.14573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans perceive their visual environment by directing their eyes towards relevant objects. The deployment of visual attention depends substantially on the stimulus's properties, higher cognitive processes, and biases and constraints of the visual system. Numerous models describe people's eye movements depending on the performed task or the viewed content. However, there is no universal, context-invariant model of human gaze behaviour. Here we show that statistical regularities can be utilised to model human gaze behaviour regardless of task, observer, and content. Using a context-agnostic eye movement model, we were able to describe human gaze behaviour better than a uniform random model in various viewing situations. Using a fixed transition kernel, the model can describe gaze patterns during reading, visual search, and scene perception, as well as for both adults and children. Thus, contrary to current belief, human gaze patterns follow a baseline behaviour, making them comparable across contexts. Since gaze behaviour is directly related to brain structure, our results provide the first evidence for the existence of an underlying, context-invariant motor prior in the human visual system.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15519">Switching States: Heteroclinic Cycles as Organising Centres of Neuronal Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.15519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuronal networks alternate between high- and low-activity regimes, known as up and down states. They also display rhythmic patterns essential for perception, memory consolidation, and sensory processing. Despite their importance, the principles behind such state transitions remain elusive. We propose necessary conditions for the existence of a novel bifurcation structure as a universal organising centre governing these transitions. Bifurcation analysis and simulations of canonical mean-field network models, including Wilson--Cowan, Tsodyks--Markram, and Jansen--Rit frameworks, show that this bifurcation structure emerges robustly across models. We demonstrate that the interplay between external input and (synaptic) connectivity converges onto this shared mechanism, providing a fundamental principle for understanding how diverse brain states arise and are regulated. Beyond phenomenological mean-field models, we show that a shared mathematical structure of nonlinear input-output relationships, rather than model-specific details, preserves the organising centre across frameworks, revealing a general mechanism for dynamic state transitions.

                arXiv:2507.15639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain rhythms seem central to understanding the neurophysiological basis of human cognition. Yet, despite significant advances, key questions remain unresolved. In this comprehensive position paper, we review the current state of the art on oscillatory mechanisms and their cognitive relevance. The paper critically examines physiological underpinnings, from phase-related dynamics like cyclic excitability, to amplitude-based phenomena, such as gating by inhibition, and their interactions, such as phase-amplitude coupling, as well as frequency dynamics, like sampling mechanisms. We also critically evaluate future research directions, including travelling waves and brain-body interactions. We then provide an in-depth analysis of the role of brain rhythms across cognitive domains, including perception, attention, memory, and communication, emphasising ongoing debates and open questions in each area. By summarising current theories and highlighting gaps, this position paper offers a roadmap for future research, aimed at facilitating a unified framework of rhythmic brain function underlying cognition.

                arXiv:2507.15702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that final-state uncertainty is ubiquitous in multistable systems of coupled neuronal maps, meaning that predicting whether one such system will eventually be chaotic or nonchaotic is often nearly impossible. We propose a "chance synchronization" mechanism that governs the emergence of unpredictability in neuron systems and support it by using basin classification, uncertainty exponent, and basin entropy techniques to analyze five simple discrete-time systems, each consisting of a different neuron model. Our results illustrate that uncertainty in neuron systems is not just a product of noise or high-dimensional complexity; it is also a fundamental property of low-dimensional, deterministic models, which has profound implications for understanding brain function, modeling cognition, and interpreting unpredictability in general multistable systems.

                arXiv:2507.15776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parr et al., 2025 examines how auto-regressive and deep temporal models differ in their treatment of non-Markovian sequence modelling. Building on this, we highlight the need for dissociating model architectures, i.e., how the predictive distribution factorises, from the computations invoked at inference. We demonstrate that deep temporal computations are mimicked by autoregressive models by structuring context access during iterative inference. Using a transformer trained on next-token prediction, we show that inducing hierarchical temporal factorisation during iterative inference maintains predictive capacity while instantiating fewer computations. This emphasises that processes for constructing and refining predictions are not necessarily bound to their underlying model architectures.

Abstract: Endowing brain anatomy, dynamics, and function with a network structure is becoming standard in neuroscience. In its simplest form, a network is a collection of units and relationships between them. The pattern of relations among the units encodes numerous properties which have been shown to have a profound effect on networked systems' dynamics and function. In an effort to strike a balance between idealization and detail, network neuroscience studies typically involve simplifying assumptions at both neural and network modeling levels. However, the extent to which existing neural models depend on such approximations is as yet poorly understood. Here, we discuss whether and how increasing neurophysiological detail and generalizing the basic simple network structure often adopted in network neuroscience may help improve our understanding of brain phenomenology and function.

                arXiv:2507.14147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Insomnia affects a vast population of the world and can have a wide range of causes. Existing treatments for insomnia have been linked with many side effects like headaches, dizziness, etc. As such, there is a clear need for improved insomnia treatment. Brain modelling has helped with assessing the effects of brain pathology on brain network dynamics and with supporting clinical decisions in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, etc. However, such models have not been developed for insomnia. Therefore, this project attempts to understand the characteristics of the brain of individuals experiencing insomnia using continuous long-duration EEG data. Brain networks are derived based on functional connectivity and spatial distance between EEG channels. The power spectral density of the channels is then computed for the major brain wave frequency bands. A graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) model is then trained to capture the functional characteristics associated with insomnia and configured for the classification task to judge performance. Results indicated a 50-second non-overlapping sliding window was the most suitable choice for EEG segmentation. This approach achieved a classification accuracy of 70% at window level and 68% at subject level. Additionally, the omission of EEG channels C4-P4, F4-C4 and C4-A1 caused higher degradation in model performance than the removal of other channels. These channel electrodes are positioned near brain regions known to exhibit atypical levels of functional connectivity in individuals with insomnia, which can explain such results.

                arXiv:2409.14279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dreams offer a unique window into the cognitive and affective dynamics of the sleeping and the waking mind. Recent quantitative linguistic approaches have shown promise in obtaining corpus-level measures of dream sentiment and topic occurrence. However, it is currently unclear how the affective content of individual dreams relates to their semantic content and structure. Here, we combine word embedding, topic modeling, and network analysis to investigate this relationship. By applying Discourse Atom Topic Modeling (DATM) to the DreamBank corpus of >18K dream reports, we represent the latent themes arising within dream reports as a sparse dictionary of topics and identify the affective associations of those topics. We show that variation in dream report affect (valence and arousal) is associated with changes in topical content. By representing each dream report as a network of topics, we demonstrate that the affective content of dream narratives is also coupled to semantic structure. Positively valenced dream reports exhibit more coherent, structured, and linear narratives, whilst negatively valenced dreams have more narrative loops and dominant topics. Topic networks of high arousal dream reports are structurally dominated by few high arousal topics and incoherent topical connections, whereas low arousal dream reports contain more loops. These findings suggest that affective processes are associated with both the content and structure of dreams. Our approach showcases the potential of integrating natural language processing and network analysis with psychology to elucidate the interplay of affect, cognition and narrative in dreams. This methodology has broad applications for the study of narrated experience and psychiatric symptomatology.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11538">BrainNetMLP: An Efficient and Effective Baseline for Functional Brain Network Classification</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.11538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have made great progress in functional brain network classification by modeling the brain as a network of Regions of Interest (ROIs) and leveraging their connections to understand brain functionality and diagnose mental disorders. Various deep learning architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks, Graph Neural Networks, and the recent Transformer, have been developed. However, despite the increasing complexity of these models, the performance gain has not been as salient. This raises a question: Does increasing model complexity necessarily lead to higher classification accuracy? In this paper, we revisit the simplest deep learning architecture, the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and propose a pure MLP-based method, named BrainNetMLP, for functional brain network classification, which capitalizes on the advantages of MLP, including efficient computation and fewer parameters. Moreover, BrainNetMLP incorporates a dual-branch structure to jointly capture both spatial connectivity and spectral information, enabling precise spatiotemporal feature fusion. We evaluate our proposed BrainNetMLP on two public and popular brain network classification datasets, the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE). Experimental results demonstrate pure MLP-based methods can achieve state-of-the-art performance, revealing the potential of MLP-based models as more efficient yet effective alternatives in functional brain network classification. The code will be available at https://github.com/JayceonHo/BrainNetMLP.

Abstract: Data-hungry neuro-AI modelling requires ever larger neuroimaging datasets. CNeuroMod-THINGS meets this need by capturing neural representations for a wide set of semantic concepts using well-characterized images in a new densely-sampled, large-scale fMRI dataset. Importantly, CNeuroMod-THINGS exploits synergies between two existing projects: the THINGS initiative (THINGS) and the Courtois Project on Neural Modelling (CNeuroMod). THINGS has developed a common set of thoroughly annotated images broadly sampling natural and man-made objects which is used to acquire a growing collection of large-scale multimodal neural responses. Meanwhile, CNeuroMod is acquiring hundreds of hours of fMRI data from a core set of participants during controlled and naturalistic tasks, including visual tasks like movie watching and videogame playing. For CNeuroMod-THINGS, four CNeuroMod participants each completed 33-36 sessions of a continuous recognition paradigm using approximately 4000 images from the THINGS stimulus set spanning 720 categories. We report behavioural and neuroimaging metrics that showcase the quality of the data. By bridging together large existing resources, CNeuroMod-THINGS expands our capacity to model broad slices of the human visual experience.

                arXiv:2507.15486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The visual systems of birds and mammals exhibit remarkable organizational similarities: the dorsal ventricular ridge (DVR) demonstrates a columnar microcircuitry that parallels the cortical architecture observed in mammals. However, the specific neuronal subtypes involved and their functional roles in pigeon hierarchical visual processing remain unclear. This study investigates the role of excitatory parvalbumin (PV+) neurons within the Ento-MVL (entoallium-mesopallium venterolaterale) circuit of pigeons underlying hierarchical moving target recognition. Electrophysiological recordings and immunofluorescence staining reveal that excitatory PV+ neurons originating from the entopallial internal (Ei) predominantly modulate MVL responses to varying visual stimuli. Using a heterochronous-speed recurrent neural network (HS-RNN) model, we further validated these dynamics, replicating the rapid adaptation of the Ento-MVL circuit to moving visual targets. The findings suggest that the fast-spiking and excitatory properties of PV+ neurons enable rapid processing of motion-related information within the Ento-MVL circuit. Our results elucidate the functional role of excitatory PV+ neurons in hierarchical information processing under the columnar organization of the visual DVR and underscore the convergent neural processing strategies shared by avian and mammalian visual systems.

                arXiv:2507.14270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the APTx Neuron, a novel, unified neural computation unit that integrates non-linear activation and linear transformation into a single trainable expression. The APTx Neuron is derived from the APTx activation function, thereby eliminating the need for separate activation layers and making the architecture both computationally efficient and elegant. The proposed neuron follows the functional form $y = \sum_{i=1}^{n} ((\alpha_i + \tanh(\beta_i x_i)) \cdot \gamma_i x_i) + \delta$, where all parameters $\alpha_i$, $\beta_i$, $\gamma_i$, and $\delta$ are trainable. We validate our APTx Neuron-based architecture on the MNIST dataset, achieving up to 96.69\% test accuracy in just 20 epochs using approximately 332K trainable parameters. The results highlight the superior expressiveness and computational efficiency of the APTx Neuron compared to traditional neurons, pointing toward a new paradigm in unified neuron design and the architectures built upon it.

                arXiv:2507.14386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a neural network model, which, with appropriate assignment of the stability of its equilibrium points (EPs), achieves Hopfield-like associative memory. The oscillator Ising machine (OIM) is an ideal candidates for such a model, as all its $0/\pi$ binary EPs are structurally stable with their dynamic stability tunable by the coupling weights. Traditional Hopfield-based models store the desired patterns by designing the coupling weights between neurons. The design of coupling weights should simultaneously take into account both the existence and the dynamic stability of the EPs for the storage of the desired patterns. For OIMs, since all $0/\pi$ binary EPs are structurally stable, the design of the coupling weights needs only to focus on assigning appropriate stability for the $0/\pi$ binary EPs according to the desired patterns. In this paper, we establish a connection between the stability and the Hamiltonian energy of EPs for OIMs, and, based on this connection, provide a Hamiltonian-Regularized Eigenvalue Contrastive Method (HRECM) to train the coupling weights of OIMs for assigning appropriate stability to their EPs. Finally, numerical experiments are performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

                arXiv:2507.14757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer energy-efficient and biologically plausible alternatives to traditional artificial neural networks, but their performance depends critically on the tuning of neuron model parameters. In this work, we identify and characterize an operational space - a constrained region in the neuron hyperparameter domain (specifically membrane time constant tau and voltage threshold vth) - within which the network exhibits meaningful activity and functional behavior. Operating inside this manifold yields optimal trade-offs between classification accuracy and spiking activity, while stepping outside leads to degeneration: either excessive energy use or complete network silence.
  Through systematic exploration across datasets and architectures, we visualize and quantify this manifold and identify efficient operating points. We further assess robustness to adversarial noise, showing that SNNs exhibit increased spike correlation and internal synchrony when operating outside their optimal region. These findings highlight the importance of principled hyperparameter tuning to ensure both task performance and energy efficiency. Our results offer practical guidelines for deploying robust and efficient SNNs, particularly in neuromorphic computing scenarios.

                arXiv:2507.15615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primal heuristics play a critical role in improving the efficiency of mixed integer programming (MILP) solvers. As large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated superior code generation abilities, recent MILP works are devoted to leveraging the evolutionary computation approaches with LLMs to generate effective primal heuristics. Although the generated heuristics have achieved better solving performance than the hand-crafted ones with little adaptability, the advantage of current LLM-based methods is limited to few MILP instances in one problem class, as they fail to capture the instance characteristics in the problem class (the MILP instances generated from the same mathematical model are defined as a problem class). Since MILP instances often differ significantly in structure and feature distribution, the neglect of their characteristics in the evolution process results in poor generalization within the same problem class. To overcome this challenge, we propose a data-algorithm co-evolution framework (DHEvo) that iteratively selects representative instances and evolves corresponding heuristics. With the initial instance distribution, we develop an LLM-based multi-agent system to generate data-code pairs simultaneously. These data-code pairs are iteratively refined based on their fitness scores, leading to the identification of the most effective heuristic over the entire problem class. Extensive experiments across diverse MILP benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms both human-designed heuristics and existing LLM-based methods.

Abstract: Human machine interaction is a huge source of inspiration in today's media art and digital design, as machines and humans merge together more and more. Its place in art reflects its growing applications in industry, such as robotics. However, those interactions often remains too technical and machine-driven for people to really engage into. On the artistic side, new technologies are often not explored in their full potential and lag a bit behind, so that state-of-the-art research does not make its way up to museums and exhibitions. Machines should support people's imagination and poetry in a seamless interface to their body or soul. We propose an artistic sound installation featuring neuromorphic body sensing to support a direct yet non intrusive interaction with the visitor with the purpose of creating sound scapes together with the machine. We design a neuromorphic multihead human pose estimation neural sensor that shapes sound scapes and visual output with fine body movement control. In particular, the feature extractor is a spiking neural network tailored for a dedicated neuromorphic chip. The visitor, immersed in a sound atmosphere and a neurally processed representation of themselves that they control, experience the dialogue with a machine that thinks neurally, similarly to them.

Abstract: Conventional frame-based cameras often struggle with limited dynamic range, leading to saturation and loss of detail when capturing scenes with significant brightness variations. Neuromorphic cameras, inspired by human retina, offer a solution by providing an inherently high dynamic range. This capability enables them to capture both bright and faint celestial objects without saturation effects, preserving details across a wide range of luminosities. This paper investigates the application of neuromorphic imaging technology for capturing celestial bodies across a wide range of flux levels. Its advantages are demonstrated through examples such as the bright planet Saturn with its faint moons and the bright star Sirius A alongside its faint companion, Sirius B.

                arXiv:2507.14172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many program synthesis tasks prove too challenging for even state-of-the-art language models to solve in single attempts. Search-based evolutionary methods offer a promising alternative by exploring solution spaces iteratively, but their effectiveness remain limited by the fixed capabilities of the underlying generative model.
  We propose SOAR, a method that learns program synthesis by integrating language models into a self-improving evolutionary loop.
  SOAR alternates between (1) an evolutionary search that uses an LLM to sample and refine candidate solutions, and (2) a hindsight learning phase that converts search attempts into valid problem-solution pairs used to fine-tune the LLM's sampling and refinement capabilities\, -- \,enabling increasingly effective search in subsequent iterations.
  On the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, SOAR achieves significant performance gains across model scales and iterations, leveraging positive transfer between the sampling and refinement finetuning tasks. These improvements carry over to test-time adaptation, enabling SOAR to solve 52\% of the public test set. Our code is open-sourced at: https://github.com/flowersteam/SOAR

Abstract: Inspired by the prevalence of recurrent circuits in biological brains, we investigate the degree to which directionality is a helpful inductive bias for artificial neural networks. Taking directionality as topologically-ordered information flow between neurons, we formalise a perceptron layer with all-to-all connections (mathematically equivalent to a weight-tied recurrent neural network) and demonstrate that directionality, a hallmark of modern feed-forward networks, can be induced rather than hard-wired by applying appropriate pruning techniques. Across different random seeds our pruning schemes successfully induce greater topological ordering in information flow between neurons without compromising performance, suggesting that directionality is not a prerequisite for learning, but may be an advantageous inductive bias discoverable by gradient descent and sparsification.

Abstract: Goal: Epilepsy remains under-diagnosed in low-income countries due to scarce neurologists and costly diagnostic tools. We propose a graph-based deep learning framework to detect epilepsy from low-cost Electroencephalography (EEG) hardware, tested on recordings from Nigeria and Guinea-Bissau. Our focus is on fair, accessible automatic assessment and explainability to shed light on epilepsy biomarkers. Methods: We model EEG signals as spatio-temporal graphs, classify them, and identify interchannel relationships and temporal dynamics using graph attention networks (GAT). To emphasize connectivity biomarkers, we adapt the inherently node-focused GAT to analyze edges. We also designed signal preprocessing for low-fidelity recordings and a lightweight GAT architecture trained on Google Colab and deployed on RaspberryPi devices. Results: The approach achieves promising classification performance, outperforming a standard classifier based on random forest and graph convolutional networks in terms of accuracy and robustness over multiple sessions, but also highlighting specific connections in the fronto-temporal region. Conclusions: The results highlight the potential of GATs to provide insightful and scalable diagnostic support for epilepsy in underserved regions, paving the way for affordable and accessible neurodiagnostic tools.

Abstract: The research community continues to seek increasingly more advanced synthetic data generators to reliably evaluate the strengths and limitations of machine learning methods. This work aims to increase the availability of datasets encompassing a diverse range of problem complexities by proposing a genetic algorithm that optimizes a set of problem complexity measures for classification and regression tasks towards specific targets. For classification, a set of 10 complexity measures was used, while for regression tasks, 4 measures demonstrating promising optimization capabilities were selected. Experiments confirmed that the proposed genetic algorithm can generate datasets with varying levels of difficulty by transforming synthetically created datasets to achieve target complexity values through linear feature projections. Evaluations involving state-of-the-art classifiers and regressors revealed a correlation between the complexity of the generated data and the recognition quality.

Abstract: The challenging deployment of compute- and memory-intensive methods from Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based Continual Learning (CL) underscores the critical need for a paradigm shift towards more efficient approaches. Neuromorphic Continual Learning (NCL) appears as an emerging solution, by leveraging the principles of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) which enable efficient CL algorithms executed in dynamically-changed environments with resource-constrained computing systems. Motivated by the need for a holistic study of NCL, in this survey, we first provide a detailed background on CL, encompassing the desiderata, settings, metrics, scenario taxonomy, Online Continual Learning (OCL) paradigm, recent DNN-based methods to address catastrophic forgetting (CF). Then, we analyze these methods considering CL desiderata, computational and memory costs, as well as network complexity, hence emphasizing the need for energy-efficient CL. Afterward, we provide background of low-power neuromorphic systems including encoding techniques, neuronal dynamics, network architectures, learning rules, hardware processors, software and hardware frameworks, datasets, benchmarks, and evaluation metrics. Then, this survey comprehensively reviews and analyzes state-of-the-art in NCL. The key ideas, implementation frameworks, and performance assessments are also provided. This survey covers several hybrid approaches that combine supervised and unsupervised learning paradigms. It also covers optimization techniques including SNN operations reduction, weight quantization, and knowledge distillation. Then, this survey discusses the progress of real-world NCL applications. Finally, this paper provides a future perspective on the open research challenges for NCL, since the purpose of this study is to be useful for the wider neuromorphic AI research community and to inspire future research in bio-plausible OCL.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16711">TSkips: Efficiency Through Explicit Temporal Delay Connections in Spiking Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.16711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with their bio-inspired Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons inherently capture temporal information. This makes them well-suited for sequential tasks like processing event-based data from Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) and event-based speech tasks. Harnessing the temporal capabilities of SNNs requires mitigating vanishing spikes during training, capturing spatio-temporal patterns and enhancing precise spike timing. To address these challenges, we propose TSkips, augmenting SNN architectures with forward and backward skip connections that incorporate explicit temporal delays. These connections capture long-term spatio-temporal dependencies and facilitate better spike flow over long sequences. The introduction of TSkips creates a vast search space of possible configurations, encompassing skip positions and time delay values. To efficiently navigate this search space, this work leverages training-free Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to identify optimal network structures and corresponding delays. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on four event-based datasets: DSEC-flow for optical flow estimation, DVS128 Gesture for hand gesture recognition and Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) and Spiking Speech Commands (SSC) for speech recognition. Our method achieves significant improvements across these datasets: up to 18% reduction in Average Endpoint Error (AEE) on DSEC-flow, 8% increase in classification accuracy on DVS128 Gesture, and up to 8% and 16% higher classification accuracy on SHD and SSC, respectively.

                arXiv:2501.15129v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (EvoRL) has emerged as a promising approach to overcoming the limitations of traditional reinforcement learning (RL) by integrating the Evolutionary Computation (EC) paradigm with RL. However, the population-based nature of EC significantly increases computational costs, thereby restricting the exploration of algorithmic design choices and scalability in large-scale settings. To address this challenge, we introduce $\texttt{$\textbf{EvoRL}$}$, the first end-to-end EvoRL framework optimized for GPU acceleration. The framework executes the entire training pipeline on accelerators, including environment simulations and EC processes, leveraging hierarchical parallelism through vectorization and compilation techniques to achieve superior speed and scalability. This design enables the efficient training of large populations on a single machine. In addition to its performance-oriented design, $\texttt{$\textbf{EvoRL}$}$ offers a comprehensive platform for EvoRL research, encompassing implementations of traditional RL algorithms (e.g., A2C, PPO, DDPG, TD3, SAC), Evolutionary Algorithms (e.g., CMA-ES, OpenES, ARS), and hybrid EvoRL paradigms such as Evolutionary-guided RL (e.g., ERL, CEM-RL) and Population-Based AutoRL (e.g., PBT). The framework's modular architecture and user-friendly interface allow researchers to seamlessly integrate new components, customize algorithms, and conduct fair benchmarking and ablation studies. The project is open-source and available at: https://github.com/EMI-Group/evorl.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02146">Brain-Inspired Online Adaptation for Remote Sensing with Spiking Neural Network</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.02146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On-device computing, or edge computing, is becoming increasingly important for remote sensing, particularly in applications like deep network-based perception on on-orbit satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In these scenarios, two brain-like capabilities are crucial for remote sensing models: (1) high energy efficiency, allowing the model to operate on edge devices with limited computing resources, and (2) online adaptation, enabling the model to quickly adapt to environmental variations, weather changes, and sensor drift. This work addresses these needs by proposing an online adaptation framework based on spiking neural networks (SNNs) for remote sensing. Starting with a pretrained SNN model, we design an efficient, unsupervised online adaptation algorithm, which adopts an approximation of the BPTT algorithm and only involves forward-in-time computation that significantly reduces the computational complexity of SNN adaptation learning. Besides, we propose an adaptive activation scaling scheme to boost online SNN adaptation performance, particularly in low time-steps. Furthermore, for the more challenging remote sensing detection task, we propose a confidence-based instance weighting scheme, which substantially improves adaptation performance in the detection task. To our knowledge, this work is the first to address the online adaptation of SNNs. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets across classification, segmentation, and detection tasks demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation and domain generalization approaches under varying weather conditions. The proposed method enables energy-efficient and fast online adaptation on edge devices, and has much potential in applications such as remote perception on on-orbit satellites and UAV.

                arXiv:2504.19027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly important in decision-critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and law. Counterfactual (CF) explanations, a key approach in XAI, provide users with actionable insights by suggesting minimal modifications to input features that lead to different model outcomes. Despite significant advancements, existing CF generation methods often struggle to balance proximity, diversity, and robustness, limiting their real-world applicability. A widely adopted framework, Diverse Counterfactual Explanations (DiCE), emphasizes diversity but lacks robustness, making CF explanations sensitive to perturbations and domain constraints. To address these challenges, we introduce DiCE-Extended, an enhanced CF explanation framework that integrates multi-objective optimization techniques to improve robustness while maintaining interpretability. Our approach introduces a novel robustness metric based on the Dice-S{\o}rensen coefficient, enabling stability under small input variations. Additionally, we refine CF generation using weighted loss components (lambda_p, lambda_d, lambda_r) to balance proximity, diversity, and robustness. We empirically validate DiCE-Extended on benchmark datasets (COMPAS, Lending Club, German Credit, Adult Income) across multiple ML backends (Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow). Results demonstrate improved CF validity, stability, and alignment with decision boundaries compared to standard DiCE-generated explanations. Our findings highlight the potential of DiCE-Extended in generating more reliable and interpretable CFs for high-stakes applications. Future work could explore adaptive optimization techniques and domain-specific constraints to further enhance CF generation in real-world scenarios

                arXiv:2505.12982v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that evolutionary algorithms can benefit from dynamic choices of the key parameters that control their behavior, to adjust their search strategy to the different stages of the optimization process. A prominent example where dynamic parameter choices have shown a provable super-constant speed-up is the $(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$ Genetic Algorithm optimizing the OneMax function. While optimal parameter control policies result in linear expected running times, this is not possible with static parameter choices. This result has spurred a lot of interest in parameter control policies. However, many works, in particular theoretical running time analyses, focus on controlling one single parameter. Deriving policies for controlling multiple parameters remains very challenging. In this work we reconsider the problem of the $(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$ Genetic Algorithm optimizing OneMax. We decouple its four main parameters and investigate how well state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning techniques can approximate good control policies. We show that although making deep reinforcement learning learn effectively is a challenging task, once it works, it is very powerful and is able to find policies that outperform all previously known control policies on the same benchmark. Based on the results found through reinforcement learning, we derive a simple control policy that consistently outperforms the default theory-recommended setting by $27\%$ and the irace-tuned policy, the strongest existing control policy on this benchmark, by $13\%$, for all tested problem sizes up to $40{,}000$.

                arXiv:2506.19037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) promise fast, non-autoregressive text generation, yet existing samplers, which pick tokens to unmask based on model confidence, ignore interactions when unmasking multiple positions in parallel and effectively reduce to slow, autoregressive behavior. We propose the Dilated Unmasking Scheduler (DUS), an inference-only, planner-model-free method that partitions sequence positions into non-adjacent dilated groups and unmasked them in parallel so as to minimize an upper bound on joint entropy gain at each denoising step. By explicitly trading off the number of network calls against generation quality, DUS recovers most of the performance lost under traditional parallel unmasking strategies. Across math (GSM8K, MATH500), code (HumanEval, MBPP) and general-knowledge benchmarks (BBH, MMLU-Pro), DUS outperforms confidence-based planners, without modifying the underlying denoiser, and reveals the true speed-quality frontier of MDLMs.

                <p>It has long been hypothesized that the nervous system uses the direction of gravity to align the various sensory systems when interacting with the external world. In line with this hypothesis, systematic drift in hand-path orientation was recently observed during targeted arm motions performed with eyes closed in weightlessness or, on Earth, for longitudinal movements in a supine posture. No such drift was observed in upright posture on Earth. But the precise conditions under which participants exhibit such drift, and the factors that influence the magnitude of the drift, are not yet known. The objective of our study was to investigate if the upright posture, by virtue of being at a biomechanical singularity induced by the force of gravity, represents a unique condition in which drift in hand-path orientation is prevented. Human participants (male and female) performed sequences of repeated point-to-point arm movements between two visual targets aligned with the longitudinal body axis, first with eyes open, then with eyes closed. Participants performed these movements in various body orientations: seated upright, and tilted backward at 45, 90, and 135&deg;. We observed drift in hand-path orientation in the eyes-closed condition when the body was tilted, but not when it was upright. The directions and rates of drift were indistinguishable between the three tilted orientations tested (45, 90, and 135&deg;). These findings support the hypothesis that the upright posture is a unique configuration that facilitates sensorimotor transformations and prevents drift in path orientation when the eyes are closed.</p>

                <p>The prepositus hypoglossi nucleus (PHN), involved in horizontal gaze control, contributes to this function via cooperation with the vestibulocerebellum (VC). Furthermore, some PHN neurons have been observed to project to cerebellar regions outside the VC. We previously reported a neuronal population in the ventral caudal PHN that projects to lobules III&ndash;V of the anterior vermis or to the cerebellar hemispheric crus. Because the properties of these neurons have not been clarified, this study aimed to determine their localization, projections, and electrophysiological and morphological characteristics in male rats. Tracing experiments revealed that these neurons were clustered within the ventral caudal PHN, approximately between the bregma &ndash;12.72 and &ndash;12.00&nbsp;mm, and did not project to the uvula/nodulus (UN), which is part of the VC. Whole-cell recordings and morphological experiments revealed that these PHN neurons exhibited high input capacitance, low input resistance, low-frequency firing, prominent voltage sag, and a multipolar shape. These results indicate that a cluster of neurons in the ventral caudal PHN projecting to lobules III&ndash;V of the anterior vermis and hemispheric crus share distinct electrophysiological and morphological properties. Furthermore, these PHN neurons are likely to constitute a distinct subpopulation from PHN neurons projecting to the VC in terms of their projection targets. While previous research has focused on PHN projections to the VC and their role in ocular motor control, this study suggests that this subpopulation may be involved in other motor functions, as the cerebellar anterior vermis and hemisphere are known to contribute to broader motor control.</p>

Identifying risk genes associated with complex traits remains challenging. Integrating gene expression data with Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) through Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) methods has discovered candidate risk genes for various complex traits. Splicing, which explains a comparable heritability of complex traits as gene expression, is underexplored due to its multidimensionality. To leverage multiple splicing events in a gene and shared splicing across tissues, we develop Multi-tissue Splicing Gene (MTSG), which employs tensor decomposition and sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis (sCCA) to extract meaningful information from high-dimensional multiple splicing events across multiple tissues. We build MTSG models using GTEx data and apply them to GWAS summary statistics of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (111,326 cases and 677,663 controls) and schizophrenia (SCZ) (36,989 cases and 113,075 controls). We identify 174 and 497 significant splicing-mediated risk genes for AD and SCZ, respectively, at Bonferroni correction. For AD, our results demonstrate significant enrichment of AD related pathways and identify additional AD risk genes not detected in the single-tissue analysis, while preserving most top genes identified in the brain frontal cortex. Consistently, for SCZ, genes identified by our brain-wide MTSG model, built from a cluster of 13 brain tissues, exhibit stronger enrichment in SCZ-relevant genes and MTSG identifies unique SCZ risk genes compared to single-tissue models. These results showcase that our MTSG models capture distinctive splicing events across tissues, which might be overlooked when using single tissue alone. Our MTSG models can be applied to other complex traits to help identify splicing-mediated disease risk genes.

For unicellular organisms, the reproduction rate and growth are crucial fitness determinants and functional manifestations of the organism genotype. Using the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> as a model organism, we integrated metabolism, which provides energy and building blocks for growth, with cell mass growth and cell cycle progression into a low-granularity, multiscale (from cell to population) computational model. This model predicted that cells with constitutive respiration do not modulate cell size according to the growth conditions. We experimentally validated the model predictions using mutants with defects in the upper part of glycolysis or glucose transport. Plugging in molecular details of cellular subsystems allowed us to refine predictions from the cellular to the molecular level. Our hybrid multiscale modeling approach provides a framework for structuring molecular knowledge and predicting cell phenotypes under various genetic and environmental conditions.

                <p>by Lars Erik J. Skjegstad, Julius B. Kirkegaard</p>

The vascular network of leaves, comprising xylem and phloem, is a highly optimized system for the delivery of water, nutrients, and sugars. The design rules for these naturally occurring networks have been studied since the time of Leonardo da Vinci, who constructed a local rule for comparing the widths of in- and outgoing veins at branch points. Recently, physical models have been developed that seek to explain the full morphogenesis of leaf venial networks in which veins grow in response to local hydrodynamic feedback. Although these models go beyond simple local rules, they are challenging to compare to experimental data. Here, we extend these hydrodynamic models to a state where the direct comparison with images of full leaves becomes possible on the level of individual veins. We present a dataset of the venial networks of leaves that maintain full network topology and use this to discuss the benefits and drawbacks of such a direct comparison. We apply our approach to the direct estimation of a sink fluctuation parameter, demonstrating consistency within distinct leaf species. Finally, we utilize the ability of the model to run on full leaves to define and calculate exponents for a Murray’s law that applies to reticulate venation networks.

There is currently limited understanding of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) adaptation to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) proteins which mediate CD8 (HLA-I) and CD4 (HLA-II) T cell immune responses. We investigated population-level T cell immune escape in SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein at amino acid binding positions (the anchor motifs) preferred by the highly restrictive peptide binding grooves of the HLA. SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein sequences isolated in South Africa from January 2020 until June 2022, were used. All possible 9-mer and 15-mer peptides in the sequence alignment were scanned for matches to HLA-I and HLA-II anchor motifs, respectively. Peptide positions with matched anchor motifs and ≥1% mismatched sequences were investigated for immune escape using immunoinformatic prediction methods and directional evolution along the phylogenetic tree. Toggling of short-lived immune escape mutations at HLA-I anchor motifs was observed in 17 peptides across Spike. Eight of these overlapped with HLA-II escape mutations. Six mutations were related to zoonotic adaptation. All 17 sites were under significant directional evolution along the phylogenetic tree, and 16/17 are within published confirmed or inferred T cell epitopes. Immune escape predictions for HLA- A*66:01/A*68:01 were common (n = 7/17). HLA- A*02:05, A*03:01, B*07:02, B*08:01, B*58:01, DRB1*04:01 and DQA1*01:02-DQB1*06:02 were each associated with at least two escape mutations. This immunoinformatic prediction of T cell immune escape at HLA anchor motifs: (i)shortlisted potentially understudied population-specific HLA and immune escape (ii)revealed a footprint of underlying toggling of short-lived immune escape mutations, and (iii)has potential to cost-effectively guide pre-clinical research questions on the inclusion of partially conserved but dominant epitopes in vaccine immunogens.

                <p>by Thomas Robert Newton, Wilten Nicola</p>

Training spiking recurrent neural networks (SRNNs) presents significant challenges compared to standard recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that model neural firing rates more directly. Here, we investigate the origins of these difficulties by training networks of spiking neurons and their parameter-matched instantaneous rate-based RNNs on supervised learning tasks. We applied FORCE training to leaky integrate-and-fire spiking networks and their matched rate-based counterparts across various dynamical tasks, keeping the FORCE hyperparameters identical. We found that at slow learning rates, spiking and rate networks behaved similarly: FORCE training identified highly correlated weight matrix solutions, and both network types exhibited overlapping hyperparameter regions for successful convergence. Remarkably, these weight solutions were largely interchangeable—weights trained in the spiking network could be transferred to the rate network and vice versa while preserving correct dynamical decoding. However, at fast learning rates, the correlation between learned solutions dropped sharply, and the solutions were no longer fully interchangeable. Despite this, rate networks still functioned well when their weight matrices were replaced with those learned from spiking networks. Additionally, the two network types exhibited distinct behaviours across different sizes: faster learning improved performance in rate networks but had little effect in spiking networks, aside from increasing instability. Through analytic derivation, we further show that slower learning rates in FORCE effectively act as a low-pass filter on the principal components of the neural bases, selectively stabilizing the dominant correlated components across spiking and rate networks. Our results indicate that some of the difficulties in training spiking networks stem from the inherent spike-time variability in spiking systems—variability that is not present in rate networks. These challenges can be mitigated in FORCE training by selecting appropriately slow learning rates. Moreover, our findings suggest that the decoding solutions learned by FORCE for spiking networks approximate a cross-trial firing rate-based decoding.

                <p>by Jeffrey Keithley, Akash Choudhuri, Bijaya Adhikari, Sriram V. Pemmaraju</p>

As observed in the case of COVID-19, effective vaccines for an emerging pandemic tend to be in limited supply initially and must be allocated strategically. The allocation of vaccines can be modeled as a discrete optimization problem that prior research has shown to be computationally difficult (i.e., NP-hard) to solve even approximately. Using a combination of theoretical and experimental results, we show that this hardness result may be circumvented. We present our results in the context of a metapopulation model, which views a population as composed of geographically dispersed heterogeneous subpopulations, with arbitrary travel patterns between them. In this setting, vaccine bundles are allocated at a subpopulation level, and so the vaccine allocation problem can be formulated as a problem of maximizing an integer lattice function g:ℤ+K→ℝ subject to a budget constraint ‖x‖1≤D. We consider a variety of simple, well-known greedy algorithms for this problem and show the effectiveness of these algorithms for three problem instances at different scales: New Hampshire (10 counties, population 1.4 million), Iowa (99 counties, population 3.2 million), and Texas (254 counties, population 30.03 million). We provide a theoretical explanation for this effectiveness by showing that the approximation factor (a measure of how well the algorithmic output for a problem instance compares to its theoretical optimum) of these algorithms depends on the <i>submodularity ratio</i> of the objective function <i>g</i>. The submodularity ratio of a function is a measure of how distant <i>g</i> is from being submodular; here submodularity refers to the very useful “diminishing returns” property of set and lattice functions, i.e., the property that as the function inputs are increased the function value increases, but not by as much.

                <p>by Kendrick Kay, Jacob S. Prince, Thomas Gebhart, Greta Tuckute, Jingyang Zhou, Thomas Naselaris, Heiko H. Schütt</p>

Measurements of neural responses to identically repeated experimental events often exhibit large amounts of variability. This <i>noise</i> is distinct from <i>signal</i>, operationally defined as the average expected response across repeated trials for each given event. Accurately distinguishing signal from noise is important, as each is a target that is worthy of study (many believe noise reflects important aspects of brain function) and it is important not to confuse one for the other. Here, we describe a principled modeling approach in which response measurements are explicitly modeled as the sum of samples from multivariate signal and noise distributions. In our proposed method—termed Generative Modeling of Signal and Noise (GSN)—the signal distribution is estimated by subtracting the estimated noise distribution from the estimated data distribution. Importantly, GSN improves estimates of the signal distribution, but does not provide improved estimates of responses to individual events. We validate GSN using ground-truth simulations and show that it compares favorably with related methods. We also demonstrate the application of GSN to empirical fMRI data to illustrate a simple consequence of GSN: by disentangling signal and noise components in neural responses, GSN denoises principal components analysis and improves estimates of dimensionality. We end by discussing other situations that may benefit from GSN’s characterization of signal and noise, such as estimation of noise ceilings for computational models of neural activity. A code toolbox for GSN is provided with both MATLAB and Python implementations.

The biogenesis of mitochondria relies on the import of hundreds of different precursor proteins from the cytosol. Most of these proteins are synthesized with N-terminal presequences which serve as mitochondrial targeting signals. Presequences consistently form amphipathic helices, but they considerably differ with respect to their primary structure and length. Here we show that presequences can be classified into seven different groups based on their specific features. Using a test set of different presequences, we observed that group A presequences endow precursor proteins with improved in vitro import characteristics. We developed IQ-Compete (for Import and de-Quenching Competition assay), a novel assay based on fluorescence de-quenching, to monitor the import efficiencies of mitochondrial precursors in vivo. With this assay, we confirmed the increased import competence of group A presequences. Using mass spectrometry, we found that the presequence of the group A protein Oxa1 specifically recruits the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)-containing protein TOMM34 to the cytosolic precursor protein. TOMM34, and the structurally related yeast co-chaperone Cns1, apparently serve as a presequence-specific targeting factor which increases the import efficiency of a specific subset of mitochondrial precursor proteins. Our results suggest that presequences contain a protein-specific priority code that encrypts the targeting mechanism of individual mitochondrial precursor proteins.

Aggregation of the hyperphosphorylated tau protein is a central driver of Alzheimer’s disease, and its accumulation exhibits a rich spatiotemporal pattern that unfolds during the course of the disease, sequentially progressing through the brain across axonal connections. It is unclear how this spatiotemporal process is orchestrated, namely, to what extent the spread of pathologic tau is governed by transport between brain regions, local production, or both. To address this, we develop a mechanistic model from tau PET data to describe tau dynamics along the Alzheimer’s disease timeline. Our analysis reveals longitudinal changes in production and transport dynamics in two independent cohorts, with subjects in the early stage of the disease exhibiting transport-dominated spread, consistent with an initial spread of pathological tau seeds, and subjects in the late stage disease characterized primarily by local tau production. Further, we demonstrate that the model can predict accurately subject-specific longitudinal tau accumulation at the regional level, potentially providing a new clinical tool to monitor and classify patient disease progression.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Numerical-order ability, a strong predictor of arithmetic, is often impaired in children with developmental dyscalculia (DD). While previous research has shown altered brain responses in number-processing regions in DD compared to typically developing children (TD), little is known about how these regions interact during number processing. This exploratory study examined the effective connectivity between six regions in the right parietal, frontal, and insular cortex as well as the vermis, using dynamic causal modeling (DCM). We investigated how number-order and number-identification tasks modulate connectivity within this network and the group differences related to DD. The number-order task led primarily to increased excitatory connectivity from the pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA) to all other regions, indicating an orchestrating role of the preSMA. DD, who exhibited deficits in number-order performance, demonstrated aberrant modulation of incoming connectivity to the ventral premotor cortex (vPMC) from the anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS), the preSMA, and the dorsal anterior insula (d-aINS). In TD, number-identification led to inhibitory modulation from the vPMC to the aIPS and the vermis. While behavioral performance in number-identification was unimpaired in DD, they showed increased excitatory connectivity from dorsal and ventral PMC to the d-aINS and from vPMC to the aIPS. Our results imply that, for both impaired and unimpaired number-related behavioral performance, neuronal number processing differs between DD and TD. This conclusion is further supported by the high predictive validity of the modulating connectivity group-effect parameters. We suggest the underlying explanation for this pattern may be related to decreased acuity of neuronal number representation in DD.</p>

                Astrocytes are glial cells of the central nervous system (CNS) that perform an array of diverse functions that are essential for brain activity. Studies on the functional diversity of astrocytes suggest that such diversity may be derived from specialized populations. We provide an overview of the current state of research on astrocyte diversity and outline current challenges and knowledge gaps while also examining the developmental origins of these populations and how their interactions with neurons contribute to their functional heterogeneity. We highlight recent studies that provide evidence for functionally diverse astrocyte populations under homeostatic conditions and as an adaptive response to a range of experiences. This review provides a framework for understanding the dynamic and heterogeneous features of astrocytes across the CNS.

                Neuronal death is a defining feature of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and motor neuron diseases, and is accordingly a priority drug target. Among the various cell death pathways, ferroptosis, a form of regulated necrosis driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, has emerged as a prominent candidate underlying neurodegeneration. Despite its potential significance, putative triggers initiating lipid peroxidation cascades that lead to ferroptosis in neurodegenerative diseases remain poorly characterized. This poses significant challenges for developing targeted and disease-specific therapies. We review evidence of ferroptosis in neurodegenerative diseases and examine potential disease-relevant triggers of ferroptosis. We propose that ferroptosis, rather than being initiated by a single triggering event, emerges due to a cumulative erosion of anti-ferroptosis defense systems. This process is likely driven by context-dependent interplay between common hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases, including neuroinflammation, protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, altered lipid metabolism, and iron accumulation.

                Sonoda, Jiang, et al. examine how mixed convergent retinal inputs shape signals in mouse dLGN. Using optogenetics, they find that individual retinal cell types largely dominate postsynaptic responses despite anatomical and functional convergence. This supports a labeled line model of signal transmission, suggesting more conserved principles across mammals than previously suggested.

                Nuyttens et al. demonstrate that sepsis-associated hyperlactatemia results from impaired mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism. While MPC and PCX remain functional, thiamine deficiency suppresses PDC activity. Septic mitochondria do enhance GPT2 activity to consume some pyruvate and to induce glutamate-mediated TCA anaplerosis. Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) restores pyruvate oxidation, allowing a synergistic TPP-plus-glucose therapy.

                Antibiotic-induced disruption of the gut microbiome leads to a transient loss of microbiome diversity (bacterial and viral) and causes blooms of bacteria and their viruses. Our analysis suggests that these viruses (phages) prey on bacteria that become dominant, thereby preventing their dominance and contributing to the recovery of microbiome balance.

Recognizing the validity of both approaches dispels misunderstandings and unnecessary tension and promotes constructive interactions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104191">A single cysteine residue in vimentin regulates long non-coding RNA XIST to suppress epithelial–mesenchymal transition and stemness in breast cancer</a></h4>

              
                Vimentin is a type III intermediate filament (IF) protein that is induced in a large number of solid tumours. A single cysteine at position 328 in vimentin plays a crucial role in assembly, organisation, and stability of IFs. However, its exact function during epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer progression has not been investigated. To investigate this, we have transduced wildtype (WT) and C328S vimentin separately in MCF-7 cells that lack endogenous vimentin. The expression of C328-VIM impacted vimentin–actin interactions and induced EMT-like features that include enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion accompanied by reduced cell adhesion when compared to the wildtype cells. Functional transcriptomic studies confirmed the upregulation of EMT and mesenchymal markers, downregulation of epithelial markers, as well as acquisition of signatures associated with cancer stemness (<i>CD56, POU5F1, PROCR,</i> and <i>CD49f</i>), thus transforming MCF-7 cells from oestrogen-positive to triple-reduced (<i>ESR1, PGR,</i> and <i>HER2</i>) status. We also observed a stark increase in the expression of long non-coding RNA, <i>XIST,</i> in MCF-7 cells expressing C328-VIM. Targeting the mutant vimentin or <i>XIST</i> by RNA interference partially reversed the phenotypes in C328-VIM-expressing MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, the introduction of C328-VIM cells into nude mice promoted tumour growth by increasing cancer stemness in an oestrogen-independent manner. Altogether, our studies provide insight into how cysteine 328 in vimentin dictates mechano-transduction signals to remodel actin cytoskeleton and protect against EMT and cancer growth via modulating lncRNA <i>XIST</i>. Therefore, targeting vimentin and/or <i>XIST</i> via RNA interference should be a promising therapeutic strategy for breast cancer treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105277">Layilin regulates Treg motility and suppressive capacity in skin</a></h4>

              
                Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are essential for maintaining immune tolerance in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues. We discovered that layilin, a C-type lectin receptor, is predominantly expressed on Tregs in skin. Layilin was highly expressed on a subset of clonally expanded ‘effector’ Tregs in both healthy and psoriatic human skin. Layilin-expressing Tregs exhibited a transcriptional profile indicative of enhanced adhesion. Deletion of layilin in Tregs in mice in vivo resulted in significantly attenuated skin inflammation. Mechanistically, layilin enhanced in vitro human Treg adhesion via modulation of lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1, resulting in distinct cytoskeletal alterations consistent with enhanced focal adhesion and lamellipodia formation. Taken together, we define layilin as a critical regulator of Treg-suppressive capacity by modulating motility and adhesion in a non-lymphoid tissue.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99473">Ultrastructural sublaminar-specific diversity of excitatory synaptic boutons in layer 1 of the adult human temporal lobe neocortex</a></h4>

              
                Layer (L)1, beside receiving massive cortico-cortical, commissural and associational projections, is the termination zone of tufted dendrites of pyramidal neurons and the area of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike initiation. However, its synaptic organization in humans is not known. Quantitative 3D models of excitatory synaptic boutons (SBs) in L1 of the human temporal lobe neocortex were generated from neocortical biopsy tissue using transmission electron microscopy, 3D-volume reconstructions, and TEM tomography. Particularly, the size of active zones (AZs) and the readily releasable, recycling, and resting pool of synaptic vesicles (SVs) were quantified. The majority of excitatory SBs contained numerous mitochondria comprising ~7% of the total volume, had a large macular, non-perforated AZ (~0.20 µm<sup>2</sup>) and were predominantly located on dendritic spines. Excitatory SBs had a total pool of ~3500 SVs, a relatively large readily releasable (~4 SVs), recycling (~470 SVs) and resting (~2900 SVs) pool. Astrocytic coverage of excitatory SBs suggests both synaptic crosstalk or removal of spilled glutamate by astrocytic processes at synaptic complexes. The structural composition of SBs in L1 may underlie the function of L1 networks that mediate, integrate, and synchronize contextual and cross-modal information, enabling flexible and state-dependent processing of feedforward sensory inputs from other layers of the cortical column.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102906">Q-learning with temporal memory to navigate turbulence</a></h4>

              
                We consider the problem of olfactory searches in a turbulent environment. We focus on agents that respond solely to odor stimuli, with no access to spatial perception nor prior information about the odor. We ask whether navigation to a target can be learned robustly within a sequential decision making framework. We develop a reinforcement learning algorithm using a small set of interpretable olfactory states and train it with realistic turbulent odor cues. By introducing a temporal memory, we demonstrate that two salient features of odor traces, discretized in a few olfactory states, are sufficient to learn navigation in a realistic odor plume. Performance is dictated by the sparse nature of turbulent odors. An optimal memory exists which ignores blanks within the plume and activates a recovery strategy outside the plume. We obtain the best performance by letting agents learn their recovery strategy and show that it is mostly casting cross wind, similar to behavior observed in flying insects. The optimal strategy is robust to substantial changes in the odor plumes, suggesting minor parameter tuning may be sufficient to adapt to different environments.

                Orienting behaviors provide a continuous stream of information about an organism’s sensory experiences and plans. Thus, to study the links between sensation and action, it is useful to identify the neurons in the brain that control orienting behaviors. Here, we describe descending neurons in the <i>Drosophila</i> brain that predict and influence orientation (heading) during walking. We show that these cells have specialized functions: whereas one cell type predicts sustained low-gain steering, the other predicts transient high-gain steering. These latter cells integrate internally directed steering signals from the head direction system with stimulus-directed steering signals from multimodal sensory pathways. The inputs to these cells are organized to produce ‘see-saw’ steering commands, so that increasing output from one brain hemisphere is accompanied by decreasing output from the other hemisphere. Together, our results show that internal and external drives are integrated to produce descending motor commands with different timescales, for flexible and precise control of an organism’s orientation in space.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100162">Cntnap2 loss drives striatal neuron hyperexcitability and behavioral inflexibility</a></h4>

              
                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by two major diagnostic criteria – persistent deficits in social communication and interaction, and the presence of restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior (RRBs). Evidence from both human and animal model studies of ASD suggests that alteration of striatal circuits, which mediate motor learning, action selection, and habit formation, may contribute to the manifestation of RRBs. <i>CNTNAP2</i> is a syndromic ASD risk gene, and loss of function of <i>Cntnap2</i> in mice is associated with RRBs. How the loss of <i>Cntnap2</i> impacts striatal neuron function is largely unknown. In this study, we utilized <i>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice to test whether altered striatal neuron activity contributes to aberrant motor behaviors relevant to ASD. We find that <i>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice exhibit enhanced cortical drive of direct pathway striatal projection neurons (dSPNs). This enhanced drive is due to increased intrinsic excitability of dSPNs, which make them more responsive to cortical inputs. We find that <i>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice exhibit spontaneous repetitive behaviors, increased motor routine learning, perseveration, and cognitive inflexibility. Increased corticostriatal drive may therefore contribute to the acquisition of repetitive, inflexible behaviors in <i>Cntnap2</i> mice.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106469">Δ133p53α and Δ160p53α isoforms of the tumor suppressor protein p53 exert dominant-negative effect primarily by co-aggregation</a></h4>

              
                p53 is a tumor suppressor protein with multiple isoforms with shared or specific functions. However, two of its isoforms, Δ133p53α and Δ160p53α, with large N-terminal deletions, can cause cancer. These isoforms exert a dominant-negative effect on full-length p53 (FLp53), although the precise molecular mechanisms are unknown. Here, we investigate the mechanisms of action of Δ133p53α and Δ160p53α isoforms using chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase expression, subcellular fractionation, immunofluorescence assays, and apoptotic caspase activity assay. Our study elucidates that these DNA-binding deficient p53 isoforms form hetero-tetrameric complexes with FLp53 and disrupt FLp53’s DNA binding and transcriptional activities when present in a higher proportion than FLp53 in the tetramer. However, these structurally unstable isoforms promote vigorous protein aggregation involving FLp53, disrupting its structure and sequestering it in the cytoplasmic and nuclear aggregates, thereby limiting its availability to function as a transcription activator protein. Thus, co-aggregation of Δ133p53α and Δ160p53α with FLp53, rather than hetero-tetramerization, is likely the primary factor contributing to their dominant-negative effect. Modulating the stability and aggregation of p53 isoforms could be a novel strategy for cancer therapy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101413">Methamphetamine-induced adaptation of learning rate dynamics depend on baseline performance</a></h4>

              
                The ability to calibrate learning according to new information is a fundamental component of an organism’s ability to adapt to changing conditions. Yet, the exact neural mechanisms guiding dynamic learning rate adjustments remain unclear. Catecholamines appear to play a critical role in adjusting the degree to which we use new information over time, but individuals vary widely in the manner in which they adjust to changes. Here, we studied the effects of a low dose of methamphetamine (MA), and individual differences in these effects, on probabilistic reversal learning dynamics in a within-subject, double-blind, randomized design. Participants first completed a reversal learning task during a drug-free baseline session to provide a measure of baseline performance. Then they completed the task during two sessions, one with MA (20 mg oral) and one with placebo (PL). First, we showed that, relative to PL, MA modulates the ability to dynamically adjust learning from prediction errors. Second, this effect was more pronounced in participants who performed moderately low at baseline. These results present novel evidence for the involvement of catecholaminergic transmission on learning flexibility and highlights that baseline performance modulates the effect of the drug.

">Corticothalamic Layer 6 Controls Cortical Activity and Thalamic Firing Mode in a Bidirectional Manner</a></h4>

              
                Corticothalamic layer 6 (L6CT) modulates information flow between cortical and thalamic circuits. Previous research reported contrasting inhibitory or excitatory effects of L6CT on cortical dynamics, potentially reflecting technological discrepancies or physiological differences in L6CT function. To resolve these discrepancies, we combined translaminar, multi-channel in vivo electrophysiology in mouse primary somatosensory cortex (S1) with optogenetic L6CT activation across a range of stimulation regimes to manipulate L6CT firing rate and frequency. Increasing L6CT firing rates exerted a transition from inhibition to excitation across cortical layers. Furthermore, L6CT activity imparted population synchrony onto distinct cortical subpopulations, independent of changes in overall L6CT activity. In the thalamus, L6CT modulated thalamic burst in a bidirectional manner, dependent on L6CT stimulation frequency. These results demonstrate that S1 L6CT can bidirectionally modulate both cortical firing and thalamic firing mode, elucidating a more nuanced function of S1 L6CT in thalamic and cortical signalling than previously recognised.

">A naturalistic reinforcement learning task uncovers historical neural representations</a></h4>

              
                Exploration is essential for reinforcement learning (RL) in human development, facilitating cognitive and behavioral adaptation. However, conventional RL paradigms in neuroimaging studies often rely on highly constrained search spaces and artificial, non-naturalistic scenarios, limiting their capacity to reflect the complexity of real-world human exploration and decision-making. To address this gap, we developed a novel, naturalistic RL paradigm called Photographer, which involves a photograph-taking task set in a virtual street-view environment. Participants navigated city scenes and attempted to infer the paradigm's covert goal solely from feedback, defined as the conceptual similarity between their photograph and a hidden target sentence. Representational similarity analysis revealed that feedback history, an encoding of recent trial attempts, was robustly represented in the middle orbital gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus. These neural representations were consistently observed across two independent participant groups. Moreover, although the two regions coactivated during exploration, each was associated with a distinct functional network.

">Purkinje cell collaterals preferentially target a subtype of molecular layer interneuron</a></h4>

              
                In addition to providing outputs from the cerebellar cortex, Purkinje cell (PC) axon collaterals target other PCs, molecular layer interneurons (MLIs), and Purkinje layer interneurons (PLIs). It was recently shown that MLIs consist of two subtypes, but the properties of PC synapses onto these subtypes was not known and it was assumed that all PC collateral to MLI synapses would provide positive feedback to PCs. Clarifying the PC connectivity onto MLI subtypes is vital to understating the influence of feedback from PC collaterals because MLI1s primarily inhibit PCs whereas MLI2s mainly inhibit MLI1s and disinhibit PCs. Here we use a combination of serial EM and optogenetic studies to characterize PC synapses onto MLI subtypes in mice. EM reconstructions show that PCs make 53% of their synapses onto other PCs, 32% onto PLIs, 6% onto MLI1s and 7% onto MLI2s. Since there are far more MLI1s than MLI2s, each MLI2 is expected to receive many more synapses than each MLI1. In slice experiments, optogenetic activation of PCs evokes inhibitory currents in most MLI2s, but primarily disinhibits MLI1s. We also find that candelabrum cells, a type of PLI, form many more synapses onto MLI1s than MLI2s. It is therefore expected that both PC-MLI2-MLI1-PC and PC-PLI-MLI1-PC pathways allow increased PC firing to disinhibit MLI1s, which are known to reduce dendritic PC calcium signals and suppress plasticity at granule cell to PC synapses. These pathways provide negative feedback that act in concert with PC-PC synapses to counter elevations in PC firing.

">Network Signatures of Disease Progression and Core Symptoms in Dementia with Lewy Bodies Distinct from Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Background. Resting-state fMRI studies in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have described connectivity alterations in large-scale brain networks. However, little is known about functional changes across disease stages, particularly in DLB. Objective. To investigate functional connectivity of key brain networks in DLB patients at different stages, compare them to AD and healthy controls (HC) and examine associations with core clinical symptoms. Methods: Ninety DLB patients, comprising 63 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI-DLB) and 27 with dementia (d-DLB), along with 25 AD patients (11 MCI-AD and 14 d-AD) and 34 HC underwent clinical, neuropsychological and resting-state fMRI assessment. ROI-to-ROI analyses were performed using the CONN toolbox, (pFDR<0.05). Results: The DLB group showed reduced functional connectivity within the salience network (SN) compared with HC, but did not differ from AD. While MCI-DLB patients showed no significant differences, d-DLB patients showed reduced SN and frontoparietal network (FPN) connectivity compared to HC and AD. SN connectivity was associated with severity of fluctuations and FPN connectivity with REM sleep behavior disorder and cognitive decline in DLB. In contrast, in the AD group, decreased default mode network (DMN) connectivity was associated with lower MMSE scores. Conclusion: SN and FPN connectivity impairments relate to disease progression and core clinical features in DLB, whereas DMN connectivity is linked to cognitive decline in AD. These distinct patterns highlight divergent paths of network dysfunction in the two diseases, offering insight into their underlying mechanisms and clinical expression.

">Perspective matters: using past experiences to understand others' insensitivity to physical pain.</a></h4>

              
                Prior research has shown that autobiographical memory (AM) supports empathy, allowing individuals to use the self as a model for understanding others. However, when the subjective experience of an event diverges between observer and target, relying on AM may hinder empathic processes, rather than support them. In this study, we recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) data from 36 healthy young adults during a pain decision task to investigate empathy for individuals described as either sensitive to physical pain (like the participants) or clinically insensitive to physical pain. Participants reported lower empathy for insensitive than for sensitive targets, regardless of whether they had personally experienced the specific event that caused physical pain. Event-related potential (ERP) analyses revealed differences in neural responses to sensitive and insensitive targets at a late stage of processing, in the discending phase of the P300 component; these differences were positively correlated with individual differences in empathy. To determine the underlying mechanisms, we applied multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to assess whether empathy for physical pain relies on AM reactivation or instead engages active perspective taking. We observed that AM reactivation can serve as a flexible mechanism that supports empathy by enabling observers to shift perspective when direct experiential overlap is lacking.

">No neurobehavioral evidence for reduced motivational potential of social rewards in alcohol use disorder</a></h4>

              
                The mesolimbic dopamine system plays a central role in motivating behavior. In alcohol use disorder (AUD), this system is thought to be dysfunctional, leading to hyperreactivity to alcohol-related cues. In contrast, evidence on how individuals with AUD respond to alcohol-unrelated reward cues is inconclusive, and the motivation for social rewards has not yet been investigated. To address this gap, 36 individuals with AUD and 34 healthy controls performed an incentive delay task to assess social reward anticipation with a monetary and a non-reward control condition while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. The ventral striatum was defined as region of interest because of its central role in neuronal circuits for motivation. Neither behavioral nor neuroimaging data provided any evidence of altered motivation for social or monetary rewards in AUD. Exploratory whole-brain analyses only revealed stronger activation in the occipital/cuneal cortex in individuals with AUD than in healthy controls across all trials. Together, these results suggest that sensitivity to social reward cues is not fundamentally impaired in AUD. Furthermore, they imply that motivational changes related to the substance do not generally alter the reward potential of alcohol-unrelated domains in AUD, opening perspectives for social-behavioral treatments for this disorder.

">Neural and Behavioural Correlates of Variance of Sensory Evidence</a></h4>

              
                Neurobiology of perceptual decisions has largely focused on the neural correlates of the mean strength of sensory evidence. Much less is known about the neural coding of sensory variability. Here, we analyzed the EEG signals obtained from participants who judged the mean orientation of a sequence of gratings with varying variance but constant mean to identify the neural signatures of sensory variance and their relation to individual differences in choice confidence. The neural responses in the stimulus-entrained (4 Hz) and alpha (9 to11 Hz) bands tracked variability independently of mean. The frontal and centro-parietal regions demonstrated a quadratic relationship (i.e., strongest responses to intermediate levels of uncertainty) to the standard deviation of the sequence. The occipital response coded the visual stimulus variability linearly. These neural markers of variability were correlated with inter-individual differences in computational components of metacognition. Centro-parietal activity was most predictive of metacognitive sensitivity, aligning with its known role in evidence accumulation. These findings advance our understanding of how the brain dynamically encodes uncertainty and help better characterise the electrophysiological basis of individual differences in metacognitive evaluation.

">Forced exercise modulates retinal inflammatory response and regulates miRNA expression to promote retinal neuroprotection during degeneration</a></h4>

              
                Background: Our labs have demonstrated exercise is protective in animal models of retinal degeneration (RD). Inflammation drives RD progression, and is regulated by the recruitment and reactivity of glia cells as well as through small non-coding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs). Here, we explore the effects of treadmill exercise on the recruitment and reactivity of retinal inflammatory cells within the neural retina and miRNA expression in a light-induced retinal degeneration model (LIRD) that exhibits phenotypes found in patients with RD. Methods: Male 6-week-old BALB/c mice were randomly assigned to either active or inactive groups. Active groups were exercised by treadmill 1 hour a day for two weeks at a speed of 10m/min, meanwhile inactive groups were placed on static treadmills for the same duration. Light induced retinal degeneration (LIRD) was induced during the second week of exercise using light exposure of 5000 lux, control animals were kept at 50 lux. Retinal function was assessed using electroretinography (ERG) 5 days after LIRD. Retinas were collected 1-day and 5-days post-LIRD, sagittal sections were stained for inflammatory markers (GFAP and Iba1), TUNEL (cell death), and photoreceptor nuclei (outer nuclear layer; ONL) were quantified. RNA was extracted and miRNA expression quantified with GeneChip miRNA 4.0 array. Results: Active+LIRD mice demonstrated significant preservation of retinal function, evidenced by higher a-wave and b-wave amplitudes in ERG 5-days post-LIRD, compared to inactive+LIRD mice. Retinal sections from active+LIRD mice had fewer Iba1+ cells and decreased GFAP labeling 5-days post-LIRD compared to inactive+LIRD mice. Active+LIRD mice had fewer ONL TUNEL+ cells compared to inactive+LIRD mice. Inactive+LIRD mice showed a decline in ONL counts 1-day post-LIRD with significant loss 5-days post-LIRD compared to active+LIRD mice. In active groups, exercise promoted significant differences in miRNA expression, such as miR-302b, miR-192-5p, miR-187 compared to inactive groups. Conclusions: Our results indicate that treadmill exercise preserved photoreceptor density, slowed and or prevented apoptosis in the ONL, and decreased the presence/recruitment of inflammatory cells in the neural retina. Altered miRNA expression profiles in active groups are associated with cell survival (miR-302b), oxidative stress regulation (miR-192-5p) and photoreceptor homeostasis (miR-187). These results reveal how exercise alters the retinal inflammatory response over the course of 1-day to 5-days, providing insight into exercise-based therapies and treatments for RD and neuroinflammatory diseases.

">Fusiform Cells in the Dorsal Cochlear Nucleus Change Intrinsic Electrophysiological Properties and Morphologically Remodel Their Basal Dendrites with Age</a></h4>

              
                Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is the most common cause of sensorineural hearing loss. The cochlear nucleus, the first central auditory structure to receive input from the cochlea, has been shown to be disrupted by ARHL. Fusiform cells (FC), the principal output cell of the dorsal part of the cochlear nucleus (DCN), mature physiologically during hearing onset. Specifically, FCs increase in rate of action potential (AP) rise and decay, stabilizing by postnatal day 14 (P14) in mice. However, whether FC intrinsic electrophysiological properties and morphological characteristics continue to change throughout the life of mice, and how they change due to ARHL, is unknown. We characterized electrophysiological and morphological properties of FCs from CBA/CaJ mice at five stages of age: preweaning (P15-20), pubescent (P21-49), young adult (P50-179), mature adult (P180-364), and old adult (P550-578). Our old adult mice had smaller auditory brainstem evoked response amplitudes and loss of some hair cells, indicative of ARHL onset. We observed no change in FC membrane properties with age. FCs from the old adult group had elevated firing rates, faster repolarization rates, and shorter AP half-widths. Morphologically, there was no change in FC soma shape or size. However, a significant decrease in basal dendritic arborization occurred between preweaning and pubescent ages, followed by an increase in our old adult group, suggesting age-dependent remodeling of the basal dendritic tree at the onset of ARHL. Together, these results suggest that FC physiology and morphology are relatively stable post weaning and become altered during the onset of ARHL.

">Generation and characterization of a tamoxifen-inducible, Cre driver rat for transgene expression in microglia</a></h4>

              
                Microglia are the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) and display diverse functions under both physiological and pathological conditions. The past decade has seen burgeoning interest in microglia function, with a variety of transgenic tools developed for specific genetic manipulation of microglia in various injury, disease, and developmental models. Although the majority of models have been developed in mice, the ability to manipulate microglia in rats provides additional advantages to studying microglial function in the brain especially related to complex behavior. Using BAC transgenesis, our lab has created a transgenic rat (Cx3cr1-CreERT2) that expresses a tamoxifen inducible Cre recombinase (CreERT2) under control of the microglial/macrophage specific fractalkine C-X3-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 1 (Cx3cr1) promoter. In mice, CreERT2 and other transgenes have been expressed in microglia using the Cx3cr1 promoter, however, this is the first demonstration in rats. Importantly, these rats exhibit similar cognitive behaviors compared to their wildtype (WT) controls. Microglial specificity of inducible Cre expression was confirmed by breeding the novel Cx3cr1-CreERT2+/- rat with a previously reported double floxed inverse open reading frame (DIO)-mCherry+/- reporter rat to show tamoxifen inducible mCherry expression that colocalizes with the microglial marker Iba1. In addition, we utilize flow cytometry to demonstrate time and Cre dependent differences in recombination of Cx3cr1+ cells in the spleen, peripheral blood, and brain at two- and eight-weeks post-tamoxifen treatment. Overall, we have created a novel transgenic rat model for researchers to employ in understanding microglial and peripheral immune cell function in rats.

">Pharmacological inhibition of all known major inward cationic currents does not block the induction of spreading depolarizations</a></h4>

              
                Spreading depolarization (SD) is a wave of profound cellular depolarization that propagates across central nervous system tissue and causes a near-complete collapse of ionic gradients. Implicated in neuropathologies including seizures, migraine with aura, traumatic brain injury, and stroke, SD is experimentally induced in animals by electrical stimulation, mechanical injury, hypoxia, elevated extracellular potassium, and various other techniques. Despite extensive research, the mechanisms underlying SD initiation remain unclear. Prior research in rodents found that simultaneously blocking sodium, calcium, and glutamatergic (AMPA and NMDA) channels prevents SD induction whereas inhibiting any two of these three currents is insufficient. This suggests that SD induction could be a product of overstimulation of any single known inward cationic current. However, some researchers propose that SD induction occurs via an unknown SD channel. To further explore the role of known inward cationic currents in SD induction, we applied high potassium to two biological models, namely zebrafish and mice. First, we developed a novel ex vivo zebrafish model to assess SD induction in the optic tectum. Using KCl microinjection and DC local field potential recordings, we found that inhibition of sodium, calcium, and glutamatergic channels significantly decreased SD amplitude but never blocked SD induction in the zebrafish optic tectum. Similar pharmacological experiments in hippocampal mouse slices (CA1 subregion) also confirmed that SDs persist despite the same pharmacological cocktail. These findings suggest that additional mechanisms beyond sodium, calcium, and glutamatergic signaling contribute to SD induction, supporting the hypothesis that a currently unknown channel is critical in SD physiology.

">Dual-feature selectivity enables bidirectional coding in visual cortical neurons</a></h4>

              
                Sensory neurons are traditionally viewed as feature detectors that respond with an increase in firing rate to preferred stimuli while remaining unresponsive to others. Here, we identify a dual-feature encoding strategy in macaque visual cortex, wherein many neurons in areas V1 and V4 are selectively tuned to two distinct visual features---one that enhances and one that suppresses activity---around an elevated baseline firing rate. By combining neuronal recordings with functional digital twin models---deep learning-based predictive models of biological neurons---we were able to systematically identify each neuron's preferred and non-preferred features. These feature pairs served as anchors for a continuous, low-dimensional axis in natural image similarity space, along which neuronal activity varied approximately linearly. Within a single visual area, visual features that strongly or weakly activated individual neurons also had a high probability of modulating the activity of other neurons, suggesting a shared feature selectivity across the population that structures stimulus encoding. We show that this encoding strategy is conserved across species, present in both primary and lateral visual areas of mouse cortex. Dual-feature selectivity is consistent with recent anatomical evidence for feature-specific inhibitory connectivity, suggesting a coding strategy in which selective excitation and inhibition increase the representational capacity of the neuronal population.

">Comprehensive characterization of human color discrimination thresholds</a></h4>

              
                Discrimination thresholds reveal the limits of human perception; scientists have studied them since the time of Fechner in the 1800s. Forced-choice psychophysical methods combined with the method of constant stimuli or parametric adaptive trial-placement procedures are well-suited for measuring one-dimensional psychometric functions. However, extending these methods to characterize psychometric fields in higher-dimensional stimulus spaces, such as three-dimensional color space, poses a significant challenge. Here, we introduce a novel Wishart Process Psychophysical Model (WPPM) that leverages the smooth variation of threshold across stimulus space. We demonstrate the use of the WPPM in conjunction with a non-parametric adaptive trial-placement procedure by characterizing the full psychophysical field for color discrimination in the isoluminant plane. Each participant (N = 8) completed between 6,000 and 6,466 three-alternative forced-choice (3AFC) oddity color discrimination trials. The WPPM was fit to these trials. Importantly, once fit, the WPPM allows readout of discrimination performance between any pair of stimuli, providing a comprehensive characterization of the psychometric field. In addition, the WPPM readouts were validated for each participant by comparison with 25 probe psychometric functions. These were measured with an additional 6,000 trials per participant that were held out from the WPPM fit. The dataset offers a foundational resource for developing perceptual color metrics and for benchmarking mechanistic models of color processing. This approach is broadly generalizable to other perceptual domains beyond color.

                Fibrils of misfolded -synuclein (-syn) accumulate in Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies, spreading between cells to template further misfolding and drive neurodegeneration. -syn fibril entry into healthy neurons is recognized as a key step in the disease process but remains ill-defined mechanistically. Here, we comprehensively assessed the membrane proteome for binding of -syn fibrils. Expression cloning identified mGluR4 and Npdc1 as plasma membrane proteins expressed by substantia nigra neurons capable of supporting high affinity -syn fibril binding. Moreover, mGluR4 and Npdc1 cellular signaling functions were titrated by the presence of extracellular fibrillary -syn. While striatal -syn fibril injection led to nigral dopamine neuron loss in wild type mice, deletion of either Grm4 or Npdc1 provided protection of dopamine neurons. We observed mGluR4 and Npdc1 to form a complex that regulates mGluR4 signaling. Cultured neurons lacking both Grm4 and Npdc1 fail to bind -syn fibrils, to accumulate phosphorylated -syn and to lose synapses. Transheterozygous Grm4, Npdc1 mice showed protection from nigral neuron loss after striatal -syn injection, demonstrating genetic interaction between the two binding proteins. On a transgenic -syn A53T background, double Grm4, Npdc1 heterozygosity robustly increased mouse survival, motor function and spinal motoneuron number. Thus, a cell surface mGluR4-Npdc1 complex participates in -syn neurodegeneration.

">A deep learning framework for understanding cochlear implants</a></h4>

              
                Sensory prostheses replace dysfunctional sensory organs with electrical stimulation but currently fail to restore normal perception. Outcomes may be limited by stimulation strategies, neural degeneration, or suboptimal decoding by the brain. We propose a deep learning framework to evaluate these issues by estimating best-case outcomes with task-optimized decoders operating on simulated prosthetic input. We applied the framework to cochlear implants--the standard treatment for deafness--by training artificial neural networks to recognize and localize sounds using simulated auditory nerve input. The resulting models exhibited speech recognition and sound localization that was worse than that of normal hearing listeners, and on par with the best human cochlear implant users, with similar results across the three main stimulation strategies in current use. Speech recognition depended heavily on the extent of decoder optimization for implant input, with lesser influence from other factors. The results identify performance limits of current devices and demonstrate a model-guided approach for understanding the limitations and potential of sensory prostheses.

We have shown that following nerve injury in mice cytotoxic Natural Killer (NK) cells infiltrate the peripheral nerve and interact with stress-induced ligands of the activating receptor NKG2D (Klrk1). However, the diversity and specificity of NKG2D receptor ligands among sensory neuron subtypes, and translation of this mechanism to humans, remains unknown. We used dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons cultured from C57BL/6J mice of both sexes with fluorescently-labelled sensory neuron lineages (Scn10a, Mrgprd, Calca, Trpv1, Th, Thy1), as well as human induced pluripotent stem cell derived (hiPSCd)-sensory neurons after laser ablation, as in vitro models of axonal injury. We assessed expression of NKG2D ligands by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) corroborated by publicly available RNA sequencing datasets and validated with single-cell PCR. Recombinant NKG2D receptor proteins in live cell-based assays were used to reveal the subcellular membrane localisation of NKG2D ligands with quantification by a semi-automated image analysis. Functional interactions between human NK cells and sensory neurons were confirmed with co-cultures in microfluidic devices. We show that NKG2D ligands are expressed exclusively in unmyelinated DRG neurons after injury. NKG2D-receptors bound to puncta along distal neurites of injured axons enriched predominantly in Mrgprd-expressing non-peptidergic nociceptors. We observed low-level binding of human NKG2D-receptors to neurites of hiPSCd sensory neurons that increased after axonal laser ablation. Degeneration of hiPSCd sensory neurons neurites by interleukin (IL-2) primed human NK cells was prevented by an NKG2D blocking antibody. The induction and enrichment of functional NKG2D receptor ligands selectively on pathological nerve fibres could aid the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy in chronic pain conditions, and sheds new light on the potential role of nociceptive neurons in regulating the local tissue immune microenvironment.

">Increased Exertion Variability is Linked to Disruptions in Effort Assessment in Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                Accurate assessment of exertion is crucial for determining whether to continue or rest during physical activity. Individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) often report fatigue and motor impairments, yet the mechanisms underlying their assessments of effortful exertion remain poorly understood. Recent work with healthy individuals suggests that motor variability can distort judgments of effort; however, this relationship has not been explored in individuals with MS. In this study, we investigated how variability in physical exertion affects effort assessment in individuals with MS compared to healthy participants. We had participants exert varying levels of physical effort and retrospectively assess the effort they exerted. Individuals with MS exhibited increased exertion variability and tended to overreport their levels of exertion compared to healthy participants. Increased exertion variability was associated with less accurate effort assessment, and this effect was more pronounced in individuals with more advanced MS. These results suggest a possible mechanism through which motor variability may be associated with inflated perceptions of effort in MS, highlighting a potential account of why efforts feel particularly costly to those individuals living with MS and identifying a promising target for treatment and rehabilitation.

">Shared and modality-specific brain networks underlying predictive coding of temporal sequences</a></h4>

              
                Predictive coding posits that the brain continuously generates and updates internal models to anticipate incoming sensory input. While auditory and visual modalities have been studied independently in this context, direct comparisons using matched paradigms are scarce. Here, we employed magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate how the brain of 83 participants encodes and consciously recognises temporally unfolding sequences that acquire Gestalt-like structure over time, a feature rarely addressed in cross-modal research. Participants memorised matched auditory and visual sequences with coherent temporal structure and later identified whether test sequences were familiar or novel. Multivariate decoding revealed robust discrimination between the brain mechanisms underlying encoding and recognition of memorised and novel sequences, with sustained temporal generalisation in the auditory domain and time-specific responses in the visual domain. Using the BROAD-NESS pipeline, we identified modality-specific and supramodal brain networks. Auditory memory engaged auditory cortex, cingulate gyrus, and hippocampus, whereas visual memory involved orbitofrontal cortex and visual areas. Notably, both modalities recruited a shared network including hippocampus and medial cingulate during recognition. These findings provide compelling evidence for distinct and shared predictive learning mechanisms across sensory systems, advancing our understanding of how the brain integrates and evaluates temporally structured, Gestalt-like information.

">A morphological comparison of the caudal rami of the superior temporal sulcus in humans, chimpanzees, and other great apes</a></h4>

              
                For centuries, anatomists have charted the folding patterns of the sulci of the cerebral cortex in primates. Improvements in neuroimaging technologies over the past decades have led to advancements in understanding of the sulcal organization of the human cerebral cortex, yet comparisons to chimpanzees, one of humans' closest extant phylogenetic relatives, remain to be performed in many regions, such as superior temporal cortex. For example, while several posterior branches, or rami, of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) have been identified in great apes since the late 1800s, no study has yet to comprehensively identify and quantitatively compare these rami across species. To fill this gap in knowledge, in the present study, we defined the three caudal branches of the STS (cSTS) in 72 human and 29 chimpanzee brains (202 total hemispheres) and then extracted and compared the morphological (depth and surface area) properties of these sulci. We report three main findings. First, modern methods replicate classic findings that three rami of the posterior STS are unique to the hominid lineage (i.e., humans and great apes). Second, normalizing for brain size, the cSTS rami were relatively deeper in chimpanzees compared to humans. Third, the cSTS branches were relatively larger in surface area in humans compared to chimpanzees. Finally, we share probabilistic predictions of the cSTS to guide the identification of these sulci in future studies. Altogether, these findings bridge the gap between historic qualitative observations and modern quantitative measurements in a part of the brain that has expanded substantially throughout evolution and that is involved in human-specific aspects of cognition.

">Starvation transforms signal encoding in C. elegans thermoresponsive neurons and suppresses heat avoidance via bidirectional glutamatergic and peptidergic signaling</a></h4>

              
                Animals must continuously adapt their behavioral outputs in response to changes in internal state, including nutritional state. Here, we show that starvation induces a profound and progressive suppression of thermonociceptive behavior in Caenorhabditis elegans. The thermoresponsive sensory neurons AWCs mediate robust heat-evoked reversals over a broad range of stimulus intensities via glutamate and FLP-6 neuropeptide signaling, each covering distinct heat intensity ranges. After six hours of food deprivation, heat-evoked reversal responses are nearly abolished, independently of any external food odor cues. Prolonged food deprivation triggers a switch in AWC heat-evoked activity patterns, transitioning from a predictable, stimulus-locked response mode to a heterogeneous and stochastic regime. This switch relies on ASI neurons, proposed to work as internal state-sensing neurons. INS-32 and NLP-18 neuropeptide signals from ASI switch from a reversal-promoting to a reversal-inhibiting effect. Glutamatergic transmission from non-AWC neurons is also engaged to suppress reversals. Our findings define a circuit logic by which nociceptive responsiveness gating by internal nutritional state is linked to dynamic modulation of sensory neuron activity patterns and orchestrated by bidirectional glutamatergic and neuropeptidergic signals. More broadly, this study illustrates how sensory systems integrate metabolic information to prioritize behavioral outputs under changing physiological conditions, providing mechanistic insight into the plastic coupling between sensation, internal state, and action selection.

">Neuron-derived extracellular vesicles in plasma present a potential non-invasive biomarker for Huntingtin protein and RNA assessment in Huntington disease</a></h4>

              
                Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the HTT gene encoding an elongated polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin (HTT) protein. The use of biomarkers has become a major component in preclinical studies focusing on HTT lowering strategies. Quantification of soluble mutant HTT (mHTT) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has served as a pharmacodynamic readout and as potential disease progression biomarker. However, development of future assays for HTT measurement from other biofluids, such as blood, will facilitate the access to human samples since CSF collection is an invasive outpatient procedure. Brain cells, in particular neurons, secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) that cross the blood-brain barrier and circulate in blood. Importantly, EVs have been identified to be involved in HTT export from cells to the extracellular space. However, it is unknow which vesicle subtype correlates better with HD progression. Our work investigates the potential of EVs as non-invasive sources of clinical biomarkers in liquid biopsies. We developed an optimized ultracentrifugation protocol for the purification of ectosomes and exosomes from human samples and plasma of humanized HD mouse models. Ectosomes are larger vesicles that bud from the plasma membrane of cells, whereas exosomes originate from multivesicular bodies and are afterwards released to the extracellular space. Consistent with previous published data in other model systems, ectosomes isolated from plasma of the Hu97/18 mouse model contain both wild-type (WT) and mHTT in higher levels than in exosomes. Similar results were observed in media from HD iPSC-differentiated neurons and in Hu97/18 primary neuronal cultures. Interestingly, we also found higher levels of HTT transcripts in this EV subtype. We further demonstrate that initial storage of the samples using a slow freezing protocol preserves HTT and EV protein marker levels, highlighting the importance of sample preparation for EV isolation and analysis. Our results also show that plasma contains vesicles originated from neuronal cells that can be isolated using neuron-specific markers, such as ATPase Na+/K+ transporting subunit alpha 3 (ATP1A3), allowing the evaluation of HTT levels in the brain through vesicles circulating in the blood. Overall, our results demonstrate that HTT protein measurement from EVs isolated from blood can be a potential less-invasive disease biomarker. We also demonstrate that EVs subtypes contain different HTT protein and RNA levels, important for the development of consistent and reliable biomarkers. Further characterization of neuron-specific EVs content from patient-derived biofluids will lead to the development of novel clinical biomarkers and for evaluation of therapeutic strategies.

">Investigating the sensitivity of the diffusion MRI signal to magnetization transfer and permeability via Monte-Carlo simulations</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: Magnetization transfer (MT) and water exchange via permeability operate on a similar spatiotemporal scale to water diffusion. In this study, we use a simulation-based approach to characterise how MT and permeability impact (1) diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) measurements from cylindrical substrates and (2) parameter estimation using a two-compartment model of white matter. Methods: We used Monte-Carlo simulations to model the dMRI signal inside and outside axons by simulating signals from parallel cylinders with different diameters and volume densities. We subsequently introduced membrane permeability and MT at the cylinder walls to investigate their impact on the dMRI signal. We fitted a two-compartment model to the simulated signal to produce estimates of the cylinder diameter and density. We evaluated the impact of MT and permeability by comparing the fitted diameter and density to the simulated ground truth. Results: Permeability leads to underestimation (up to 100%) of cylinder diameter and density. Specifically, by enabling isochromats to escape from restrictions and diffuse more freely, permeability makes the overall displacement profile closer to the extra-axonal displacement profile. MT had limited effects on diameter estimation but caused substantial bias (20-50%) in volume density estimates depending on the ratio of the intra-axonal and extra-axonal volume fraction. This is due to the intra-axonal and extra-axonal space having different surface-to-volume ratios and therefore different surface relaxation rates. Conclusion: Permeability and MT can considerably influence the dMRI signal. They increase the relative contribution from larger cylinders to the dMRI signal and bias microstructural parameter estimates derived from dMRI data.

However, there is only limited behavioral and neural evidence regarding the relationship between social status and the construction of trust.

Human participants assumed the role of trustor and engaged in interactions with fictitious partners (trustees) who varied in social status. Participants were more inclined to trust Superiors than Inferiors and gradually modified their trust decisions based on their partners’ reciprocity. Furthermore, we unveiled the neurocomputational mechanisms of two cognitive processes: (i) prior-based static modulation supported by the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), amygdala, and their neural coupling, and (ii) the reward network engaged in feedback-based dynamic modulation. We also found that prior bias in the social value of social status can reduce the reliance on the feedback-based dynamic modulation rooted in the vmPFC and ventral striatum. The present findings enhance the understanding of the neural representations of how social status modulates trust-related processing and trustworthiness updating.</span>

">Maturation of Dorsal Association Tracts during Preadolescence Links to Concurrent and Future Cognitive Performance and Transdiagnostic Psychopathology</a></h4>

              
                Many psychiatric disorders begin during adolescence, coinciding with the rapid development of brain white matter (WM). However, it remains unclear whether deviations from normal WM maturation during this age period contribute to the development of psychopathology. In this study, we developed and validated normative models of brain age based on specific WM tracts using three large-scale developmental datasets (a total of ~10,000 subjects). We found that tract-specific deviations in WM development of association and limbic/subcortical systems were linked to concurrent cognition and psychopathology. The spatial pattern of the association system aligned closely with distributions of high-order brain networks, and with mitochondrial content and respiratory capacity. The maturation of the association system contributed significantly to better cognitive performance assessed two or three years later. Importantly, delayed WM development especially in dorsal association tracts predicted psychiatric disorders across diagnoses and disorder onset over a 2-year follow-up. By identifying tract-specific WM development during preadolescence as a predictor of cognitive capacity and psychiatric disorder risks, this study provides a valuable framework for tracking individualized brain maturation and understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of cognitive performance and transdiagnostic psychopathology.

">Deformed Probability Estimation in Goal-Directed reinforcement learning model explains anxious-depression dimensions of psychiatric disorders</a></h4>

              
                Psychiatric disorders are complex, multi-dimensional pathologies rooted in diverse cognitive processes. Computational psychiatry aims to reveal distortions in these processes through behavior modeling, providing a deeper understanding of psychiatric disorders. Previous studies, using Daws two-stage task, had linked the imbalance between habitual/model-free and goal-directed/model-based behaviors to disorders with compulsive behaviors and intrusive thoughts. The model-based component relies on the estimation of environmental probabilities. Therefore, we added a well-known deformation in subjective probability estimation to the model and this improved the model fitting. More importantly, the fitted deformation explains some variance of the anxious-depression dimension of psychiatric symptoms. The deformation parameter is aligned with the description-experience gap in decision-making literature. Our results point to subjective possibly distortion as the probable underlying cognitive process of anxiety, apathy, and depression. This study also shows that the inclusion of cognitive biases in modeling can extract the hidden aspects of behavior possibility linked to disorders. Our approach enhances the precision of computational psychiatry and provides deeper insights into the cognitive processes underlying psychiatric symptoms, paving the way for more effective, personalized therapeutic strategies.

">Barcoded Rabies In Situ Connectomics for high-throughput reconstruction of neural circuits</a></h4>

              
                Sequencing of oligonucleotide barcodes holds promise as a high-throughput approach for reconstructing synaptic connectivity at scale. Rabies viruses can act as a vehicle for barcode transmission, thanks to their ability to spread between synaptically connected cells. However, applying barcoded rabies viruses to map synaptic connections in vivo has proved challenging. Here, we develop Barcoded Rabies In Situ Connectomics (BRISC) for high-throughput connectivity mapping in the mouse brain. To ensure that the majority of post-synaptic "starter" neurons are uniquely labeled with distinct barcode sequences, we first generated libraries of rabies viruses with sufficient diversity to label >1000 neurons uniquely. To minimize the probability of barcode transmission between starter neurons, we developed a strategy to tightly control their density. We then applied BRISC to map inputs of single neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1). Using in situ sequencing, we read out the expression of viral barcodes in rabies-infected neurons, while preserving spatial information. We then matched barcode sequences between starter and presynaptic neurons, mapping the inputs of 385 neurons and identifying 7,814 putative synaptic connections. The resulting connectivity matrix revealed layer- and cell-type-specific local connectivity rules and topographic organization of long-range inputs to V1. These results show that BRISC can simultaneously resolve the synaptic connectivity of hundreds of neurons while preserving spatial information, enabling reconstruction of neural circuits at an unprecedented scale.

">A positive feedback loop between sensory and octopaminergic neurons underlies nociceptive plasticity in Drosophila larvae</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive modulation of nociceptive behaviour based on prior experience is essential for responding effectively to environmental threats. In Drosophila larvae, nociceptive escape behaviours are robust and stereotyped, yet emerging evidence suggests this can be modulated by experience and internal state. Here, we demonstrate that repeated activation of nociceptive sensory neurons enhances both the likelihood and intensity of nocifensive rolling, reflecting a form of behavioural sensitization. This heightened responsiveness is accompanied by a sustained increase in activity within nociceptive sensory neurons, suggesting that plasticity arises, at least in part, within the sensory compartment. We identified the neuromodulator octopamine as a critical regulator of the sensitization: signalling through the octopamine receptor OAMB is required to sustain elevated nociceptive gain, and feedback from one of octopaminergic neurons class, the ventral unpaired median (VUM) neurons, amplifies sensory neuron output. Together, these findings reveal an experience-dependent positive feedback loop in the nociceptive system, where neuromodulatory circuits tune behavioural output.

">Synaptic and intrinsic membrane defects disrupt early neural network dynamics in Down syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Down syndrome, caused by trisomy 21, affects around six million people worldwide and features learning, memory and language deficits. However, the mechanisms underlying trisomy 21 neurophenotypes involving human cortical circuitry are unknown. By characterising developing neural network dynamics and single cell excitability profiles, with synaptic and voltage-dependent ion channel behaviour, using an isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neuronal model, we show that trisomy 21 impairs the activity and development of cortical circuitry. This is caused by deficient glutamatergic synaptic connectivity and by aberrant intrinsic membrane properties involving K+ and Na+ channels culminating in spike firing defects that weaken neural network activity and disrupt the synchrony of developing neurons. We also identify transiently activated A-type K+ channels, specifically Kv4.3 channels, as a key orchestrator for Down syndrome during neurodevelopment. Overall, these excitability changes will significantly contribute towards the aberrant neurophenotypes observed later on in life.

">Concerted remodelling of the postsynaptic spine and RNA granule by cLTP</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic plasticity is the cellular foundation of learning and memory and, for these plastic changes to be stabilised into long-term memory, proteins must be synthesised at the synapse1,2. RNA granules ensure that specific mRNAs are delivered and translated at the right time and place3,4, but the signalling mechanisms linking synaptic activation to local translation are still largely unknown. Here, to investigate how postsynaptic signals modulate the RNA granule, we employed a spatially-restricted biotinylation approach to quantify protein accessibility and proximity in the postsynaptic and RNA granule subproteomes. Upon chemical long-term potentiation (cLTP), we observed a sharp increase in the accessibility of ribosomes, translation factors and RNA binding proteins belonging to the RNA granule. Similarly, strong alterations were observed in proteins of the postsynaptic density, but mostly in those involved in signalling. Specific proximity to DBN1 and IGF2BP1 as postsynaptic and RNA granule reporters unveiled a shift of the translation machinery towards the postsynaptic compartment, whereas specific translation initiation factors and RNA helicases displayed marked changes in their proximity to DBN1 and/or IGF2BP1. Finally, alteration of synapse development and signalling by DBN1 downregulation caused a highly significant decrease in the proximity of RNA granule proteins to IGF2BP1 after synaptic stimulation, establishing a causal link between postsynaptic events and RNA granule dynamics.

">Inhibition of the Microglial Phagocytic Receptor MerTK Underlies ELA-induced Changes in Synapses and Behavior in Male Mice</a></h4>

              
                Background: Early-life adversity (ELA) is a significant risk factor for emotional disorders like depression, likely by provoking changes in stress-related circuit development. We have previously shown that ELA increases the number of excitatory synapses onto corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-expressing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) by decreasing microglial synapse engulfment. Here, we hypothesize that ELA induces microglial dysfunction via inhibition of the microglial phagocytic receptor, MerTK, thus resulting in the observed changes in synapses and stress-related behavior. Methods: To determine whether deleting MerTK in microglia phenocopies the effects of ELA, microglia-specific (m)MerTK-KO (CX3CR1-Cre+::MerTKfl/fl) mice were crossed with "wild-type" (CX3CR1-Cre-::MerTKfl/fl) mice and their litters were reared in either a control or ELA (induced by limited bedding and nesting paradigm) environment, from postnatal days (P)2-10. Excitatory synapses in the PVN were assessed at P10, and adult offspring were tested in a behavioral battery to measure threat-response (known to be dependent on PVN-CRH+neurons) and anxiety-like behavior, followed by acute restraint stress to measure the neuroendocrine stress response. Results: Following ELA at P10, excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapses in the PVN were increased in males, which was mimicked by mMerTK-KO in control males, but caused no further increase in ELA males. However, females already had higher numbers of excitatory synapses at baseline, and showed no further increase with ELA or mMerTK-KO. Remarkably, the pattern of threat-response behavior in males closely matched the excitatory synapses, with mMerTK-KO control males escaping more from the simulated predator threat in the looming-shadow threat task, similar to ELA males. Again, females did not show any significant changes due to ELA or mMerTK-KO in the threat-response, although they did show ELA-induced changes in anxiety-like behavior. ELA provoked a greater corticosterone response to acute stress in males, but not females, although females were again higher at baseline. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that ELA provokes increased excitatory synapses in the PVN, leading to an increased active response to threat in the looming-shadow test in males only. Deleting MerTK specifically from microglia recapitulates both the synaptic and behavioral effects in control males, but does not have an effect in ELA males or control females, suggesting that the MerTK pathway is already inhibited by ELA in males and less active in females at baseline. Our work is the first to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the male-biased microglial dysfunction caused by ELA, with promise for the development of better preventative and therapeutic strategies for at-risk children.

">A C. elegans model of familial Alzheimer's disease shows age-dependent synaptic degeneration independent of amyloid β-peptide</a></h4>

              
                The membrane-embedded {gamma}-secretase complex is involved in the intramembrane cleavage of ~ 150 substrates. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP)-derived substrate C99 generates 38-43-residue secreted amyloid {beta}-peptides (A{beta}), with the aggregation-prone 42-residue form (A{beta}42) particularly implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, whether A{beta}42 is the primary driver of neurodegeneration in AD remains unclear. Dominant mutations in APP or presenilin--the catalytic component of {gamma}-secretase--cause early-onset familial AD (FAD) and reduce one or more steps in the multi-step processive proteolysis of C99 to A{beta} peptides, apparently through stabilization of {gamma}-secretase enzyme-substrate (E-S) complexes. To investigate mechanisms of neurodegeneration in FAD, we developed new C. elegans models co-expressing wild-type or FAD-mutant C99 substrate and presenilin-1 (PSEN1) variants in neurons, allowing intramembrane processing of C99 to A{beta} in vivo. We demonstrate that while FAD-mutation of either C99 or PSEN1 leads to age-dependent synaptic loss, proteolytically inactive PSEN1 did not. Designed mutations that allow stable E-S complex formation without A{beta}42 or A{beta} production likewise result in synaptic degeneration. Moreover, replacement of C99 with variants of a Notch1-based substrate revealed that disrupted processing of another {gamma}-secretase substrate can similarly lead to synaptic degeneration. These results support a model in which synaptic loss can be triggered by toxic, stalled {gamma}-secretase E-S complexes in the absence of A{beta} production and not by simple loss of proteolytic function. This new C. elegans system provides a powerful platform to study the role of dysfunctional {gamma}-secretase substrate processing in FAD pathogenesis.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>While previous studies have found rhythms in gene expression in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the contribution of different cell types and potential variation by sex has not been determined. Of interest are excitatory pyramidal cells and inhibitory parvalbumin (PV) interneurons, as the interaction between these cells is thought to underlie gamma oscillations and play a role in schizophrenia. We identify cell-type-specific rhythms in ribosome-associated transcripts from PV and pyramidal cells in the mouse PFC and assess rhythms in PV cell electrophysiology. We find that while core molecular clock genes are synchronized between cell types, pyramidal cells have nearly twice as many rhythmic transcripts as PV cells (35% vs. 18%). Moreover, in contrast to PV cells, rhythmic transcripts in pyramidal cells show substantial overlap between sexes. Additionally, there is a sex-specific reduction in action potential amplitude and spike frequency adaptation during the dark phase in PV cells from females. This study demonstrates that rhythms in gene expression and electrophysiological properties in the PFC vary by cell type and by sex. Moreover, the biological processes associated with rhythmic transcripts may provide insight into the unique functions of rhythms in these cells, as well as their selective vulnerabilities to circadian disruption.</span>

                Nanaware et al. characterize peptides presented by MHC proteins in inflamed human pancreatic islets and test them for reactivity with CD4 and CD8 T cells from patients with T1D. These results identify naturally processed islet peptides targeted by autoimmune T cells and highlight pathways that generate immune epitopes in disease.

Natural selection occurs at multiple levels of organization in cancer. At an organismal level, natural selection has led to the evolution of diverse tumor suppression mechanisms, while at a cellular level, it favors traits that promote cellular proliferation, survival and cancer. Natural selection also occurs at a subcellular level, among collections of cells and even among collections of organisms; selection at these levels could influence the evolution of cancer and cancer suppression mechanisms, affecting cancer risk and treatment strategies. There may also be cancer-like processes happening at different levels of organization, in which uncontrolled proliferation at lower levels may disrupt a higher level of organization. This Essay examines how selection operates across levels, highlighting how we might leverage this understanding to improve cancer research, prevention and treatment.

                Jain et al. profiled 41 classical psychedelics across 318 GPCRs, revealing activity at serotonin, dopamine, and adrenergic receptors. All compounds activated multiple 5-HT2AR signal transduction pathways which are linked to their in vivo effects. These findings demonstrate the polypharmacology underlying psychedelic actions and their engagement with diverse molecular signaling pathways.

                Martínez et al. identify a set of ccRCC tumors with high levels of intron retention (IR) and poison exon (PE) inclusion, producing transcripts normally targeted by the NMD pathway. These tumors have altered mTOR signaling, are associated with poor prognosis, and have unique signatures of immune cell infiltration.

                Potiri et al. uncover how the splicing factor SRRM3 drives tumor progression in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) via neural microexon inclusion. Aberrant splicing disrupts insulin secretion and calcium signaling, revealing a novel link between neuroendocrine dysfunction and cancer. Therapeutic redirection using splice-switching ASOs can effectively impair tumor growth in preclinical models.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93200">Mediodorsal thalamic nucleus mediates resistance to ethanol through Cav3.1 T-type Ca2+ regulation of neural activity</a></h4>

              
                Thalamocortical activity is known to orchestrate sensory gating and consciousness switching. The precise thalamic regions involved, or the firing patterns related to the unconsciousness, remain unclear. Interestingly, the highly -expressed thalamic T-type calcium currents have been considered as a candidate for the ionic mechanism for the generation of thalamocortically driven change in conscious state. Here, we tested the hypothesis that Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 T-type channels in the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD) might control neuronal firing during unconsciousness using Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 T-type channel knockout (KO) and knockdown (KD) mice under natural sleep and ethanol-induced unconsciousness. During natural sleep, the MD neurons in KO mice showed general characteristics of sustained firing across sleep stages. We found that KO and MD-specific KD mice showed enhanced resistance to ethanol. During the ethanol-induced unconscious state, wild-type (WT) MD neurons showed a significant reduction in neuronal firing from baseline with increased burst firing, whereas Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 KO neurons showed well-sustained neural firing, within the level of wakefulness, and no burst firing. Further, 20 Hz optogenetic and electrical activation of MD neurons mimicked the ethanol resistance behavior in WT mice. These results suggest that maintaining MD neural firing at a wakeful level is sufficient to induce resistance to ethanol-induced hypnosis in WT mice. This work has important implications for the design of treatments for consciousness disorders using thalamic stimulation of deeper nuclei, including the targeting of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100574">Effective population size does not explain long-term variation in genome size and transposable element content in animals</a></h4>

              
                Animal genomes exhibit a remarkable variation in size, but the evolutionary forces responsible for such variation are still debated. As the effective population size (Ne<sub>e</sub>) reflects the intensity of genetic drift, it is expected to be a key determinant of the fixation rate of nearly-neutral mutations. Accordingly, the Mutational Hazard Hypothesis postulates lineages with low Ne<sub>e</sub> to have bigger genome sizes due to the accumulation of slightly deleterious transposable elements (TEs), and those with high Ne<sub>e</sub> to maintain streamlined genomes as a consequence of a more effective selection against TEs. However, the existence of both empirical confirmation and refutation using different methods and different scales precludes its general validation. Using high-quality public data, we estimated genome size, TE content, and rate of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) as Ne<sub>e</sub> proxy for 807 species including vertebrates, molluscs, and insects. After collecting available life-history traits, we tested the associations among population size proxies, TE content, and genome size, while accounting for phylogenetic non-independence. Our results confirm TEs as major drivers of genome size variation, and endorse life-history traits and dN/dS as reliable proxies for Ne<sub>e</sub>. However, we do not find any evidence for increased drift to result in an accumulation of TEs across animals. Within more closely related clades, only a few isolated and weak associations emerge in fishes and birds. Our results outline a scenario where TE dynamics vary according to lineage-specific patterns, lending no support for genetic drift as the predominant force driving long-term genome size evolution in animals.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Currently, bipolar disorder diagnosis is primarily based on clinical interviews. Magnetoencephalography signals reflect changes in the brain’s magnetic field induced by neuronal activity. As a result, the combination of magnetoencephalography and network science holds great promise for identifying bipolar disorder biomarkers. However, the existing methods remain limited in capturing the complexity of nodes and their connections within resting-state brain networks, making it difficult to fully reveal underlying pathological mechanisms. In this work, we measured the uncertainty associated with a subgraph, an information-theoretic metric called “subgraph entropy,” and used it to identify individuals with bipolar disorder. This method enabled a more accurate characterization of brain network complexity, facilitating the identification of regions closely associated with disease states. The results showed that subgraph entropy features significantly contributed to the classification of bipolar disorder, particularly within the beta frequency band. In addition, two special forms of subgraph entropy, namely node entropy and edge entropy, were examined to identify important brain regions and functional connectivity in bipolar disorder patients across multiple frequency bands. Notably, in the beta frequency band, the method based on edge entropy achieved 0.8462 accuracy, 0.7308 specificity, and 0.9231 sensitivity through leave-one-out cross-validation, effectively distinguishing individuals with bipolar disorder from healthy controls.</span>

     alt="Persistent Disruptions in Prefrontal Connectivity Despite Behavioral Rescue by Environmental Enrichment in a Mouse Model of Rett Syndrome"/>
<p>This study reveals that the loss of MeCP2 in Rett syndrome model mice disrupts prefrontal connectivity. Although early environmental enrichment helps mitigate behavioral deficits and restores hippocampal BDNF levels, it fails to reverse the altered prefrontal connectivity or prevent the prefrontal-specific decline in BDNF.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the <i>MECP2</i> gene, is characterized by severe motor, cognitive, and emotional impairments. Some of the deficits may result from changes in cortical connections, especially downstream projections of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which may also be targets of restoration following rearing conditions such as environmental enrichment that alleviate specific symptoms. Here, using a heterozygous <i>Mecp2<sup>+/−</sup>
</i> female mouse model closely analogous to human Rett syndrome, we investigated the impact of early environmental enrichment on behavioral deficits and PFC connectivity. Behavioral analyses revealed that enriched housing rescued fine motor deficits and reduced anxiety, with enrichment-housed <i>Mecp2<sup>+/−</sup>
</i> mice performing comparably to wild-type (WT) controls in rotarod and open field assays. Anatomical mapping of top-down anterior cingulate cortex (ACA) projections demonstrated altered PFC connectivity in <i>Mecp2<sup>+/−</sup>
</i> mice, with increased axonal density in the somatosensory cortex and decreased density in the motor cortex compared to WT controls. ACA axons revealed shifts in hemispheric distribution, particularly in the medial network regions, with <i>Mecp2<sup>+/−</sup>
</i> mice exhibiting reduced ipsilateral dominance. These changes were unaffected by enriched housing, suggesting that structural abnormalities in PFC connectivity persist despite behavioral improvements. Enriched housing rescued brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in the hippocampus but failed to restore BDNF levels in the PFC, consistent with the persistent deficits observed in prefrontal axonal projections. These findings highlight the focal nature of changes induced by reduction of MeCP2 and by exposure to environmental enrichment and suggest that environmental enrichment starting in adolescence can alleviate behavioral deficits in <i>Mecp2<sup>+/−</sup>
</i> mice without reversing abnormalities in large-scale cortical connectivity.</p>
