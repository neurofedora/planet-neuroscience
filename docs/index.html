              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14256">Mechanisms for bump state localization in two-dimensional networks of leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.14256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networks of nonlocally coupled leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons exhibit a variety of complex collective behaviors, such as partial synchronization, frequency or amplitude chimeras, solitary states and bump states. In particular, the bump states consist of one or many regions of asynchronous elements within a sea of quiescent subthreshold elements. The asynchronous domains (also called bumps) travel in the network in a direction predetermined by the initial conditions. In the present study we investigate the occurrence of bump states in networks of leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons in two-dimensions using nonlocal toroidal connectivity and we explore possible mechanisms for stabilizing the moving asynchronous domains. Our findings indicate that I) incorporating a refractory period can effectively anchor the position of these domains in the network, and II) the switching off of some randomly preselected nodes (i.e., making them permanently idle/inactive) can likewise contribute to stabilizing the positions of the asynchronous domains. In particular, in case II for large values of the coupling strength and a large percentage of idle elements, all nodes acquire different fixed (frozen) values in the subthreshold region and oscillations cease throughout the network due to self-organization. For the special case of stationary bump states, we propose an analytical approach to predict their properties. This approach is based on the self-consistency argument and is valid for infinitely large networks. Case I is of particular biomedical interest in view of the importance of refractoriness for biological neurons, while case II can be biomedically relevant when designing therapeutic methods for stabilizing moving signals in the brain.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14453">How EEG preprocessing shapes decoding performance</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.14453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EEG preprocessing varies widely between studies, but its impact on stimulus classification performance remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we analyzed seven experiments with 40 participants drawn from the public ERP CORE dataset. We systematically varied key preprocessing steps, such as filtering, referencing, baseline interval, detrending, and multiple artifact correction steps. Then we performed trial-wise binary classification (i.e., decoding) using neural networks (EEGNet), or time-resolved logistic regressions. Our findings demonstrate that preprocessing choices influenced decoding performance considerably. All artifact correction steps reduced decoding performance across all experiments and models, while higher high-pass filter cutoffs consistently enhanced decoding. For EEGNet, baseline correction further improved performance, and for time-resolved classifiers, linear detrending and lower low-pass filter cutoffs were beneficial. Other optimal preprocessing choices were specific for each experiment. The current results underline the importance of carefully selecting preprocessing steps for EEG-based decoding. If not corrected, artifacts facilitate decoding but compromise conclusive interpretation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14174">Auto Detecting Cognitive Events Using Machine Learning on Pupillary Data</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.14174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessing cognitive workload is crucial for human performance as it affects information processing, decision making, and task execution. Pupil size is a valuable indicator of cognitive workload, reflecting changes in attention and arousal governed by the autonomic nervous system. Cognitive events are closely linked to cognitive workload as they activate mental processes and trigger cognitive responses. This study explores the potential of using machine learning to automatically detect cognitive events experienced using individuals. We framed the problem as a binary classification task, focusing on detecting stimulus onset across four cognitive tasks using CNN models and 1-second pupillary data. The results, measured by Matthew's correlation coefficient, ranged from 0.47 to 0.80, depending on the cognitive task. This paper discusses the trade-offs between generalization and specialization, model behavior when encountering unseen stimulus onset times, structural variances among cognitive tasks, factors influencing model predictions, and real-time simulation. These findings highlight the potential of machine learning techniques in detecting cognitive events based on pupil and eye movement responses, contributing to advancements in personalized learning and optimizing neurocognitive workload management.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20601">Modular Boundaries in Recurrent Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2310.20601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent theoretical and experimental work in neuroscience has focused on the representational and dynamical character of neural manifolds --subspaces in neural activity space wherein many neurons coactivate. Importantly, neural populations studied under this "neural manifold hypothesis" are continuous and not cleanly divided into separate neural populations. This perspective clashes with the "modular hypothesis" of brain organization, wherein neural elements maintain an "all-or-nothing" affiliation with modules. In line with this modular hypothesis, recent research on recurrent neural networks suggests that multi-task networks become modular across training, such that different modules specialize for task-general dynamical motifs. If the modular hypothesis is true, then it would be important to use a dimensionality reduction technique that captures modular structure. Here, we investigate the features of such a method. We leverage RNNs as a model system to study the character of modular neural populations, using a community detection method from network science known as modularity maximization to partition neurons into distinct modules. These partitions allow us to ask the following question: do these modular boundaries matter to the system? ...

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13866">Associative memory and dead neurons</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.13866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In "Large Associative Memory Problem in Neurobiology and Machine Learning," Dmitry Krotov and John Hopfield introduced a general technique for the systematic construction of neural ordinary differential equations with non-increasing energy or Lyapunov function. We study this energy function and identify that it is vulnerable to the problem of dead neurons. Each point in the state space where the neuron dies is contained in a non-compact region with constant energy. In these flat regions, energy function alone does not completely determine all degrees of freedom and, as a consequence, can not be used to analyze stability or find steady states or basins of attraction. We perform a direct analysis of the dynamical system and show how to resolve problems caused by flat directions corresponding to dead neurons: (i) all information about the state vector at a fixed point can be extracted from the energy and Hessian matrix (of Lagrange function), (ii) it is enough to analyze stability in the range of Hessian matrix, (iii) if steady state touching flat region is stable the whole flat region is the basin of attraction. The analysis of the Hessian matrix can be complicated for realistic architectures, so we show that for a slightly altered dynamical system (with the same structure of steady states), one can derive a diverse family of Lyapunov functions that do not have flat regions corresponding to dead neurons. In addition, these energy functions allow one to use Lagrange functions with Hessian matrices that are not necessarily positive definite and even consider architectures with non-symmetric feedforward and feedback connections.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13872">BLEND: Behavior-guided Neural Population Dynamics Modeling via Privileged Knowledge Distillation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.13872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling the nonlinear dynamics of neuronal populations represents a key pursuit in computational neuroscience. Recent research has increasingly focused on jointly modeling neural activity and behavior to unravel their interconnections. Despite significant efforts, these approaches often necessitate either intricate model designs or oversimplified assumptions. Given the frequent absence of perfectly paired neural-behavioral datasets in real-world scenarios when deploying these models, a critical yet understudied research question emerges: how to develop a model that performs well using only neural activity as input at inference, while benefiting from the insights gained from behavioral signals during training?
  To this end, we propose BLEND, the behavior-guided neural population dynamics modeling framework via privileged knowledge distillation. By considering behavior as privileged information, we train a teacher model that takes both behavior observations (privileged features) and neural activities (regular features) as inputs. A student model is then distilled using only neural activity. Unlike existing methods, our framework is model-agnostic and avoids making strong assumptions about the relationship between behavior and neural activity. This allows BLEND to enhance existing neural dynamics modeling architectures without developing specialized models from scratch. Extensive experiments across neural population activity modeling and transcriptomic neuron identity prediction tasks demonstrate strong capabilities of BLEND, reporting over 50% improvement in behavioral decoding and over 15% improvement in transcriptomic neuron identity prediction after behavior-guided distillation. Furthermore, we empirically explore various behavior-guided distillation strategies within the BLEND framework and present a comprehensive analysis of effectiveness and implications for model performance.

                arXiv:2410.13881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental question in the conjunction of information theory, biophysics, bioinformatics and thermodynamics relates to the principles and processes that guide the development of natural intelligence in natural environments where information about external stimuli may not be available at prior. A novel approach in the description of the information processes of natural learning is proposed in the framework of constrained optimization, where the objective function represented by the information entropy of the internal states of the system with the states of the external environment is maximized under the natural constraints of memory, computing power, energy and other essential resources. The progress of natural intelligence can be interpreted in this framework as a strategy of approximation of the solutions of the optimization problem via a traversal over the extrema network of the objective function under the natural constraints that were examined and described. Non-trivial conclusions on the relationships between the complexity, variability and efficiency of the structure, or architecture of learning models made on the basis of the proposed formalism can explain the effectiveness of neural networks as collaborative groups of small intelligent units in biological and artificial intelligence.

                arXiv:2405.16922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans and animals learn throughout life. Such continual learning is crucial for intelligence. In this chapter, we examine the pivotal role plasticity mechanisms with complex internal synaptic dynamics could play in enabling this ability in neural networks. By surveying theoretical research, we highlight two fundamental enablers for continual learning. First, synaptic plasticity mechanisms must maintain and evolve an internal state over several behaviorally relevant timescales. Second, plasticity algorithms must leverage the internal state to intelligently regulate plasticity at individual synapses to facilitate the seamless integration of new memories while avoiding detrimental interference with existing ones. Our chapter covers successful applications of these principles to deep neural networks and underscores the significance of synaptic metaplasticity in sustaining continual learning capabilities. Finally, we outline avenues for further research to understand the brain's superb continual learning abilities and harness similar mechanisms for artificial intelligence systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14031">Modeling the Human Visual System: Comparative Insights from Response-Optimized and Task-Optimized Vision Models, Language Models, and different Readout Mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.14031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, predictive modeling of neural responses in the primate visual system has advanced significantly, largely driven by various DNN approaches. These include models optimized directly for visual recognition, cross-modal alignment through contrastive objectives, neural response prediction from scratch, and large language model embeddings.Likewise, different readout mechanisms, ranging from fully linear to spatial-feature factorized methods have been explored for mapping network activations to neural responses. Despite the diversity of these approaches, it remains unclear which method performs best across different visual regions. In this study, we systematically compare these approaches for modeling the human visual system and investigate alternative strategies to improve response predictions. Our findings reveal that for early to mid-level visual areas, response-optimized models with visual inputs offer superior prediction accuracy, while for higher visual regions, embeddings from LLMs based on detailed contextual descriptions of images and task-optimized models pretrained on large vision datasets provide the best fit. Through comparative analysis of these modeling approaches, we identified three distinct regions in the visual cortex: one sensitive primarily to perceptual features of the input that are not captured by linguistic descriptions, another attuned to fine-grained visual details representing semantic information, and a third responsive to abstract, global meanings aligned with linguistic content. We also highlight the critical role of readout mechanisms, proposing a novel scheme that modulates receptive fields and feature maps based on semantic content, resulting in an accuracy boost of 3-23% over existing SOTAs for all models and brain regions. Together, these findings offer key insights into building more precise models of the visual system.

Abstract: This technical report investigates the application of event-based vision sensors in non-invasive qualitative vibration analysis, with a particular focus on frequency measurement and motion magnification. Event cameras, with their high temporal resolution and dynamic range, offer promising capabilities for real-time structural assessment and subtle motion analysis. Our study employs cutting-edge event-based vision techniques to explore real-world scenarios in frequency measurement in vibrational analysis and intensity reconstruction for motion magnification. In the former, event-based sensors demonstrated significant potential for real-time structural assessment. However, our work in motion magnification revealed considerable challenges, particularly in scenarios involving stationary cameras and isolated motion.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14067">Provable Benefits of Complex Parameterizations for Structured State Space Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.14067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structured state space models (SSMs), the core engine behind prominent neural networks such as S4 and Mamba, are linear dynamical systems adhering to a specified structure, most notably diagonal. In contrast to typical neural network modules, whose parameterizations are real, SSMs often use complex parameterizations. Theoretically explaining the benefits of complex parameterizations for SSMs is an open problem. The current paper takes a step towards its resolution, by establishing formal gaps between real and complex diagonal SSMs. Firstly, we prove that while a moderate dimension suffices in order for a complex SSM to express all mappings of a real SSM, a much higher dimension is needed for a real SSM to express mappings of a complex SSM. Secondly, we prove that even if the dimension of a real SSM is high enough to express a given mapping, typically, doing so requires the parameters of the real SSM to hold exponentially large values, which cannot be learned in practice. In contrast, a complex SSM can express any given mapping with moderate parameter values. Experiments corroborate our theory, and suggest a potential extension of the theory that accounts for selectivity, a new architectural feature yielding state of the art performance.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14210">Shape Transformation Driven by Active Contour for Class-Imbalanced Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.14210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Annotating 3D medical images demands expert knowledge and is time-consuming. As a result, semi-supervised learning (SSL) approaches have gained significant interest in 3D medical image segmentation. The significant size differences among various organs in the human body lead to imbalanced class distribution, which is a major challenge in the real-world application of these SSL approaches. To address this issue, we develop a novel Shape Transformation driven by Active Contour (STAC), that enlarges smaller organs to alleviate imbalanced class distribution across different organs. Inspired by curve evolution theory in active contour methods, STAC employs a signed distance function (SDF) as the level set function, to implicitly represent the shape of organs, and deforms voxels in the direction of the steepest descent of SDF (i.e., the normal vector). To ensure that the voxels far from expansion organs remain unchanged, we design an SDF-based weight function to control the degree of deformation for each voxel. We then use STAC as a data-augmentation process during the training stage. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms some state-of-the-art methods. Source code is publicly available at https://github.com/GuGuLL123/STAC.

                arXiv:2410.14623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current and future large scale structure surveys aim to constrain the neutrino mass and the equation of state of dark energy. We aim to construct accurate and interpretable symbolic approximations to the linear and nonlinear matter power spectra as a function of cosmological parameters in extended $\Lambda$CDM models which contain massive neutrinos and non-constant equations of state for dark energy. This constitutes an extension of the syren-halofit emulators to incorporate these two effects, which we call syren-new (SYmbolic-Regression-ENhanced power spectrum emulator with NEutrinos and $W_0-w_a$). We also obtain a simple approximation to the derived parameter $\sigma_8$ as a function of the cosmological parameters for these models. Our results for the linear power spectrum are designed to emulate CLASS, whereas for the nonlinear case we aim to match the results of EuclidEmulator2. We compare our results to existing emulators and $N$-body simulations. Our analytic emulators for $\sigma_8$, the linear and nonlinear power spectra achieve root mean squared errors of 0.1%, 0.3% and 1.3%, respectively, across a wide range of cosmological parameters, redshifts and wavenumbers. We verify that emulator-related discrepancies are subdominant compared to observational errors and other modelling uncertainties when computing shear power spectra for LSST-like surveys. Our expressions have similar accuracy to existing (numerical) emulators, but are at least an order of magnitude faster, both on a CPU and GPU. Our work greatly improves the accuracy, speed and range of applicability of current symbolic approximations to the linear and nonlinear matter power spectra. We provide publicly available code for all symbolic approximations found.

                arXiv:2403.19578v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that off-the-shelf text-based Transformers, with no additional training, can perform few-shot in-context visual imitation learning, mapping visual observations to action sequences that emulate the demonstrator's behaviour. We achieve this by transforming visual observations (inputs) and trajectories of actions (outputs) into sequences of tokens that a text-pretrained Transformer (GPT-4 Turbo) can ingest and generate, via a framework we call Keypoint Action Tokens (KAT). Despite being trained only on language, we show that these Transformers excel at translating tokenised visual keypoint observations into action trajectories, performing on par or better than state-of-the-art imitation learning (diffusion policies) in the low-data regime on a suite of real-world, everyday tasks. Rather than operating in the language domain as is typical, KAT leverages text-based Transformers to operate in the vision and action domains to learn general patterns in demonstration data for highly efficient imitation learning, indicating promising new avenues for repurposing natural language models for embodied tasks.

                arXiv:2410.09804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across various tasks, they encounter potential security risks such as jailbreak attacks, which exploit vulnerabilities to bypass security measures and generate harmful outputs. Existing jailbreak strategies mainly focus on maximizing attack success rate (ASR), frequently neglecting other critical factors, including the relevance of the jailbreak response to the query and the level of stealthiness. This narrow focus on single objectives can result in ineffective attacks that either lack contextual relevance or are easily recognizable. In this work, we introduce BlackDAN, an innovative black-box attack framework with multi-objective optimization, aiming to generate high-quality prompts that effectively facilitate jailbreaking while maintaining contextual relevance and minimizing detectability. BlackDAN leverages Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs), specifically the NSGA-II algorithm, to optimize jailbreaks across multiple objectives including ASR, stealthiness, and semantic relevance. By integrating mechanisms like mutation, crossover, and Pareto-dominance, BlackDAN provides a transparent and interpretable process for generating jailbreaks. Furthermore, the framework allows customization based on user preferences, enabling the selection of prompts that balance harmfulness, relevance, and other factors. Experimental results demonstrate that BlackDAN outperforms traditional single-objective methods, yielding higher success rates and improved robustness across various LLMs and multimodal LLMs, while ensuring jailbreak responses are both relevant and less detectable.

">Molecular Specification of Claustro-Amygdalar and Paleocortical Neurons and Connectivity</a></h4>

              
                The ventropallial excitatory neurons (ExNs) in the claustro-amygdalar complex and piriform cortex (PIR; part of paleocortex) form crucial reciprocal connections with the prefrontal cortex (PFC), integrating cognitive and sensory information that result in adaptive behaviors. Early-life disruptions in these circuits are linked to neuropsychiatric disorders, highlighting the importance of understanding their development. Our study uncovers that transcription factors SOX4, SOX11, and TFAP2D play a pivotal role in the development, identity, and PFC connectivity of these neurons. Using mouse models, we demonstrate that the absence of transcription factors SOX4 and SOX11 in post-mitotic ExNs dramatically reduces the size of the basolateral amygdala complex (BLC), claustrum, and PIR. SOX4 and SOX11 control BLC formation through direct regulation of Tfap2d expression. Cross-species analyses, including humans, identified conserved Tfap2d expression in developing ExNs of BLC, claustrum, paleocortex including PIR, and the associated transitional areas of the frontal, insular and temporal cortex. While the loss and haploinsufficiency of Tfap2d yield similar alterations in learned threat behaviors, differences emerge in the manifestation of Tfap2d dosage, particularly in terms of changes observed in BLC size and the connectivity pattern between the BLC and PFC. This underscores the significance of Tfap2d dosage in orchestrating developmental shifts in BLC-PFC connectivity and behavioral modifications reminiscent of symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders. Together, these findings reveal key elements of a conserved gene regulatory network that shapes the development and function of crucial ventropallial ExNs and their PFC connectivity and offer insights into their evolution and alterations in neuropsychiatric disorders.

">Mutations of schizophrenia risk gene SETD1A dysregulate synaptic function in human neurons</a></h4>

              
                Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder associated with both common risk variants of small effect sizes and rare risk variants of high penetrance. Rare protein truncating variants (PTVs) in SETD1A (SET Domain Containing 1A) show a strong association with SCZ; however, it remains largely unclear how rare PTVs in SETD1A contribute to the pathophysiology of SCZ. To understand the impact of SETD1A rare PTVs in human neurons, we CRISPR/Cas9-engineered five isogenic pairs of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), with a recurrent heterozygous patient-specific PTV mutation c.4582-2delAG in two donor lines and a heterozygous frameshift mutation c.4596_4597insG (p. Leu1533fs) in three donor lines. These two mutations are predicted to cause a premature stop codon in exon 16 of SETD1A, leading to the loss of the conserved SET domain that is critical for its histone methyltransferase activity. We found that these presumably loss-of-function (LoF) mutations caused the SETD1A mRNAs to be degraded by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), accompanied by a reduction of full-length SETD1A protein level in iPSCs. We then characterized the morphological, electrophysiological, and transcriptomic impacts of the SETD1A+/- LoF mutations in iPSC-derived human excitatory neurons induced by NGN2. We found that the SETD1A+/- exon-16 LoF mutations altered dendrite complexity, dysregulated synaptic transmission, and synaptic plasticity, likely by dysregulating genes involved in synaptic function. These results provide mechanistic insights into how SETD1A+/- exon-16 patient-specific LoF mutations affect neuron phenotypes that may be relevant to the pathophysiology of SCZ.

                Most synapses in the brain transmit information by the presynaptic release of vesicular glutamate, driving postsynaptic depolarization through AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs). The nanometer-scale topography of synaptic AMPARs regulates response amplitude by controlling the number of receptors activated by synaptic vesicle fusion. The mechanisms controlling AMPAR topography and their interactions with postsynaptic density proteins are unclear, as is the spatial relationship between AMPARs and synaptic vesicles. Here, we used cryo-electron tomography to map the molecular topography of AMPARs and visualize their in-situ structure. Clustered AMPARs form structured complexes with postsynaptic scaffolding proteins resolved by sub-tomogram averaging. Sub-synaptic topography mapping reveals the presence of AMPAR nanoclusters with exclusion zones beneath synaptic vesicles. Our molecular-resolution maps visualize the predominant information transfer path in the nervous system.

">Androgen receptor modulation of vocal circuitry in Alston's singing mouse</a></h4>

              
                Animal courtship and aggressive displays are dramatic, often sexually dimorphic behaviors that require the coordinated modulation of diverse motivational and motor circuits. In Alstons singing mice (Scotinomys teguina), a novel and elaborate advertisement vocalization is sexually dimorphic and steroid sensitive. Males sing more often than females, and on average male songs have more notes. Song is influenced by circulating androgens, but how such hormonal differences influence the diverse brain regions involved in vocal display is not understood. To characterize androgen-sensitive sites in the vocal motor pathway, we used two isoforms of pseudorabies virus (PRV) to double-label circuits ending in laryngeal and jaw muscles involved in vocalization, and co-labeled these neurons for androgen receptor (AR). Next we manipulated circulating androgens and observed the effects on AR distribution and male song. We find androgens drive coordinated changes in AR abundance across motor and motivational circuits, and both individual and group differences in song are associated with AR abundance. The results reveal how circulating androgens and the auto-regulation of androgen receptors can influence the diverse circuits necessary for elaborate advertisement displays.

">Altered Proteasome Composition in Aging Brains, Genetic Proteasome Augmentation Mitigates Age-Related Cognitive Declines, and Acute Proteasome Agonist Treatment Rescues Age-Related Cognitive Deficits in Mice</a></h4>

              
                The aging brain experiences a significant decline in proteasome function, The proteasome is critical for many key neuronal functions including neuronal plasticity, and memory formation/retention. Treatment with proteasome inhibitors impairs these processes. Our study reveals a marked reduction in 20S and 26S proteasome activities in aged mice brains driven by reduced functionality of aged proteasome. This is matched by a decline in 20S proteasome but an increase in 26S proteasome. Our data suggests this may be a compensatory response to reduced functionality. By overexpressing the proteasome subunit PSMB5 in the neurons of mice, enhancing proteasome function, we slowed age-related declines in spatial learning and memory as well neuromuscular declines. We then showed acute treatment with a proteasome activator to rescue spatial learning and memory deficits in aged mice. These findings highlight the potential of proteasome augmentation as a therapeutic strategy to mitigate age-related cognitive declines.

">A network based study of the dynamics of Aβ and {tau} proteins in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Due to the extreme complexity of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the aetiology of which is not yet known, nor are there any known effective treatments, mathematical modelling can be very useful. Indeed, mathematical models, if deemed reliable, can be used to test medical hypotheses that could be difficult to verify directly. In this context, it is important to understand how A{beta} and {tau} proteins, which in abnormal aggregate conformations are hallmarks of the disease, interact and spread. We are particularly interested in this paper in studying the spreading of misfolded {tau}. To this end, we present four different mathematical models, all on networks on which the protein evolves. The models differ in both the choice of network and diffusion operator. Through comparison with clinical data on {tau} concentration, that we carefully obtained with multimodal analysis techniques, we show that some models are more adequate than others to simulate the dynamics of the protein. This type of study may suggest that, when it comes to modelling certain pathologies, the choice of the mathematical setting must be made with great care if comparison with clinical data is considered decisive.

">Microglia regulate GABAergic neurogenesis in prenatal human brain through IGF1</a></h4>

              
                GABAergic neurons are an essential cellular component of neural circuits. Their abundance and diversity have enlarged significantly in the human brain, contributing to the expanded cognitive capacity of humans. However, the developmental mechanism of the extended production of GABAergic neurons in the human brain remains elusive. Here, we use single-cell transcriptomics, bioinformatics, and histological analyses to uncover microglial regulation of the sustained proliferation of GABAergic progenitors and neuroblasts in the human medial ganglionic eminence (hMGE). We show that insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and its receptor IGR1R as the top ligand-receptor pair underlying microglia-progenitor communication in the prenatal human brain. Using our newly developed neuroimmune hMGE organoids, which mimics hMGE cytoarchitecture and developmental trajectory, we demonstrate that microglia-derived IGF1 promotes progenitor proliferation and the production of GABAergic neurons. Conversely, IGF1-neutralizing antibodies and IGF1 knockout human embryonic stem cells (hESC)-induced microglia (iMG) completely abolished iMG-mediated progenitor proliferation. Together, these findings reveal a previously unappreciated role of microglia-derived IGF1 in promoting proliferation of neural progenitors and the development of GABAergic neurons.

">Template-driven dynamic functional network connectivity predicts medication response for major depression and bipolar disorders</a></h4>

              
                The process of finding reliable treatment for major depression and bipolar disorder can be arduous. The myriad behavioral symptoms presented by patients and resistance to treatment from particular medication classes complicate standard diagnostic and prescription methodologies, often requiring multiple attempted treatments during which symptoms may still be present. Physiological information such as neuroimaging scans may help to alleviate some of the uncertainty surrounding diagnosis and treatment when incorporated into a clinical setting. Changes in functional magnetic resonance imaging show particular promise, as the incorporation of dynamical information may provide insights into physiological changes prior to static, structural changes. In this work, we present a novel method for generating robust and replicable dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) features from neuroimaging data using a template of dynamic states derived from a large, non-affected data set. We demonstrate that this template-driven dFNC approach expands on standard dFNC approaches by allowing for the derivation of a continuous state-contribution time series. We demonstrate that the derived biomarkers can support high predictive performance for the identification of medication class and non-responders while also expanding the set of biomarkers available for studying differences in mood disorder medication response.

">Chronic circadian disruption in adolescent mice impairs hippocampal memory disrupting gene expression oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Chronodisruption, the misalignment of internal biological systems with external environmental changes, leads to adverse health effects. Particularly, Social Jet Lag (SJL) is defined as the discrepancy between social and biological time and it exemplifies this misalignment, affecting a large part of the young population and impacting cognitive function. Despite its prevalence, our understanding of how developmental chronodisruption ultimately translates into morbidity is limited. To address this, we implemented a chronic chronodisruption protocol in adolescent mice consisting of light/dark cycle manipulation. We employed a comprehensive battery of established behavioral tests alongside an in-depth analysis of the oscillatory expression of the molecular clock and other genes involved in relevant physiological function. Our results show that chronic circadian disruption during adolescence induces impairments in short-term, social, and spatial memory without prompting anxiety-like behavior. Additionally, we report altered gene expression patterns of circadian clock genes per1, per2, cry2 and npas2 in the hypothalamus and the hippocampus. Lastly, we observed a disruption of hippocampal gene expression oscillations which may underlie the hippocampal memory impairments. Overall, this work underscores the critical role of adolescent circadian rhythms in maintaining cognitive function, the relevance of circadian control of hippocampal homeostasis, and the importance of further research into the mechanisms of chronodisruption, particularly during adolescence, to better understand its long-term implications for cognitive function and overall health.

">Hippocampal place cell sequences are impaired in a rat model of Fragile X Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that can cause impairments in spatial cognition and memory. The hippocampus is thought to support spatial cognition through the activity of place cells, neurons with spatial receptive fields. Coordinated firing of place cell populations is organized by different oscillatory patterns in the hippocampus during specific behavioral states. Theta rhythms organize place cell populations during awake exploration. Sharp wave-ripples organize place cell population reactivation during waking rest. Here, we examined the coordination of CA1 place cell populations during active behavior and subsequent rest in a rat model of FXS (Fmr1 knockout rats). While the organization of individual place cells by the theta rhythm was normal, the coordinated activation of sequences of place cells during individual theta cycles was impaired in Fmr1 knockout rats. Further, the subsequent replay of place cell sequences was impaired during waking rest following active exploration. Together, these results expand our understanding of how genetic modifications that model those observed in FXS affect hippocampal physiology and suggest a potential mechanism underlying impaired spatial cognition in FXS.

">Frontoparietal theta synchronization causally links working memory with impulsive decision making</a></h4>

              
                Delaying gratification in value-based decision making is canonically related to activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), but past research neglected that the dlPFC is part of a larger frontoparietal network. It is therefore unknown whether the dlPFC causally implements delay of gratification in concert with posterior parts of the frontoparietal network rather than in isolation. Here, we addressed this gap by testing the effects of frontoparietal theta synchronization and desynchronization on impulsive decision making using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). Healthy participants performed an intertemporal choice task and a 3-back working memory task while left frontal and parietal cortices were stimulated with a 5 Hz theta frequency at in-phase (synchronization), anti-phase (desynchronization), or sham tACS. We found frontoparietal theta coupling to improve working memory performance, while in the decision task desynchronization was associated with more impulsive choices and stronger hyperbolic discounting of future rewards. Overall, our findings overcome the past focus of the dlPFC in isolation and show that patient decision making causally relies on synchronous activation in a frontoparietal network related to working memory.

	<p>Background/Objectives: The dysregulation of the hypothalamic&amp;amp;ndash;pituitary&amp;amp;ndash;adrenal (HPA) axis has been associated with various mental disorders. One of the most commonly described parameters of HPA axis functioning is the cortisol awakening response (CAR). To date, few studies have been conducted on the relationship between personality disorders and CAR. The present study aimed to compare the CAR between individuals with personality disorders and healthy controls. Moreover, the study aimed to assess the association of CAR with cognitive biases and psychopathological symptoms in people with personality disorders. Methods: A total of 43 individuals with personality disorders and 45 healthy controls were enrolled. Participants completed questionnaires measuring the severity of depressive symptoms, anxiety, cognitive biases, and psychotic-like experiences. Cortisol levels were measured in four morning saliva samples: immediately after awakening, and after 15, 30, and 45 min. Results: A significantly lower CAR was found among individuals with personality disorders, even after adjustment for age, sex, and the level of education. However, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed a relatively low area under the curve (AUC = 0.362). Furthermore, a significant negative correlation was observed between the CAR and the level of external attribution bias among individuals with personality disorders. No significant associations of the CAR with psychopathological symptoms and other cognitive biases were observed. Conclusions: Findings from this study indicate that the HPA axis activity might be altered in personality disorders. However, the clinical utility of this observation needs further studies in larger samples. External attribution might be related to the HPA axis alterations in this population.</p>

<p>
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Previous studies have observed liver abnormalities in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. This study aimed to investigate whether early signs of liver disease, measured by magnetic resonance imaging-derived iron-corrected T1-mapping (cT1), are risk factors for developing ALS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>cT1 and proton density fat fraction were measured and automatically analyzed using LiverMultiScan® software. The Fibrosis-4 index was calculated using an established formula based on age and blood markers. Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the relationship between liver disease, liver biomarkers, and incident ALS.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In a cohort of 533,707 individuals from UK Biobank, 24 ALS cases were identified among 28,328 participants with liver disease during the follow-up period. Among a total of 33,959 individuals with complete liver imaging data, 15 incident ALS cases were observed during a median follow-up period of 5.6 years. Individuals with liver disease had a higher risk of developing ALS, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 7.35 (95% CI 4.47–12.09; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). An increase in cT1 was also associated with a higher risk of ALS. After adjusting for age, sex, Townsend deprivation index, smoking status, alcohol intake frequency, body mass index, proton density fat fraction, Fibrosis-4, and metabolic syndrome, an increase in cT1 remained significantly associated with a higher risk of ALS, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 3.15 (95% CI 1.79–5.55) per 1-SD increase. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these robust results.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Liver disease activity, indicated by cT1, increases the risk of developing ALS, independent of metabolic syndrome, liver fat, or fibrosis. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

">A hypothalamic circuit mechanism underlying the impact of stress on memory and sleep</a></h4>

              
                Stress profoundly affects sleep and memory processes. Stress impairs memory consolidation, and similarly, disruptions in sleep compromise memory functions. Yet, the neural circuits underlying stress-induced sleep and memory disturbances are still not fully understood. Here, we show that activation of CRHPVN neurons, similar to acute restraint stress, decreases sleep and impairs memory in a spatial object recognition task. Conversely, inhibiting CRHPVN neurons during stress reverses stress-induced memory deficits while slightly increasing the amount of sleep. We found that both stress and stimulation of CRHPVN neurons activate neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LH), and that their projections to the LH are critical for mediating stress-induced memory deficits and sleep disruptions. Our results suggest a pivotal role for CRHPVN neuronal pathways in regulating the adverse effects of stress on memory and sleep, an important step towards improving sleep and ameliorating the cognitive deficits that occur in stress-related disorders.

                The amygdaloid complex mediates learning, memory, and emotions. Understanding the cellular and anatomical features that are specialized in the amygdala of primates versus other vertebrates requires a systematic, anatomically-resolved molecular analysis of constituent cell populations. We analyzed five nuclear subdivisions of the primate amygdala with single-nucleus RNA sequencing in macaques, baboons, and humans to examine gene expression profiles for excitatory and inhibitory neurons and confirmed our results with single-molecule FISH analysis. We identified distinct subtypes of FOXP2+ interneurons in the intercalated cell masses and protein-kinase C-delta interneurons in the central nucleus. We also establish that glutamatergic, pyramidal-like neurons are transcriptionally specialized within the basal, lateral, or accessory basal nuclei. Understanding the molecular heterogeneity of anatomically-resolved amygdalar neuron types provides a cellular framework for improving existing models of how amygdalar neural circuits contribute to cognition and mental health in humans by using nonhuman primates as a translational bridge.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Changes in nuclear morphology, alterations to the nuclear pore complex (NPC), including loss, aggregation, and dysfunction of nucleoporins (Nups), and nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) abnormalities have become hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases. Previous RNA sequencing data utilizing knockdown of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) identified enrichment for pathways and changes in RNAs related to nuclear morphology and showed differential expression of key nuclear targets. This suggests that dysfunction of hnRNP A1, which is observed in neurodegenerative diseases, may contribute to abnormalities in nuclear morphology, NPC, and NCT. Methods: We performed knockdown of hnRNP A1 in Neuro-2A cells, a neuronal cell line, to examine nuclear morphology, NPC, and NCT. Results: First, we examined nuclear morphology using Lamin B, wherein we observed increased nuclear envelope abnormalities in cells with hnRNP A1 knockdown as compared to control. To quantify changes in Lamin B, we designed and validated an automated computer-based model, which quantitatively confirmed our observations. Next, we investigated the impact of hnRNP A1 knockdown on components of the NPC and NCT. In line with the previous literature, we found changes in Nups, including altered distribution and reduced protein expression, as well as disrupted NCT. Finally, we validated our findings in multiple sclerosis (MS) brains, a disease with a significant neurodegenerative component caused by hnRNP A1 dysfunction, where neuronal nuclear envelope alterations were significantly increased as compared to controls. Conclusions: Together, these data implicate hnRNP A1 as an important contributor to nuclear morphology, Nup expression and distribution, and NCT and suggest that hnRNP A1 dysfunction may lead to defects in these processes in neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Cranioplasty (CP) is the main surgical procedure aiming to repair a morphological defect in the skull. It has been shown that early CP is useful for patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) to achieve functional recovery, whereas few studies have investigated the clinical effects of ultra-late CP on TBI outcomes. Methods: Here, we describe the clinical course over 2 years of a TBI patient who underwent CP 19 months after fronto-parietal decompressive craniectomy (DC) of a limited size. Results: We found that after ultra-late CP, a meaningful functional recovery (cognitive and motor), with emergence from a minimally conscious state and recovery of functional communication, was revealed. Conclusions: Our preliminary findings contribute to the actual debate on the timing of CP for this neurosurgical procedure&amp;amp;rsquo;s therapeutic success, as early CP has already been shown.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Internet addiction (IA) and related behaviors, such as Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) and social media addiction (SMA), have gained increasing research attention. Studies show gender differences, with males more likely to develop gaming-related addictions and females more prone to social media and phubbing behaviors. This study aimed to explore gender differences in Internet addiction and related behaviors in a Spanish sample, with the goal of identifying predictors and gender-specific patterns of IA. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study with 585 participants (265 male, 320 female) aged 18 to 35 years (M = 22.11, SD = 3.08). Data were collected using standardized questionnaires to assess IA, IGD, SMA, phubbing, Fear of Missing Out (FoMO), emotional dysregulation, personality traits, and prosociality. Correlation and regression analyses were used to identify gender-specific predictors of IA. Results: Males exhibited significantly higher scores for IA and IGD, while females showed higher scores for SMA and the &amp;amp;ldquo;phone obsession&amp;amp;rdquo; dimension of phubbing. No significant gender differences were found in the &amp;amp;ldquo;communication disturbance&amp;amp;rdquo; dimension of phubbing or in FoMO. Correlation analyses revealed significant associations between IA and psychological as well as technological variables. Gender-specific predictors of IA included social media engagement and emotional regulation for females, while gaming behaviors and communication patterns were more relevant for males. Conclusions: These findings highlight gender differences in IA, suggesting that tailored interventions should address unique online behaviors and emotional regulation challenges in males and females. Future research should refine gender-specific patterns to develop more effective, targeted prevention and treatment strategies.</p>

                Background Spin-offs play a significant role in organizational development strategies, particularly in Islamic banking, by fostering entrepreneurship, innovation, and Shariah-compliant management practices. Indonesia stands as a pioneer in implementing the dual banking system and has established a spin-off policy to foster the growth of Islamic banking. This study investigates whether the spin-off decision has a significant impact on financing risk in Indonesian Islamic banks. Methods Financing risk is measured by the non-performing financing ratio, while the spin-off decision is represented by a dummy variable equal to 1 for the post-spin-off period and 0 for the pre-spin-off period. This study utilizes data from semi-annual reports of 35 Indonesian Islamic banks and analyzes it using a dynamic panel model with the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). Results The findings reveal that spin-offs significantly reduce financing risk, thereby enhancing the financial resilience and boosting investor appeal. Notably, this implies that Islamic banks operating as Islamic windows exhibit a higher level of financing risk compared to fully-fledged Islamic banks. Furthermore, a noteworthy pattern emerges that spin-off Islamic banks with substantial assets demonstrate greater risk in comparison to their counterparts with more modest assets. System GMM also confirmed the result. Conclusions Islamic banks can significantly reduce their financing risks by establishing independent Islamic banks, or spin-offs. Unlike Islamic windows, which are typically integrated within conventional banks and face higher risk levels, standalone Islamic banks offer greater flexibility and control over their operations.

                Background Physical activity plays a crucial role in the health and well-being of older adults, positively influencing various aspects of their quality of life. This study aims to explore the relationship between physical activity and body segments, as well as the risk indices of non-communicable chronic diseases in healthy elderly individuals. Methods The analyzed variables include weekly physical activity, the Postural Correction Index (PCI), measured using the system developed by Portland State University (PSU), and predictors of non-communicable chronic diseases assessed through body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio. Results The results reveal a moderate positive relationship between physical activity and the PCI (r=0.45; p≤0.05), with significant correlations in specific components of the PCI, such as thoracic depression (r=0.51; p<0.01), anteroposterior shoulder alignment (r=0.51; p<0.01), and upper back (r=0.53; p<0.001). Conclusions It is concluded that physical activity has a significant positive impact on the posture of older adults, particularly in the trunk, contributing 40% to the improvement of PCI components. The PCI values obtained, exceeding 82.67 in men and 84.67 in women according to the PSU evaluation, underscore the effectiveness of physical activity in postural correction and the prevention of issues associated with chronic diseases.

                <p>by Ted Moskovitz, Kevin J. Miller, Maneesh Sahani, Matthew M. Botvinick</p>

Dual-process theories play a central role in both psychology and neuroscience, figuring prominently in domains ranging from executive control to reward-based learning to judgment and decision making. In each of these domains, two mechanisms appear to operate concurrently, one relatively high in computational complexity, the other relatively simple. Why is neural information processing organized in this way? We propose an answer to this question based on the notion of compression. The key insight is that dual-process structure can enhance adaptive behavior by allowing an agent to minimize the description length of its own behavior. We apply a single model based on this observation to findings from research on executive control, reward-based learning, and judgment and decision making, showing that seemingly diverse dual-process phenomena can be understood as domain-specific consequences of a single underlying set of computational principles.

                <p>by Rakesh Maharjan, Zhemin Zhang, Philip A. Klenotic, William D. Gregor, Marios L. Tringides, Meng Cui, Georgiana E. Purdy, Edward W. Yu</p>

The <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb) pathogen, the causative agent of the airborne infection tuberculosis (TB), harbors a number of mycobacterial membrane protein large (MmpL) transporters. These membrane proteins can be separated into 2 distinct subclasses, where they perform important functional roles, and thus, are considered potential drug targets to combat TB. Previously, we reported both X-ray and cryo-EM structures of the MmpL3 transporter, providing high-resolution structural information for this subclass of the MmpL proteins. Currently, there is no structural information available for the subclass associated with MmpL4 and MmpL5, transporters that play a critical role in iron homeostasis of the bacterium. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of the <i>M</i>. <i>smegmatis</i> MmpL4 and MmpL5 transporters to resolutions of 2.95 Å and 3.00 Å, respectively. These structures allow us to propose a plausible pathway for siderophore translocation via these 2 transporters, an essential step for iron acquisition that enables the survival and replication of the mycobacterium.

Nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins can engage in complex interactions to detect pathogens and execute a robust immune response via downstream helper NLRs. However, the biochemical mechanisms of helper NLR activation by upstream sensor NLRs remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the coiled-coil helper NLR NRC2 from <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> accumulates in vivo as a homodimer that converts into a higher-order oligomer upon activation by its upstream virus disease resistance protein Rx. The cryo-EM structure of NbNRC2 in its resting state revealed intermolecular interactions that mediate homodimer formation and contribute to immune receptor autoinhibition. These dimerization interfaces have diverged between paralogous NRC proteins to insulate critical network nodes and enable redundant immune pathways, possibly to minimise undesired cross-activation and evade pathogen suppression of immunity. Our results expand the molecular mechanisms of NLR activation pointing to transition from homodimers to higher-order oligomeric resistosomes.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Clemastine has emerged as a promising therapy for the restoration of neurologic function in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, clemastine and other agents with prodifferentiative effects on oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) in rodent models have underperformed in clinical trials. We hypothesized that the preclinical studies showed more robust effects because of the abundance of OPCs in rodent models. To better examine the therapeutic potential of clemastine, we examined its effect on demyelinated white matter lesions in rabbits, which exhibit progenitor densities and limited remyelination more closely matching those found in tissues from patients with MS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used lysolecithin to induce demyelination in white matter of New Zealand rabbits and then administered oral clemastine (10mg/kg/day) for various periods before assessing the OPC and oligodendrocyte (OL) populations in these lesions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Daily administration of clemastine for the full study period (56 days) increased oligodendrogenesis in white matter lesions. However, shorter durations of treatment failed to increase overall OL density despite enhancing OPC-to-OL differentiation. This effect was due to exhaustion of the OPC pool, as the differentiating progenitors were not replaced because of reduced OPC proliferation. Notably, delayed administration of clemastine led to an accumulation of activated OPCs expressing markers of senescence.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Although capable of driving OL differentiation, clemastine treatment in rabbits hampered progenitor pool replenishment, induced senescence, and promoted conversion of microglia/macrophages to a proinflammatory phenotype. Whether these effects would also occur in humans or with other prodifferentiative therapies should be studied further, but our data suggest the need to carefully consider progenitor dynamics in the treatment of MS.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite the advances in treatments for multiple sclerosis (MS), unremitting neurodegeneration continues to drive disability and disease progression. Smoldering/slowly expanding lesions (SELs) and dysfunction of the RNA binding protein (RBP) heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) are pathologic hallmarks of MS cortex and intricately tied to disability and neurodegeneration, respectively. We hypothesized that neuronal hnRNP A1 dysfunction contributes to neurodegeneration and is exacerbated by smoldering/SELs in progressive MS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Neuronal hnRNP A1 pathology (nucleocytoplasmic mislocalization of hnRNP A1) was examined in healthy control and MS brains using immunohistochemistry. MS cases were stratified by severity of hnRNP A1 pathology to examine the link between RBP dysfunction, demyelination, and neurodegeneration.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that smoldering/SELs were only present within a subset of MS tissues characterized by elevated neuronal hnRNP A1 pathology (MS-A1<sup>
   <i>high</i>
</sup>) in adjacent cortical gray matter. In contrast to healthy controls and MS with low hnRNP A1 pathology (MS-A1<sup>
   <i>low</i>
</sup>), MS-A1<sup>
   <i>high</i>
</sup> showed elevated markers of neurodegeneration, including neuronal loss and injury, brain atrophy, axonal loss, and axon degeneration. Additionally, we discovered a subpopulation of morphologically intact neurons lacking expression of NeuN, a neuron-specific RBP, in cortical projection neurons in MS-A1<sup>
   <i>high</i>
</sup> cases.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>hnRNP A1 dysfunction contributes to neurodegeneration and may be exacerbated by smoldering/SELs in progressive MS. The discovery of NeuN-negative neurons suggests that some cortical neurons may only be injured and not lost. By characterizing RBP pathology in MS cortex, this study has important implications for understanding the pathogenic mechanisms driving neurodegeneration, the substrate of disability and disease progression.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23631?af=R">Differential role of NMDA receptors in hippocampal‐dependent spatial memory and plasticity in juvenile male and female rats</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Early life, or juvenility, stands out as the most pivotal phase in neurodevelopment due to its profound impact over the long-term cognition. During this period, significant changes are made in the brain's connections both within and between different areas, particularly in tandem with the development of more intricate behaviors. The hippocampus is among the brain regions that undergo significant postnatal remodeling, including dendritic arborization, synaptogenesis, the formation of complex spines and neuron proliferation. Given the crucial role of the hippocampus in spatial memory processing, it has been observed that spatial memory abilities continue to develop as the hippocampus matures, particularly before puberty. The <i>N</i>-methyl-<span class="smallCaps">d</span>-aspartate (NMDA) type of glutamate receptor channel is crucial for the induction of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and spatial memory formation in both rodents and humans. Although extensive evidence shows the role of NMDA receptors (NMDAr) in spatial memory and synaptic plasticity, the studies addressing the role of NMDAr in spatial memory of juveniles are sparse and mostly limited to adult males. In the present study, we, therefore, aimed to investigate the effects of systemic NMDAr blockade by the MK-801 on spatial memory (novel object location memory, OLM) and hippocampal plasticity in the form of long-term potentiation (LTP) of both male and female juvenile rats. Our results show the sex-dimorphic role of NMDAr in spatial memory and plasticity during juvenility, as systemic NMDAr blockade impairs the OLM and LTP in juvenile males without an effect on juvenile females. Taken together, our results demonstrate that spatial memory and hippocampal plasticity are NMDAr-dependent in juvenile males and NMDAr-independent in juvenile females. These sex-specific differences in the mechanisms of spatial memory and plasticity may imply gender-specific treatment for spatial memory disorders even in children.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23633?af=R">Estrogens dynamically regulate neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of adult female rats</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Estrone and estradiol differentially modulate neuroplasticity and cognition. How they influence the maturation of new neurons in the adult hippocampus, however, is not known. The present study assessed the effects of estrone and estradiol on the maturation timeline of neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of ovariectomized (a model of surgical menopause) young adult Sprague–Dawley rats using daily subcutaneous injections of 17β-estradiol, estrone or vehicle. Rats were injected with a DNA synthesis marker, 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU), and were perfused 1, 2, or 3 weeks after BrdU injection and daily hormone treatment. Brains were sectioned and processed for various markers including: sex-determining region Y-box 2 (Sox2), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), antigen kiel 67 (Ki67), doublecortin (DCX), and neuronal nuclei (NeuN). Immunofluorescent labeling or co-labelling of BrdU with Sox2 (progenitor cells), Sox2/GFAP (neural progenitor cells), Ki67 (cell proliferation), DCX (immature neurons), NeuN (mature neurons) was used to examine the trajectory and maturation of adult-born neurons over time. Estrogens had early (1 week of exposure) effects on different stages of neurogenesis (neural progenitor cells, cell proliferation and early maturation of new cells into neurons) but these effects were less pronounced after prolonged treatment. Estradiol enhanced, whereas estrone reduced cell proliferation after 1 week but not after longer exposure to either estrogen. Both estrogens increased the density of immature neurons (BrdU/DCX-ir) after 1 week of exposure compared to vehicle treatment but this increased density was not sustained over longer durations of treatments to estrogens, suggesting that the enhancing effects of estrogens on neurogenesis were short-lived. Longer duration post-ovariectomy, without treatments with either of the estrogens, was associated with reduced neural progenitor cells in the DG. These results demonstrate that estrogens modulate several aspects of adult hippocampal neurogenesis differently in the short term, but may lose their ability to influence neurogenesis after long-term exposure. These findings have potential implications for treatments involving estrogens after surgical menopause.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Fragile-X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading monogenetic cause of intellectual disability among children but remains without a cure. Using the <i>Fmr1</i>
<i>KO</i> mouse model of FXS, much work has been done to understand FXS hippocampus dysfunction. Purinergic signaling, where ATP and its metabolites are used as signaling molecules, participates in hippocampus development, but it is unknown if purinergic signaling is affected in the developing <i>Fmr1</i>
<i>KO</i> hippocampus. In our study, we characterized the purinergic receptor P2X7. We first found that P2X7 was reduced in <i>Fmr1 KO</i> whole hippocampus tissue at P14 and P21, corresponding to the periods of neurite outgrowth and synaptic refinement in the hippocampus. We then evaluated the cell-specific expression of P2X7 with immunofluorescence and found differences between WT and <i>Fmr1 KO</i> mice in P2X7 colocalization with hippocampal microglia and neurons. P2X7 colocalized more with microglia at P14 and P21, but there was a sex-specific reduction in P2X7 colocalization with neurons. In contrast, male mice at P14 and P21 showed reduced neuronal P2X7 colocalization compared to females, but only females showed reduced absolute neuronal P2X7 expression across the dorsal hippocampal formation. Together, our results suggest that P2X7 expression is altered during <i>Fmr1</i>-KO hippocampal development, potentially influencing several developmental processes in the <i>Fmr1-</i>KO hippocampus formation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23632?af=R">Spatial memory encoding is associated with the anterior and posterior hippocampus: An fMRI activation likelihood estimation meta‐analysis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>It has been hypothesized that differential processing occurs along the longitudinal (anterior–posterior) axis of the hippocampus. One hypothesis is that spatial memory (during both encoding and retrieval) is associated with the posterior hippocampus. An alternative hypothesis is that memory encoding (either spatial or nonspatial) is associated with the anterior hippocampus and memory retrieval is associated with the posterior hippocampus. Of importance, during spatial memory encoding, the spatial–posterior hypothesis predicts posterior hippocampal involvement, whereas the encoding–retrieval hypothesis predicts anterior hippocampal involvement. To distinguish between these hypotheses, we conducted a coordinate-based fMRI activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of 26 studies (with a total of 435 participants) that reported hippocampal activity during spatial memory encoding and/or spatial memory retrieval. Both spatial memory encoding and spatial memory retrieval produced extensive activity along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus as well as the entorhinal cortex, the perirhinal cortex, and the parahippocampal cortex. Critically, the contrast of spatial memory encoding and spatial memory retrieval produced activations in both the anterior hippocampus and the posterior hippocampus. That spatial memory encoding produced activity in both the anterior and posterior hippocampus can be taken to reject strict forms of the spatial–posterior hypothesis, which stipulates that all forms of spatial memory produce activity in the posterior hippocampus, and the encoding–retrieval hypothesis, which stipulates that all forms of encoding versus retrieval produce activity in only the anterior hippocampus. Our results indicate that spatial memory encoding can involve the anterior hippocampus and the posterior hippocampus.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23635?af=R">Time cells in the retrosplenial cortex</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is a key component of the brain's memory systems, with anatomical connections to the hippocampus, anterior thalamus, and entorhinal cortex. This circuit has been implicated in episodic memory and many of these structures have been shown to encode temporal information, which is critical for episodic memory. For example, hippocampal time cells reliably fire during specific segments of time during a delay period. Although RSC lesions are known to disrupt temporal memory, time cells have not been observed there. In this study, we reanalyzed archival RSC neuronal firing data during the intertrial delay period from two previous experiments involving different behavioral tasks, a blocked alternation task and a cued T-maze task. For the blocked alternation task, rats were required to approach the east or west arm of a plus maze for reward during different blocks of trials. Because the reward locations were not cued, the rat had to remember the goal location for each trial. In the cued T-maze task, the reward location was explicitly cued with a light and the rats simply had to approach the light for reward, so there was no requirement to hold a memory during the intertrial delay. Time cells were prevalent in the blocked alternation task, and most time cells clearly differentiated the east and west trials. We also found that RSC neurons could exhibit off-response time fields, periods of reliably inhibited firing. Time cells were also observed in the cued T-maze, but they were less prevalent and they did not differentiate left and right trials as well as in the blocked alternation task, suggesting that RSC time cells are sensitive to the memory demands of the task. These results suggest that temporal coding is a prominent feature of RSC firing patterns, consistent with an RSC role in episodic memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23637?af=R">Curved multiplanar reformatting allows the accurate histological delineation of hippocampal subfields</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Hippocampal subfields perform specific roles in normal cognitive functioning and have distinct vulnerabilities in neurological disorders. However, measurement of subfields with MRI is technically difficult in the head and tail of the hippocampus. Recent studies have utilized curved multiplanar reconstruction (CMPR) to improve subfield visualization in the head and tail, but this method has not yet been applied to histological data.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We utilized BigBrain data, an open-source database of serially sectioned histological data for our analyses. The left hippocampus was segmented according to histological criteria by two raters in order to evaluate intra- and inter-rater reliability of histology-based segmentation throughout the long axis. Segmentation according to our previous protocol for the hippocampal body was then compared to these histological measurements to evaluate for histological validity. Agreement between segmentations was evaluated using Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Intra-rater reliability (DSCs) of histological segmentation was excellent for all subfields: CA1 (0.8599), CA2 (0.7586), CA3/CA4/DG (0.8907), SLM (0.9123), subiculum (0.8149). Similarly, inter-rater reliability analysis demonstrated excellent agreement (DSCs) for all subfield locations: CA1 (0.8203), CA2 (0.7253), CA3/CA4/DG (0.8439), SLM (0.8700), subiculum (0.7794). Finally, histological accuracy (DSCs) for our previous protocol was excellent for all subfields: CA1 (0.8821), CA2 (0.8810), CA3/CA4/DG (0.9802), SLM (0.9879), subiculum (0.8774). When subfields in the hippocampus head, body, and tail were analyzed independently, DSCs also showed excellent agreement.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>CMPR allows reliable subfield segmentation based on histological criteria throughout the hippocampal head, body, and tail. Our previous protocol for the hippocampal body can be applied to provide histologically valid subfield measurements throughout the entire hippocampal long axis.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Despite bilateral hippocampal damage dating to the perinatal or early childhood period and severely impaired episodic memory, patients with developmental amnesia continue to exhibit well-developed semantic memory across the developmental trajectory. Detailed information on the extent and focality of brain damage in these patients is needed to hypothesize about the neural substrate that supports their remarkable capacity for encoding and retrieval of semantic memory. In particular, we need to assess whether the residual hippocampal tissue is involved in this preservation, or whether the surrounding cortical areas reorganize to rescue aspects of these critical cognitive memory processes after early injury. We used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis, automatic (FreeSurfer) and manual segmentation to characterize structural changes in the brain of an exceptionally large cohort of 23 patients with developmental amnesia in comparison with 32 control subjects. Both the VBM and the FreeSurfer analyses revealed severe structural alterations in the hippocampus and thalamus of patients with developmental amnesia. Milder damage was found in the amygdala, caudate, and parahippocampal gyrus. Manual segmentation demonstrated differences in the degree of atrophy of the hippocampal subregions in patients. The level of atrophy in CA-DG subregions and subicular complex was more than 40%, while the atrophy of the uncus was moderate (−24%). Anatomo-functional correlations were observed between the volumes of residual hippocampal subregions in patients and selective aspects of their cognitive performance, viz, intelligence, working memory, and verbal and visuospatial recall. Our findings suggest that in patients with developmental amnesia, cognitive processing is compromised as a function of the extent of atrophy in hippocampal subregions. More severe hippocampal damage may be more likely to promote structural and/or functional reorganization in areas connected to the hippocampus. In this hypothesis, different levels of hippocampal function may be rescued following this variable reorganization. Our findings document not only the extent, but also the limits of circuit reorganization occurring in the young brain after early bilateral hippocampal damage.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In the entorhinal cortex (EC), attempts have been made to identify the human homologue regions of the medial (MEC) and lateral (LEC) subregions using either functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). However, there are still discrepancies between entorhinal subdivisions depending on the choice of connectivity seed regions and the imaging modality used. While DTI can be used to follow the white matter tracts of the brain, fMRI can identify functionally connected brain regions. In this study, we used both DTI and resting-state fMRI in 103 healthy adults to investigate both structural and functional connectivity between the EC and associated cortical brain regions. Differential connectivity with these regions was then used to predict the locations of the human homologues of MEC and LEC. Our results from combining DTI and fMRI support a subdivision into posteromedial (pmEC) and anterolateral (alEC) EC and reveal a confined border between the pmEC and alEC. Furthermore, the EC subregions obtained by either imaging modality showed similar distinct whole-brain connectivity profiles. Optimizing the delineation of the human homologues of MEC and LEC with a combined, cross-validated DTI-fMRI approach allows to define a likely border between the two subdivisions and has implications for both cognitive and translational neuroscience research.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23636?af=R">Hippocampal storage and recall of neocortical “What”–“Where” representations</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A key question for understanding the function of the hippocampus in memory is how information is recalled from the hippocampus to the neocortex. This was investigated in a neuronal network model of the hippocampal system in which “What” and “Where” neuronal firing rate vectors were applied to separate neocortical modules, which then activated entorhinal cortex “What” and “Where” modules, then the dentate gyrus, then CA3, then CA1, then the entorhinal cortex, and then the backprojections to the neocortex. A rate model showed that the whole system could be trained to recall “Where” in the neocortex from “What” applied as a retrieval cue to the neocortex, and could in principle be trained up towards the theoretical capacity determined largely by the number of synapses onto any one neuron divided by the sparseness of the representation. The trained synaptic weights were then imported into an integrate-and-fire simulation of the same architecture, which showed that the time from presenting a retrieval cue to a neocortex module to recall the whole memory in the neocortex is approximately 100 ms. This is sufficiently fast for the backprojection synapses to be trained onto the still active neocortical neurons during storage of the episodic memory, and this is needed for recall to operate correctly to the neocortex. These simulations also showed that the long loop neocortex–hippocampus–neocortex that operates continuously in time may contribute to complete recall in the neocortex; but that this positive feedback long loop makes the whole dynamical system inherently liable to a pathological increase in neuronal activity. Important factors that contributed to stability included increased inhibition in CA3 and CA1 to keep the firing rates low; and temporal adaptation of the neuronal firing and of active synapses, which are proposed to make an important contribution to stabilizing runaway excitation in cortical circuits in the brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1249/v1?src=rss">Can indoor plants reduce formaldehyde levels in the anatomy dissection hall? A study to evaluate the practicality of using plants in reducing formaldehyde levels [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Formaldehyde a commonly used embalming fluid for the preservation of cadavers, produces numerous short and long-term side effects on the students and staff working with it. Indoor plants have been shown to reduce atmospheric formaldehyde levels. The purpose of the study was to compare the efficacy of indoor plants in reducing formaldehyde levels in ambient air to levels deemed safe by WHO standards Methods The study was conducted in the storage room of the Anatomical dissection hall. 7 potted plants of one variety were kept in the storage room for 14 days and the Formaldehyde reading was measured using a VOC (Volatile Organic Compound) monitor. Then the same was done with no plant. This cycle was repeated 2 more times, with two different plant species. The three spieces of plants used for this study were as follows: Dracaena trifasciata, Epipremnum aureum, Spathiphyllum. Results The results were analysed and compared and it was determined that the effect of having a plant present versus having no plant present on the Formaldehyde concentration in the air was inconclusive as Dracaena trifasciata failed to reject the null hypothesis altogether (p-value>0.05), while Epipremnum aureum and Spathiphyllum rejected the null hypothesis (p-value<0.05), however they both had a weak positive correlation with formaldehyde concentration. Conclusion The efficacy of indoor plants in reducing formaldehyde levels in ambient air needs to be further explored and validated since all the prior studies conducted were in controlled environment and should be done in a real time scenario for its practical and beneficial uses.

                Background Table tennis presented a unique and accessible sport for people of all ages, particularly seniors compared to other sports. Methods This study utilized a quantitative with 136 Table tennis players those who registered for attending in the Thailand Master Table tennis Championships 2024 which hosted in January 2024 at Chiangmai. The questionnaire based on the measurement quality of life, WHOQOL Thai version, and analyzed using Descriptive statistics, Pearson Correlation. Results Pearson correlation coefficients between the scores of the quality of life in four dimensions and the overall score revealed significant correlations (p < 0.01) with all dimensions, including physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environmental health. Conclusions Playing Table tennis for senior in the tournament level helped to improve the quality of life in all domains.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-304/v2?src=rss">Knowledge and Attitude of self-medication with leftover antibiotics in Saudi Arabia: A cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Antimicrobial resistance is increasing at an alarming rate. The use of antibiotics without a prescription by a patient or other family members and their inappropriate storage have caused serious health issues as it would lead to antibiotic resistance and exposure to the risk of harmful adverse effects unnecessarily. Therefore, the study aimed to evaluate the current behaviour of antibiotic usage, storage, re-usage and misuse among the residents of Saudi Arabia. Methods This is a cross-sectional study. Our target study population was the residents of Saudi Arabia. Data were collected by an online questionnaire and analysed by SPSS. Results A total of 738 participants answered the online questionnaire from all ages, genders, nationalities, and socioeconomic backgrounds residing in different regions across the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 76.42% knew that an antibiotic is a chemical substance used to treat infections. The participants were questioned about when they started using antibiotics, to which 95.66% (n=706) responded after consulting a physician, 3.25% (n=24) said when they felt ill for any reason, and 1.08% (n=8) replied after first attempting herbal medicine. A total of 147 participants admitted that they store excess pills of antibiotics after being prescribed for an infection and reuse them later on for symptoms like sore throat and fever. Conclusions The results indicated that nearly half of the participants used leftover antibiotics. Participants having children in their homes significantly reuse antibiotics. However, one-third of the participants didn’t complete the antibiotics course. A large portion of the population, regardless of age, level of education, or professional background, have continued to store leftover antibiotics after an infection treatment and reuse them once they think they need them for new symptoms. This advice further revises the current measures to fill those gaps and reduce this habit.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93981">Intrinsic dynamics of randomly clustered networks generate place fields and preplay of novel environments</a></h4>

              
                During both sleep and awake immobility, hippocampal place cells reactivate time-compressed versions of sequences representing recently experienced trajectories in a phenomenon known as replay. Intriguingly, spontaneous sequences can also correspond to forthcoming trajectories in novel environments experienced later, in a phenomenon known as preplay. Here, we present a model showing that sequences of spikes correlated with the place fields underlying spatial trajectories in both previously experienced and future novel environments can arise spontaneously in neural circuits with random, clustered connectivity rather than pre-configured spatial maps. Moreover, the realistic place fields themselves arise in the circuit from minimal, landmark-based inputs. We find that preplay quality depends on the network’s balance of cluster isolation and overlap, with optimal preplay occurring in small-world regimes of high clustering yet short path lengths. We validate the results of our model by applying the same place field and preplay analyses to previously published rat hippocampal place cell data. Our results show that clustered recurrent connectivity can generate spontaneous preplay and immediate replay of novel environments. These findings support a framework whereby novel sensory experiences become associated with preexisting “pluripotent” internal neural activity patterns.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94970">Population clustering of structural brain aging and its association with brain development</a></h4>

              
                Structural brain aging has demonstrated strong inter-individual heterogeneity and mirroring patterns with brain development. However, due to the lack of large-scale longitudinal neuroimaging studies, most of the existing research focused on the cross-sectional changes of brain aging. In this investigation, we present a data-driven approach that incorporate both cross-sectional changes and longitudinal trajectories of structural brain aging and identified two brain aging patterns among 37,013 healthy participants from UK Biobank. Participants with accelerated brain aging also demonstrated accelerated biological aging, cognitive decline and increased genetic susceptibilities to major neuropsychiatric disorders. Further, by integrating longitudinal neuroimaging studies from a multi-center adolescent cohort, we validated the ‘last in, first out’ mirroring hypothesis and identified brain regions with manifested mirroring patterns between brain aging and brain development. Genomic analyses revealed risk loci and genes contributing to accelerated brain aging and delayed brain development, providing molecular basis for elucidating the biological mechanisms underlying brain aging and related disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90349">Trans regulation of an odorant binding protein by a proto-Y chromosome affects male courtship in house fly</a></h4>

              
                The male-limited inheritance of Y chromosomes favors alleles that increase male fitness, often at the expense of female fitness. Determining the mechanisms underlying these sexually antagonistic effects is challenging because it can require studying Y-linked alleles while they still segregate as polymorphisms. We used a Y chromosome polymorphism in the house fly, <i>Musca domestica</i>, to address this challenge. Two male determining Y chromosomes (Y<sup>M</sup> and III<sup>M</sup>) segregate as stable polymorphisms in natural populations, and they differentially affect multiple traits, including male courtship performance. We identified differentially expressed genes encoding odorant binding proteins (in the <i>Obp56h</i> family) as candidate agents for the courtship differences. Through network analysis and allele-specific expression measurements, we identified multiple genes on the house fly III<sup>M</sup> chromosome that could serve as <i>trans</i> regulators of <i>Obp56h</i> gene expression. One of those genes is homologous to <i>Drosophila melanogaster CG2120</i>, which encodes a transcription factor that binds near <i>Obp56h</i>. Upregulation of <i>CG2120</i> in <i>D. melanogaster</i> nervous tissues reduces copulation latency, consistent with this transcription factor acting as a negative regulator of <i>Obp56h</i> expression. The transcription factor gene, which we name <i>speed date</i>, demonstrates a molecular mechanism by which a Y-linked gene can evolve male-beneficial effects.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96459">Transcriptomic profiling of Schlemm’s canal cells reveals a lymphatic-biased identity and three major cell states</a></h4>

              
                Schlemm’s canal (SC) is central in intraocular pressure regulation but requires much characterization. It has distinct inner and outer walls, each composed of Schlemm’s canal endothelial cells (SECs) with different morphologies and functions. Recent transcriptomic studies of the anterior segment added important knowledge, but were limited in power by SEC numbers or did not focus on SC. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of SC biology, we performed bulk RNA sequencing on C57BL/6 J SC, blood vessel, and lymphatic endothelial cells from limbal tissue (~4,500 SECs). We also analyzed mouse limbal tissues by single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (C57BL/6 J and 129/Sj strains), successfully sequencing 903 individual SECs. Together, these datasets confirm that SC has molecular characteristics of both blood and lymphatic endothelia with a lymphatic phenotype predominating. SECs are enriched in pathways that regulate cell-cell junction formation pointing to the importance of junctions in determining SC fluid permeability. Importantly, and for the first time, our analyses characterize three molecular classes of SECs, molecularly distinguishing inner wall from outer wall SECs and discovering two inner wall cell states that likely result from local environmental differences. Further, and based on ligand and receptor expression patterns, we document key interactions between SECs and cells of the adjacent trabecular meshwork (TM) drainage tissue. Also, we present cell type expression for a collection of human glaucoma genes. These data provide a new molecular foundation that will enable the functional dissection of key homeostatic processes mediated by SECs as well as the development of new glaucoma therapeutics.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94520">The ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate ameliorates neurodevelopmental deficits in the GABAergic system of daf-18/PTEN Caenorhabditis elegans mutants</a></h4>

              
                A finely tuned balance between excitation and inhibition (E/I) is essential for proper brain function. Disruptions in the GABAergic system, which alter this equilibrium, are a common feature in various types of neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Mutations in <i>Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog (PTEN)</i>, the main negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase/Akt pathway, are strongly associated with ASD. However, it is unclear whether <i>PTEN</i> deficiencies can differentially affect inhibitory and excitatory signaling. Using the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> neuromuscular system, where both excitatory (cholinergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic) inputs regulate muscle activity, we found that <i>daf-18</i>/<i>PTEN</i> mutations impact GABAergic (but not cholinergic) neurodevelopment and function. This selective impact results in a deficiency in inhibitory signaling. The defects observed in the GABAergic system in <i>daf-18/PTEN</i> mutants are due to reduced activity of DAF-16/FOXO during development. Ketogenic diets (KGDs) have proven effective for disorders associated with E/I imbalances. However, the mechanisms underlying their action remain largely elusive. We found that a diet enriched with the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate during early development induces DAF-16/FOXO activity, therefore improving GABAergic neurodevelopment and function in <i>daf-18/PTEN</i> mutants. Our study provides valuable insights into the link between <i>PTEN</i> mutations and neurodevelopmental defects and delves into the mechanisms underlying the potential therapeutic effects of KGDs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93312">Integrative study of skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction in a murine pancreatic cancer-induced cachexia model</a></h4>

              
                Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the most common pancreatic cancer, is a deadly cancer, often diagnosed late and resistant to current therapies. PDAC patients are frequently affected by cachexia characterized by muscle mass and strength loss (sarcopenia) contributing to patient frailty and poor therapeutic response. This study assesses the mechanisms underlying mitochondrial remodeling in the cachectic skeletal muscle, through an integrative exploration combining functional, morphological, and omics-based evaluation of gastrocnemius muscle from KIC genetically engineered mice developing autochthonous pancreatic tumor and cachexia. Cachectic PDAC KIC mice exhibit severe sarcopenia with loss of muscle mass and strength associated with reduced muscle fiber’s size and induction of protein degradation processes. Mitochondria in PDAC atrophied muscles show reduced respiratory capacities and structural alterations, associated with deregulation of oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial dynamics pathways. Beyond the metabolic pathways known to be altered in sarcopenic muscle (carbohydrates, proteins, and redox), lipid and nucleic acid metabolisms are also affected. Although the number of mitochondria per cell is not altered, mitochondrial mass shows a twofold decrease and the mitochondrial DNA threefold, suggesting a defect in mitochondrial genome homeostasis. In conclusion, this work provides a framework to guide toward the most relevant targets in the clinic to limit PDAC-induced cachexia.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90859">Direct observation of the neural computations underlying a single decision</a></h4>

              
                Neurobiological investigations of perceptual decision-making have furnished the first glimpse of a flexible cognitive process at the level of single neurons. Neurons in the parietal and prefrontal cortex are thought to represent the accumulation of noisy evidence, acquired over time, leading to a decision. Neural recordings averaged over many decisions have provided support for the deterministic rise in activity to a termination bound. Critically, it is the unobserved stochastic component that is thought to confer variability in both choice and decision time. Here, we elucidate this drift-diffusion signal on individual decisions. We recorded simultaneously from hundreds of neurons in the lateral intraparietal cortex of monkeys while they made decisions about the direction of random dot motion. We show that a single scalar quantity, derived from the weighted sum of the population activity, represents a combination of deterministic drift and stochastic diffusion. Moreover, we provide direct support for the hypothesis that this drift-diffusion signal approximates the quantity responsible for the variability in choice and reaction times. The population-derived signals rely on a small subset of neurons with response fields that overlap the choice targets. These neurons represent the integral of noisy evidence. Another subset of direction-selective neurons with response fields that overlap the motion stimulus appear to represent the integrand. This parsimonious architecture would escape detection by state-space analyses, absent a clear hypothesis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95402">A neurotransmitter atlas of C. elegans males and hermaphrodites</a></h4>

              
                Mapping neurotransmitter identities to neurons is key to understanding information flow in a nervous system. It also provides valuable entry points for studying the development and plasticity of neuronal identity features. In the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> nervous system, neurotransmitter identities have been largely assigned by expression pattern analysis of neurotransmitter pathway genes that encode neurotransmitter biosynthetic enzymes or transporters. However, many of these assignments have relied on multicopy reporter transgenes that may lack relevant <i>cis</i>-regulatory information and therefore may not provide an accurate picture of neurotransmitter usage. We analyzed the expression patterns of 16 CRISPR/Cas9-engineered knock-in reporter strains for all main types of neurotransmitters in <i>C. elegans</i> (glutamate, acetylcholine, GABA, serotonin, dopamine, tyramine, and octopamine) in both the hermaphrodite and the male. Our analysis reveals novel sites of expression of these neurotransmitter systems within both neurons and glia, as well as non-neural cells, most notably in gonadal cells. The resulting expression atlas defines neurons that may be exclusively neuropeptidergic, substantially expands the repertoire of neurons capable of co-transmitting multiple neurotransmitters, and identifies novel sites of monoaminergic neurotransmitter uptake. Furthermore, we also observed unusual co-expression patterns of monoaminergic synthesis pathway genes, suggesting the existence of novel monoaminergic transmitters. Our analysis results in what constitutes the most extensive whole-animal-wide map of neurotransmitter usage to date, paving the way for a better understanding of neuronal communication and neuronal identity specification in <i>C. elegans</i>.

">Failure to reproduce the effect of procedural memory interference on wakeful consolidation of episodic memory in younger and older adults</a></h4>

              
                Brown and Robertson (2007) revealed that skill learning interferes with the wakeful consolidation of episodic memories in young adults. This finding is commonly used as evidence that episodic and procedural memories should not be learned in close temporal proximity but has not been reproduced by an independent laboratory. Additionally, older adults experience episodic memory deficits, but it is unknown whether this group is also vulnerable to this type of interference. We aimed to reproduce Brown and Robertson's (2007) finding in younger adults, while also comparing the magnitude of interference between younger and older adults. Forty younger (18-40 years; n =20) and older adults ([&ge;]55 years; n = 20) visited the laboratory in the morning and acquired episodic memories (a list of words) immediately before a procedural finger-tapping (procedural) task. Half of all participants were exposed to a learnable sequential structure. In the afternoon of the same day, participants were asked to recall the episodic memories from the morning session. We found weak evidence of interference for both age groups and no statistical difference in interference between groups. Our results suggest that the interfering effects of these memory types may be negligible or overestimated, and that these memory types can be acquired together without interference.

">Effects of non-invasive brain stimulation on effective connectivity during working memory task in Neurofibromatosis Type 1 patients</a></h4>

              
                This study examined the effects of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (atDCS) on effective connectivity during a working memory task. Eighteen adolescents with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) completed a single blind sham controlled cross over randomised atDCS trial. Dynamic causal modelling was used to estimate the effective connectivity between regions that showed working memory effects from the fMRI. Group-level inferences for between sessions (pre- and post-stimulation) and stimulation type (atDCS and sham) effects were carried out using the parametric empirical Bayes approach. A correlation analysis was performed to relate the estimated effective connectivity parameters of left dlPFC pre-atDCS and post-atDCS to the concentration of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) measured via magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS-GABA). Next, correlation analysis was repeated using all working memory performance and all pre-atDCS and post-atDCS connectivity parameters. It was found that atDCS decreased average excitatory connectivity from left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) to left superior frontal gyrus and increased average excitatory connectivity to left globus pallidus. Further, reduced average intrinsic (inhibitory) connectivity of left dlPFC was associated with lower MRS-GABA. However, none of the connectivity parameters of dlPFC showed any association with performance on a working memory task. These findings suggest that atDCS reorganised connectivity from frontal to fronto-striatal connectivity. As atDCS-related changes were not specific to the effect of working memory, they may have impacted general cognitive control processes. In addition, by reducing MRS-GABA, atDCS might make dlPFC more sensitive and responsive to external stimulation, such as performance of cognitive tasks.

">Simulation Insights on the Compound Action Potential in Multifascicular Nerves</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Develop an efficient method for simulating evoked compound action potential (eCAP) signals from complex nerves to help optimize and interpret eCAP recordings; validate it through comparison with measured vagus nerve eCAP recordings; elucidate the subtle interplay giving rise to specific eCAP signal shapes and magnitudes. Approach: We developed an extended reciprocity theorem approach to model neuron signals in heterogeneous environments, and use it to study analytically the single fibre action potential. We then established a semi-analytic model that also uses hybrid electromagnetic-electrophysiological simulations to model eCAP signals from complex nerves populated with heterogeneous fiber populations of fibers. A cuff electrode was used to measure activity induced by vagus nerve stimulation in in vivo porcine experiments; these measurements were compared with signals produced by the model. Main Results: The semi-analytic model produces signals that approximate the shape and amplitude of in vivo measurements. Partially activated fascicles contribute substantially to the signal, as eCAP contributions from smoothly varying fiber calibers in fully activated ones partially cancel. As a result, eCAP magnitude does not depend monotonically on the stimulation current and recruitment level. Because the eCAP is sensitive to the degree of activation in individual fascicles, and to the location of the recording electrodes with respect to individual fascicles, the contributions of different fascicles to the recorded eCAP signals vary significantly with changes in the shape and placement of the stimulus and the recording electrodes. Significance: Our method can be used to rapidly assess new stimulation and recording setups involving complex nerves and neurovascular bundles, e.g., to maximize signal information content, for closed-loop control in bioelectronic medicine applications, and potentially to non-destructively reconstruct structural and functional nerve topologies through inverse problem solving.

">A brain-shuttled antibody targeting alpha synuclein aggregates for the treatment of synucleinopathies</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy are members of a class of devastating neurodegenerative diseases called synucleinopathies, which are characterized by the presence of alpha-synuclein (-Syn) rich aggregates in the brains of patients. Passive immunotherapy targeting these aggregates is an attractive disease-modifying strategy. Such an approach must not only demonstrate target selectivity towards -Syn aggregates, but also achieve appropriate brain exposure to have the desired therapeutic effect. Here we present preclinical data for a next-generation antibody for the treatment of synucleinopathies. SAR446159 (ABL301) is a bispecific antibody composed of an -Syn-binding immunoglobulin (IgG) and an engineered insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF1R) binding single-chain variable fragment (scFv), acting as a shuttle to transport an antibody across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). SAR446159 binds tightly and preferentially to -Syn aggregates and prevents their seeding capacity in vitro and in vivo. Incubation with SAR446159 reduced -Syn preformed fibrils (PFFs) uptake in neurons and facilitated uptake and clearance by microglia. In wild type mice injected in the striatum with -Syn PFFs, treatment with SAR446159 reduced the spread of aSyn pathology as measured by phosphorylated -Syn staining and lessened the severity of motor phenotypes. Additionally, in 9-month-old transgenic mice overexpressing -Syn (mThy1--Syn, Line 61), repeated treatment with SAR446159 reduced markers of -Syn aggregation in the brain. SAR446159 had significantly higher brain and CSF penetration over a sustained period than its monospecific counterpart (1E4) in rats and monkeys. The binding properties of SAR446159 combined with its brain-shuttle technology make it a potent, next-generation immunotherapeutic for treating synucleinopathies

                Generations of researchers have sought a link between features of an artistic image and the audience's experience. However, a direct link between the properties of an image and the responses evoked has still not been established. Given the importance of shape to human perception and artistic creation, it can be assumed that one of the most important aspects of an artistic image is the use of different visual structures. We show that a method from the field of computational topology, persistent homology, can be used to analyse properties of image structures and composition at multiple scales. In order to determine the reliability of this method as a tool for analysing visual artworks, we analysed two different sets of abstract paintings that revealed significant discrepancies in the eye tracking and electroencephalography (EEG) activity of viewers. Our research showed that our newly developed method using persistent homology, not only clearly distinguished between two sets of images, which was not possible with common statistical image properties, but also allowed us to map topological features onto gaze fixation heat maps.

">Abstract choice representations during stable choice-response associations</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual decisions have long been framed in terms of the actions used to report a choice. Accordingly, studies of perceptual decision-making have historically relied on tasks with fixed choice-response mappings, in which choice and motor response are inextricably linked. Although several studies have since dissociated choice and response, they have typically involved dynamic switching of the choice-response mapping on a trial-by-trial basis. Thus, it remains unclear if abstract choice representations arise specifically when choice-response relationships change dynamically, or if they reflect a more general property of the decision-making process. Here, we show that in the human brain, choices are represented abstractly, even when the association between choice and motor response remains stable over time. We measured neural activity in humans using magnetoencephalography (MEG) while participants performed a motion discrimination task. Importantly, the associations between perceptual choice and motor response were balanced across experimental conditions and remained stable over many trials. We found neural information about the participants' perceptual choice, independent of both the motor response and the visual stimulus. This abstract choice information increased during the stimulus period and peaked after the response had been made. Furthermore, choice and response information showed distinct cortical distributions, with strongest choice information in frontoparietal regions. Our results suggest that abstract choice representations are not restricted to action-independent contexts or those with dynamic choice-response associations and may therefore reflect a general role in perceptual decision-making.

">Elucidating the neuropathological and molecular heterogeneity of amyloid-beta and tau in Alzheimer's disease through machine learning and transcriptomic integration</a></h4>

              
                Discerning functional brain network variations related to neuropathological aggregates in Alzheimer's disease (AD), including amyloid-beta (Abeta) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau), is crucial for understanding their link to cognitive decline and underlying molecular mechanisms. However, these variations are often confounded by normal aging-related changes, complicating interpretation. To address this challenge, we first defined Alzheimer's continuum cases (Abeta positive (A+), n = 129) and normal elderly (Abeta negative (A-), n = 160) using cerebral spinal fluid amyloid levels, and then applied a novel deep learning approach to resting-state connectivity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the 289 subjects to disentangle A+-specific dimensions in brain network alterations from those shared with A- individuals. The identified A+-specific dimensions were further refined to predict individual Abeta and p-tau levels separately. We observed that resulting brain signatures, defined from A+-specific dimensions for predicting these two CSF biomarkers, were both attributed to the right superior temporal and anterior cingulate cortices and associated with attention and memory domains. When linking the brain signatures to gene expression data from a public transcriptomic atlas, we found that the brain signatures were associated with molecular pathways involving synaptic dysfunction and disruptions in pathways containing activity of excitatory neurons, astrocytes, and microglia. For A--shared dimensions, the A{beta}-linked brain signature involved the left fusiform and right middle cingulate cortices, correlating with the language cognitive measurement and language-related molecular pathways. The p-tau-linked signature predominantly involved the right insula and inferior temporal cortices, correlating with the aging-related molecular pathways. Collectively, our findings provided new insights in understanding of Alzheimer's continuum pathological biomarkers.

">Development and validation of an open-source Hand Laterality Judgement Task for in-person and online studies</a></h4>

              
                The Hand Laterality Judgement Task (HLJT) is considered a measure of the ability to manipulate motor images. The "biomechanical constraints" effect (longer reaction times for hand rotations towards anatomically difficult versus biomechanically easier movements) is considered the behavioural hallmark indicating motor imagery is being used. Previous work has used diverse HLJT paradigms, and there is no standardized procedure for the task. We developed an open-source, freely available version of the HLJT in PsychoPy2, which needs no programming skills and is highly customisable. Some studies suggest responding to the HLJT with the hands may interfere with performance, which would limit practical application of the task. We examined this potential issue using in-person and online versions. For the in-person version, 40 right-footed/handed individuals performed the HLJT with their feet or bimanually (N=20 each). For the online version, 60 right-handed individuals performed the task bimanually or unimanually (N=20 each). Bayesian mixed-effect analyses quantified the evidence for and against equivalence within and between the in-person and online versions. Both versions replicated previously described behavioural phenomena, including effects of angle, hand view, and the "biomechanical constraints" effect. While responding with different effectors modified overall reaction times, it did not interact with other factors analysed, and did not affect accuracy or the "biomechanical constraints" effect. There was also evidence for equivalence between in-person and online bimanual groups for all measures. We conclude that this open-source, standardized HLJT protocol (available at https://osf.io/8h7ec/) can reliably detect previously identified effects and works equally well in-person or online.

">Partial Correlation as a Tool for Mapping Functional-Structural Correspondence in Human Brain Connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Brain structure-function coupling has been studied in health and disease by many different researchers in recent years. Most of the studies have addressed functional connectivity matrices by estimating correlation coefficients between different brain areas, despite well-known disadvantages compared to partial correlation connectivity matrices. Indeed, partial correlation represents a more sensible model for structural connectivity since, under a Gaussian approximation, it accounts only for direct dependencies between brain areas. Motivated by this and following previous results by different authors, we investigate structure-function coupling using partial correlation matrices of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain activity time series under different regularization (a.k.a. noise-cleaning) algorithms. We find that, across different algorithms and conditions, partial correlation provides a higher match with structural connectivity retrieved from Density Weighted Imaging data than standard correlation, and this occurs at both subject and population levels. Importantly, we also show that the precise regularization and thresholding strategy are crucial for this match to emerge. Finally, we assess neuro-genetic associations in relation to structure-function coupling, which presents promising opportunities to further advance research in the field of network neuroscience, particularly concerning brain disorders.

">An AI-Driven Model of Consciousness, Its Disorders, and Their Treatment</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the neural signatures of consciousness and the mechanisms underlying its disorders, such as coma and unresponsive wakefulness syndrome, remains a critical challenge in neuroscience. In this study, we present a novel computational approach for the in silico discovery of neural correlates of consciousness, the mechanisms driving its disorders, and potential treatment strategies. Inspired by generative adversarial networks, which have driven recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (AI), we trained deep neural networks to detect consciousness across multiple brain areas and species, including humans. These networks were then integrated with a genetic algorithm to optimize a brain-wide mean-field model of neural electrodynamics. The result is a realistic simulation of conscious brain states and disorders of consciousness (DOC), which not only recapitulates known mechanisms of unconsciousness but also predicts novel causes expected to lead to these conditions. Beyond simulating DOC, our model provides a platform for exploring therapeutic interventions, specifically deep brain stimulation (DBS), which has shown promise in improving levels of awareness in DOC in over five decades of study. We systematically applied simulated DBS to various brain regions at a wide range of frequencies to identify an optimal paradigm for reigniting consciousness in this cohort. Our findings suggest that in addition to previously studied thalamic and pallidal stimulation, high-frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus, a relatively underexplored target in DOC, may hold significant promise for restoring consciousness in this set of disorders.

">Divergent and Convergent TMEM106B Pathology in Murine Models of Neurodegeneration and Human Disease</a></h4>

              
                TMEM106B is a lysosomal/late endosome protein that is a potent genetic modifier of multiple neurodegenerative diseases as well as general aging. Recently, TMEM106B was shown to form insoluble aggregates in postmortem human brain tissue, drawing attention to TMEM106B pathology and the potential role of TMEM106B aggregation in disease. In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, TMEM106B has been studied in vivo using animal models of neurodegeneration, but these studies rely on overexpression or knockdown approaches. To date, endogenous TMEM106B pathology and its relationship to known canonical pathology in animal models has not been reported. Here, we analyze histological patterns of TMEM106B in murine models of C9ORF72-related amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (C9-ALS/FTD), SOD1-related ALS, and tauopathy and compare these to postmortem human tissue from patients with C9-ALS/FTD, Alzheimers disease (AD), and AD with limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (AD/LATE). We show that there are significant differences between TMEM106B pathology in mouse models and human patient tissue. Importantly, however, we also identified convergent evidence from both murine models and human patients that links TMEM106B pathology to TDP-43 nuclear clearance specifically in C9-ALS. Similarly, we find a profound relationship at the cellular level between TMEM106B pathology and phosphorylated Tau burden in Alzheimers disease. By characterizing endogenous TMEM106B pathology in both mice and human postmortem tissue, our work reveals essential considerations that must be taken when analyzing data from in vivo mouse studies and elucidates new insights supporting the involvement of TMEM106B in the pathogenesis and progression of multiple neurodegenerative diseases.

">Coupling Between Functionality and Trafficking to the Axon Initial Segment in KCNQ2/3 K+ Channels</a></h4>

              
                KCNQ2/3 are the predominant voltage-gated K+ channels localized at the axon initial segment (AIS), the critical site for the initiation of action potentials and the plasticity of excitability. Both the functionality and spatial distribution of KCNQ2/3 provide the basis for the regulation of neuronal excitability and the pathogenesis of various neurological disorders, including epilepsy. However, less is known about how functionality is coupled with trafficking regulation in KCNQ2/3. Here, we study the AIS localization of KCNQ2/3 by performing both multiple- and single-molecule imaging analyses. We found that low-activity mutations in the KCNQ3 subunit affect all of the 3D dynamics composed of lateral diffusion and exo/endocytosis processes through disruption of interaction with ankyrin-G, consequently suppressing the AIS targeting of KCNQ2/3. Thus, the functionality of KCNQ2/3 is coupled with its trafficking regulation, enhancing our understanding of the mechanisms underlying physiological and pathophysiological changes in neuronal excitability.

">Benchmarking Stroke Outcome Prediction through Comprehensive Data Analysis - NeuralCup 2023</a></h4>

              
                Stroke is a significant cause of mortality and long-term disability worldwide, with variable recovery trajectories posing substantial challenges in anticipating post-event care and rehabilitation planning. The NeuralCup 2023 consortium was established to address these challenges by comparing the predictability of stroke outcome models through a collaborative, data-driven approach. This study presents the consortium's findings, which involved 15 participating teams worldwide. Using a comprehensive dataset, which included clinical and imaging data, we conducted an open competition to identify and compare predictors of motor, cognitive, and neuropsychological (emotional) outcomes one-year post-stroke. Analyses incorporated both traditional and novel methods, including machine learning algorithms. These efforts culminated in the search for 'optimal recipes' for predicting each domain through an exhaustive exploration of the features of all the approaches. Key predictors included lesion characteristics, T1-weighted MRI sequences, and demographic factors. Notably, integrating FLAIR imaging and white matter tract analysis emerged as crucial to improving the accuracy of cognitive and motor outcome predictions, respectively. These findings advocate for a tailored, multifaceted approach to stroke outcome prediction, underscoring the potential of collaborative data science in addressing complex neurological prognostication challenges. This study also sets a new benchmark methodology in stroke research, offering a foundational step toward personalized care strategies that could significantly impact recovery planning and quality of life for stroke survivors.

">Noninvasive optical monitoring of cerebral hemodynamics in a preclinical model of neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage</a></h4>

              
                Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a common complication in premature infants and is associated with white matter injury and long-term neurodevelopmental disabilities. Standard diagnostic tools such as cranial ultrasound and MRI are widely used in both preclinical drug development and clinical practice to detect IVH. However, these methods only provide endpoint assessments of blood accumulation and lack real-time information about dynamic changes in ventricular blood flow. This limitation could potentially result in missed opportunities to advance drug candidates that may have protective effects against IVH. In this pilot study, we aimed to develop a noninvasive optical approach using diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) to monitor real-time hemodynamic changes associated with hemorrhagic and sub-hemorrhagic events in a preclinical rabbit model of IVH. DCS measurements were conducted during the experimental induction of IVH, and results were compared with ultrasound and histological analysis to validate findings. Significant changes in hemodynamics were detected in all animals subjected to IVH-inducing procedures, including those that did not show clear positive results on ultrasound. The study revealed progressively elevated coefficients of variation in blood flow, particularly driven by increased oscillations within the 0.05-0.1 Hz frequency band. These hemodynamic changes were more pronounced in animals that developed IVH, as confirmed by ultrasound. Our findings suggest that real-time optical monitoring with DCS can provide critical insights into pathological blood flow changes, offering a more sensitive and informative tool for evaluating potential therapeutics in the context of IVH.

">The combination of optogenetic-induced protein aggregation and proximity biotinylation assays strongly implicates endolysosomal proteins in the early stages of α-synuclein aggregation</a></h4>

              
                Alpha-synuclein (-syn) aggregation is a defining feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) and related synucleinopathies. Despite significant research efforts focused on understanding -syn aggregation mechanisms, the early stages of this process remain elusive, largely due to limitations in experimental tools that lack the temporal resolution to capture these dynamic events. Here, we introduce UltraID-LIPA, an innovative platform that combines the Light-Inducible Protein Aggregation (LIPA) system with the UltraID proximity-dependent biotinylation assay to identify -syn-interacting proteins and uncover key mechanisms driving its oligomerization. UltraID-LIPA successfully identified 38 -syn-interacting proteins, including both established and novel candidates, highlighting the accuracy and robustness of the approach. Notably, a strong interaction with endolysosomal and membrane-associated proteins was observed, supporting the hypothesis that interactions with membrane-bound organelles are pivotal in the early stages of -syn aggregation. This powerful platform provides new insights into dynamic protein aggregation events, enhancing our understanding of synucleinopathies and other proteinopathies.

">Sleep-Induced Vasomotor Pulsation is a Driver of Cerebrospinal Fluid and Blood-Brain Barrier Dynamics in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is crucial for restoring and maintaining brain tissue homeostasis, primarily through enhanced transport of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) solutes. Infra-slow (<0.1 Hz) vasomotion, CSF flow, and the electrical potential of blood-brain barrier (BBB) all increase during sleep. While these phenomena have been linked to CSF solute transport, there is little understanding of their interaction as potentials drivers of CSF flow. Therefore, we recorded these three signals in a group of healthy volunteers across sleep-wake states with simultaneous 10 Hz functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) contrast, direct current-coupled electroencephalography (DC-EEG), and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). We next investigated the directed coupling patterns between these linked processes according to phase transfer entropy (TE). In the awake state, the electrophysiological BBB potential and water fluctuations predicted vasomotor waves uniformly throughout the brain. In sleep state, results showed a reversal of the direction of this coupling in cerebral cortex, as vasomotor BOLD waves started predicting both CSF and BBB potential shifts. Our findings indicate that vasomotor waves become the primary driver of CSF hydrodynamics and BBB electrical potential in human brain during sleep.

">Mitochondria are absent from microglial processes performing surveillance, chemotaxis, and phagocytic engulfment</a></h4>

              
                Microglia continually surveil the brain allowing for rapid detection of tissue damage or infection. Microglial metabolism is linked to tissue homeostasis, yet how mitochondria are subcellularly partitioned in microglia and dynamically reorganize during surveillance, injury responses, and phagocytic engulfment in the intact brain are not known. Here, we performed intravital imaging of microglia mitochondria, revealing that microglial processes diverge, with some containing multiple mitochondria while others are completely void. Microglial processes that engage in minute-to-minute surveillance typically do not have mitochondria. Moreover, unlike process surveillance, mitochondrial motility does not change with animal anesthesia. Likewise, the processes that acutely chemoattract to a lesion site or initially engage with a neuron undergoing programmed cell death do not contain mitochondria. Rather, microglia mitochondria have a delayed arrival into the responding cell processes. Thus, there is subcellular heterogeneity of mitochondrial partitioning and asymmetry between mitochondrial localization and cell process motility or acute damage responses.

	<p>(1) Background. Neurofeedback has been used in sports since the 1990s, frequently showing positive outcomes in enhancing athletic performance. This systematic review provides an updated analysis of neurofeedback training in sports, evaluating reaction time, cognitive performance, and emotional regulation to address literature gaps and suggest future research directions. (2) Methods. A systematic search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and Web of Science databases for articles published from January 2016 to April 2023. The search included only original articles written in English, resulting in 24 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. (3) Results. The reviewed studies cover a wide range of sports, including golf, basketball, swimming, rifle shooting, football, volleyball, athletics, judo, ice hockey, triathlon, handball, fencing, taekwondo, and darts. They involved athletes of varying experience levels (beginners, professionals, and experts) and utilized neurofeedback training targeting different frequency bands (alpha, beta, theta, and SMR), either individually or in mixed protocols. Findings show improvements in sports and cognitive performance, emotional regulation, and anxiety management. (4) Conclusions. This systematic review supports the effectiveness of neurofeedback in enhancing sports and cognitive performance across various disciplines and experience levels. Notable improvements were observed in technical skills, physical performance parameters, scoring, attention, concentration, reaction time, short-term and working memory, self-regulation, and cognitive anxiety. Future research should standardize protocols, include more diverse samples, and explore long-term effects to further validate these findings.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Figurative language is a central tool for enriching spoken and written languages, and it is important for building social relationships. Difficulties in figurative language understanding may impair social adjustment. Some studies have found more gaps in the understanding of irony and idioms among children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared to those of their peers with typical development (TD). To date, no studies have examined the relationship between the ability to understand social situations (as a separate ability) and the ability to understand irony and idioms. The present study examined the roles of theory of mind (ToM) and social situation understanding in the comprehension of idioms and ironic criticism. Methods: The current study included 58 participants aged 8&amp;amp;ndash;11, including 28 children with high-functioning ASD and 30 children with TD matched by age, gender, and nonverbal intelligence. All the participants completed a ToM questionnaire that assesses their understanding of others&amp;amp;rsquo; intentions, as well as a questionnaire pertaining to their comprehension of social situations, ironic criticism, and idioms. Results: TD children outperformed the autistic children in idiom and irony understanding, as well as in ToM and social situation understanding. Understanding social situations and ToM contributed to idiom and irony understanding, with ToM ability uniquely contributing to irony (but not to idiom) understanding. Path analysis revealed that social cognitive abilities mediated the link between group affiliation and vocabulary, affecting figurative language comprehension. Conclusions: The present study demonstrates that social cognition skills influence the ability to understand ironic criticism and idioms, mediating the association between vocabulary and figurative language comprehension.</p>

	<p>Objectives: To provide a basis for further research on the molecular mechanisms underlying type 2 diabetes-associated mild cognitive impairment (DCI) using two bioinformatics methods to screen key genes involved in the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and type 2 diabetes. Methods: RNA sequencing data of MCI and normal cognition groups, as well as expression profile and sample information data of clinical characteristic data of GSE63060, which contains 160 MCI samples and 104 normal samples, were downloaded from the GEO database. Hub genes were identified using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Protein&amp;amp;ndash;protein interaction (PPI) analysis, combined with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses, was used to verify the genes. Moreover, RNA sequencing and clinical characteristic data for GSE166502 of 13 type 2 diabetes samples and 13 normal controls were downloaded from the GEO database, and the correlation between the screened genes and type 2 diabetes was verified by difference and ROC curve analyses. In addition, we collected clinical biopsies to validate the results. Results: Based on WGCNA, 10 modules were integrated, and six were correlated with MCI. Six hub genes associated with MCI (TOMM7, SNRPG, COX7C, UQCRQ, RPL31, and RPS24) were identified using the LASSO algorithm. The ROC curve was screened by integrating the GEO database, and revealed COX7C, SNRPG, TOMM7, and RPS24 as key genes in the progression of type 2 diabetes. Conclusions: COX7C, SNRPG, TOMM7, and RPS24 are involved in MCI and type 2 diabetes progression. Therefore, the molecular mechanisms of these four genes in the development of type 2 diabetes-associated MCI should be studied.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Co-occurring mental health conditions affect autistic individuals at high rates, impacting their well-being and quality of life. Mental health conditions are often appropriate treatment targets that can improve the lives of autistic individuals. Because of this, there is growing interest in predictors of mental health and behavioral outcomes. Given the rapidly evolving evidence base and growing literature using longitudinal cohorts, it is unclear which predictors of symptoms of anxiety and depression are consistent, and which are not. Additionally, it is difficult to deduce which predictors of mental health symptoms at a given time also predict change over time. This can be partially due to the different statistical approaches that are implemented, including trajectory vs. non-trajectory methodologies. Methods: We conducted a systematic review to evaluate how non-trajectory and trajectory analyses inform our knowledge of how symptoms of anxiety and depression change over time. Additionally, we aimed to identify important predictors of change and later anxiety and depressive symptoms in autistic individuals. Results: There is variability in symptoms of anxiety and depression in autistic individuals. Adaptive skills arose as significant predictors of change and of later symptoms of both anxiety and depression. Peer relationships in school age seem to be particularly important in predicting later symptoms of depression. Conclusions: This review provides evidence that there are different trajectories and different patterns of mental health symptoms over the lifespan, providing further evidence that autism is a developmental condition that changes over time in different ways for different people. Implications and future directions are further discussed.</p>

                Background Individuals with Parkinson’s Disease (PD), particularly those with the rigid-akinetic with postural instability (RA) subtype, often experience motor symptoms that impair functionality and postural control. Physiotherapy interventions, including both dry land and aquatic therapies, can help manage PD treatment. This study aimed to develop and assess the effects of two exercise protocols emphasizing the extensor musculature of the vertebral column (dry land and shallow water) on functional capacity in individuals with and without RA-type PD. Methods The study utilized a protocol study followed by a randomized clinical trial, with the registry number NCT04863118, involving ten RA-type PD (intervention group) and ten individuals without PD (reference group). Participants underwent exercise protocols of varying intensity levels, and their pre and post-intervention functional capacity were evaluated using standardized tests. The applicability and safety of these protocols were assessed through a self-perception questionnaire. Results Significant improvements were observed in functional capacity parameters following both dry land and aquatic physiotherapy interventions among PD individuals, including increased repetitions in the Sit-to-Stand test and reduced completion time in the Timed Up and Go test. Similar positive outcomes were observed in individuals without PD, indicating the efficacy of these interventions irrespective of PD status. Conclusion A single session of physiotherapy, whether on dry land or in shallow water, focusing on the extensor musculature of the vertebral column, enhances functional capacity in PD and non-PD individuals alike. Furthermore, the protocols demonstrated safety, comfort, and acceptability, promoting treatment adherence and future recommendations. These findings support the implementation of these protocols in clinical practice, aiding therapists in enhancing rehabilitation outcomes while ensuring individual safety.

                Abstract Background Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) pose a significant global health threat, with increasing prevalence worldwide, including in Indonesia. Despite the public health impact, comprehensive data on the burden of CRE in Indonesia remains fragmented. This protocol outlines a systematic review and meta-analysis aiming to estimate the prevalence of CRE in Indonesia, summarize trends over time, and identify key resistance mechanisms. Methods We will conduct a systematic search across multiple electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, and local Indonesian databases, for studies reporting the prevalence of CRE in Indonesia from 2008 to 2024. Eligibility criteria include observational studies (cross-sectional, cohort, and case-control) and surveillance reports. Data extraction will focus on CRE prevalence, bacterial species, sample types, resistance mechanisms, and study settings (hospital vs. community). Quality assessment of studies will be performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Meta-analysis will be conducted using a random-effects model to estimate pooled prevalence, and subgroup analysis will explore variations by geographical region, period, and healthcare setting. Discussion This systematic review and meta-analysis will provide the first comprehensive overview of CRE prevalence in Indonesia, contributing to an improved understanding of the national burden and resistance patterns. The findings will guide public health policies and inform antimicrobial stewardship efforts in Indonesia. Registration PROSPERO CRD42024580177

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/10/ENEURO.0192-24.2024?rss=1">Distinct Roles of Medial Prefrontal Cortex Subregions in the Consolidation and Recall of Remote Spatial Memories</a></h4>

              
                <p>It is a common belief that memories, over time, become progressively independent of the hippocampus and are gradually stored in cortical areas. This view is mainly based on evidence showing that prefrontal cortex (PFC) manipulations impair the retrieval of remote memories, while hippocampal inhibition does not. More controversial is whether activity in the medial PFC is required immediately after learning to initiate consolidation. Another question concerns functional differences among PFC subregions in forming and storing remote memories. To address these issues, we directly contrasted the effects of loss-of-function manipulations of the anterior cingulate cortex (aCC) and the ventromedial PFC, which includes the infralimbic (IL) and prelimbic (PL) cortices, before testing and immediately after training on the ability of CD1 mice to recall the hidden platform location in the Morris water maze. We injected an AAV carrying the hM4Di receptor into the PL&ndash;IL or aCC. Interestingly, pretest administrations of clozapine-N-oxide (CNO; 3&nbsp;mg/kg) revealed that the aCC, but not the PL&ndash;IL, was necessary to recall remote spatial information. Furthermore, systemic post-training administration of CNO impaired memory recall at remote, but not recent, time points in both groups. These findings revealed a functional dissociation between the two prefrontal areas, demonstrating that both the PL&ndash;IL and the aCC are involved in early consolidation of remote spatial memories, but only the aCC is engaged in their recall.</p>

                <p>The Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling pathway is vital in neural progenitor cell proliferation, specification, and differentiation. The BMP signaling antagonist Gremlin 2 (Grem2) is the most potent natural inhibitor of BMP expressed in the adult brain; however its function remains unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we have analyzed mice lacking Grem2 via homologous recombination (<I>Grem2<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I>). Histological analysis of brain sections revealed significant scattering of CA3 pyramidal cells within the dentate hilus in the hippocampus of <I>Grem2<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> mice. Furthermore, the number of proliferating neural stem cells and neuroblasts was significantly decreased in the subgranular zone of <I>Grem2<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> mice compared with that of wild-type (WT) controls. Due to the role of hippocampal neurogenesis in neurological disorders, we tested mice on a battery of neurobehavioral tests. <I>Grem2<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> mice exhibited increased anxiety on the elevated zero maze in response to acute and chronic stress. Specifically, male <I>Grem2<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> mice showed increased anxiogenesis following chronic stress, and this was correlated with higher levels of BMP signaling and decreased proliferation in the dentate gyrus. Additionally, when chemically challenged with kainic acid, <I>Grem2<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> mice displayed a higher susceptibility to and increased severity of seizures compared with WTs. Together, our data indicate that Grem2 regulates BMP signaling and is vital in maintaining homeostasis in adult hippocampal neurogenesis and structure. Furthermore, the lack of Grem2 contributes to the development and progression of neurogenesis-related disorders such as anxiety and epilepsy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-934/v2?src=rss">Assessment of early neonatal practices to prevent hypothermia ; A comparative study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Globally, neonatal deaths are significantly attributed to hypothermia. This is mostly because of its co-morbidity with asphyxia, premature birth and severe neonatal infections. Worldwide, neonatal hypothermia case fatality rates (CFRs) range from 8.5% to 52%. This study aimed to assess how well a video-based training intervention on mothers’ knowledge and practices in preventing neonatal hypothermia worked. Methods The knowledge and practices of two groups of primi-para mothers—one control group and one intervention group—were compared in order to achieve this. A total of 124 primipara mothers took part in the research. Using a video based tool, the intervention group was educated about preventing hypothermia in newborns. Both control and intervention group mothers were interviewed to compare the knowledge and practices. Results Sixty-one of the sixty-two mothers in the control group were unsure of which body area to cover in order to preserve the baby’s body heat. Following the intervention, 61 out of 62 mothers in the group recognised which body part to cover to protect the baby’s body heat. In the post-intervention group, 98.4% of moms wore a cap over their baby’s head, compared to just 35.5% in the control group. Conclusion The results of this study demonstrate the significant improvement in mothers’ knowledge and actions about the prevention of neonatal hypothermia resulting from the use of a video-based training tool.

                Salivary gland cancers (SGC) are rare neoplasms that exhibit a wide array of histological heterogeneities. Most patients presenting with SGCs are asymptomatic, as they are typically slow-growing and localized. Primary surgical resection is the cornerstone treatment for SGCs and radiotherapy is performed in selected cases. There is no consensus on concrete standard post-operative guidelines. Patients are followed-up for years, however an agreed duration of follow-up is less elucidated in the literature present on the subject. Distant metastases are the primary cause of treatment failure. Post-operative diagnostic evidence of disease recurrence or distant metastases is heavily guided by radiological examinations. Patients with SGCs have better outcomes with a well-structured and lengthy follow-up plan. This review aims to suggest an appropriate follow-up duration and radiological modalities used post-operatively for SGC patients.

                Abstract Background Large Language Models (LLMs), as in the case of OpenAITM ChatGPT-4TM Turbo, are revolutionizing several industries, including higher education. In this context, LLMs can be personalised through customization process to meet the student demands on every particular subject, like statistics. Recently, OpenAI launched the possibility of customizing their model with a natural language web interface, enabling the creation of customised GPT versions deliberately conditioned to meet the demands of a specific task. Methods This preliminary research aims to assess the potential of the customised GPTs. After developing a Business Statistics Virtual Professor (BSVP), tailored for students at the Universidad Pontificia Comillas, its behaviour was evaluated and compared with that of ChatGPT-4 Turbo. Firstly, each professor collected 15-30 genuine student questions from “Statistics and Probability” and “Business Statistics” courses across seven degrees, primarily from second-year courses. These questions, often ambiguous and imprecise, were posed to ChatGPT-4 Turbo and BSVP, with their initial responses recorded without follow-ups. In the third stage, professors blindly evaluated the responses on a 0-10 scale, considering quality, depth, and personalization. Finally, a statistical comparison of the systems’ performance was conducted. Results The results lead to several conclusions. Firstly, a substantial modification in the style of communication was observed. Following the instructions it was trained with, BSVP responded in a more relatable and friendly tone, even incorporating a few minor jokes. Secondly, when explicitly asked for something like, “I would like to practice a programming exercise similar to those in R practice 4,” BSVP could provide a far superior response. Lastly, regarding overall performance, quality, depth, and alignment with the specific content of the course, no statistically significant differences were observed in the responses between BSVP and ChatGPT-4 Turbo. Conclusions It appears that customised assistants trained with prompts present advantages as virtual aids for students, yet they do not constitute a substantial improvement over ChatGPT-4 Turbo.

                Lutein, a plant-derived xanthophyl-carotenoid, is an exceptional antioxidant and anti-inflammatory constituent found in food. High dietary intake of lutein is beneficial against eye disease, improves cardiometabolic health, protects from neurodegenerative diseases, and is beneficial for liver, kidney, and respiratory health. Lutein protects against oxidative and nitrosative stress, both of which play a major role in long COVID and mRNA vaccination injury syndromes. Lutein is an important natural agent for therapeutic use against oxidative and nitrosative stress in chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. It can also potentially inhibit spike protein-induced inflammation. Rich dietary supplementation of lutein, naturally derived in non-biodegradable Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO), can most optimally be used against oxidative and nitrosative stress during post-COVID and mRNA vaccination injury syndromes. Due to its high oleic acid (OA) content, EVOO supports optimal absorption of dietary lutein. The main molecular pathways by which the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein induces pathology, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer activated B cells (NF-κB) and activated protein (AP)-1, can be suppressed by lutein. Synergy with other natural compounds for spike protein detoxification is likely.

                Long-read sequencing technologies have transformed the field of epigenetics by enabling direct, single-base resolution detection of DNA modifications, such as methylation. This produces novel opportunities for studying the role of DNA methylation in gene regulation, imprinting, and disease. However, the unique characteristics of long-read data, including the modBAM format and extended read lengths, necessitate the development of specialised software tools for effective analysis. The NanoMethViz package provides a suite of tools for loading in long-read methylation data, visualising data at various data resolutions. It can convert the data for use with other Bioconductor software such as bsseq, DSS, dmrseq and edgeR to discover differentially methylated regions (DMRs). In this workflow article, we demonstrate the process of converting modBAM files into formats suitable for comprehensive downstream analysis. We leverage NanoMethViz to conduct an exploratory analysis, visually summarizing differences between samples, examining aggregate methylation profiles across gene and CpG islands, and investigating methylation patterns within specific regions at the single-read level. Additionally, we illustrate the use of dmrseq for identifying DMRs and show how to integrate these findings into gene-level visualization plots. Our analysis is applied to a triplicate dataset of haplotyped long-read methylation data from mouse neural stem cells, allowing us to visualize and compare the characteristics of the parental alleles on chromosome 7. By applying DMR analysis, we recover DMRs associated with known imprinted genes and visualise the methylation patterns of these genes summarised at single-read resolution. Through DMR analysis, we identify DMRs associated with known imprinted genes and visualize their methylation patterns at single-read resolution. This streamlined workflow is adaptable to common experimental designs and offers flexibility in the choice of upstream data sources and downstream statistical analysis tools.

The efficiency of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) in industrial wastewater treatment is profoundly influenced by the microbial community, which can be disrupted by variable industrial operations. Although microbial guilds linked to MFC performance under specific conditions have been identified, comprehensive knowledge of the convergent community structure and pathways of adaptation is lacking. Here, we developed a microbe-microbe interaction genome-scale metabolic model (mmGEM) based on metabolic cross-feeding to study the adaptation of microbial communities in MFCs treating sulfide-containing wastewater from a canned-pineapple factory. The metabolic model encompassed three major microbial guilds: sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), methanogens (MET), and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (SOB). Our findings revealed a shift from an SOB-dominant to MET-dominant community as organic loading rates (OLRs) increased, along with a decline in MFC performance. The mmGEM accurately predicted microbial relative abundance at low OLRs (L-OLRs) and adaptation to high OLRs (H-OLRs). The simulations revealed constraints on SOB growth under H-OLRs due to reduced sulfate-sulfide (S) cycling and acetate cross-feeding with SRB. More cross-fed metabolites from SRB were diverted to MET, facilitating their competitive dominance. Assessing cross-feeding dynamics under varying OLRs enabled the execution of practical scenario-based simulations to explore the potential impact of elevated acidity levels on SOB growth and MFC performance. This work highlights the role of metabolic cross-feeding in shaping microbial community structure in response to high OLRs. The insights gained will inform the development of effective strategies for implementing MFC technology in real-world industrial environments.

Bacteriophages (phages) are viruses that infect bacteria and can be classified into two different lifecycles. Virulent phages (or lytic phages) have a lytic cycle that can lyse the bacteria host after their infection. Temperate phages (or lysogenic phages) can integrate their phage genomes into bacterial chromosomes and replicate with bacterial hosts via the lysogenic cycle. Identifying phage lifecycles is a crucial step in developing suitable applications for phages. Compared to the complicated traditional biological experiments, several tools have been designed for predicting phage lifecycle using different algorithms, such as random forest (RF), linear support-vector classifier (SVC), and convolutional neural network (CNN). In this study, we developed a natural language processing (NLP)-based tool—DeepPL—for predicting phage lifecycles via nucleotide sequences. The test results showed that our DeepPL had an accuracy of 94.65% with a sensitivity of 92.24% and a specificity of 95.91%. Moreover, DeepPL had 100% accuracy in lifecycle prediction on the phages we isolated and biologically verified previously in the lab. Additionally, a mock phage community metagenomic dataset was used to test the potential usage of DeepPL in viral metagenomic research. DeepPL displayed a 100% accuracy for individual phage complete genomes and high accuracies ranging from 71.14% to 100% on phage contigs produced by various next-generation sequencing technologies. Overall, our study indicates that DeepPL has a reliable performance on phage lifecycle prediction using the most fundamental nucleotide sequences and can be applied to future phage and metagenomic research.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex disease influenced by well-established environmental exposures (most notably, cigarette smoking) and incompletely defined genetic factors. The chromosome 4q region harbors multiple genetic risk loci for COPD, including signals near <i>HHIP</i>, <i>FAM13A</i>, <i>GSTCD</i>, <i>TET2</i>, and <i>BTC</i>. Leveraging RNA-Seq data from lung tissue in COPD cases and controls, we estimated the co-expression network for genes in the 4q region bounded by <i>HHIP</i> and <i>BTC</i> (~70MB), through partial correlations informed by protein-protein interactions. We identified several co-expressed gene pairs based on partial correlations, including <i>NPNT-HHIP</i>, <i>BTC</i>-<i>NPNT</i> and <i>FAM13A</i>-<i>TET2</i>, which were replicated in independent lung tissue cohorts. Upon clustering the co-expression network, we observed that four genes previously associated to COPD: <i>BTC</i>, <i>HHIP</i>, <i>NPNT</i> and <i>PPM1K</i> appeared in the same network community. Finally, we discovered a sub-network of genes differentially co-expressed between COPD vs controls (including <i>FAM13A</i>, <i>PPA2</i>, <i>PPM1K</i> and <i>TET2)</i>. Many of these genes were previously implicated in cell-based knock-out experiments, including the knocking out of <i>SPP1</i> which belongs to the same genomic region and could be a potential local key regulatory gene. These analyses identify chromosome 4q as a region enriched for COPD genetic susceptibility and differential co-expression.

Neurocristopathies such as CHARGE syndrome result from aberrant neural crest development. A large proportion of CHARGE cases are attributed to pathogenic variants in the gene encoding CHD7, chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7, which remodels chromatin. While the role for CHD7 in neural crest development is well documented, how this factor is specifically up-regulated in neural crest cells is not understood. Here, we use epigenomic profiling of chick and human neural crest to identify a cohort of enhancers regulating <i>Chd7</i> expression in neural crest cells and other tissues. We functionally validate upstream transcription factor binding at candidate enhancers, revealing novel epistatic relationships between neural crest master regulators and Chd7, showing tissue-specific regulation of a globally acting chromatin remodeller. Furthermore, we find conserved enhancer features in human embryonic epigenomic data and validate the activity of the human equivalent <i>CHD7</i> enhancers in the chick embryo. Our findings embed <i>Chd7</i> in the neural crest gene regulatory network and offer potentially clinically relevant elements for interpreting CHARGE syndrome cases without causative allocation.

                Introduction Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease affecting quality of life and causing pruritus. The factors influencing itch and its impact on the quality of life in Thai psoriasis patients are unknown. We aimed to identify these factors and their effect on quality of life. Methods In this questionnaire-based cross-sectional study, we included patients with psoriasis who received treatment at Chulabhorn Hospital in Thailand from January 2019 to July 2021. Interviewer is the non-dermatologist practician. The patient’s information was collected, including demographic data, Itch Numeric Rating Scale (Itch NRS) score, factors affecting itch, and score on the Thai version of the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). We performed descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis. Results Of 100 participants, most (99%) experienced itching, with a moderate degree of pruritus (mean Itch NRS score 6.5 ± 2.6) and a moderate effect on quality of life (mean DLQI score 9.4 ± 6.2). Factors associated with itch aggravation were dry skin (p-value = 0.003) and heat and humidity (p-value = 0.042). The results of binary logistic regression revealed that factors associated with moderate-to-extremely large DLQI scores were itch intensity (no-to-mild vs. moderate-to-severe itch: odds ratio [OR] = 13.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.72–65.32, p < 0.001; and adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 31.17; 95% CI = 4.55–213.36; p < 0.001. Conclusions Our findings revealed that the quality of life among patients with psoriasis is their greatest concern. Eliminating the itch intensity that affects their quality of life is crucial but remains challenging in Thailand.

                Background Despite the availability of a vaccine to combat COVID-19 disease, vaccine hesitancy is still a major concern, notably in countries with developing healthcare systems such as Pakistan. Hence, this study considered the rationale for vaccine hesitancy in Pakistani university students and support staff, and the impact of gender, age, and education on vaccination hesitancy. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted with randomly selected university students and supportive staff. An anonymous questionnaire collected data covering socio-demographic characteristics, vaccination status, current beliefs, and past vaccination history. Responses were assessed using descriptive analysis (p-value estimation and correlation/regression) and machine learning models applied to classify individuals based on their acceptance or vaccine hesitancy behavior and then used to predict the important variables associated with vaccine hesitancy. Results The survey of 847 participants revealed that 43% were vaccinated and 57% were vaccine hesitant; of which 37%, 38%, and 25% had safety and efficacy concerns, were afraid of side effects, or exhibited other complacency behavior regarding vaccination, respectively. Non-university educated people were significantly more hesitant than university-educated people (p = 0.033). Vaccine refusal was significantly higher in students than in supportive staff (p = 0.01). Correlation analysis revealed a strong association between key independent variables (the fear of side effects, mistrusted information, and low perceived disease risk without vaccination) and vaccine acceptance (dependent variable), as revealed by linear regression and a Structure Model Equation. Machine learning classified vaccine-hesitant and vaccine-acceptant individuals with commutative accuracy of 96% and 97%, respectively, using random forest and logistic regression. Logistic regression identified five predictors for vaccine hesitancy: low perceived disease risk without vaccination, mistrusted information, the fear of side effects, occupation, and education. Conclusion Education campaigns that cover the safety, efficacy, and importance of vaccination are needed to increase vaccination take-up to protect from COVID-19 disease.

     alt="A Neuropeptide Signaling Network That Regulates Developmental Timing and Systemic Growth in Drosophila"/>
<p>Anatomical as well as genetic analyses were performed to elucidate the role of neurons that produce neuropeptides called Hugin peptides in the larval central nervous system of the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Results suggest that Hugin peptides regulate developmental timing and body size via neurons that produce prothoracicotropic hormone.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Animals sense chemical cues such as nutritious and noxious stimuli through the chemosensory system and adapt their behavior, physiology, and developmental schedule to the environment. In the <i>Drosophila</i> central nervous system, chemosensory interneurons that produce neuropeptides called Hugin (Hug) peptides receive signals from gustatory receptor neurons and regulate feeding behavior. Because Hug neurons project their axons to the higher brain region within the protocerebrum where dendrites of multiple neurons producing developmentally important neuropeptides are extended, it has been postulated that Hug neurons regulate development through the neuroendocrine system. In this study, we show that Hug neurons interact with a subset of protocerebrum neurons that produce prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) and regulate the onset of metamorphosis and systemic growth. Loss of the <i>hug</i> gene and silencing of Hug neurons caused a delay in larval-to-prepupal transition and an increase in final body size. Furthermore, deletion of Hug receptor-encoding genes also caused developmental delay and body size increase, and the phenotype was restored by expressing Hug receptors in PTTH-producing neurons. These results indicate that Hug neurons regulate developmental timing and body size via PTTH-producing neurons. This study provides a basis for understanding how chemosensation is converted into neuroendocrine signaling to control insect growth and development.</p>

The absence of PD-L1 increases DC susceptibility to chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity, leading to reduced T cell priming and poorer patient prognosis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94558">A metabolic modeling-based framework for predicting trophic dependencies in native rhizobiomes of crop plants</a></h4>

              
                The exchange of metabolites (i.e., metabolic interactions) between bacteria in the rhizosphere determines various plant-associated functions. Systematically understanding the metabolic interactions in the rhizosphere, as well as in other types of microbial communities, would open the door to the optimization of specific predefined functions of interest, and therefore to the harnessing of the functionality of various types of microbiomes. However, mechanistic knowledge regarding the gathering and interpretation of these interactions is limited. Here, we present a framework utilizing genomics and constraint-based modeling approaches, aiming to interpret the hierarchical trophic interactions in the soil environment. 243 genome scale metabolic models of bacteria associated with a specific disease-suppressive vs disease-conducive apple rhizospheres were drafted based on genome-resolved metagenomes, comprising an in silico native microbial community. Iteratively simulating microbial community members’ growth in a metabolomics-based apple root-like environment produced novel data on potential trophic successions, used to form a network of communal trophic dependencies. Network-based analyses have characterized interactions associated with beneficial vs non-beneficial microbiome functioning, pinpointing specific compounds and microbial species as potential disease supporting and suppressing agents. This framework provides a means for capturing trophic interactions and formulating a range of testable hypotheses regarding the metabolic capabilities of microbial communities within their natural environment. Essentially, it can be applied to different environments and biological landscapes, elucidating the conditions for the targeted manipulation of various microbiomes, and the execution of countless predefined functions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87455">Extreme positive epistasis for fitness in monosomic yeast strains</a></h4>

              
                The loss of a single chromosome in a diploid organism halves the dosage of many genes and is usually accompanied by a substantial decrease in fitness. We asked whether this decrease simply reflects the joint damage caused by individual gene dosage deficiencies. We measured the fitness effects of single heterozygous gene deletions in yeast and combined them for each chromosome. This predicted a negative growth rate, that is, lethality, for multiple monosomies. However, monosomic strains remained alive and grew as if much (often most) of the damage caused by single mutations had disappeared, revealing an exceptionally large and positive epistatic component of fitness. We looked for functional explanations by analyzing the transcriptomes. There was no evidence of increased (compensatory) gene expression on the monosomic chromosomes. Nor were there signs of the cellular stress response that would be expected if monosomy led to protein destabilization and thus cytotoxicity. Instead, all monosomic strains showed extensive upregulation of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, but in an indiscriminate manner that did not correspond to their altered dosage. This response did not restore the stoichiometry required for efficient biosynthesis, which probably became growth limiting, making all other mutation-induced metabolic defects much less important. In general, the modular structure of the cell leads to an effective fragmentation of the total mutational load. Defects outside the module(s) currently defining fitness lose at least some of their relevance, producing the epiphenomenon of positive interactions between individually negative effects.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96575">Expression of most retrotransposons in human blood correlates with biological aging</a></h4>

              
                Retrotransposons (RTEs) have been postulated to reactivate with age and contribute to aging through activated innate immune response and inflammation. Here, we analyzed the relationship between RTE expression and aging using published transcriptomic and methylomic datasets of human blood. Despite no observed correlation between RTE activity and chronological age, the expression of most RTE classes and families except short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) correlated with biological age-associated gene signature scores. Strikingly, we found that the expression of SINEs was linked to upregulated DNA repair pathways in multiple cohorts. We also observed DNA hypomethylation with aging and the significant increase in RTE expression level in hypomethylated RTEs except for SINEs. Additionally, our single-cell transcriptomic analysis suggested a role for plasma cells in aging mediated by RTEs. Altogether, our multi-omics analysis of large human cohorts highlights the role of RTEs in biological aging and suggests possible mechanisms and cell populations for future investigations.

	<p>Background: With the rapid expansion of the generative AI market, conducting in-depth research on cognitive conflicts in human&amp;amp;ndash;computer interaction is crucial for optimizing user experience and improving the quality of interactions with AI systems. However, existing studies insufficiently explore the role of user cognitive conflicts and the explanation of stance attribution in the design of human&amp;amp;ndash;computer interactions. Methods: This research, grounded in mental models theory and employing an improved version of the oddball paradigm, utilizes Event-Related Spectral Perturbations (ERSP) and functional connectivity analysis to reveal how task types and stance attribution explanations in generative AI influence users&amp;amp;rsquo; unconscious cognitive processing mechanisms during service failures. Results: The results indicate that under design stance explanations, the ERSP and Phase Locking Value (PLV) in the theta frequency band were significantly lower for emotional task failures than mechanical task failures. In the case of emotional task failures, the ERSP and PLV in the theta frequency band induced by intentional stance explanations were significantly higher than those induced by design stance explanations. Conclusions: This study found that stance attribution explanations profoundly affect users&amp;amp;rsquo; mental models of AI, which determine their responses to service failure.</p>

	<p>Background: The literature lacks a combined analysis of neurosurgical microvascular anastomosis training models. We performed a systematic literature search to provide an overview of the existing models and proposed a classification system based on the level of simulation and reproducibility of the microvascular anastomosis. Methods: The systematic literature search followed the PRISMA guidelines. We consulted MEDLINE, Web of Knowledge, and EMBASE independently for papers about bypass training models. Every training model was analyzed according to six tasks supposed to esteem their fidelity to the real operative setting by using a scoring system from zero to two. Finally, authors classified the models into five classes, from A to E, by summing the individual scores. Results: This study included 109 papers for analysis. Training models were grouped into synthetic tubes, ex vivo models (animal vessels, fresh human cadavers, human placentas) and in vivo simulators (live animals&amp;amp;mdash;rats, rabbits, pigs). By applying the proposed classification system, live animals and placentas obtained the highest scores, falling into class A (excellent simulators). Human cadavers and animal vessels (ex vivo) were categorized in class B (good simulators), followed by synthetic tubes (class C, reasonable simulators). Conclusions: The proposed classification system helps the neurosurgeon to analyze the available training models for microvascular anastomosis critically, and to choose the most appropriate one according to the skills they need to improve</p>

	<p>Background: Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative ocular disease that is accompanied by cerebral damage extending beyond the visual system. Recent studies based on diffusion tensor tractography have suggested an association between glaucoma and brain structural connectivity but have not clarified causality. Methods: To explore the causal associations between glaucoma and brain structural connectivity, a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) study was conducted involving glaucoma and 206 diffusion tensor tractography traits. Highly associated genetic variations were applied as instrumental variables and statistical data were sourced from the database of FinnGen and UK Biobank. The inverse-variance weighted method was applied to assess causal relationships. Additional sensitivity analyses were also performed. Results: Glaucoma was potentially causally associated with alterations in three brain structural connectivities (from the SN to the thalamus, from the DAN to the putamen, and within the LN network) in the forward MR analysis, whereas the inverse MR results identified thirteen brain structural connectivity traits with a potential causal relationship to the risk of glaucoma. Both forward and reverse MR analyses satisfied the sensitivity test with no significant horizontal pleiotropy or heterogeneity. Conclusions: This study offered suggestive evidence for the potential causality between the risk of glaucoma and brain structural connectivity. Our findings also provided novel insights into the neurodegenerative mechanism of glaucoma.</p>

	<p>Background: The evaluation of evidence, which frequently takes the form of scientific evidence, necessitates the input of experts in relevant fields. The results are presented as expert opinions or expert evaluations, which are generally accepted as a reliable representation of the facts. A further issue that remains unresolved though is the process of evaluating the expertise and knowledge of an expert in the first instance. In general, earned certificates, grades and other objective criteria are typically regarded as representative documentation to substantiate an expert status. However, there is a possibility that these may not always be sufficiently representative. Objectives: The goal of the present study was to provide evidence that the neural processing of law-relevant and law-irrelevant terms varies significantly between participants who have received training in the field of law (experts) and those who have not (novices). Methods: To this end, changes in brain activity were recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) during visual presentations of terms belonging to five different categories (fake right, democracy, filler word, basic right and rule of law). Event-related potentials (ERPs) were subsequently averaged for each category and subjected to statistical analysis. Results: The results clearly demonstrate that participants trained in law processed fake rights and filler words in a similar manner. Furthermore, both of these conditions elicited different levels of brain activity compared to all law-relevant terms. This was not the case in participants who had not received legal training. The brains of untrained participants processed all five term categories in a strikingly similar manner. In light of prior knowledge regarding language processing, the primary focus was on two distinct electrode locations: one in the left posterior region, and the other in the left frontal region. In both locations, the most prominent differences in brain activity elicited by the aforementioned term categories in law-trained participants occurred approximately 450 milliseconds after stimulus onset. The results were further corroborated by a repeated-measures ANOVA and subsequent t-tests, which also demonstrated the absence of this effect in law-untrained participants. Conclusions: The findings of this study provide empirical evidence that brain activity measurements, in particular ERPs, can be used to distinguish between experts trained in a specific field of expertise and novices in that field. Such findings have the potential to facilitate objective assessments of expertise, enabling comparisons between experts and novices that extend beyond traditional criteria such as qualifications and experience. Instead, individuals can be evaluated based on their cognitive processes, as observed through brain activity.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Speaker race and the listener&amp;amp;rsquo;s language experience (i.e., monolinguals vs. bilinguals) have both been shown to influence accent intelligibility independently. Speaker race specifically is thought to be informed by learned experiences (exemplar model) or individual biases and attitudes (bias-based model). The current study investigates speaker race and the listener&amp;amp;rsquo;s language experience simultaneously as well as listeners&amp;amp;rsquo; attitudes toward non-native speakers and their ability to identify the accent. Methods: Overall, 140 White English monolinguals and 140 English/Norwegian bilinguals transcribed 60 Mandarin-accented English sentences presented in noise in the context of a White or East Asian face. Following sentence transcription, participants were asked to rate the strength of the accent heard and completed a short questionnaire that assessed their accent identification ability and their language usage, proficiency, familiarity, and attitudes. Results: Results show that a listeners&amp;amp;rsquo; ability to identify an accent and their attitudes toward non-native speakers had a significant impact on accent intelligibility and accentedness ratings. Speaker race by itself did not play a role in accent intelligibility and accentedness ratings; however, we found evidence that speaker race interacted with participants&amp;amp;rsquo; accent identification scores and attitudes toward non-native speakers, and these interactions differed as a function of language experience. Conclusions: Our results suggest that bilinguals&amp;amp;rsquo; sociolinguistic processing may be more in line with a bias-based model than monolinguals.</p>

                <p>Two-photon calcium imaging allows for the activity readout of large populations of neurons at single cell resolution in living organisms, yielding new insights into how the brain processes information. Holographic optogenetics allows us to trigger activity of this population directly, raising the possibility of injecting information into a living brain. Optogenetic triggering of activity that mimics "natural" information, however, requires identification of stimulation targets based on real-time analysis of the functional network. We have developed NeuroART (Neuronal Analysis in Real Time), software that provides real-time readout of neuronal activity integrated with downstream analysis of correlations and synchrony and of sensory metadata. On the example of auditory stimuli, we demonstrate real-time inference of the contribution of each neuron in the field of view to sensory information processing. To avoid the limitations of microscope hardware and enable collaboration of multiple research groups, NeuroART taps into microscope data streams without the need for modification of microscope control software and is compatible with a wide range of microscope platforms. NeuroART also integrates the capability to drive a spatial light modulator (SLM) for holographic photostimulation of optimal stimulation targets, enabling real-time modification of functional networks. Neurons used for photostimulation experiments were extracted from Sprague Dawley rat embryos of both sexes.</p>

                <p>Advances in single-cell technologies have led to the discovery and characterization of new brain cell types, which in turn lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we present a detailed analysis of single-nucleus (sn)RNA-seq data for three stages of AD from middle temporal gyrus and compare it with snRNA-seq data from the prefrontal cortices from individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD). We observed a significant decrease in both inhibitory and excitatory neurons, in general agreement with previous reports. We observed several cell-type&ndash;specific gene expressions and pathway dysregulations that delineate AD stages. Endothelial and vascular leptomeningeal cells showed the greatest degree of gene expression changes. Cell-type&ndash;specific evidence of neurodegeneration was seen in multiple neuronal cell types particularly in somatostatin and Layer 5 extratelencephalic neurons, among others. Evidence of inflammatory responses was seen in non-neuronal cells, particularly in intermediate and advanced AD. We observed common perturbations in AD and AUD, particularly in pathways, like transcription, translation, apoptosis, autophagy, calcium signaling, neuroinflammation, and phosphorylation, that imply shared transcriptional pathogenic mechanisms and support the role of excessive alcohol intake in AD progression. Major AUD gene markers form and perturb a network of genes significantly associated with intermediate and advanced AD. Master regulator analysis from AUD gene markers revealed significant correlation with advanced AD of transcription factors that have implications in intellectual disability, neuroinflammation, and other neurodegenerative conditions, further suggesting a shared nexus of transcriptional changes between AD and AUD.</p>

                <p>Reelin, a secreted glycoprotein, plays a crucial role in guiding neocortical neuronal migration, dendritic outgrowth and arborization, and synaptic plasticity in the adult brain. Reelin primarily operates through the canonical lipoprotein receptors apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (Apoer2) and very low-density lipoprotein receptor (Vldlr). Reelin also engages with noncanonical receptors and unidentified coreceptors; however, the effects of which are less understood. Using high-throughput tandem mass tag (TMT) liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based proteomics and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), we identified both shared and unique intracellular pathways activated by Reelin through its canonical and noncanonical signaling in primary murine neurons of either sex during dendritic growth and arborization. We observed pathway cross talk related to regulation of cytoskeleton, neuron projection development, protein transport, and actin filament-based process. We also found enriched gene sets exclusively by the noncanonical Reelin pathway including protein translation, mRNA metabolic process, and ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis suggesting Reelin fine-tunes neuronal structure through distinct signaling pathways. A key discovery is the identification of aldolase A, a glycolytic enzyme and actin-binding protein, as a novel effector of Reelin signaling. Reelin induced de novo translation and mobilization of aldolase A from the actin cytoskeleton. We demonstrated that aldolase A is necessary for Reelin-mediated dendrite growth and arborization in primary murine neurons and mouse brain cortical neurons. Interestingly, the function of aldolase A in dendrite development is independent of its known role in glycolysis. Altogether, our findings provide new insights into the Reelin-dependent signaling pathways and effector proteins that are crucial for dendritic development.</p>

                <p>Cochlear hair cells (HCs) sense sound waves and allow us to hear. Loss of HCs will cause irreversible sensorineural hearing loss. It is well known that DNA damage repair plays a critical role in protecting cells in many organs. However, how HCs respond to DNA damage and how defective DNA damage repair contributes to hearing loss remain elusive. In this study, we showed that cisplatin induced DNA damage in outer hair cells (OHCs) and promoted OHC loss, leading to hearing loss in mice of either sex. Cisplatin induced the expression of Brca1, a DNA damage repair factor, in OHCs. Deficiency of Brca1 induced OHC and hearing loss, and further promoted cisplatin-induced DNA damage in OHCs, accelerating OHC loss. This study provides the first in vivo evidence demonstrating that cisplatin mainly induces DNA damage in OHCs and that BRCA1 promotes repair of DNA damage in OHCs and prevents hearing loss. Our findings not only demonstrate that DNA damage&ndash;inducing agent generates DNA damage in postmitotic HCs but also suggest that DNA repair factors, like BRCA1, protect postmitotic HCs from DNA damage&ndash;induced cell death and hearing loss.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/42/e0171242024?rss=1">Multiple Intrinsic Timescales Govern Distinct Brain States in Human Sleep</a></h4>

              
                <p>Human sleep exhibits multiple, recurrent temporal regularities, ranging from circadian rhythms to sleep stage cycles and neuronal oscillations during nonrapid eye movement sleep. Moreover, recent evidence revealed a functional role of aperiodic activity, which reliably discriminates different sleep stages. Aperiodic activity is commonly defined as the spectral slope <I></I> of the 1/frequency (1/f<sup></sup>) decay function of the electrophysiological power spectrum. However, several lines of inquiry now indicate that the aperiodic component of the power spectrum might be better characterized by a superposition of several decay processes with associated timescales. Here, we determined multiple timescales, which jointly shape aperiodic activity using human intracranial electroencephalography. Across three independent studies (47 participants, 23 female), our results reveal that aperiodic activity reliably dissociated sleep stage-dependent dynamics in a regionally specific manner. A principled approach to parametrize aperiodic activity delineated several, spatially and state-specific timescales. Lastly, we employed pharmacological modulation by means of propofol anesthesia to disentangle state-invariant timescales that may reflect physical properties of the underlying neural population from state-specific timescales that likely constitute functional interactions. Collectively, these results establish the presence of multiple intrinsic timescales that define the electrophysiological power spectrum during distinct brain states.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/42/e0243242024?rss=1">Mu-Opioid Receptor (MOR) Dependence of Pain in Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy</a></h4>

              
                <p>We recently demonstrated that transient attenuation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, can both prevent and reverse pain associated with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), a severe side effect of cancer chemotherapy, for which treatment options are limited. Given the reduced efficacy of opioid analgesics to treat neuropathic, compared with inflammatory pain, the cross talk between nociceptor TLR4 and mu-opioid receptors (MORs), and that MOR and TLR4 agonists induce hyperalgesic priming (priming), which also occurs in CIPN, we determined, using male rats, whether (1) antisense knockdown of nociceptor MOR attenuates CIPN, (2) and attenuates the priming associated with CIPN, and (3) CIPN also produces opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH). We found that intrathecal MOR antisense prevents and reverses hyperalgesia induced by oxaliplatin and paclitaxel, two common clinical chemotherapy agents. Oxaliplatin-induced priming was also markedly attenuated by MOR antisense. Additionally, intradermal morphine, at a dose that does not affect nociceptive threshold in controls, exacerbates mechanical hyperalgesia (OIH) in rats with CIPN, suggesting the presence of OIH. This OIH associated with CIPN is inhibited by interventions that reverse Type II priming [the combination of an inhibitor of Src and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)], an MOR antagonist, as well as a TLR4 antagonist. Our findings support a role of nociceptor MOR in oxaliplatin-induced pain and priming. We propose that priming and OIH are central to the symptom burden in CIPN, contributing to its chronicity and the limited efficacy of opioid analgesics to treat neuropathic pain.</p>
