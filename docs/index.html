              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Retinal vein occlusion as the first clinical manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus in a male patient [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by widespread clinical manifestations and immunological disorders. A myriad of ocular manifestations can be seen in patients with SLE. The most vision-threatening complication is vaso-occlusive retinopathy including retinal vein occlusion (RVO). RVO associated with SLE is well described in the literature and its association with antiphospholipid antibodies is recognized. However, RVO as the initial manifestation of SLE is scarcely reported. Herein, we report the first case of recurrent RVO as the primary manifestation of SLE in a 40-year-old male patient. He had two consecutive episodes of decreased vision. Ophthalmologic examination disclosed a branch retinal vein occlusion the first time and a central retinal vein occlusion the second time. The diagnosis of SLE was established based on clinical and immunological criteria. He was prescribed antiplatelet therapy, hydroxychloroquine at 5.5 mg/kg/day, and intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibodies regimen. He slowly improved under treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Philympics 2021: Prophage Predictions Perplex Programs [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Most bacterial genomes contain integrated bacteriophages—prophages—in various states of decay. Many are active and able to excise from the genome and replicate, while others are cryptic prophages, remnants of their former selves. Over the last two decades, many computational tools have been developed to identify the prophage components of bacterial genomes, and it is a particularly active area for the application of machine learning approaches. However, progress is hindered and comparisons thwarted because there are no manually curated bacterial genomes that can be used to test new prophage prediction algorithms. Methods We present a library of gold-standard bacterial genome annotations that include manually curated prophage annotations, and a computational framework to compare the predictions from different algorithms. We use this suite to compare all extant stand-alone prophage prediction algorithms to identify their strengths and weaknesses. We provide a FAIR dataset for prophage identification, and demonstrate the accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score from the analysis of seven different algorithms for the prediction of prophages. Results We identified different strengths and weaknesses between the prophage prediction tools. Several tools exhibit exceptional f1 scores, while others have better recall at the expense of more false positives. The tools vary greatly in runtime performance with few exhibiting all desirable qualities for large-scale analyses. Conclusions Our library of gold-standard prophage annotations and benchmarking framework provide a valuable resource for exploring strengths and weaknesses of current and future prophage annotation tools. We discuss caveats and concerns in this analysis, how those concerns may be mitigated, and avenues for future improvements. This framework will help developers identify opportunities for improvement and test updates. It will also help users in determining the tools that are best suited for their analysis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Clinical characteristics and radiological domains among patients with recurrent strokes-a descriptive cross-sectional study from a tertiary care center in central Nepal [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Stroke is a significant global health hazard that ripples continuum multi-spectral effects to the patients as well their caretakers.   Methods: We studied 28 consecutive cohorts of patients with recurrent strokes managed in our centre within the last two years.  Results: The most common recurrence stroke pattern was of that of hemorrhagic to hemorrhagic subtype observed in 50% of the patients. The most common anatomical region of involvement was cortical – cortical seen in 39.28% of our cohorts. The surgical intervention was required in 17.85% whereas 42.85% of them were managed conservatively. Paradoxically, 39.28% of patients left against medical advice. The receiver operating curve (ROC) predicting mode of management was highest (area under the curve (AUC) =0.635) for compliance to therapy followed by stroke territory (AUC=0.578), age (AUC=0.457) and motor grading (AUC=0.374). The receiver operating curve (ROC) for influencing decision to leave against medical advice was highest (area under the curve (AUC) =0.861) for motor score followed by sex (AUC=0.701) and age (AUC=0.564). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) study pertaining to the mode of management was significantly connoted by the motor score and the stroke territory only. The ANOVA study pertaining to the decision to leave against medical advice was significantly governed by the motor score, stroke territory, and sex respectively. The multivariate analysis for variables governing mode of management was significant for motor score and the stroke territory only. The multivariate analysis for variables governing leave against medical advice was significant for sex, motor score and the stroke territory.  Conclusions: This study aims to appraise early dichotomization of high-risk patients for recurrent strokes to reduce the continuum of neurological events as well as to mitigate the financial aspects governing stroke care.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Unsupervised machine learning reveals key immune cell subsets in COVID-19, rhinovirus infection, and cancer therapy</a></h4>

              
                For an emerging disease like COVID-19, systems immunology tools may quickly identify and quantitatively characterize cells associated with disease progression or clinical response. With repeated sampling, immune monitoring creates a real-time portrait of the cells reacting to a novel virus before disease specific knowledge and tools are established. However, single cell analysis tools can struggle to reveal rare cells that are under 0.1% of the population. Here, the machine learning workflow Tracking Responders Expanding (T-REX) was created to identify changes in both very rare and common cells in diverse human immune monitoring settings. T-REX identified cells that were highly similar in phenotype and localized to hotspots of significant change during rhinovirus and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Specialized reagents used to detect the rhinovirus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> cells, MHCII tetramers, were not used during unsupervised analysis and instead 'left out' to serve as a test of whether T-REX identified biologically significant cells. In the rhinovirus challenge study, T-REX identified virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells based on these cells being a distinct phenotype that expanded by ≥95% following infection. T-REX successfully identified hotspots containing virus-specific T cells using pairs of samples comparing Day 7 of infection to samples taken either prior to infection (Day 0) or after clearing the infection (Day 28). Mapping pairwise comparisons in samples according to both the direction and degree of change provided a framework to compare systems level immune changes during infectious disease or therapy response. This revealed that the magnitude and direction of systemic immune change in some COVID-19 patients was comparable to that of blast crisis acute myeloid leukemia patients undergoing induction chemotherapy and characterized the identity of the immune cells that changed the most. Other COVID-19 patients instead matched an immune trajectory like that of individuals with rhinovirus infection or melanoma patients receiving checkpoint inhibitor therapy. T-REX analysis of paired blood samples provides an approach to rapidly identify and characterize mechanistically significant cells and to place emerging diseases into a systems immunology context.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Met and Cxcr4 cooperate to protect skeletal muscle stem cells against inflammation-induced damage during regeneration</a></h4>

              
                Acute skeletal muscle injury is followed by an inflammatory response, removal of damaged tissue, and the generation of new muscle fibers by resident muscle stem cells, a process well characterized in murine injury models. Inflammatory cells are needed to remove the debris at the site of injury and provide signals that are beneficial for repair. However, they also release chemokines, reactive oxygen species as well as enzymes for clearance of damaged cells and fibers, which muscle stem cells have to withstand in order to regenerate the muscle. We show here that MET and CXCR4 cooperate to protect muscle stem cells against the adverse environment encountered during muscle repair. This powerful cyto-protective role was revealed by the genetic ablation of <i>Met</i> and <i>Cxcr4</i> in muscle stem cells of mice, which resulted in severe apoptosis during early stages of regeneration. TNFα neutralizing antibodies rescued the apoptosis, indicating that TNFα provides crucial cell-death signals during muscle repair that are counteracted by MET and CXCR4. We conclude that muscle stem cells require MET and CXCR4 to protect them against the harsh inflammatory environment encountered in an acute muscle injury.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Characterization of cephalic and non-cephalic sensory cell types provides insight into joint photo- and mechanoreceptor evolution</a></h4>

              
                Rhabdomeric opsins (r-opsins) are light-sensors in cephalic eye photoreceptors, but also function in additional sensory organs. This has prompted questions on the evolutionary relationship of these cell types, and if ancient r-opsins were non-photosensory. A molecular profiling approach in the marine bristleworm <i>Platynereis dumerilii</i> revealed shared and distinct features of cephalic and non-cephalic of <i>r-opsin1</i>-expressing cells. Non-cephalic cells possess a full set of phototransduction components, but also a mechanosensory signature. Prompted by the latter, we investigated <i>Platynereis </i>putative mechanotransducer, and found <i>nompc </i>and<i> pkd2.1</i> co-expressed with <i>r-opsin1 </i>in TRE cells by HCR RNA-FISH. To further assess the role of r-Opsin1 in these cells, we studied its signaling properties and unraveled that r-Opsin1 is a Gαq-coupled blue-light receptor. Profiling of cells from <i>r-opsin1</i> mutants versus wild-types, and a comparison under different light conditions reveals that in the non-cephalic cells, light - mediated by r-Opsin1 - adjusts the expression level of a calcium transporter relevant for auditory mechanosensation in vertebrates. We establish a deep learning-based quantitative behavioral analysis for animal trunk movements, and identify a light- and r-Opsin-1-dependent fine-tuning of the worm's undulatory movements in headless trunks, which are known to require mechanosensory feedback. Our results provide new data on peripheral cell types of likely light-sensory/mechanosensory nature. These results point towards a concept in which such a multisensory cell type evolved to allow for fine-tuning of mechanosensation by light. This implies that light-independent mechanosensory roles of r-opsins may have evolved secondarily.

                Synthetic strategies for optically controlling gene expression may enable the precise spatiotemporal control of genes in any combination of cells that cannot be targeted with specific promoters. We develop an improved genetic code expansion system in <i>C. elegans</i> and use it to create a photo-activatable Cre recombinase. We laser-activate Cre in single neurons within a bilaterally symmetric pair to selectively switch on expression of a loxP controlled optogenetic channel in the targeted neuron. We use the system to dissect, in freely moving animals, the individual contributions of the mechanosensory neurons PLML/PLMR to the <i>C. elegans</i> touch response circuit, revealing distinct and synergistic roles for these neurons. We thus demonstrate how genetic code expansion and optical targeting can be combined to break the symmetry of neuron pairs and dissect behavioural outputs of individual neurons that cannot be genetically targeted.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ancient viral genomes reveal introduction of human pathogenic viruses into Mexico during the transatlantic slave trade</a></h4>

              
                After the European colonization of the Americas there was a dramatic population collapse of the Indigenous inhabitants caused in part by the introduction of new pathogens. Although there is much speculation on the etiology of the Colonial epidemics, direct evidence for the presence of specific viruses during the Colonial era is lacking. To uncover the diversity of viral pathogens during this period, we designed an enrichment assay targeting ancient DNA (aDNA) from viruses of clinical importance and applied it to DNA extracts from individuals found in a Colonial hospital and a Colonial chapel (16<sup>th</sup> c. - 18<sup>th</sup> c.) where records suggest victims of epidemics were buried during important outbreaks in Mexico City. This allowed us to reconstruct three ancient human parvovirus B19 genomes, and one ancient human hepatitis B virus genome from distinct individuals. The viral genomes are similar to African strains, consistent with the inferred morphological and genetic African ancestry of the hosts as well as with the isotopic analysis of the human remains, suggesting an origin on the African continent. This study provides direct molecular evidence of ancient viruses being transported to the Americas during the transatlantic slave trade and their subsequent introduction to New Spain. Altogether, our observations enrich the discussion about the etiology of infectious diseases during the Colonial period in Mexico.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evolution of diversity in metabolic strategies</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the origin and maintenance of biodiversity is a fundamental problem. Many theoretical approaches have been investigating ecological interactions, such as competition, as potential drivers of diversification. Classical consumer-resource models predict that the number of coexisting species should not exceed the number of distinct resources, a phenomenon known as the competitive exclusion principle. It has recently been argued that including physiological tradeoffs in consumer-resource models can lead to violations of this principle and to ecological coexistence of very high numbers of species. Here we show that these results crucially depend on the functional form of the tradeoff. We investigate the evolutionary dynamics of resource use constrained by tradeoffs and show that if the tradeoffs are non-linear, the system either does not diversify, or diversifies into a number of coexisting species that does not exceed the number of resources. In particular, very high diversity can only be observed for linear tradeoffs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Adipocyte NR1D1 dictates adipose tissue expansion during obesity</a></h4>

              
                The circadian clock component NR1D1 (REVERBα) is considered a dominant regulator of lipid metabolism, with global <i>Nr1d1</i> deletion driving dysregulation of white adipose tissue (WAT) lipogenesis and obesity. However, a similar phenotype is not observed under adipocyte-selective deletion (<i>Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup>:Adipoq<sup>Cre</sup></i>), and transcriptional pro1ling demonstrates that, under basal conditions, direct targets of NR1D1 regulation are limited, and include the circadian clock and collagen dynamics. Under high-fat diet (HFD) feeding, <i>Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup>:Adipoq<sup>Cre</sup></i> mice do manifest profound obesity, yet without the accompanying WAT in2ammation and 1brosis exhibited by controls. Integration of the WAT NR1D1 cistrome with differential gene expression reveals broad control of metabolic processes by NR1D1 which is unmasked in the obese state. Adipocyte NR1D1 does not drive an anticipatory daily rhythm in WAT lipogenesis, but rather modulates WAT activity in response to alterations in metabolic state. Importantly, NR1D1 action in adipocytes is critical to the development of obesity-related WAT pathology and insulin resistance.

                Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) has been linked to atypical brain development and a wide range of cognitive and behavioral impairments, including poor reading performance in childhood and adolescence. However, little is known about how structural and/or functional teratogenesis in the brain mediate reading impairment in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and whether neural correlates of reading and phonological processing differ between FASD subtypes with different clinical presentations in facial morphology. Methods: The current study utilized functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to characterize functional and structural mechanisms mediating reading deficits in 26 syndromal adolescents with PAE-related facial dysmorphology (i.e., fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or partial FAS (PFAS)) and 30 heavily exposed (HE) without this dysmorphology, in comparison with 19 typically developing controls. Importantly, the levels of PAE and reading ability were comparable between the FAS/PFAS and HE groups in the current study. Results: Compared to the nonsyndromal HE and control groups, the syndromal adolescents showed greater activation in the right precentral gyrus during an fMRI phonological processing task and rightward lateralization in an important reading-related tract (inferior longitudinal fasciculus, ILF), suggesting an atypical reliance on the right hemisphere during reading. By contrast, in the HE group, better reading skills were associated with increased neural activation in the left angular gyrus (LAG) and higher fractional anisotropy in the white matter organization of the left ILF. However, the brain function-behavior relation was weaker in the HE than among the controls, suggesting less efficient function of the typical reading neural network that may contribute to the observed reading impairments. Conclusions: Our findings provide the first evidence for the distinctive functional and structural mechanisms underlying atypical reading and phonological processing in PAE adolescents with and without FAS facial dysmorphology.

	<p>Performance validity tests (PVTs) are used for the detection of noncredible performance in neuropsychological assessments. The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy (i.e., discrimination capacity) of a novel PVT, the Multi-Level Pattern Memory Test (MPMT). It includes stages that allow profile analysis (i.e., detecting noncredible performance based on an analysis of participants’ performance across stages) and minimizes the likelihood that it would be perceived as a PVT by examinees. In addition, it utilizes nonverbal stimuli and is therefore more likely to be cross-culturally valid. In Experiment 1, participants that were instructed to simulate cognitive impairment performed less accurately than honest controls in the MPMT (n = 67). Importantly, the MPMT has shown an adequate discrimination capacity, though somewhat lower than an established PVT (i.e., Test of Memory Malingering—TOMM). Experiment 2 (n = 77) validated the findings of the first experiment while also indicating a dissociation between the simulators’ objective performance and their perceived cognitive load while performing the MPMT. The MPMT and the profile analysis based on its outcome measures show initial promise in detecting noncredible performance. It may, therefore, increase the range of available PVTs at the disposal of clinicians, though further validation in clinical settings is mandated. The fact that it is an open-source software will hopefully also encourage the development of research programs aimed at clarifying the cognitive processes involved in noncredible performance and the impact of PVT characteristics on clinical utility.</p>

	<p>Autism is associated with gastrointestinal dysfunction and gut microbiota dysbiosis, including an overall increase in Clostridium. Modulation of the gut microbiota is suggested to improve autistic symptoms. In this study, we explored the implementation of two different interventions that target the microbiota in a rodent model of autism and their effects on social behavior: the levels of different fecal Clostridium spp., and hippocampal transcript levels. Autism was induced in young Sprague Dawley male rats using oral gavage of propionic acid (PPA) for three days, while controls received saline. PPA-treated animals were divided to receive either saline, fecal transplant from healthy donor rats, or Bifidobacterium for 22 days, while controls continued to receive saline. We found that PPA attenuated social interaction in animals, which was rescued by the two interventions. PPA-treated animals had a significantly increased abundance of fecal C. perfringens with a concomitant decrease in Clostridium cluster IV, and exhibited high hippocampal Bdnf expression compared to controls. Fecal microbiota transplantation or Bifidobacterium treatment restored the balance of fecal Clostridium spp. and normalized the level of Bdnf expression. These findings highlight the involvement of the gut–brain axis in the etiology of autism and propose possible interventions in a preclinical model of autism.</p>

	<p>Parenting a child with a disability, such as neurodevelopmental disorders and genetic syndromes, implies a high level of stress. During the COVID-19 outbreak—as a period implying additional challenges—few studies have specifically investigated caregivers’ distress among neurodevelopmental disabilities. The objective of the study is to investigate whether during the COVID-19 pandemic, the level of parental stress differs between four disability groups including neurodevelopmental disorders (autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)) and genetic syndromes (Rett syndrome (RTT), Sotos syndrome (SS)) in comparison to families with typical development offspring (TD). In total, 220 Italian parents of children affected by neurodevelopmental disabilities (74 ASD, 51 ADHD, 34 SS, 21 RTT, 40 TD; age M 9.4 ± SD 4.2) underwent a standardized evaluation for stress related to parenting through the self-report questionnaire, Parental Stress Index-Short Form (PSI-SF). The main findings show greater levels of parental stress—mainly linked to child behavioral characteristics rather than parental sense of competence—in parents of children affected by a disability in comparison to children with typical development. This study highlights the need to support not only individuals with special needs but also their own caregivers: core figures in the management and outcome of children disorders.</p>

	<p>Operculo-insular epilepsy (OIE) is an under-recognized condition that can mimic temporal and extratemporal epilepsies. Previous studies have revealed structural connectivity changes in the epileptic network of focal epilepsy. However, most reports use the debated streamline-count to quantify ‘connectivity strength’ and rely on standard tracking algorithms. We propose a sophisticated cutting-edge method that is robust to crossing fibers, optimizes cortical coverage, and assigns an accurate microstructure-reflecting quantitative conectivity marker, namely the COMMIT (Convex Optimization Modeling for Microstructure Informed Tractography)-weight. Using our pipeline, we report the connectivity alterations in OIE. COMMIT-weighted matrices were created in all participants (nine patients with OIE, eight patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), and 22 healthy controls (HC)). In the OIE group, widespread increases in ‘connectivity strength’ were observed bilaterally. In OIE patients, ‘hyperconnections’ were observed between the insula and the pregenual cingulate gyrus (OIE group vs. HC group) and between insular subregions (OIE vs. TLE). Graph theoretic analyses revealed higher connectivity within insular subregions of OIE patients (OIE vs. TLE). We reveal, for the first time, the structural connectivity distribution in OIE. The observed pattern of connectivity in OIE likely reflects a diffuse epileptic network incorporating insular-connected regions and may represent a structural signature and diagnostic biomarker.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Repurposing RNA sequencing for discovery of RNA modifications in clinical cohorts</a></h4>

              
                <p>The study of RNA modifications in large clinical cohorts can reveal relationships between the epitranscriptome and human diseases, although this is especially challenging. We developed ModTect (<A HREF="https://github.com/ktan8/ModTect">https://github.com/ktan8/ModTect</A>), a statistical framework to identify RNA modifications de novo by standard RNA-sequencing with deletion and mis-incorporation signals. We show that ModTect can identify both known (<I>N</I><sup>1</sup>-methyladenosine) and previously unknown types of mRNA modifications (<I>N</I><sup>2</sup>,<I>N</I><sup>2</sup>-dimethylguanosine) at nucleotide-resolution. Applying ModTect to 11,371 patient samples and 934 cell lines across 33 cancer types, we show that the epitranscriptome was dysregulated in patients across multiple cancer types and was additionally associated with cancer progression and survival outcomes. Some types of RNA modification were also more disrupted than others in patients with cancer. Moreover, RNA modifications contribute to multiple types of RNA-DNA sequence differences, which unexpectedly escape detection by Sanger sequencing. ModTect can thus be used to discover associations between RNA modifications and clinical outcomes in patient cohorts.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">GRB2 enforces homology-directed repair initiation by MRE11</a></h4>

              
                <p>DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair is initiated by MRE11 nuclease for both homology-directed repair (HDR) and alternative end joining (Alt-EJ). Here, we found that GRB2, crucial to timely proliferative RAS/MAPK pathway activation, unexpectedly forms a biophysically validated GRB2-MRE11 (GM) complex for efficient HDR initiation. GRB2-SH2 domain targets the GM complex to phosphorylated H2AX at DSBs. GRB2 K109 ubiquitination by E3 ubiquitin ligase RBBP6 releases MRE11 promoting HDR. RBBP6 depletion results in prolonged GM complex and HDR defects. GRB2 knockout increased MRE11-XRCC1 complex and Alt-EJ. Reconstitution with separation-of-function GRB2 mutant caused HDR deficiency and synthetic lethality with PARP inhibitor. Cell and cancer genome analyses suggest biomarkers of low GRB2 for noncanonical HDR deficiency and high MRE11 and GRB2 expression for worse survival in HDR-proficient patients. These findings establish GRB2&rsquo;s role in binding, targeting, and releasing MRE11 to promote efficient HDR over Alt-EJ DSB repair, with implications for genome stability and cancer biology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">The epigenetic factor FVE orchestrates cytoplasmic SGS3-DRB4-DCL4 activities to promote transgene silencing in Arabidopsis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) is a regulatory mechanism to suppress undesired transcripts. Here, we identified <I>Flowering locus VE</I> (<I>FVE</I>), a well-known epigenetic component, as a new player in cytoplasmic PTGS. Loss-of-function <I>fve</I> mutations substantially reduced the accumulation of transgene-derived small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). FVE interacts with suppressor of gene silencing 3 (SGS3), a master component in PTGS. FVE promotes SGS3 homodimerization that is essential for its function. FVE can bind to single-stranded RNA and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) with moderate affinities, while its truncated form FVE-8 has a significantly increased binding affinity to dsRNA. These affinities affect the association and channeling of SGS3-RNA to downstream dsRNA binding protein 4 (DRB4)/Dicer-like protein 2/4 (DCL2/4) complexes. Hence, FVE, but not FVE-8, biochemically enhances the DRB4/DCL2/4 activity in vitro. We surmise that FVE promotes production of transgene-derived siRNAs through concertedly tuning SGS3-DRB4/DCL2/4 functions. Thus, this study revealed a noncanonical role of FVE in PTGS.</p>

                <p>Eukaryotic initiation factor 4A-III (eIF4A3), a core helicase component of the exon junction complex, is essential for splicing, mRNA trafficking, and nonsense-mediated decay processes emerging as targets in cancer therapy. Here, we unravel eIF4A3&rsquo;s tumor-promoting function by demonstrating its role in ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) and p53 (de)regulation. Mechanistically, eIF4A3 resides in nucleoli within the small subunit processome and regulates rRNA processing via R-loop clearance. <I>EIF4A3</I> depletion induces cell cycle arrest through impaired RiBi checkpoint&ndash;mediated p53 induction and reprogrammed translation of cell cycle regulators. Multilevel omics analysis following <I>eIF4A3</I> depletion pinpoints pathways of cell death regulation and translation of alternative mouse double minute homolog 2 (<I>MDM2</I>) transcript isoforms that control p53. EIF4A3 expression and subnuclear localization among clinical cancer specimens correlate with the RiBi status rendering eIF4A3 an exploitable vulnerability in high-RiBi tumors. We propose a concept of eIF4A3&rsquo;s unexpected role in RiBi, with implications for cancer pathogenesis and treatment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">The physics of cement cohesion</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cement is the most produced material in the world. A major player in greenhouse gas emissions, it is the main binding agent in concrete, providing a cohesive strength that rapidly increases during setting. Understanding how such cohesion emerges is a major obstacle to advances in cement science and technology. Here, we combine computational statistical mechanics and theory to demonstrate how cement cohesion arises from the organization of interlocked ions and water, progressively confined in nanoslits between charged surfaces of calcium-silicate-hydrates. Because of the water/ions interlocking, dielectric screening is drastically reduced and ionic correlations are proven notably stronger than previously thought, dictating the evolution of nanoscale interactions during cement hydration. By developing a quantitative analytical prediction of cement cohesion based on Coulombic forces, we reconcile a fundamental understanding of cement hydration with the fully atomistic description of the solid cement paste and open new paths for scientific design of construction materials.</p>

                <p>We investigated the influence of Bacillus Calmette-Gu&eacute;rin (BCG) vaccination on the unstimulated plasma levels of a wide panel of cytokines, chemokines, acute-phase proteins (APPs), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and growth factors in a group of healthy elderly individuals (age, 60 to 80 years) at baseline (before vaccination) and 1 month after vaccination as part of our clinical study to examine the effect of BCG on COVID-19. Our results demonstrated that BCG vaccination resulted in diminished plasma levels of types 1, 2, and 17 and other proinflammatory cytokines and type 1 interferons. BCG vaccination also resulted in decreased plasma levels of CC, CXC chemokines, APPs, MMPs, and growth factors. Plasma levels of the aforementioned parameters were significantly lower in vaccinated individuals when compared to unvaccinated control individuals. Thus, our study demonstrates the immunomodulatory properties of BCG vaccination and suggests its potential utility in nonspecific vaccination of COVID-19 by down-modulating pathogenic inflammatory responses.</p>

                <p>Cointegration of multistate single-transistor neurons and synapses was demonstrated for highly scalable neuromorphic hardware, using nanoscale complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication. The neurons and synapses were integrated on the same plane with the same process because they have the same structure of a metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor with different functions such as homotype. By virtue of 100% CMOS compatibility, it was also realized to cointegrate the neurons and synapses with additional CMOS circuits. Such cointegration can enhance packing density, reduce chip cost, and simplify fabrication procedures. The multistate single-transistor neuron that can control neuronal inhibition and the firing threshold voltage was achieved for an energy-efficient and reliable neural network. Spatiotemporal neuronal functionalities are demonstrated with fabricated single-transistor neurons and synapses. Image processing for letter pattern recognition and face image recognition is performed using experimental-based neuromorphic simulation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">The source scaling and seismic productivity of slow slip transients</a></h4>

              
                <p>Slow slip events (SSEs) represent a slow faulting process leading to aseismic strain release often accompanied by seismic tremor or earthquake swarms. The larger SSEs last longer and are often associated with intense and energetic tremor activity, suggesting that aseismic slip controls tremor genesis. A similar pattern has been observed for SSEs that trigger earthquake swarms, although no comparative studies exist on the source parameters of SSEs and tremor or earthquake swarms. We analyze the source scaling of SSEs and associated tremor- or swarm-like seismicity through our newly compiled dataset. We find a correlation between the aseismic and seismic moment release indicating that the shallower SSEs produce larger seismic moment release than deeper SSEs. The scaling may arise from the heterogeneous frictional and rheological properties of faults prone to SSEs and is mainly controlled by temperature. Our results indicate that similar physical phenomena govern tremor and earthquake swarms during SSEs.</p>

However, there is a long-lasting paradox between their convergent mimetic wing patterns and rapid divergence in speciation. Here, we characterize a locus that consistently displays high divergence among <I>Heliconius</I> butterflies and acts as an introgression hotspot. We further show that this locus contains multiple genes related to locomotion and conserved in Lepidoptera. In light of these findings, we consider that locomotion traits may be under selection, and if these are heritable traits that are selected for, then they might act as species barriers.</p>

                <p>Fisheries encompass complex interplays between social, economic, and environmental factors, but limitations on historical fisheries data can hamper efforts to identify and contextualize the long-term spatiotemporal patterns that shape them. We integrate 2500 years of stable isotope (<sup>34</sup>S, <sup>13</sup>C, and <sup>15</sup>N) and zooarchaeological evidence from Gulf of Mexico fisheries to assess cultural, demographic, and technological changes affecting sheepshead (<I>Archosargus probatocephalus</I>) populations and fishing practices in Louisiana, USA. Concurrent with human population growth, average sizes of sheepshead caught decreased from the 1720s to 1830s. The size of fish caught after the 1830s increased to pre-1720 levels at the same time that isotopic compositions of fish bone collagen show that fish were being caught from a more diverse range of ecosystems, including distant seagrass beds. Our findings provide the first evidence for large-scale depressions of historical sheepshead populations and the processes driving them, including rapid human population growth and sustained harvesting pressure.</p>

                <p>Efficient energy transport is desirable in organic semiconductor (OSC) devices. However, photogenerated excitons in OSC films mostly occupy highly localized states, limiting exciton diffusion coefficients to below ~10<sup>&ndash;2</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/s and diffusion lengths below ~50 nm. We use ultrafast optical microscopy and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations to study well-ordered poly(3-hexylthiophene) nanofiber films prepared using living crystallization-driven self-assembly, and reveal a highly efficient energy transport regime: transient exciton delocalization, where energy exchange with vibrational modes allows excitons to temporarily re-access spatially extended states under equilibrium conditions. We show that this enables exciton diffusion constants up to 1.1 &plusmn; 0.1 cm<sup>2</sup>/s and diffusion lengths of 300 &plusmn; 50 nm. Our results reveal the dynamic interplay between localized and delocalized exciton configurations at equilibrium conditions, calling for a re-evaluation of exciton dynamics and suggesting design rules to engineer efficient energy transport in OSC device architectures not based on restrictive bulk heterojunctions.</p>

                <p>Direct CO<SUB>2</SUB> hydrogenation to methanol using renewable energy&ndash;generated hydrogen is attracting intensive attention, but qualifying catalysts represents a grand challenge. Pure-/multi-metallic systems used for this task usually have low catalytic activity. Here, we tailored a highly active and selective InNi<SUB>3</SUB>C<SUB>0.5</SUB>/ZrO<SUB>2</SUB> catalyst by tuning the performance-relevant electronic metal-support interaction (EMSI), which is tightly linked with the ZrO<SUB>2</SUB> type&ndash;dependent oxygen deficiency. Highly oxygen-deficient monoclinic-ZrO<SUB>2</SUB> support imparts high electron density to InNi<SUB>3</SUB>C<SUB>0.5</SUB> because of the considerably enhanced EMSI, thereby enabling InNi<SUB>3</SUB>C<SUB>0.5</SUB>/monoclinic-ZrO<SUB>2</SUB> with an intrinsic activity three or two times as high as that of InNi<SUB>3</SUB>C<SUB>0.5</SUB>/amorphous-ZrO<SUB>2</SUB> or InNi<SUB>3</SUB>C<SUB>0.5</SUB>/tetragonal-ZrO<SUB>2</SUB>. The EMSI-governed catalysis observed in the InNi<SUB>3</SUB>C<SUB>0.5</SUB>/ZrO<SUB>2</SUB> system is extendable to other oxygen-deficient metal oxides, in particular InNi<SUB>3</SUB>C<SUB>0.5</SUB>/Fe<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>4</SUB>, achieving 25.7% CO<SUB>2</SUB> conversion with 90.2% methanol selectivity at 325&deg;C, 6.0 MPa, 36,000 ml g<SUB>cat</SUB><sup>&ndash;1</sup> hour<sup>&ndash;1</sup>, and H<SUB>2</SUB>/CO<SUB>2</SUB> = 10:1. This affordable catalyst is stable for at least 500 hours and is also highly resistant to sulfur poisoning.</p>

                <p>Determining the presence or absence of a past long-lived lunar magnetic field is crucial for understanding how the Moon&rsquo;s interior and surface evolved. Here, we show that Apollo impact glass associated with a young 2 million&ndash;year&ndash;old crater records a strong Earth-like magnetization, providing evidence that impacts can impart intense signals to samples recovered from the Moon and other planetary bodies. Moreover, we show that silicate crystals bearing magnetic inclusions from Apollo samples formed at ~3.9, 3.6, 3.3, and 3.2 billion years ago are capable of recording strong core dynamo&ndash;like fields but do not. Together, these data indicate that the Moon did not have a long-lived core dynamo. As a result, the Moon was not sheltered by a sustained paleomagnetosphere, and the lunar regolith should hold buried <sup>3</sup>He, water, and other volatile resources acquired from solar winds and Earth&rsquo;s magnetosphere over some 4 billion years.</p>

                <p>Host antibody responses are pivotal for providing protection against infectious agents. We have pioneered a new class of self-assembling micelles based on pentablock copolymers that enhance antibody responses while providing a low inflammatory environment compared to traditional adjuvants. This type of "just-right" immune response is critical in the rational design of vaccines for older adults. Here, we report on the mechanism of enhancement of antibody responses by pentablock copolymer micelles, which act as scaffolds for antigen presentation to B cells and cross-link B cell receptors, unlike other micelle-forming synthetic block copolymers. We exploited this unique mechanism and developed these scaffolds as a platform technology to produce antibodies in vitro. We show that this novel approach can be used to generate laboratory-scale quantities of therapeutic antibodies against multiple antigens, including those associated with SARS-CoV-2 and <I>Yersinia pestis</I>, further expanding the value of these nanomaterials to rapidly develop countermeasures against infectious diseases.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Genome-Wide Binding Profile for Human RE1 Silencing Transcription Factor Unveils a Unique Genetic Circuitry in Hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <p>Early studies in mouse neurodevelopment led to the discovery of the RE1 Silencing Transcription Factor (REST) and its role as a master repressor of neuronal gene expression. Recently, REST was reported to also repress neuronal genes in the human adult brain. These genes were found to be involved in pro-apoptotic pathways; and their repression, associated with increased REST levels during aging, were found to be neuroprotective and conserved across species. However, direct genome-wide REST binding profiles for REST in adult brain have not been identified for any species. Here, we apply this approach to mouse and human hippocampus. We find an expansion of REST binding sites in the human hippocampus that are lacking in both mouse hippocampus and other human non-neuronal cell types. The unique human REST binding sites are associated with genes involved in innate immunity processes and inflammation signaling which, on the basis of histology and recent public transcriptomic analyses, suggest that these new target genes are repressed in glia. We propose that the increases in REST expression in mid-adulthood presage the beginning of brain aging, and that human REST function has evolved to protect the longevity and function of both neurons and glia in human brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The RE1 Silencing Transcription Factor (REST) repressor has served historically as a model for gene regulation during mouse neurogenesis. Recent studies of REST have also suggested a conserved role for REST repressor function across lower species during aging. However, direct genome-wide studies for REST have been lacking for human brain. Here, we perform the first genome-wide analysis of REST binding in both human and mouse hippocampus. The majority of REST-occupied genes in human hippocampus are distinct from those in mouse. Further, the REST-associated genes unique to human hippocampus represent a new set related to innate immunity and inflammation, where their gene dysregulation has been implicated in aging-related neuropathology, such as Alzheimer's disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Mitochondrial Proteostasis Requires Genes Encoded in a Neurodevelopmental Syndrome Locus</a></h4>

              
                <p>Eukaryotic cells maintain proteostasis through mechanisms that require cytoplasmic and mitochondrial translation. Genetic defects affecting cytoplasmic translation perturb synapse development, neurotransmission, and are causative of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Fragile X syndrome. In contrast, there is little indication that mitochondrial proteostasis, either in the form of mitochondrial protein translation and/or degradation, is required for synapse development and function. Here we focus on two genes deleted in a recurrent copy number variation causing neurodevelopmental disorders, the 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome. We demonstrate that SLC25A1 and MRPL40, two genes present in the microdeleted segment and whose products localize to mitochondria, interact and are necessary for mitochondrial ribosomal integrity and proteostasis. Our <I>Drosophila</I> studies show that mitochondrial ribosome function is necessary for synapse neurodevelopment, function, and behavior. We propose that mitochondrial proteostasis perturbations, either by genetic or environmental factors, are a pathogenic mechanism for neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The balance between cytoplasmic protein synthesis and degradation, or cytoplasmic proteostasis, is required for normal synapse function and neurodevelopment. Cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ribosomes are necessary for two compartmentalized, yet interdependent, forms of proteostasis. Proteostasis dependent on cytoplasmic ribosomes is a well-established target of genetic defects that cause neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism. Here we show that the mitochondrial ribosome is a neurodevelopmentally regulated organelle whose function is required for synapse development and function. We propose that defective mitochondrial proteostasis is a mechanism with the potential to contribute to neurodevelopmental disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Pioneer Axons Utilize a Dcc Signaling-Mediated Invasion Brake to Precisely Complete Their Pathfinding Odyssey</a></h4>

              
                <p>Axons navigate through the embryo to construct a functional nervous system. A missing part of the axon navigation puzzle is how a single axon traverses distinct anatomic choice points through its navigation. The dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons experience such choice points. First, they navigate to the dorsal root entry zone (DREZ), then halt navigation in the peripheral nervous system to invade the spinal cord, and then reinitiate navigation inside the CNS. Here, we used time-lapse super-resolution imaging in zebrafish DRG pioneer neurons to investigate how embryonic axons control their cytoskeleton to navigate to and invade at the correct anatomic position. We found that invadopodia components form in the growth cone even during filopodia-based navigation, but only stabilize when the axon is at the spinal cord entry location. Further, we show that intermediate levels of DCC and cAMP, as well as Rac1 activation, subsequently engage an axon invasion brake. Our results indicate that actin-based invadopodia components form in the growth cone and disruption of the invasion brake causes axon entry defects and results in failed behavioral responses, thereby demonstrating the importance of regulating distinct actin populations during navigational challenges.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Correct spatiotemporal navigation of neuronal growth cones is dependent on extracellular navigational cues and growth cone dynamics. Here, we link <I>dcc</I>-mediated signaling to actin-based invadopodia and filopodia dynamics during pathfinding and entry into the spinal cord using an <I>in vivo</I> model of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory axons. We reveal a molecularly-controlled brake on invadopodia stabilization until the sensory neuron growth cone is present at the dorsal root entry zone (DREZ), which is ultimately essential for growth cone entry into the spinal cord and behavioral response.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Axonal Glycolytic Pathway Contributes to Sensory Axon Extension and Growth Cone Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>Understanding the bioenergetics of axon extension and maintenance has wide ranging implications for neurodevelopment and disease states. Glycolysis is a pathway consisting of 10 enzymes and separated into preparatory and payoff phases, the latter producing ATP. Using embryonic chicken sensory neurons, we report that glycolytic enzymes are found through the axon and the growth cone. Pharmacological inhibition of glycolysis in the presence of NGF impairs axon extension and growth cone dynamics within minutes without affecting axon maintenance. Experiments using microfluidic chambers show that the effect of inhibiting glycolysis on axon extension is local along distal axons and can be reversed by promoting mitochondrial respiration. Knockdown of GAPDH simplifies growth cone morphology and is rescued by shRNA-resistant GAPDH expression. Rescue of GAPDH using KillerRed fused to GAPDH followed by localized chromophore-assisted light inactivation of KillerRed-GAPDH in distal axons halts growth cone dynamics. Considering filament polymerization requires ATP, inhibition of glycolysis results in a paradoxical increase in axonal actin filament levels. The effect on actin filaments is because of enzymes before GAPDH, the first enzyme in the payoff phase. In the absence of NGF, inhibition of glycolysis along distal axons results in axon degeneration independent of cell death. These data indicate that the glycolytic pathway is operative in distal axons and contributes to the rate of axon extension and growth cone dynamics in the presence of NGF and that, in the absence of NGF, the axonal glycolytic pathway is required for axon maintenance.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Elucidation of the sources of ATP required for axon extension and maintenance has implications for understanding the mechanism of neuronal development and diseases of the nervous system. While recent work has emphasized the importance of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, the role of the glycolytic pathway in axon morphogenesis and maintenance remains minimally understood. The data reveal that the glycolytic pathway is required for normal sensory axon extension in the presence of NGF, while in the absence of NGF the glycolytic pathway is required for axon maintenance. The results have implications for the understanding of the bioenergetics of axon morphogenesis and plasticity and indicate that NGF has protective effects on sensory axon maintenance in hypoglycemic states.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Rac-GAP alpha2-Chimaerin Signals via CRMP2 and Stathmins in the Development of the Ocular Motor System</a></h4>

              
                <p>A precise sequence of axon guidance events is required for the development of the ocular motor system. Three cranial nerves grow toward, and connect with, six extraocular muscles in a stereotyped pattern, to control eye movements. The signaling protein alpha2-chimaerin (&alpha;2-CHN) plays a pivotal role in the formation of the ocular motor system; mutations in <I>CHN1</I>, encoding &alpha;2-CHN, cause the human eye movement disorder Duane Retraction Syndrome (DRS). Our research has demonstrated that the manipulation of &alpha;2-chn signaling in the zebrafish embryo leads to ocular motor axon wiring defects, although the signaling cascades regulated by &alpha;2-chn remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that several cytoskeletal regulatory proteins&mdash;collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2; encoded by the gene <I>dpysl2</I>), stathmin1, and stathmin 2&mdash;bind to &alpha;2-CHN. <I>dpysl2</I>, <I>stathmin1</I>, and especially <I>stathmin2</I> are expressed by ocular motor neurons. We find that the manipulation of <I>dpysl2</I> and of <I>stathmins</I> in zebrafish larvae leads to defects in both the axon wiring of the ocular motor system and the optokinetic reflex, impairing horizontal eye movements. Knockdowns of these molecules in zebrafish larvae of either sex caused axon guidance phenotypes that included defasciculation and ectopic branching; in some cases, these phenotypes were reminiscent of DRS. <I>chn1</I> knock-down phenotypes were rescued by the overexpression of CRMP2 and STMN1, suggesting that these proteins act in the same signaling pathway. These findings suggest that CRMP2 and stathmins signal downstream of &alpha;2-CHN to orchestrate ocular motor axon guidance and to control eye movements.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The precise control of eye movements is crucial for the life of vertebrate animals, including humans. In humans, this control depends on the arrangement of nerve wiring of the ocular motor system, composed of three nerves and six muscles, a system that is conserved across vertebrate phyla. Mutations in the protein alpha2-chimaerin have previously been shown to cause eye movement disorders (squint) and axon wiring defects in humans. Our recent work has unraveled how alpha2-chimaerin coordinates axon guidance of the ocular motor system in animal models. In this article, we demonstrate key roles for the proteins CRMP2 and stathmin 1/2 in the signaling pathway orchestrated by alpha2-chimaerin, potentially giving insight into the etiology of eye movement disorders in humans.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">On the Role of Arkypallidal and Prototypical Neurons for Phase Transitions in the External Pallidum</a></h4>

              
                <p>The external pallidum (globus pallidus pars externa [GPe]) plays a central role for basal ganglia functions and dynamics and, consequently, has been included in most computational studies of the basal ganglia. These studies considered the GPe as a homogeneous neural population. However, experimental studies have shown that the GPe contains at least two distinct cell types (prototypical and arkypallidal cells). In this work, we provide <I>in silico</I> insight into how pallidal heterogeneity modulates dynamic regimes inside the GPe and how they affect the GPe response to oscillatory input. We derive a mean-field model of the GPe system from a microscopic spiking neural network of recurrently coupled prototypical and arkypallidal neurons. Using bifurcation analysis, we examine the influence of dopamine-dependent changes of intrapallidal connectivity on the GPe dynamics. We find that increased self-inhibition of prototypical cells can induce oscillations, whereas increased inhibition of prototypical cells by arkypallidal cells leads to the emergence of a bistable regime. Furthermore, we show that oscillatory input to the GPe, arriving from striatum, leads to characteristic patterns of cross-frequency coupling observed at the GPe. Based on these findings, we propose two different hypotheses of how dopamine depletion at the GPe may lead to phase-amplitude coupling between the parkinsonian beta rhythm and a GPe-intrinsic  rhythm. Finally, we show that these findings generalize to realistic spiking neural networks of sparsely coupled Type I excitable GPe neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our work provides (1) insight into the theoretical implications of a dichotomous globus pallidus pars externa (GPe) organization, and (2) an exact mean-field model that allows for future investigations of the relationship between GPe spiking activity and local field potential fluctuations. We identify the major phase transitions that the GPe can undergo when subject to static or periodic input and link these phase transitions to the emergence of synchronized oscillations and cross-frequency coupling in the basal ganglia. Because of the close links between our model and experimental findings on the structure and dynamics of prototypical and arkypallidal cells, our results can be used to guide both experimental and computational studies on the role of the GPe for basal ganglia dynamics in health and disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">No Evidence for Entrainment: Endogenous Gamma Oscillations and Rhythmic Flicker Responses Coexist in Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Over the past decades, numerous studies have linked cortical gamma oscillations (~30&ndash;100 Hz) to neurocomputational mechanisms. Their functional relevance, however, is still passionately debated. Here, we asked whether endogenous gamma oscillations in the human brain can be entrained by a rhythmic photic drive &gt;50 Hz. Such a noninvasive modulation of endogenous brain rhythms would allow conclusions about their causal involvement in neurocognition. To this end, we systematically investigated oscillatory responses to a rapid sinusoidal flicker in the absence and presence of endogenous gamma oscillations using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in combination with a high-frequency projector. The photic drive produced a robust response over visual cortex to stimulation frequencies of up to 80 Hz. Strong, endogenous gamma oscillations were induced using moving grating stimuli as repeatedly done in previous research. When superimposing the flicker and the gratings, there was no evidence for phase or frequency entrainment of the endogenous gamma oscillations by the photic drive. Unexpectedly, we did not observe an amplification of the flicker response around participants' individual gamma frequencies (IGFs); rather, the magnitude of the response decreased monotonically with increasing frequency. Source reconstruction suggests that the flicker response and the gamma oscillations were produced by separate, coexistent generators in visual cortex. The presented findings challenge the notion that cortical gamma oscillations can be entrained by rhythmic visual stimulation. Instead, the mechanism generating endogenous gamma oscillations seems to be resilient to external perturbation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We aimed to investigate to what extent ongoing, high-frequency oscillations in the gamma-band (30&ndash;100 Hz) in the human brain can be entrained by a visual flicker. Gamma oscillations have long been suggested to coordinate neuronal firing and enable interregional communication. Our results demonstrate that rhythmic visual stimulation cannot hijack the dynamics of ongoing gamma oscillations; rather, the flicker response and the endogenous gamma oscillations coexist in different visual areas. Therefore, while a visual flicker evokes a strong neuronal response even at high frequencies in the gamma-band, it does not entrain endogenous gamma oscillations in visual cortex. This has important implications for interpreting studies investigating the causal and neuroprotective effects of rhythmic sensory stimulation in the gamma-band.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Paraventricular Nucleus Oxytocin Subsystems Promote Active Paternal Behaviors in Mandarin Voles</a></h4>

              
                <p>Paternal care plays a critical role in the development of brain and behaviors in offspring in monogamous species. However, the neurobiological mechanisms, especially the neuronal circuity, underlying paternal care is largely unknown. Using socially monogamous male mandarin voles (<I>Microtus mandarinus</I>) with high levels of paternal care, we found that paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) to ventral tegmental area (VTA) or nucleus accumbens (NAc) oxytocin (OT) neurons are activated during paternal care. Chemogenetic activation/inhibition of the PVN OT projection to VTA promoted/decreased paternal care, respectively. Chemogenetic inhibition of the PVN to VTA OT pathway reduced dopamine (DA) release in the NAc of male mandarin voles during licking and grooming of pups as revealed by <I>in vivo</I> fiber photometry. Optogenetic activation/inhibition of the VTA to NAc DA pathway possibly enhanced/suppressed paternal behaviors, respectively. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation/inhibition of PVN to NAc OT circuit enhanced/inhibited paternal care. This finding is a first step toward delineating the neuronal circuity underlying paternal care and may have implications for treating abnormalities in paternal care associated with paternal postpartum depression or paternal abuse.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Paternal behavior is essential for offspring survival and development in some mammalian species. However, the circuit mechanisms underlying the paternal brain are poorly understood. We show that manipulation of paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) to ventral tegmental area (VTA) oxytocin (OT) projections as well as VTA to nucleus accumbens (NAc) DA projections promote paternal behaviors. Inhibition the PVN to VTA OT pathway reduces DA release in the NAc during pup licking and grooming. PVN to NAc OT circuit is also essential for paternal behaviors. Our findings identify two new neural circuits that modulate paternal behaviors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Human Hippocampal Neurons Track Moments in a Sequence of Events</a></h4>

              
                <p>An indispensable feature of episodic memory is our ability to temporally piece together different elements of an experience into a coherent memory. Hippocampal time cells&mdash;neurons that represent temporal information&mdash;may play a critical role in this process. Although these cells have been repeatedly found in rodents, it is still unclear to what extent similar temporal selectivity exists in the human hippocampus. Here, we show that temporal context modulates the firing activity of human hippocampal neurons during structured temporal experiences. We recorded neuronal activity in the human brain while patients of either sex learned predictable sequences of pictures. We report that human time cells fire at successive moments in this task. Furthermore, time cells also signaled inherently changing temporal contexts during empty 10 s gap periods between trials while participants waited for the task to resume. Finally, population activity allowed for decoding temporal epoch identity, both during sequence learning and during the gap periods. These findings suggest that human hippocampal neurons could play an essential role in temporally organizing distinct moments of an experience in episodic memory.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Episodic memory refers to our ability to remember the what, where, and when of a past experience. Representing time is an important component of this form of memory. Here, we show that neurons in the human hippocampus represent temporal information. This temporal signature was observed both when participants were actively engaged in a memory task, as well as during 10-s-long gaps when they were asked to wait before performing the task. Furthermore, the activity of the population of hippocampal cells allowed for decoding one temporal epoch from another. These results suggest a robust representation of time in the human hippocampus.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neural Encoding of Auditory Statistics</a></h4>

              
                <p>The human brain extracts statistical regularities embedded in real-world scenes to sift through the complexity stemming from changing dynamics and entwined uncertainty along multiple perceptual dimensions (e.g., pitch, timbre, location). While there is evidence that sensory dynamics along different auditory dimensions are tracked independently by separate cortical networks, how these statistics are integrated to give rise to unified objects remains unknown, particularly in dynamic scenes that lack conspicuous coupling between features. Using tone sequences with stochastic regularities along spectral and spatial dimensions, this study examines behavioral and electrophysiological responses from human listeners (male and female) to changing statistics in auditory sequences and uses a computational model of predictive Bayesian inference to formulate multiple hypotheses for statistical integration across features. Neural responses reveal multiplexed brain responses reflecting both local statistics along individual features in frontocentral networks, together with global (object-level) processing in centroparietal networks. Independent tracking of local surprisal along each acoustic feature reveals linear modulation of neural responses, while global melody-level statistics follow a nonlinear integration of statistical beliefs across features to guide perception. Near identical results are obtained in separate experiments along spectral and spatial acoustic dimensions, suggesting a common mechanism for statistical inference in the brain. Potential variations in statistical integration strategies and memory deployment shed light on individual variability between listeners in terms of behavioral efficacy and fidelity of neural encoding of stochastic change in acoustic sequences.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The world around us is complex and ever changing: in everyday listening, sound sources evolve along multiple dimensions, such as pitch, timbre, and spatial location, and they exhibit emergent statistical properties that change over time. In the face of this complexity, the brain builds an internal representation of the external world by collecting statistics from the sensory input along multiple dimensions. Using a Bayesian predictive inference model, this work considers alternative hypotheses for how statistics are combined across sensory dimensions. Behavioral and neural responses from human listeners show the brain multiplexes two representations, where local statistics along each feature linearly affect neural responses, and global statistics nonlinearly combine statistical beliefs across dimensions to shape perception of stochastic auditory sequences.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Noise Correlations for Faster and More Robust Learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Distributed population codes are ubiquitous in the brain and pose a challenge to downstream neurons that must learn an appropriate readout. Here we explore the possibility that this learning problem is simplified through inductive biases implemented by stimulus-independent noise correlations that constrain learning to task-relevant dimensions. We test this idea in a set of neural networks that learn to perform a perceptual discrimination task. Correlations among similarly tuned units were manipulated independently of an overall population signal-to-noise ratio to test how the format of stored information affects learning. Higher noise correlations among similarly tuned units led to faster and more robust learning, favoring homogenous weights assigned to neurons within a functionally similar pool, and could emerge through Hebbian learning. When multiple discriminations were learned simultaneously, noise correlations across relevant feature dimensions sped learning, whereas those across irrelevant feature dimensions slowed it. Our results complement the existing theory on noise correlations by demonstrating that when such correlations are produced without significant degradation of the signal-to-noise ratio, they can improve the speed of readout learning by constraining it to appropriate dimensions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Positive noise correlations between similarly tuned neurons theoretically reduce the representational capacity of the brain, yet they are commonly observed, emerge dynamically in complex tasks, and persist even in well-trained animals. Here we show that such correlations, when embedded in a neural population with a fixed signal-to-noise ratio, can improve the speed and robustness with which an appropriate readout is learned. In a simple discrimination task such correlations can emerge naturally through Hebbian learning. In more complex tasks that require multiple discriminations, correlations between neurons that similarly encode the task-relevant feature improve learning by constraining it to the appropriate task dimension.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">4R Tau Modulates Cocaine-Associated Memory through Adult Dorsal Hippocampal Neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                <p>The development, persistence and relapse of drug addiction require drug memory that generally develops with drug administration-paired contextual stimuli. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) contributes to cocaine memory formation; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Male mice hippocampal expression of Tau was significantly decreased during the cocaine-associated memory formation. Genetic overexpression of four microtubule-binding repeats Tau (4R Tau) in the mice hippocampus disrupted cocaine memory by suppressing AHN. Furthermore, 4R Tau directly interacted with phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-p85 and impaired its nuclear translocation and PI3K-AKT signaling, processes required for hippocampal neuron proliferation. Collectively, 4R Tau modulates cocaine memory formation by disrupting AHN, suggesting a novel mechanism underlying cocaine memory formation and provide a new strategy for the treatment of cocaine addiction.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Drug memory that generally develops with drug-paired contextual stimuli and drug administration is critical for the development, persistence and relapse of drug addiction. Previous studies have suggested that adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) plays a role in cocaine memory formation. Here, we showed that Tau was significantly downregulated in the hippocampus in the cocaine memory formation. Tau knock-out (KO) promoted AHN in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), resulting in the enhanced memory formation evoked by cocaine-cue stimuli. In contrast, genetically overexpressed 4R Tau in the hippocampus disrupted cocaine-cue memory by suppressing AHN. In addition, 4R Tau interacted directly with phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-p85 and hindered its nuclear translocation, eventually repressing PI3K-AKT signaling, which is essential for hippocampal neuronal proliferation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Inhibition of Epigenetic Modifiers LSD1 and HDAC1 Blocks Rod Photoreceptor Death in Mouse Models of Retinitis Pigmentosa</a></h4>

              
                <p>Epigenetic modifiers are increasingly being investigated as potential therapeutics to modify and overcome disease phenotypes. Diseases of the nervous system present a particular problem as neurons are postmitotic and demonstrate relatively stable gene expression patterns and chromatin organization. We have explored the ability of epigenetic modifiers to prevent degeneration of rod photoreceptors in a mouse model of retinitis pigmentosa (RP), using rd10 mice of both sexes. The histone modification eraser enzymes lysine demethylase 1 (LSD1) and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) are known to have dramatic effects on the development of rod photoreceptors. In the RP mouse model, inhibitors of these enzymes blocked rod degeneration, preserved vision, and affected the expression of multiple genes including maintenance of rod-specific transcripts and downregulation of those involved in inflammation, gliosis, and cell death. The neuroprotective activity of LSD1 inhibitors includes two pathways. First, through targeting histone modifications, they increase accessibility of chromatin and upregulate neuroprotective genes, such as from the Wnt pathway. We propose that this process is going in rod photoreceptors. Second, through nonhistone targets, they inhibit transcription of inflammatory genes and inflammation. This process is going in microglia, and lack of inflammation keeps rod photoreceptors alive.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Retinal degenerations are a leading cause of vision loss. RP is genetically very heterogeneous, and the multiple pathways leading to cell death are one reason for the slow progress in identifying suitable treatments for patients. Here we demonstrate that inhibition of LSD1and HDAC1 in a mouse model of RP leads to preservation of rod photoreceptors and visual function, retaining of expression of rod-specific genes, and with decreased inflammation, cell death, and Mu&#x0308;ller cell gliosis. We propose that these epigenetic inhibitors cause more open and accessible chromatin, allowing expression of neuroprotective genes. A second mechanism that allows rod photoreceptor survival is suppression of inflammation by epigenetic inhibitors in microglia. Manipulation of epigenetic modifiers is a new strategy to fight neurodegeneration in RP.</p>

                Background:  Shared decision making is critical to patient-centered care and yet there is limited consensus on effective teaching approaches for training physicians in this domain. As a collaborative process in which the patient and physician co-create a decision, patient and relational agency may be important contributors and studies with patient-reported outcomes may identify successful approaches and determine gaps in pedagogy.  The authors conducted a systematic review of educational interventions for shared decision making, focusing on patient-reported outcomes and consideration of agency.  Methods:  Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for studies describing educational interventions with patient-level outcomes published between January 2000 and January 2020. Articles were excluded if they were not in English, included only patient interventions, or reported only physician outcomes.  Quality assessment was performed using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI).  Data about the educational methods used were extracted and included studies were assessed for quality. Thematic analysis was performed to identify the potential role of agency. Results: 26 articles were identified describing 17 unique studies.  Educational interventions were diverse in duration and content, with multiple components.  Three-quarters of studies used role play or simulated patients and 82% included tools to facilitate shared decisions.  Although no articles explicitly discussed facilitating agency as a component of the intervention or as an outcome, one qualitative study demonstrated themes of patient and relational agency. Conclusions:  Educational interventions included small group discussion, decision aids, role play, and simulated patients, and improved a range of patient outcomes, but our study included only studies including practicing physicians, limiting applicability to trainees and other health care providers. Interventions have not included explicit instructional design around agency, but qualitative analyses demonstrated interventions may facilitate agency and shared decision making. Future instructional strategies should consider the complexity inherent in co-constructing decisions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Using citation tracking for systematic literature searching - study protocol for a scoping review of methodological studies and a Delphi study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Up-to-date guidance on comprehensive study identification for systematic reviews is crucial. According to current recommendations, systematic searching should combine electronic database searching with supplementary search methods. One such supplementary search method is citation tracking. It aims at collecting directly and/or indirectly cited and citing references from "seed references". Tailored and evidence-guided recommendations concerning the use of citation tracking are strongly needed. Objective: We intend to develop recommendations for the use of citation tracking in systematic literature searching for health-related topics. Our study will be guided by the following research questions: What is the benefit of citation tracking for systematic literature searching for health-related topics? Which methods, citation indexes, and other tools are used for citation tracking? What terminology is used for citation tracking methods? Methods: Our study will have two parts: a scoping review and a Delphi study. The scoping review aims at identifying methodological studies on the benefit and use of citation tracking in systematic literature searching for health-related topics with no restrictions on study design, language, and publication date. We will perform database searching in MEDLINE (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Web of Science Core Collection, two information science databases, web searching, and contact experts in the field. Two reviewers will independently perform study selection. We will conduct direct backward and forward citation tracking on included articles. Data from included studies will be extracted using a prespecified extraction sheet and presented in both tabular and narrative form. The results of the scoping review will inform the subsequent Delphi study through which we aim to derive consensus recommendations for the future practice and research of citation tracking.

                Biological agents and infectious pathogens have the potential to cause very significant harm, as the natural occurrence of disease and pandemics makes clear. As a way to better understand the risk of Global Catastrophic Biological Risks due to human activities, rather than natural sources, this paper reports on a dataset of 71 incidents involving either accidental or purposeful exposure to, or infection by, a highly infectious pathogenic agent. There has been significant effort put into both reducing the risk of purposeful spread of biological weapons, and biosafety intended to prevent the exposure to, or release of, dangerous pathogens in the course of research. Despite these efforts, there are incidents of various types that could potentially be controlled or eliminated by different lab and/or bioweapon research choices and safety procedures. The dataset of events presented here was compiled during a project conducted in 2019 to better understand biological risks from anthropic sources. The events which are listed are unrelated to clinical treatment of naturally occurring outbreaks, and are instead entirely the result of human decisions and mistakes. While the events cover a wide range of cases, the criteria used covers a variety of events previously scattered across academic, policy, and other unpublished or not generally available sources.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Deep geometric representations for modeling effects of mutations on protein-protein binding affinity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xianggen Liu, Yunan Luo, Pengyong Li, Sen Song, Jian Peng</p>

Modeling the impact of amino acid mutations on protein-protein interaction plays a crucial role in protein engineering and drug design. In this study, we develop GeoPPI, a novel structure-based deep-learning framework to predict the change of binding affinity upon mutations. Based on the three-dimensional structure of a protein, GeoPPI first learns a geometric representation that encodes topology features of the protein structure via a self-supervised learning scheme. These representations are then used as features for training gradient-boosting trees to predict the changes of protein-protein binding affinity upon mutations. We find that GeoPPI is able to learn meaningful features that characterize interactions between atoms in protein structures. In addition, through extensive experiments, we show that GeoPPI achieves new state-of-the-art performance in predicting the binding affinity changes upon both single- and multi-point mutations on six benchmark datasets. Moreover, we show that GeoPPI can accurately estimate the difference of binding affinities between a few recently identified SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein. These results demonstrate the potential of GeoPPI as a powerful and useful computational tool in protein design and engineering. Our code and datasets are available at: https://github.com/Liuxg16/GeoPPI.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The unbiased estimation of the fraction of variance explained by a model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Dean A. Pospisil, Wyeth Bair</p>

The correlation coefficient squared, <i>r</i><sup>2</sup>, is commonly used to validate quantitative models on neural data, yet it is biased by trial-to-trial variability: as trial-to-trial variability increases, measured correlation to a model’s predictions decreases. As a result, models that perfectly explain neural tuning can appear to perform poorly. Many solutions to this problem have been proposed, but no consensus has been reached on which is the least biased estimator. Some currently used methods substantially overestimate model fit, and the utility of even the best performing methods is limited by the lack of confidence intervals and asymptotic analysis. We provide a new estimator, r ^ ER 2, that outperforms all prior estimators in our testing, and we provide confidence intervals and asymptotic guarantees. We apply our estimator to a variety of neural data to validate its utility. We find that neural noise is often so great that confidence intervals of the estimator cover the entire possible range of values ([0, 1]), preventing meaningful evaluation of the quality of a model’s predictions. This leads us to propose the use of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as a quality metric for making quantitative comparisons across neural recordings. Analyzing a variety of neural data sets, we find that up to ∼ 40% of some state-of-the-art neural recordings do not pass even a liberal SNR criterion. Moving toward more reliable estimates of correlation, and quantitatively comparing quality across recording modalities and data sets, will be critical to accelerating progress in modeling biological phenomena.

                <p>by Xing Zhang, Yamin Meng, Yizhou Huang, Dan Zhang, Weiguo Fang</p>

Pathogenic fungi precisely respond to dynamic microenvironments during infection, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. The insect pathogenic fungus <i>Metarhizium robertsii</i> is a representative fungus in which to study broad themes of fungal pathogenicity as it resembles some major plant and mammalian pathogenic fungi in its pathogenesis. Here we report on a novel cascade that regulates response of <i>M</i>. <i>robertsii</i> to 2 distinct microenvironments during its pathogenesis. On the insect cuticle, the transcription factor COH2 activates expression of cuticle penetration genes. In the hemocoel, the protein COH1 is expressed due to the reduction in epigenetic repression conferred by the histone deacetylase HDAC1 and the histone 3 acetyltransferase HAT1. COH1 interacts with COH2 to reduce COH2 stability, and this down-regulates cuticle penetration genes and up-regulates genes for hemocoel colonization. Our work significantly advances the insights into fungal pathogenicity in insects.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to identify disease relevant genes and explore underlying immunological mechanisms that contribute to early and late onset forms of myasthenia gravis.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used a novel genomic methodology to integrate genomewide association study (GWAS) findings in myasthenia gravis with cell-type specific information, such as gene expression patterns and promotor-enhancer interactions, in order to identify disease-relevant genes. Subsequently, we conducted additional genomic investigations, including an expression quantitative analysis of 313 healthy people to provide mechanistic insights.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified several genes that were specifically linked to early onset myasthenia gravis including <i>TNIP1</i>, <i>ORMDL3</i>, <i>GSDMB</i>, and <i>TRAF3</i>. We showed that regulators of toll-like receptor 4 signaling were enriched among these early onset disease genes (fold enrichment = 3.85, <i>p</i> = 6.4 × 10<sup>−3</sup>). In contrast, T-cell regulators <i>CD28</i> and <i>CTLA4</i> were exclusively linked to late onset disease. We identified 2 causal genetic variants (rs231770 and rs231735; posterior probability = 0.98 and 0.91) near the <i>CTLA4</i> gene. Subsequently, we demonstrated that these causal variants result in low expression of <i>CTLA4</i> (rho = −0.66, <i>p</i> = 1.28 × 10<sup>−38</sup> and rho = −0.52, <i>p</i> = 7.01 × 10<sup>−22</sup>, for rs231735 and rs231770, respectively).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The disease-relevant genes identified in this study are a unique resource for many disciplines, including clinicians, scientists, and the pharmaceutical industry. The distinct immunological pathways linked to early and late onset myasthenia gravis carry important implications for drug repurposing opportunities and for future studies of drug development.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Trap of weights: The reuse of weights in the floating catchment area (FCA) methods to measuring accessibility [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Geographic weights are vital in the floating catchment area (FCA) method of accessibility measurements due to their simulation of spatial barriers in various ways. When modelling population demand, geographical weights with different distance decay coefficients can reflect diverse distance tolerances in facility utilization and could lead to erratic accessibility results. Quantifying accessibility as the sum of weighted supply-demand ratios can alleviate the distance decay coefficient's influence and generate stable geographic patterns. However, the effects of weighted ratios on different FCA models and resources have not been investigated. Methods: To identify impacts of weighted ratios on various FCA variants, this study contrasted the accessibility calculated from the sum of ratios (access) and the sum of weighted ratios (access ratios) within three prevalent FCA models: enhanced two-step FCA (E2SFCA), modified two-step FCA (M2SFCA), and three-step FCA (3SFCA). In addition, the accessibilities of various resources evaluate the stability of the weighted ratios' effect. This study therefore examined the accessibilities to primary schools, job opportunities, and major hospitals in Shanghai. Shanghai is a case study that provides lessons on using big data to measure accessibility in metropolitan areas. Results: Geographic weights can not only mitigate the impact of the distance decay coefficients, but can also eliminate model features,  which reduces the performance of the M2SFCA's supply decay and the 3SFCA's population demand adjustment in accessibility results. Moreover, weighted ratios tend to overestimate accessibility in marginal communities that lie within fewer catchments, regardless of the resource type. This tendency can lead to an epistemological trap that creates an inaccurate and counter-intuitive perception of resource distribution in a given area. Conclusions: The results identify a gap between the methodological logic and the empirical perception in accessibility measurements. This study concludes that the use of geographic weights needs to be cautious and epistemologically consistent.

                Background: Statistical deconvolution strategies have emerged over the past decade to estimate the proportion of various cell populations in homogenate tissue sources like brain using gene expression data. However, no study has been undertaken to assess the extent to which expression-based and DNAm-based cell type composition estimates agree. Results: Using estimated neuronal fractions from DNAm data, from the same brain region (i.e., matched) as our bulk RNA-Seq dataset, as proxies for the true unobserved cell-type fractions (i.e., as the gold standard), we assessed the accuracy (RMSE) and concordance (R2) of four reference-based deconvolution algorithms: Houseman, CIBERSORT, non-negative least squares (NNLS)/MIND, and MuSiC. We did this for two cell-type populations - neurons and non-neurons/glia - using matched single nuclei RNA-Seq and mismatched single cell RNA-Seq reference datasets. With the mismatched single cell RNA-Seq reference dataset, Houseman, MuSiC, and NNLS produced concordant (high correlation; Houseman R2 = 0.51, 95% CI [0.39, 0.65]; MuSiC R2 = 0.56, 95% CI [0.43, 0.69]; NNLS R2 = 0.54, 95% CI [0.32, 0.68]) but biased (high RMSE, >0.35) neuronal fraction estimates. CIBERSORT produced more discordant (moderate correlation; R2 = 0.25, 95% CI [0.15, 0.38]) neuronal fraction estimates, but with less bias (low RSME, 0.09). Using the matched single nuclei RNA-Seq reference dataset did not eliminate bias (MuSiC RMSE = 0.17). Conclusions: Our results together suggest that many existing RNA deconvolution algorithms estimate the RNA composition of homogenate tissue, e.g. the amount of RNA attributable to each cell type, and not the cellular composition, which relates to the underlying fraction of cells.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Simple statistical insights into the COVID-19 data of Saudi Arabia: figures prior to vaccination campaign [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: COVID-19, the disease caused by the newly emerging coronavirus, SARS-COV2, is still a major health burden worldwide as it continues to spread rapidly in many countries after being contained for a while. The aim of the study was to analyze the official current disease estimates in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to anticipate future risks and needs. Methods: Publicly available COVID-19 data published by the Saudi Ministry of Health were analyzed to extract statistical estimates of the disease. These include monthly case fatality rates, death rates/1000, comparison of death figures and regression analysis. Results: The number of confirmed, recovered and deaths surged in the middle of the outbreak (June and July). The case fatality rates reported later in September-November were the highest despite the decline in the number of confirmed cases. The death rates/1000 were higher during the middle of the outbreak, where the highest numbers of deaths were recorded. The number of recovered cases was the highest as well during this time. Regression analysis showed that the number of deaths was related to that of confirmed cases, especially during the peak time. On the other hand, the number of recovered cases was related to that of confirmed cases at the beginning of the outbreak. Conclusion: Statistical estimates of COVID-19 fatalities provide simple figures to understand the disease progression pattern and the health care management success in disease containment. However, the absolute numbers should never be disregarded to reflect on the real situation.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Is cyclooxygenase‐1 involved in neuroinflammation?</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><i>Purpose:</i> Reactive microglia are an important hallmark of neuroinflammation. Reactive microglia release various inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines, chemokines, and prostaglandins, which are produced by enzymes like cyclooxygenases (COX). The inducible COX-2 subtype has been associated with inflammation, whereas the constitutively expressed COX-1 subtype is generally considered as a housekeeping enzyme. However, recent evidence suggests that COX-1 can also be upregulated and may play a prominent role in the brain during neuroinflammation. In this review, we summarize the evidence that supports this involvement of COX-1. <i>Methods</i>: Five databases were used to retrieve relevant studies that addressed COX-1 in the context of neuroinflammation. The search resulted in 32 articles, describing <i>in vitro</i>, <i>in vivo</i>, post mortem, and <i>in vivo</i> imaging studies that specifically investigated the COX-1 isoform under such conditions. <i>Results</i>: Reviewed literature generally indicated that the overexpression of COX-1 was induced by an inflammatory stimulus, which resulted in an increased production of prostaglandin E2. The pharmacological inhibition of COX-1 was shown to suppress the induction of inflammatory mediators like prostaglandin E2. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies in animal models confirmed the overexpression of COX-1 during neuroinflammation. The same imaging method, however, could not detect any upregulation of COX-1 in patients with Alzheimer's disease. <i>Conclusion</i>: Taken together, studies in cultured cells and living rodents suggest that COX-1 is involved in neuroinflammation. Most postmortem studies on human brains indicate that the concentration of COX-1-expressing microglial cells is increased near sites of inflammation. However, evidence for the involvement of COX-1 in neuroinflammation in the living human brain is still largely lacking.</p>

                Background:Diarrhea is still the leading cause of childhood death worldwide, as well as a major cause for concern in developing countries. This study was conducted to investigate the factors related to childhood diarrhea in Cambodia. Methods:A cross-sectional study of the secondary data from the Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey 2014 was conducted using the combined dataset of household data and children’s data. A generalized linear mixed model was used to analyze the determinant factors of childhood diarrhea. Results:The surveys included 2,828 children, aged 12 to 35 months. The prevalence of diarrhea in the last 2 weeks was 16.44% (95% CI: 14.72%-18.31%). Factors with statistically significant associations with childhood diarrhea in Cambodia were: maternal unemployment, compared with being in employment (AOR = 1.43; 95% CI: 1.14-1.78); the child being male (AOR = 1.25; 95%CI: 1.02-1.53); the presence of unimproved toilet facilities (AOR = 1.17; 95%CI: 1.05-1.31) compared with improved toilet facilities; and unhygienic disposal of children’s stools (AOR = 1.32; 95%CI: 1.06-1.64) compared with hygienic disposal of children’s stools when controlling for other covariates. Both maternal age (one year older; AOR = 0.85; 95%CI: 0.78– 0.93) and child age (one month older; AOR = 0.86; 95%CI: 0.78-0.94) had significant negative associations with the occurrence of childhood diarrhea. Conclusion:Childhood diarrhea remains a public health concern in Cambodia. The probability of diarrhea occurring is shown to be increased by maternal unemployment, the sex of the child being male, lack of provision of improved toilet facilities, and the unhygienic disposal of children’s stools; whereas increasing maternal age and child’s age were associated with a reduced chance of diarrhea occurring. On the basis of these results, we recommend provision of programs focusing on reducing diarrhea through the construction of improved toilet facilities and the promotion of behavior to improve hygiene, specifically targeting younger mothers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Brain-derived neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein levels in urine in overactive bladder patients: a meta-analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Overactive bladder (OAB) is a clinical syndrome characterized by a combination of symptoms including urgency, frequency, and nocturia, with or without urinary incontinence. Overactive bladder has a high prevalence especially in those of an older age and women, with diagnosis depending on the patient’s symptoms. This study aims to assess brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (HSCRP) in urine as biomarkers in OAB. Methods: Studies were searched from Pubmed, Science Direct, Wiley Online Library, and Google Scholar. All studies assessing BDNF, NGF, and HSCRP in urine in OAB patients were included. The standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were then calculated. Results: A total of 85 studies were included with a total of 11,483 subjects (6,885 OAB patients and 4,598 controls). Based on data analysis results, urinary NGF/Creatinine (NGF/Cr) and NGF level in OAB patients were significantly higher than control (SMD = 1.00, 95%CI = 0.80-1.20, P<0.00001; and SMD = 1.11, 95%CI = 0.79-1.43, P<0.00001). NGF/Cr level was found higher in OAB with incontinence (OAB wet) compared with OAB without incontinence (OAB dry) (SMD = 0.41, 95%CI = 0.23-0.60, P<0.0001), and decreased after treatment (SMD = 0.76, 95%CI = 0.49-1.03, P<0.00001). Urinary BDNF/Cr level was significantly higher in OAB patients compared with controls (SMD = 1.97, 95%CI = 1.14-2.79, P<0.00001), and also decreased significantly after treatment (SMD = 0.75, 95%CI = 0.42-1.08, P<0.00001). The level of HSCRP was significantly higher in OAB patients when compared with controls (SMD = 0.38, 95%CI = 0.12-0.64, P<0.004). Conclusions: The level of BDNF/Cr, NGF/Cr, NGF, and HSCRP in urine were found higher in OAB compared with controls, which means they may be used as a biomarkers for OAB.

                Kikuchi-Fujimoto Disease (KFD), also known as histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis, is a rare cause of cervical lymphadenopathy. Patients usually present with localized lymphadenopathy, fever and fatigue. Because of the poorly understood etiology, it can be mistaken for an infectious disease or even malignance. Here we discuss a case of KFD that initially presented with left sided cervical lymphadenopathy that later progressed to left supraclavicular lymph nodes. Due to its characteristic overlap with other disorders like tuberculous lymphadenitis and lymphoma, KFD remains an arduous diagnosis for physicians. Therefore, one should be made aware of symptoms that can lead to misdiagnosis in patients.

                Background: Research on the psychosocial toll of the COVID-19 pandemic is being conducted in various countries. This study aimed to examine stress levels and causal stressors for perceived stress and generalized anxiety in the Indian population related to the lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A total of 300 adults were invited to participate in the online study via snowball and virtual snowball sampling. They were requested to complete electronic survey forms for assessing perceived stress and anxiety, and questions related to psychosocial stressors. Frequency and percentage were used for categorical variables. Unpaired t-test was applied to compare responses based on gender, level of education, employment, and place of residence. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result: In total, 257 out of the 300 invited, responded and completed the survey. Men accounted for 58% (n=149) of the respondents. Overall, 84% (n=217) of participants had moderate to severe levels of perceived stress and 88% (n=228) had moderate to severe levels of anxiety. Women, as well as those not employed, reported significantly higher perceived stress and anxiety, urban residents reported higher perceived stress, while level of education had no difference in terms of perceived stress as well as anxiety. Fear of contracting COVID-19 was the highest stressor followed by difficulties in executing a routine exercise schedule and worry about the future. Conclusion: The psychosocial impact of the nationwide lockdown on the Indian population has been high. Vulnerable groups for increased stress and anxiety include women, younger ages, and the unemployed. The stressors recognized include fear of contracting COVID-19, inability to execute a routine exercise schedule and worry about the future.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Alternative strategies for closing the award gap between white and minority ethnic students</a></h4>

              
                In the United Kingdom, undergraduate students from Black, Asian and other minority ethnic backgrounds receive lower classes of degrees than white students, and similar gaps have been reported in other countries. Such award gaps limit ethnic diversity in academic research, and in the broader job market. Whilst there has been some success in reducing the award gap in the UK, a significant gap still persists. Here, based on an analysis of students studying cell biology at University College London, I show that differences in performance at exams contribute significantly more to the award gap than differences in performance in coursework. From these data, plus scrutiny of the literature, alternative policies are identified to speed up the closure of the award gap and to remove the barriers that prevent students from Black, Asian and other minority ethnic backgrounds from progressing to PhD and postdoctoral positions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ciliary and extraciliary Gpr161 pools repress hedgehog signaling in a tissue-specific manner</a></h4>

              
                The role of compartmentalized signaling in primary cilia during tissue morphogenesis is not well understood. The cilia-localized G-protein-coupled receptor—Gpr161 represses hedgehog pathway via cAMP signaling. We engineered a knock-in at <i>Gpr161 </i>locus in mice to generate a variant (Gpr161<sup>mut1</sup>), which was ciliary localization defective but cAMP signaling competent. Tissue phenotypes from hedgehog signaling depend on downstream bifunctional Gli transcriptional factors functioning as activators/repressors. Compared to knockout (ko), <i>Gpr161<sup>mut1/ko</sup></i> had delayed embryonic lethality, moderately increased hedgehog targets and partially down-regulated Gli3-repressor. Unlike ko, the <i>Gpr161<sup>mut1/</sup></i><sup>ko</sup> neural tube did not show Gli2-activator-dependent expansion of ventral-most progenitors. Instead, the intermediate neural tube showed progenitor expansion that depends on loss of Gli3-repressor. Increased extraciliary receptor (<i>Gpr161<sup>mut1/mut1</sup></i>) prevented ventralization. Morphogenesis in limb buds and midface requires Gli-repressor; these tissues in <i>Gpr161<sup>mut1/mut1</sup><sup> </sup></i>manifested hedgehog hyperactivation phenotypes—polydactyly and midfacial widening. Thus, ciliary and extraciliary Gpr161 pools likely establish tissue-specific Gli-repressor thresholds in determining morpho-phenotypic outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ciliary chemosensitivity is enhanced by cilium geometry and motility</a></h4>

              
                Cilia are hairlike organelles involved in both sensory functions and motility. We discuss the question of whether the location of chemical receptors on cilia provides an advantage in terms of sensitivity and whether motile sensory cilia have a further advantage. Using a simple advection-diffusion model, we compute the capture rates of diffusive molecules on a cilium. Because of its geometry, a non-motile cilium in a quiescent fluid has a capture rate equivalent to a circular absorbing region with ~4x its surface area. When the cilium is exposed to an external shear flow, the equivalent surface area increases to ~6x. Alternatively, if the cilium beats in a non-reciprocal way in an otherwise quiescent fluid, its capture rate increases with the beating frequency to the power of 1/3. Altogether, our results show that the protruding geometry of a cilium could be one of the reasons why so many receptors are located on cilia. They also point to the advantage of combining motility with chemical reception.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The genomic consequences of hybridization</a></h4>

              
                In the past decade, advances in genome sequencing have allowed researchers to uncover the history of hybridization in diverse groups of species, including our own. Although the field has made impressive progress in documenting the extent of natural hybridization, both historical and recent, there are still many unanswered questions about its genetic and evolutionary consequences. Recent work has suggested that the outcomes of hybridization in the genome may be in part predictable, but many open questions about the nature of selection on hybrids and the biological variables that shape such selection have hampered progress in this area. We synthesize what is known about the mechanisms that drive changes in ancestry in the genome after hybridization, highlight major unresolved questions, and discuss their implications for the predictability of genome evolution after hybridization.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Identification of abscission checkpoint bodies as structures that regulate ESCRT factors to control abscission timing</a></h4>

              
                The abscission checkpoint regulates the ESCRT membrane fission machinery and thereby delays cytokinetic abscission to protect genomic integrity in response to residual mitotic errors. The checkpoint is maintained by Aurora B kinase, which phosphorylates multiple targets, including CHMP4C, a regulatory ESCRT-III subunit necessary for this checkpoint. We now report the discovery that cytoplasmic abscission checkpoint bodies (ACBs) containing phospho-Aurora B and tri-phospho-CHMP4C develop during an active checkpoint. ACBs are derived from Mitotic Interchromatin Granules (MIGs), transient mitotic structures whose components are housed in splicing-related nuclear speckles during interphase. ACB formation requires CHMP4C, and the ESCRT factor ALIX also contributes. ACB formation is conserved across cell types and under multiple circumstances that activate the checkpoint. Finally, ACBs retain a population of ALIX, and their presence correlates with delayed abscission and delayed recruitment of ALIX to the midbody where it would normally promote abscission. Thus, a cytoplasmic mechanism helps regulate midbody machinery to delay abscission.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A low Smc flux avoids collisions and facilitates chromosome organization in B. subtilis</a></h4>

              
                SMC complexes are widely conserved ATP-powered DNA-loop-extrusion motors indispensable for organizing and faithfully segregating chromosomes. How SMC complexes translocate along DNA for loop extrusion and what happens when two complexes meet on the same DNA molecule is largely unknown. Revealing the origins and the consequences of SMC encounters is crucial for understanding the folding process not only of bacterial, but also of eukaryotic chromosomes. Here, we uncover several factors that influence bacterial chromosome organization by modulating the probability of such clashes. These factors include the number, the strength, and the distribution of Smc loading sites, the residency time on the chromosome, the translocation rate, and the cellular abundance of Smc complexes. By studying various mutants, we show that these parameters are fine-tuned to reduce the frequency of encounters between Smc complexes, presumably as a risk mitigation strategy. Mild perturbations hamper chromosome organization by causing Smc collisions, implying that the cellular capacity to resolve them is limited. Altogether, we identify mechanisms that help to avoid Smc collisions and their resolution by Smc traversal or other potentially risky molecular transactions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Gjd2b-mediated gap junctions promote glutamatergic synapse formation and dendritic elaboration in Purkinje neurons</a></h4>

              
                Gap junctions between neurons serve as electrical synapses, in addition to conducting metabolites and signaling molecules. During development, early-appearing gap junctions are thought to prefigure chemical synapses, which appear much later. We present evidence for this idea at a central, glutamatergic synapse and provide some mechanistic insights. Loss or reduction in the levels of the gap junction protein Gjd2b decreased the frequency of glutamatergic miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in cerebellar Purkinje neurons (PNs) in larval zebrafish. Ultrastructural analysis in the molecular layer showed decreased synapse density. Further, mEPSCs had faster kinetics and larger amplitudes in mutant PNs, consistent with their stunted dendritic arbors. Time-lapse microscopy in wild type and mutant PNs reveals that Gjd2b puncta promote the elongation of branches and that CaMKII may be a critical mediator of this process. These results demonstrate that Gjd2b-mediated gap junctions regulate glutamatergic synapse formation and dendritic elaboration in PNs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Rolling controls sperm navigation in response to the dynamic rheological properties of the environment</a></h4>

              
                Mammalian sperm rolling around their longitudinal axes is a long-observed component of motility, but its function in the fertilization process, and more specifically in sperm migration within the female reproductive tract, remains elusive. While investigating bovine sperm motion under simple shear flow and in a quiescent microfluidic reservoir and developing theoretical and computational models, we found that rolling regulates sperm navigation in response to the rheological properties of the sperm environment. In other words, rolling enables a sperm to swim progressively even if the flagellum beats asymmetrically. Therefore, a rolling sperm swims stably along the nearby walls (wall-dependent navigation) and efficiently upstream under an external fluid flow (rheotaxis). By contrast, an increase in ambient viscosity and viscoelasticity suppresses rolling, consequently, non-rolling sperm are less susceptible to nearby walls and external fluid flow and swim in two-dimensional diffusive circular paths (surface exploration). This surface exploration mode of swimming is caused by the intrinsic asymmetry in flagellar beating such that the curvature of a sperm’s circular path is proportional to the level of asymmetry. We found that the suppression of rolling is reversible and occurs in sperm with lower asymmetry in their beating pattern at higher ambient viscosity and viscoelasticity. Consequently, the rolling component of motility may function as a regulatory tool allowing sperm to navigate according to the rheological properties of the functional region within the female reproductive tract.

                Providing Virtual Reality(VR) users with a 3D representation of their body complements the experience of immersion and presence in the virtual world with the experience of being physically located and more personally involved. A full-body avatar representation is known to induce a Sense of Embodiment (SoE) for this virtual body, which is associated with improvements in task performance, motivation and motor learning. Recent experimental research on embodiment provides useful guidelines, indicating the extent of discrepancy tolerated by users and, conversely, the limits and disruptive events that lead to a break in embodiment (BiE). Based on previous works on the limit of agency under movement distortion, this paper describes, studies and analyses the impact of a very common yet overlooked embodiment limitation linked to articular limits when performing a reaching movement. We demonstrate that perceiving the articular limit when fully extending the arm provides users with an additional internal proprioceptive feedback which, if not matched in the avatar's movement, leads to the disruptive realization of an incorrect posture mapping. This study complements previous works on self-contact and visuo-haptic conflicts and emphasizes the risk of disrupting the SoE when distorting users movements or using a poorly-calibrated avatar.

                Background and Purpose: Microstructure imaging with advanced diffusion MRI (dMRI) techniques have shown increased sensitivity and specificity to microstructural changes in various disease and injury models. Oscillating gradient spin echo (OGSE) dMRI, implemented by varying the oscillating gradient frequency, and microscopic anisotropy ({micro}A) dMRI, implemented via tensor valued diffusion encoding, may provide additional insight by increasing sensitivity to smaller spatial scales and disentangling fiber orientation dispersion from true microstructural changes, respectively. The aims of this study were to characterize the test-retest reproducibility of in vivo OGSE and {micro}A dMRI metrics in the mouse brain at 9.4 Tesla and provide estimates of required sample sizes for future investigations. Methods: Eight adult C57Bl/6 mice were scanned twice (5 days apart). Each imaging session consisted of multifrequency OGSE and {micro}A dMRI protocols. Metrics investigated included {micro}A, isotropic and anisotropic kurtosis, and the diffusion dispersion rate ({Lambda}), which explores the power-law frequency dependence of mean diffusivity. The dMRI metric maps were analyzed with mean region-of-interest (ROI) and whole brain voxel-wise analysis. Bland-Altman plots and coefficients of variation (CV) were used to assess the reproducibility of OGSE and {micro}A metrics. Furthermore, we estimated sample sizes required to detect a variety of effect sizes. Results: Bland-Altman plots showed negligible biases between test and retest sessions. ROI-based CVs revealed high reproducibility for both {micro}A (CVs < 8 %) and {Lambda} (CVs < 15 %). Voxel-wise CV maps revealed high reproducibility for {micro}A (CVs ~ 10 %), but low reproducibility for OGSE metrics (CVs ~ 50 %). Conclusion: Most of the {micro}A dMRI metrics are reproducible in both ROI-based and voxel-wise analysis, while the OGSE dMRI metrics are only reproducible in ROI-based analysis. {micro}A and {Lambda} may provide sensitivity to subtle microstructural changes (4 - 8 %) with feasible sample sizes (10 - 15).

                Retinoic acid (RA) plays major roles during nervous system development, and during regeneration of the adult nervous system. We have previously shown that components of the RA signaling pathway are upregulated after optic nerve injury, and that exogenous application of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) greatly increases the survival of axotomized retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). The objective of the present study is to investigate the effects of ATRA application on the macrophages in the optic nerve after injury, and to determine whether this affects axonal regeneration. The optic nerve was crushed and treated with PBS, ATRA and/or clodronate-loaded liposomes. Nerves were examined at one and two weeks after axotomy with light microscopy, immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy. ATRA application to the optic nerve caused transient increases in the number of macrophages and microglia one week after injury. The macrophages are consistently labeled with M2-type markers, and have considerable phagocytic activity. ATRA increased ultrastructural features of ongoing phagocytic activity in macrophages at one and two weeks. ATRA treatment also significantly increased the numbers of regenerating GAP-43-labeled axons. Clodronate liposome treatment depleted macrophage numbers by 80%, completely eliminated the ATRA-mediated increase in axonal regeneration, and clodronate treatment alone decreased axonal numbers by 30%. These results suggest that the success of axon regeneration is partially dependent on the presence of debris-phagocytosing macrophages, and that the increases in regeneration caused by ATRA are in part due to their increased numbers. Further studies will examine whether macrophage depletion affects RGC survival.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Altered low frequency brain rhythms precede changes in gamma power during tauopathy</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease and other dementias are associated with disruptions of electrophysiological brain activity, including low frequency and gamma rhythms. Many of these dementias are also associated with the malfunction of the membrane associated protein tau. Tauopathy disrupts neuronal function and the stability of synapses and is a key driver of neurodegeneration. Here we ask how brain rhythms are affected by tauopathy, at different stages of its progression. We performed local field potential recordings from visual cortex of rTg4510 and control animals at early stages of neurodegeneration (5 months) and at a more advanced stage where pathology is evident (8 months). We measured brain activity in the presence or absence of external visual stimulation, and while monitoring pupil diameter and locomotion to establish animal behavioural states. At 5 months, before substantial pathology, we found an increase in low frequency rhythms during resting state in tauopathic animals. This was because tauopathic animals entered intermittent periods of increased neural synchronisation, where activity across a wide band of low frequencies was strongly correlated. At 8 months, when the degeneration was more advanced, the increased synchronisation and low frequency power was accompanied by a reduction in power in the gamma range, with diverse effects across different components of the gamma rhythm. Our results indicate that slower rhythms are impaired earlier than gamma rhythms in tauopathy, suggesting that electrophysiological measurements can indicate both the presence and progression of tauopathic degeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Concentration-dependent change in hypothalamic neuronal transcriptome by the dietary fatty acids: oleic and palmitic acids</a></h4>

              
                Prenatal high-fat diet exposure increases hypothalamic neurogenesis events in embryos and programs offspring to be obesity-prone. The molecular mechanism involved in these dietary effects of neurogenesis are unknown. This study investigated the effects of oleic and palmitic acids, which are abundant in a high-fat diet, on the hypothalamic neuronal transcriptome and how these changes impact neurogenesis events. The results show differential effects of low and high concentrations of oleic or palmitic acid treatment on differential gene transcription. Gene ontology analysis uncovered significant gene enrichment in several cellular pathways involved in gene regulation and protein production, particularly with proliferation, migration, and cell survival. The enriched signaling pathways include Wnt, integrin, PDGF, and apoptosis, in addition endocrine function signaling pathways CCKR and GnRH. Further examination of proliferation and migration show low concentrations of oleic acid to stimulate proliferation and high concentrations of both oleic and palmitic acid to stimulate apoptosis. Oleic acid also reduced hypothalamic neuronal migration, with little effects by palmitic acid. The results show direct impact of the two most abundant fatty acids in a high fat diet to directly impact hypothalamic neuronal proliferation and migration. The results also uncovered signaling pathways affected by oleic and palmitic acid and suggest a mechanism of prenatal high-fat diet induced neurogenesis events is through these two abundant fatty acids.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Data-Dependent Acquisition Ladder for Ultrasensitive (Neuro)Proteomics</a></h4>

              
                Measurement of broad types of proteins from a small number of cells to single cells would help to better understand the nervous system but requires significant leaps in high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) sensitivity. Microanalytical capillary electrophoresis electrospray ionization (microCE-ESI) offers a path to ultrasensitive proteomics by integrating scalability with sensitivity. We report here a data acquisition strategy that expands the detectable and quantifiable proteome in trace amounts of digests using microCE-ESI-HRMS. Data-dependent acquisition (DDA) was programmed to progressively exclude high-intensity peptide signals during repeated measurements. These nested experiments formed rungs of our DDA ladder. The method was tested for replicates analyzing ~500 pg of protein digest from cultured hippocampal (primary) neurons (mouse), which estimates to the total amount of protein from a single neuron. Analysis of net amounts approximating to ~10 neurons identified 428 nonredundant proteins (415 quantified), an ~35% increase over traditional DDA. The identified proteins were enriched in neuronal marker genes and molecular pathways of neurobiological importance. The DDA ladder deepens the detectable proteome from trace amounts of proteins, expanding the analytical toolbox of neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The control and training of single motor units in isometric tasks are constrained by a common synaptic input signal</a></h4>

              
                Recent developments in neural interfaces enable the real-time and non-invasive tracking of motor neuron spiking activity. Such novel interfaces provide a promising basis for human motor augmentation by extracting potential high-dimensional control signals directly from the human nervous system. However, it is unclear how flexibly humans can control the activity of individual motor neurones to effectively increase the number of degrees-of-freedom available to coordinate multiple effectors simultaneously. Here, we provided human subjects (N=7) with real-time feedback on the discharge patterns of pairs of motor units (MUs) innervating a single muscle (tibialis anterior) and encouraged them to independently control the MUs by tracking targets in a 2D space. Subjects learned control strategies to achieve the target-tracking task for various combinations of MUs. These strategies rarely corresponded to a volitional control of independent input signals to individual MUs. Conversely, MU activation was consistent with a common input to the MU pair, while individual activation of the MUs in the pair was predominantly achieved by alterations in de-recruitment order that could be explained with history-dependent changes in motor neuron excitability. These results suggest that flexible MU control based on independent synaptic inputs to single MUs is not a simple to learn control strategy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Asynchronous and coherent dynamics in balanced excitatory-inhibitory populations</a></h4>

              
                Dynamic excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) balance is a paradigmatic mechanism invoked to explain the irregular low firing activity observed in the cortex. However, we will show that the E-I balance can be at the origin of other regimes observable in the brain. The analysis is performed by combining extensive simulations of sparse E-I networks composed of N spiking neurons with analytical investigations of low dimensional neural mass models. The bifurcation diagrams, derived for the neural mass model, allow to classify the possible asynchronous and coherent behaviours emerging in balanced E-I networks with structural heterogeneity for any finite in-degree K. In the limit N >> K >> 1 both supra and sub-threshold balanced asynchronous regimes can be observed in our system. Due to the heterogeneity the asynchronous states are characterized by the splitting of the neurons in three groups: silent, fluctuation and mean driven. These features are consistent with experimental observations reported for heterogeneous neural circuits. The coherent rhythms observed in our system can range from periodic and quasi-periodic collective oscillations (COs) to coherent chaos. These rhythms are characterized by regular or irregular temporal fluctuations joined to spatial coherence somehow similar to coherent fluctuations observed in the cortex over multiple spatial scales. The COs can emerge due to two different mechanisms. A first mechanism similar to the pyramidal-interneuron gamma (PING) one, usually invoked for the emergence of gamma-oscillations. The second mechanism is intimately related to the presence of current fluctuations, which sustain COs characterized by an essentially simultaneous bursting of the two populations. We observe period-doubling cascades involving the PING-like COs finally leading to the appearance of coherent chaos. Fluctuation driven COs are usually observable in our system as quasi-periodic collective motions characterized by two incommensurate frequencies. However, for sufficiently strong current fluctuations we report a novel mechanism of frequency locking among collective rhythms promoted by these intrinsic fluctuations. Our analysis suggest that despite PING-like or fluctuation driven COS are observable for any finite in-degree K, in the limit N >> K >> 1 these solutions finally result in two coexisting balanced regimes: an asynchronous and a fully synchronized one.

                Astrocytes are resident glia cells of the central nervous system (CNS) that play complex and heterogeneous roles in brain development, homeostasis and disease. Since their vast involvement in health and disease is becoming increasingly recognized, suitable and reliable tools for studying these cells in vivo and in vitro are of utmost importance. One of the key challenges hereby is to adequately mimic their context-dependent in vivo phenotypes and functions in vitro. To better understand the spectrum of astrocytic variations in defined settings we performed a side-by-side-comparison of embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived astrocytes as well as primary neonatal and adult astrocytes, revealing major differences on a functional and transcriptomic level, specifically on proliferation, migration, calcium signalling and cilium activity. Our results highlight the need to carefully consider the choice of astrocyte origin and phenotype with respect to age, isolation and culture protocols based on the respective biological question.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcranial magnetic stimulation of the occipital cortex interferes with foot movements in blind individuals</a></h4>

              
                Plasticity after visual loss is a remarkable characteristic of the brain. Previous studies in blind individuals have shown that the occipital cortex, which corresponds to the visual cortex in sighted individuals, can be reorganized and repurposed for nonvisual perception and cognitive functions. To our knowledge, however, no studies have directly examined its involvement in motor production. Here we show that a rhythmic foot movement performed by acquired blind participants can be disrupted by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to their primary and secondary visual cortex (V1/V2). Variability of this foot movement increased when we applied TMS to the acquired blind participants. This effect of TMS was absent for both sighted and congenitally blind participants. These results suggest that the visual cortex of blind individuals is involved in motor production, but its involvement requires prior visual experience. Our finding indicates that functional repurposing of the visual cortex may not be restricted to perception and cognitive functions, but also extended to motor function. Motor function may emerge in the visual cortex of blind individuals as a consequence of the reorganization of the visuomotor network, which has been developed before visual loss.

                Our experience of time can feel dilated or compressed, rather than reflecting true 'clock time.' Although many contextual factors influence the subjective perception of time, it is unclear how memory accessibility plays a role in constructing our experience of and memory for time. Here, we used a combination of behavioral and fMRI measures to ask the question of how memory is incorporated into temporal duration judgments. Behaviorally, we found that event boundaries, which have been shown to disrupt ongoing memory integration processes, result in the temporal compression of duration judgments. Additionally, using a multivoxel pattern similarity analysis of fMRI data, we found that greater temporal pattern change in the left hippocampus within individual trials was associated with longer duration judgments. Together, these data suggest that mnemonic processes play a role in constructing representations of time.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Shisa7 phosphorylation regulates GABAergic transmission and neurodevelopmental behaviors</a></h4>

              
                GABA-A receptors (GABAARs) are crucial for development and regulation of the central nervous system. Altered GABAergic signaling is hypothesized to be involved in the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders. Nevertheless, how aberrant cellular and molecular mechanisms affect GABAARs in these diseases remain elusive. Recently, we identified Shisa7 as a GABAAR auxiliary subunit that modulates GABAAR trafficking, kinetics, and pharmacology, and discovered a phosphorylation site in Shisa7 (S405) critical for extrasynaptic a5-GABAAR trafficking and tonic inhibition. However, the role of S405 phosphorylation in the regulation of synaptic inhibition, plasticity, and behavior remains unknown. Here, we found that expression of a phospho-null mutant (Shisa7 S405A) in heterologous cells and neurons diminishes a2-GABAAR trafficking. Subsequently, we generate a Shisa7 S405A knock-in (KI) mouse line that displays reduced surface expression of GABAARs in hippocampal neurons. Importantly, both synaptic and tonic inhibition are decreased in KI mice. Moreover, chemically induced inhibitory long-term potentiation is impaired, highlighting a critical role of Shisa7 S405 in GABAergic plasticity. Lastly, KI mice exhibit enhanced locomotor activity and grooming associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Collectively, our study reveals a phosphorylation site critical for Shisa7-dependent trafficking of synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAARs which contributes to behavioral endophenotypes displayed in neurodevelopmental disorders.

                Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by monoallelic mutation or deletion in the transcription factor 4 (TCF4) gene. Individuals with PTHS typically present in the first year of life with developmental delay and exhibit intellectual disability, lack of speech, and motor incoordination. There are no effective treatments available for PTHS, but the root cause of the disorder, TCF4 haploinsufficiency, suggests that it could be treated by normalizing TCF4 gene expression. Here we performed proof-of-concept viral gene therapy experiments using a conditional Tcf4 mouse model of PTHS and found that postnatally reinstating Tcf4 expression in neurons improved anxiety-like behavior, activity levels, innate behaviors, and memory. Postnatal reinstatement also partially corrected EEG abnormalities, which we characterized here for the first time, and the expression of key TCF4-regulated genes. Our results support a genetic normalization approach as a treatment strategy for PTHS, and possibly other TCF4-linked disorders.

                Visual inputs to early visual cortex integrate with semantic, linguistic and memory inputs in higher visual cortex, in a manner that is rapid and accurate, and enables complex computations such as face recognition and word reading. This implies the existence of fundamental organizational principles that enable such efficiency. To elaborate on this, we performed intracranial recordings in 82 individuals while they performed tasks of varying visual and cognitive complexity. We discovered that visual inputs induce highly organized posterior-to-anterior propagating patterns of phase modulation across the ventral occipitotemporal cortex. At individual electrodes there was a stereotyped temporal pattern of phase progression following both stimulus onset and offset, consistent across trials and tasks. The phase of low frequency activity in anterior regions was predicted by the prior phase in posterior cortical regions. This spatiotemporal propagation of phase likely serves as a feed-forward organizational influence enabling the integration of information across the ventral visual stream. This phase modulation manifests as the early components of the event related potential; one of the most commonly used measures in human electrophysiology. These findings illuminate fundamental organizational principles of the higher order visual system that enable the rapid recognition and characterization of a variety of inputs.

                Cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease, specifically amnestic (memory dominant) deficits, are associated with cholinergic degeneration in the basal forebrain. The cholinergic nucleus within the basal forebrain, the nucleus basalis of Meynert, exhibits local atrophy and reduced cortical tract integrity on MRI, and reveals amyloid-{beta} and phosphorylated-tau pathology at autopsy. To better understand the pathophysiology of nucleus basalis of Meynert atrophy and its neocortical projections in Alzheimer's disease, we utilized a combined post-mortem in-situ MRI and histopathology approach. A total of 19 Alzheimer's disease (10 amnestic and 9 non-amnestic) and 9 non-neurological control donors underwent 3T T1-weighted MRI for anatomical delineation and volume assessment of the nucleus basalis of Meynert, and diffusion-weighted imaging for microstructural assessment of the nucleus and its projections. At subsequent brain autopsy, tissue dissection and immunohistochemistry were performed for amyloid-{beta}, phosphorylated-tau and choline acetyltransferase. Compared to controls, we observed an MRI-derived volume reduction and altered microstructural integrity of the nucleus basalis of Meynert in Alzheimer's disease donors. Furthermore, decreased cholinergic cell density was associated with reduced integrity of the nucleus and its tracts to the temporal lobe, specifically to the temporal pole of the superior temporal gyrus, and the parahippocampal gyrus. The association between cholinergic cell density and alteration to cortical tracts was specific for amnestic, compared to non-amnestic Alzheimer's disease donors. Our study illustrates that the nucleus basalis of Meynert is severely affected in amnestic Alzheimer's disease, both in terms of pathology within the nucleus, but also in terms of damage to its cortical projections, specifically to the temporal lobe, which may contribute to the observed cognitive deterioration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Learning shapes cortical dynamics to enhance integration of relevant sensory input</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive sensory behavior is thought to depend on processing in recurrent cortical circuits, but how dynamics in these circuits shapes the integration and transmission of sensory information is not well understood. Here, we study neural coding in recurrently connected networks of neurons driven by sensory input. We show analytically how information available in the network output varies with the alignment between feedforward input and the integrating modes of the circuit dynamics. In light of this theory, we analyzed neural population activity in the visual cortex of mice that learned to discriminate visual features. We found that over learning, slow patterns of network dynamics realigned to better integrate input relevant to the discrimination task. This realignment of network dynamics could be explained by changes in excitatory-inhibitory connectivity amongst neurons tuned to relevant features. These results suggest that learning tunes the temporal dynamics of cortical circuits to optimally integrate relevant sensory input.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Involvement of ASIC1a channels in the spinal processing of pain information by deep projection neurons</a></h4>

              
                Dorsal horn of the spinal cord is an important crossroad of pain neuraxis, especially for the neuronal plasticity mechanisms that can lead to chronic pain states. Windup is a well-known spinal pain facilitation process initially described several decades ago, but which exact mechanism is still not fully understood. Here, we combine both ex vivo and in vivo electrophysiological recordings of spinal neurons with computational modelling to demonstrate a role for ASIC1a-containing channels in the windup process. Spinal application of the ASIC1a inhibitory venom peptides mambalgin-1 and psalmotoxin-1 (PcTx1) significantly reduces the ability of deep wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons to develop windup in vivo. All deep WDR-like neurons recorded from spinal slices exhibit an ASIC current with biophysical and pharmacological characteristics consistent with functional expression of ASIC1a/ASIC2 heteromeric channels. A computational model of WDR neuron supplemented with heteromeric ASIC1a/ASIC2 channel parameters accurately reproduces the experimental data, further supporting a positive contribution of these channels to windup. It also predicts a calcium-dependent windup decrease for elevated ASIC conductances, a phenomenon that was experimentally validated using either a combination of calcium-activated potassium channel inhibitory peptides (apamin and iberiotoxin), or the Texas coral snake ASIC-activating toxin (MitTx). This study demonstrates a possible dual contribution to windup of calcium permeable ASIC1a/ASIC2 channels in deep laminae projecting neurons, promoting it upon moderate channel activity, but ultimately leading to calcium-dependent windup inhibition associated to potassium channels when activity increases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Influence of anatomical features of different brain regions on the spatial localization of fiber photometry signals</a></h4>

              
                Fiber photometry is widely used in neuroscience labs for in vivo detection of functional fluorescence from optical indicators of neuronal activity with a simple optical fiber. The fiber is commonly placed next to the region of interest to both excite and collect the fluorescence signal. However, the path of both excitation and fluorescence photons is altered by the uneven optical properties of the brain, due to local variation of the refractive index, different cellular types, densities and shapes. Nonetheless, the effect of the local anatomy on the actual shape and extent of the volume of tissue that interfaces with the fiber has received little attention so far. To fill this gap, we measured the size and shape of fiber photometry efficiency field in the primary motor and somatosensory cortex, in the hippocampus and in the striatum of the mouse brain, highlighting how their substructures determine the detected signal and the depth at which photons can be mined. Importantly, we show that the information on the spatial expression of the fluorescent probes alone is not sufficient to account for the contribution of local subregions to the overall collected signal, and it must be combined with the optical properties of the tissue adjacent to the fiber tip.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamic Cognitive States Predict Individual Variability in Behavior and Modulate with EEG Functional Connectivity during Working Memory</a></h4>

              
                Short-term fluctuations in strategy, attention, or motivation can cause large variability in cognitive performance across task trials. Typically, this variability is treated as noise when analyzing the relationships among behavior, neural activity, and experimentally structured task rules and stimuli. These relationships are thought to remain consistent over repeatedly administered identical task conditions (e.g. trial types and stimuli) while the variability is assumed to be random and to cancel out when averaged across trials and individuals. We propose that the variability carries important information regarding a participant's internal cognitive states, and could provide insights into both intra- and inter-individual differences in performance and its neural bases. However, these states are difficult to quantify, as they are not directly measurable. Therefore, we use a mathematical, state-space modeling framework to estimate internal cognitive states from measured behavioral data to predict each participant's reaction time fluctuations. We can quantify each participant's sensitivity to different factors (e.g. previous performance or distractions) that were predicted to affect cognitive states, and thus become sources of variability. By including a participant's states in the behavioral model, we improved model performance by a factor of 10, over a model with only experimental task parameters. We show how the participant-specific states reflect neural activity by identifying EEG functional connectivity features that modulate with each state. Overall, this approach could better quantify and characterize both individual and population behavioral differences across time, which could improve understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying the interactions among cognitive, strategic and motivational processes affecting behavior.

                Perceptions of others' traits based on social group membership (stereotypes) are known to affect social behavior, but little is known about the neural mechanisms mediating these effects. Here, using fMRI and representational similarity analysis (RSA), we investigated neural representations of others' traits and their contributions to social decision making. Behaviorally, perceptions of others' traits, captured by a two-dimensional framework, biased participants' monetary allocation choices in a context-dependent manner: recipients' perceived warmth increased advantageous inequity aversion and competence increased disadvantageous inequity aversion. Neurally, RSA revealed that stereotypes about others' traits were represented in activity patterns in the temporoparietal junction and superior temporal sulcus, two regions associated with mentalizing, and in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), known to represent latent environmental features during goal-directed outcome inference. Critically, only the latter predicted individual choices, suggesting that the effect of stereotypes on behavior is mediated by inference-based, goal-directed decision-making processes in the OFC.

                Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an increasingly popular method in hearing research. However, few studies have considered efficient stimulation parameters for fNIRS auditory experimental design. The objectives of our study are (1) to characterize the auditory hemodynamic responses to trains of white noise with increasing stimulation durations (8s, 10s, 15s, 20s) in terms of amplitude and response linearity; (2) to identify the most-efficient stimulation duration using fNIRS; and (3) to generalize results to more ecological environmental stimuli. We found that cortical activity is augmented following the increments in stimulation durations and reaches a plateau after about 15s of stimulation. The linearity analysis showed that this augmentation due to stimulation duration is not linear in the auditory cortex, the non-linearity being more pronounced for longer durations (15s and 20s). The 15s block duration that we propose as optimal precludes signal saturation, is associated with a high response amplitude and a relatively short total experimental duration. Moreover, the 15s duration remains optimal independently of the nature of presented sounds. The sum of these findings suggests that 15s stimulation duration used in the appropriate experimental setup allows researchers to acquire optimal fNIRS signal quality.

                Isolation and proteomic profiling of brain cell types, particularly neurons, pose several technical challenges which limit our ability to resolve distinct cellular phenotypes in neurological diseases. Therefore, we generated a novel mouse line that enables cell type-specific expression of a biotin ligase, TurboID, via Cre-lox strategy for in vivo proximity-dependent biotinylation of proteins. Using adenoviral-based and transgenic approaches, we show striking protein biotinylation in neuronal cell bodies and axons throughout the mouse brain. We quantified more than 2,000 neuron-derived proteins following enrichment that mapped to numerous subcellular compartments. Synaptic, transmembrane transporters, ion channel subunits, and disease-relevant druggable targets were among the most significantly enriched proteins. Remarkably, we resolved brain region-specific proteomic profiles of Camk2a neurons with distinct functional molecular signatures and disease associations that may underlie regional neuronal vulnerability. Leveraging the neuronal specificity of this in vivo biotinylation strategy, we used an antibody-based approach to uncover regionally unique patterns of neuron-derived signaling phospho-proteins and cytokines, particularly in the cortex and cerebellum. Our work provides a proteomic framework to investigate cell type-specific mechanisms driving physiological and pathological states of the brain as well as complex tissues beyond the brain.

                The spatial layout of large-scale functional brain networks differs between individuals and is particularly variable in association cortex that has been implicated in a broad range of psychiatric disorders. However, it remains unknown whether this variation in functional topography is related to major dimensions of psychopathology in youth. Capitalizing on a large sample with 27-minutes of high-quality functional MRI data (n=790, ages 8-23 years) and advances in machine learning, we examined associations between functional topography and four correlated dimensions of psychopathology (fear, psychosis, externalizing, anxious-misery) as well as an overall psychopathology factor. We found that functional topography significantly predicted individual differences in dimensions of psychopathology, driven mainly by robust associations between topography and overall psychopathology. Reduced cortical representations of association networks were among the most important features of the model. Our results emphasize the value of considering systematic differences in functional neuroanatomy for personalized diagnostics and therapeutics in psychiatry.

                Microglia are brain-resident immune cells with a repertoire of functions in the developing, mature and pathological brain. Their wide-ranging roles in physiology include the clearance of cellular debris, elimination of excess synapses, regulation of neuronal activity and contributions to blood vessel development. Despite these known roles for microglia, the extent of their interactions with the vasculature and potential regulation of vascular physiology has been insufficiently explored. Here, using in vivo acute and longitudinal two-photon imaging in transgenic mice combined with electron microscopy, fixed tissue immunohistochemistry, pharmacological treatments and laser speckle imaging, we document the steady-state interactions between ramified CX3CR1+ myeloid cell somata and capillaries in the brain. We first confirm that these myeloid cells are bona fide microglia by molecular, morphological and ultrastructural approaches. Then we give a detailed spatio-temporal characterization of these capillary-associated microglia (CAMs) comparing and contrasting them with parenchymal microglia (PCMs) in their static, dynamic and chronic morphological activities including during microglial depletion and repopulation. Molecularly, we identify microglial-specific purinergic P2RY12 receptors as a receptor regulating CAM interactions under the control of released purines from pannexin 1 (PANX1) channels. Furthermore, to elucidate roles for microglia in vascular structure and function, we eliminated microglia and showed that this triggered capillary dilation, blood flow increase, and impaired vasodilative responses. We find that P2RY12-/- and PANX1-/- mice recapitulate these vascular impairments suggesting purines released through PANX1 channels play important roles in activating microglial P2RY12 receptors to regulate neurovascular structure and function.

                Overeating and a sedentary life style are major causes of obesity and related metabolic disorders. Identification of the neurobiological processes that regulate energy balance will facilitate development of interventions for these disorders. Here we show that the Neurotensin-expressing neurons in the mouse IPAC (IPACNts), a nucleus of the central extended amygdala, bidirectionally coordinate hedonic feeding and physical activity, thereby regulating energy balance, metabolic processes and bodyweight. IPACNts are preferentially activated by consumption of highly palatable food or exposure to its taste and smell. Activating IPACNts promotes food intake in a palatability-dependent manner and decreases locomotion. Conversely, inhibiting IPACNts selectively reduces palatable food intake and dramatically enhances physical activity and energy expenditure, and in parallel stimulates physiological responses that oppose diet-induced obesity and metabolic dysfunctions. Thus, a single neuronal population, Neurotensin-expressing neurons in the IPAC, acts to control obesogenic and leptogenic processes by synergistically coordinating energy intake and expenditure with metabolism.

                Machine learning advances in electrochemical detection have recently produced sub- second and concurrent detection of dopamine and serotonin during perception and action tasks in conscious humans. Here, we present a new machine learning approach to sub- second, concurrent separation of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. The method exploits a low amplitude burst protocol for the controlled voltage waveform and we demonstrate its efficacy by showing how it separates dopamine-induced signals from norepinephrine induced signals. Previous efforts to deploy electrochemical detection of dopamine in vivo have not separated the dopamine-dependent signal from a norepinephrine-dependent signal. Consequently, this new method can provide new insights into concurrent signaling by these two important neuromodulators.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reduced expression of the psychiatric risk gene DLG2 (PSD93) impairs hippocampal synaptic integration and plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Background: Genetic variations indicating loss of function in the DLG2 gene have been associated with markedly increased risk for schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, and intellectual disability. DLG2 encodes the postsynaptic scaffolding protein DLG2 (PSD93) that interacts with NMDA receptors, potassium channels, and cytoskeletal regulators but the net impact of these interactions on synaptic plasticity, likely underpinning cognitive impairments associated with these conditions, remains unclear. Methods: Hippocampal CA1 neuronal excitability and synaptic function were investigated in a novel clinically relevant heterozygous Dlg2+/- rat model using ex vivo patch-clamp electrophysiology, pharmacology, and computational modelling. Results: Dlg2+/- rats had increased NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic currents and, conversely, impaired associative long-term potentiation. This impairment resulted from an increase in potassium channel function leading to a decrease in input resistance and reduced supra-linear dendritic integration during induction of associative long-term potentiation. Enhancement of dendritic excitability by blockade of potassium channels or activation of muscarinic M1 receptors with selective allosteric agonist 77-LH-28- 1 reduced the threshold for dendritic integration and 77-LH-28-1 rescued the associative long- term potentiation impairment in the Dlg2+/- rats. Conclusions: Despite increasing synaptic NMDA receptor currents, the combined impact of reduced DLG2 impairs synaptic integration in dendrites resulting in disrupted associative synaptic plasticity. This biological phenotype can be reversed by compound classes used clinically such as muscarinic M1 receptor agonists and is therefore a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sound improves neuronal encoding of visual stimuli in mouse primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                In everyday life, we integrate visual and auditory information in routine tasks such as navigation and communication. While it is known that concurrent sound can improve visual perception, the neuronal correlates of this audiovisual integration are not fully understood. Specifically, it remains unknown whether improvement of the detection and discriminability of visual stimuli due to sound is reflected in the neuronal firing patterns in the primary visual cortex (V1). Furthermore, presentation of the sound can induce movement in the subject, but little is understood about whether and how sound-induced movement contributes to V1 neuronal activity. Here, we investigated how sound and movement interact to modulate V1 visual responses in awake, head-fixed mice and whether this interaction improves neuronal encoding of the visual stimulus. We presented visual drifting gratings with and without simultaneous auditory white noise to awake mice while recording mouse movement and V1 neuronal activity. Sound modulated the light-evoked activity of 80% of light-responsive neurons, with 95% of neurons exhibiting increased activity when the auditory stimulus was present. Sound consistently induced movement. However, a generalized linear model revealed that sound and movement had distinct and complementary effects of the neuronal visual responses. Furthermore, decoding of the visual stimulus from the neuronal activity was improved with sound, an effect that persisted even when controlling for movement. These results demonstrate that sound and movement modulate visual responses in complementary ways, resulting in improved neuronal representation of the visual stimulus. This study clarifies the role of movement as a potential confound in neuronal audiovisual responses, and expands our knowledge of how multi-modal processing is mediated at a neuronal level in the awake brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A vibrissa pathway that activates the limbic system</a></h4>

              
                Vibrissa sensory inputs play a central role in driving rodent behavior. These inputs transit through the sensory trigeminal nuclei, which give rise to the ascending lemniscal and paralemniscal pathways. While lemniscal projections are somatotopically mapped from brain stem to cortex, those of the paralemniscal pathway are more widely distributed. Yet the extent and topography of paralemniscal projections are unknown, along with the potential role of these projections in controlling behavior. Here we used viral tracers to map paralemniscal projections. We find that this pathway broadcasts vibrissa-based sensory signals to brain stem regions that are involved in the regulation of autonomic functions and to forebrain regions that are involved in the expression of emotional reactions. We further provide evidence that GABAergic cells of the Kolliker-Fuse nucleus gate trigeminal sensory input in the paralemniscal pathway via a mechanism of presynaptic or extrasynaptic inhibition.

	<p>Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is a chronic disease that affects ~40 million people worldwide. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) are common in individuals with HIV-1 Infection, and represent a recent public health problem. Here we evaluate the performance of a recently proposed short protocol for detecting HAND by studying 60 individuals with HIV-1-Infection and 60 seronegative controls from a Caribbean community in Barranquilla, Colombia. The short evaluation protocol used significant neuropsychological tests from a previous study of asymptomatic HIV-1 infected patients and a group of seronegative controls. Brief screening instruments, i.e., the Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) and the International HIV Dementia Scale (IHDS), were also applied. Using machine-learning techniques, we derived predictive models of HAND status, and evaluated their performance with the ROC curves. The proposed short protocol performs exceptionally well yielding sensitivity, specificity, and overall prediction values &amp;amp;gt;90%, and better predictive capacity than that of the MMSE and IHDS. Community-specific cut-off values for HAND diagnosis, based on the MMSE and IHDS, make this protocol suitable for HAND screening in individuals from this Caribbean community. This study shows the effectivity of a recently proposed short protocol to detect HAND in individuals with asymptomatic HIV-1-Infection. The application of community-specific cut-off values for HAND diagnosis in the clinical setting may improve HAND screening accuracy and facilitate patients’ treatment and follow-up. Further studies are needed to assess the performance of this protocol in other Latin American populations.</p>

	<p>Visceral fat accumulation is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Visceral fat is a causal risk factor for hypertension and type 2 diabetes, which was reported as one of the risk factors for dementia. Visceral fat areas (VFA) might be clinically important to prevent dementia; however, the association between VFA and cognitive function in the elderly remains unknown. We aimed to evaluate the association between brain structural abnormalities using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and VFA, and the association between cognitive function and VFA, in the elderly. A total of 2364 healthy individuals were enrolled, and we excluded those diagnosed with dementia. Participants were divided into a high-VFA and a low-VFA group based on median VFA. The high-VFA group had significantly lower cognitive function than the low-VFA group (p = 0.025), after adjustment for related factors using a linear regression model. Regarding brain structure in MRI, VFA remained significantly associated with white matter lesions (odds ratio (OR), 1.90; 95% confidence interval (1.33–2.70); adjusted p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and perivascular space (OR, 1.28; 95% confidence interval (1.02–1.61); adjusted p = 0.033). Further follow-up studies are needed, but reducing visceral fat might be important, not only to prevent cardiovascular disease but also to prevent dementia.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Patch-clamp instruments including amplifier circuits and pipettes affect the recorded voltage signals. We hypothesized that realistic and complete <I>in silico</I> representation of recording instruments together with detailed morphology and biophysics of small recorded structures will reveal signal distortions and provide a tool that predicts native, instrument-free electrical signals from distorted voltage recordings. Therefore, we built a model that was verified by small axonal recordings. The model accurately recreated actual action potential (AP) measurements with typical recording artefacts and predicted the native electrical behavior. The simulations verified that recording instruments substantially filter voltage recordings. Moreover, we revealed that instrumentation directly interferes with local signal generation depending on the size of the recorded structures, which complicates the interpretation of recordings from smaller structures, such as axons. However, our model offers a straightforward approach that predicts the native waveforms of fast voltage signals and the underlying conductances even from the smallest neuronal structures.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Localizing Microemboli within the Rodent Brain through Block-Face Imaging and Atlas Registration</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Brain microinfarcts are prevalent in humans, however because of the inherent difficulty of identifying and localizing individual microinfarcts, brain-wide quantification is impractical. In mice, microinfarcts have been created by surgically introducing microemboli into the brain, but a major limitation of this model is the absence of automated methods to identify and localize individual occlusions. We present a novel and semi-automated workflow to identify the anatomic location of fluorescent emboli (microspheres) within the mouse brain through histologic processing and atlas registration. By incorporating vibratome block-face imaging with the QuickNII brain registration tool, we show that the anatomic location of microspheres can be accurately registered to brain structures within the Allen mouse brain (AMB) atlas (e.<I>g</I>., somatomotor areas, hippocampal region, visual areas, etc.). Compared with registering images of slide mounted sections to the AMB atlas, microsphere location was more accurately determined when block-face images were used. As a proof of principle, using this workflow we compared the distribution of microspheres within the brains of mice that were either perfused or immersion fixed. No significant effect of perfusion on total microsphere number or location was detected. In general, microspheres were distributed brain-wide, with the largest density found in the thalamus. In sum, our block-face imaging workflow enables efficient characterization of the widespread distribution of fluorescent microemboli, facilitating future investigation into the impact of microinfarct load and location on brain health.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Psychoses affecting people with epilepsy increase disease burden and diminish quality of life. We characterized postictal psychosis, which comprises about one quarter of epilepsy-related psychoses, and has unknown causation.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a case–control cohort study including patients diagnosed with postictal psychosis, confirmed by psychiatric assessment, with available data regarding epilepsy, treatment, psychiatric history, psychosis profile, and outcomes. After screening 3,288 epilepsy patients, we identified 83 with psychosis; 49 had postictal psychosis. Controls were 98 adults, matched by age and epilepsy type, with no history of psychosis. Logistic regression was used to investigate clinical factors associated with postictal psychosis; univariate associations with a <i>p</i> value &lt; 0.20 were used to build a multivariate model. Polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia were calculated.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Cases were more likely to have seizure clustering (odds ratio [OR] = 7.59, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), seizures with a recollected aura (OR = 2.49, <i>p =</i> 0.013), and a family history of psychiatric disease (OR = 5.17, <i>p</i> = 0.022). Cases showed predominance of right temporal epileptiform discharges (OR = 4.87, <i>p</i> = 0.007). There was no difference in epilepsy duration, neuroimaging findings, or antiseizure treatment between cases and controls. Polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia in an extended cohort of postictal psychosis cases (n = 58) were significantly higher than in 1,366 epilepsy controls (<i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 3%, <i>p</i> = 6 × 10<sup>−3</sup>), but not significantly different from 945 independent patients with schizophrenia (<i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.1%<i>, p</i> = 0.775).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Postictal psychosis occurs under particular circumstances in people with epilepsy with a heightened genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, illustrating how disease biology (seizures) and trait susceptibility (schizophrenia) may interact to produce particular outcomes (postictal psychosis) in a common disease.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Development of a framework for the implementation of synchronous e-mental health: a protocol for a realist synthesis of systematic reviews [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been necessary to deliver mental health care using technologies (e-mental health). But there have been difficulties in its application. Quantitative systematic reviews such as meta-analysis doesn’t allow us to fully identify and properly describe this subject. Thus, our study has two main objectives: a) "to determine what evidence is available for synchronous e-mental health implementation"; and b) "to develop a framework informed by a realist analysis for the implementation of synchronous e-mental health". Methods: We will search MEDLINE, EBM Reviews, PsycINFO, EMBASE, SCOPUS, CINAHL Complete, and Web of Science databases from 1st January 2015 to September 2020, with no language restriction. A systematic review with a narrative description and a realist synthesis will be conducted. Primary studies relating to adults with common mental health problems using any type of mobile mental health intervention that includes a synchronic component and communication with a mental health professional will be included. For the analysis, we will make a realist synthesis of the systematic reviews, using a grounded theory approach with an emergent approach to synthesize the information, prioritizing the systematic reviews with a lower risk of bias in the AMSTAR-2 tool. The realist synthesis will be based on the interpretation, integration, and inference of the evaluated elements and the generation of hypotheses to better understand the implementation process of synchronous e-mental health. Finally, we will present the overall assessment in a Summary of Qualitative Findings table. Conclusion: Our results will allow a better understanding of the facilitator and limitations in implementing e-mental health.
