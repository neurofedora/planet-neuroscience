              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15985">Beat Frequency Induced Transitions in Synchronization Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.15985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In neurosciences, the brain processes information via the firing patterns of connected neurons operating across a spectrum of frequencies. To better understand the effects of these frequencies in the neuron dynamics, we have simulated a neuronal network of Izhikevich neurons to examine the interaction between frequency allocation and intermittent phase synchronization dynamics. As the synchronized population of neurons passes through a bifurcation, an additional frequency mode emerges, enabling a match in the mean frequency while retaining distinct most probable frequencies among neurons. Subsequently, the network intermittently transits between two patterns, one partially synchronized and the other unsynchronized. Through our analysis, we demonstrate that the frequency changes on the network lead to characteristic transition times between synchronization states. Moreover, these transitions adhere to beat frequency statistics when the neurons' frequencies differ by multiples of a frequency gap. Finally, our results can improve the performance in predicting transitions on problems where the beat frequency strongly influences the dynamics.

                arXiv:2511.16432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The big strides seen in generative AI are not based on somewhat obscure algorithms, but due to clearly defined generative principles. The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modelling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.

                arXiv:2511.16465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate simulations of electric fields (E-fields) in brain stimulation depend on tissue conductivity representations that link macroscopic assumptions with underlying microscopic tissue structure. Mesoscale conductivity variations can produce meaningful changes in E-fields and neural activation thresholds but remain largely absent from standard macroscopic models. Recent microscopic models have suggested substantial local E-field perturbations and could, in principle, inform mesoscale conductivity. However, the quantitative validity of microscopic models is limited by fixation-related tissue distortion and incomplete extracellular-space reconstruction. We outline approaches that bridge macro- and microscales to derive consistent mesoscale conductivity distributions, providing a foundation for accurate multiscale models of E-fields and neural activation in brain stimulation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14046">Clarifying the conceptual dimensions of representation in neuroscience</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2403.14046v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the centrality of the notion of representation in neuroscience, the field lacks a unified framework for the concepts used to characterize representation, leading to disparate use of both terminology and measures associated with representation. To offer clarification, we propose a core set of conceptual dimensions that characterize representations in neuroscience. These dimensions describe relations between a neural response, features that may be represented, and downstream effects of the neural response. A neural response may be shown to be sensitive and specific to a feature, invariant to other features, and functional, which means that it is used downstream in the brain. We use information-theoretic measures to introduce these conceptual dimensions unambiguously and explain how data analysis methods such as correlational analyses, decoding and encoding models, representational similarity analysis, and tests of statistical dependence or adaptation relate to our framework. We consider several canonical examples, including the representation of orientation, numerosity, and spatial location, which illustrate how the evidence put forth in support or criticism of representational conclusions is systematized by our framework. By offering a unified conceptual framework we hope to aid the comparison and integration of results across studies and research groups and to help determine when evidence for a representational conclusion is strong.

                arXiv:2504.10875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Music is a universal feature of human culture, linked to embodied cognitive functions that drive learning, action, and the emergence of creativity and individuality. Evidence highlights the critical role of statistical learning an implicit cognitive process of the brain in musical creativity and individuality. Despite its significance, the precise neural and computational mechanisms underpinning these dynamic and embodied cognitive processes re-main poorly understood. This paper discusses how individuality and creativity emerge within the framework of the brain's statistical learning, drawing on a series of neural and computational studies. This work offers perspectives on the mechanisms driving the heterogeneous nature of statistical learning abilities and embodied mechanisms and provides a framework to explain the paradoxical phenomenon where individuals with specific cognitive traits that limit certain perceptual abilities excel in creative domains.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14865">A Tripartite Framework for Understanding the Embodied Mind: A Comprehensive Review of Bodily Map Study</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.14865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: People often speak of being "moved beyond words" when witnessing awe-inspiring natural beauty, experiencing profound moral elevation, or encountering powerful works of art and music. Such moments evoke intensely embodied sensations - a swelling in the chest, a quickened heartbeat, or a sudden stillness that floods the entire body. These experiences are difficult to articulate, yet they are vividly real and spatially anchored in bodily experience. This review examines the emerging method of body mapping, which captures how individuals subjectively localize emotional sensations across the body. Drawing on over two dozen empirical studies, we propose a tripartite framework for understanding the origins of emotional bodily maps: (1) bottom-up physiological signals, (2) top-down behavioral engagement (including motor actions), and (3) conceptual and metaphorical constructions. Crucially, we argue that bodily maps are not mere reflections of physiological monitoring, but expressive interfaces between brain, body, and conceptualization. Because they rely on introspective sensation rather than verbal articulation, bodily maps offer a promising language-independent tool for assessing emotional experience - particularly in cross-cultural research, developmental studies, and clinical contexts where verbal reporting may be limited or unreliable. Ultimately, bodily maps reveal the hidden geography of emotion-those feelings that elude precise definition or verbalization, like being moved beyond words, yet are undeniably real and embodied - offering a compelling window into how emotions are formed, shared, and lived through the body.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05268">System Filter-Based Common Components Modeling for Cross-Subject EEG Decoding</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.05268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology enables direct communication between the brain and external devices through electroencephalography (EEG) signals. However, existing decoding models often mix common and personalized components, leading to interference from individual variability that limits cross-subject decoding performance. To address this issue, this paper proposes a system filter that extends the concept of signal filtering to the system level. The method expands a system into its spectral representation, selectively removes unnecessary components, and reconstructs the system from the retained target components, thereby achieving explicit system-level decomposition and filtering. We further integrate the system filter into a Cross-Subject Decoding framework based on the System Filter (CSD-SF) and evaluate it on the four-class motor imagery (MI) task of the BCIC IV 2a dataset. Personalized models are transformed into relation spectrums, and statistical testing across subjects is used to remove personalized components. The remaining stable relations, representing common components across subjects, are then used to construct a common model for cross-subject decoding. Experimental results show an average improvement of 3.28% in decoding accuracy over baseline methods, demonstrating that the proposed system filter effectively isolates stable common components and enhances model robustness and generalizability in cross-subject EEG decoding.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14872">Maximum entropy models of neuronal populations at and off criticality</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.14872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empirical evidence of scaling behaviors in neuronal avalanches suggests that neuronal populations in the brain operate near criticality. Departure from scaling in neuronal avalanches has been used as a measure of distance to criticality and linked to brain disorders. A distinct line of evidence for brain criticality has come from thermodynamic signatures in maximum entropy (ME) models. Both of these approaches have been widely applied to the analysis of neuronal data. However, the relationship between deviations from avalanche criticality and thermodynamics of ME models of neuronal populations remains poorly understood. To address this question, we study spontaneous activity of organotypic rat cortex slice cultures in physiological and drug-induced hypo- or hyper-excitable conditions, which are classified as critical, subcritical and supercritical based on avalanche dynamics. We find that ME models inferred from critical cultures show signatures of criticality in thermodynamic quantities, e.g. specific heat. However, such signatures are also present, and equally strong, in models inferred from supercritical cultures -- despite their altered dynamics and poor functional performance. On the contrary, ME models inferred from subcritical cultures do not show thermodynamic hints of criticality. Importantly, we confirm these results using an interpretable neural network model that can be tuned to and away from avalanche criticality. Our findings indicate that maximum entropy models correctly distinguish subcritical from critical/supercritical systems. However, they may not be able to discriminate between avalanche criticality and supercriticality, although they may still capture a number of important features from neuronal data.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03972">Measuring and Controlling Solution Degeneracy across Task-Trained Recurrent Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.03972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Task-trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are widely used in neuroscience and machine learning to model dynamical computations. To gain mechanistic insight into how neural systems solve tasks, prior work often reverse-engineers individual trained networks. However, different RNNs trained on the same task and achieving similar performance can exhibit strikingly different internal solutions, a phenomenon known as solution degeneracy. Here, we develop a unified framework to systematically quantify and control solution degeneracy across three levels: behavior, neural dynamics, and weight space. We apply this framework to 3,400 RNNs trained on four neuroscience-relevant tasks: flip-flop memory, sine wave generation, delayed discrimination, and path integration, while systematically varying task complexity, learning regime, network size, and regularization. We find that higher task complexity and stronger feature learning reduce degeneracy in neural dynamics but increase it in weight space, with mixed effects on behavior. In contrast, larger networks and structural regularization reduce degeneracy at all three levels. These findings empirically validate the Contravariance Principle and provide practical guidance for researchers seeking to tune the variability of RNN solutions, either to uncover shared neural mechanisms or to model the individual variability observed in biological systems. This work provides a principled framework for quantifying and controlling solution degeneracy in task-trained RNNs, offering new tools for building more interpretable and biologically grounded models of neural computation.

                arXiv:2511.15987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale neuromorphic architectures consist of computing tiles that communicate spikes using a shared interconnect. The communication patterns in these systems are inherently sparse, asynchronous, and localized, as neural activity is characterized by temporal sparsity with occasional bursts of high traffic. These characteristics require optimized interconnects to handle high-activity bursts while consuming minimal power during idle periods. Among the proposed interconnect solutions, the dynamic segmented bus has gained attention due to its structural simplicity, scalability, and energy efficiency. Since the benefits of a dynamic segmented bus stem from its simplicity, it is essential to develop a streamlined control plane that can scale efficiently with the network. In this paper, we present a design methodology for a scenario-aware control plane tailored to a segmented ladder bus, with the aim of minimizing control overhead and optimizing energy and area utilization. We evaluated our approach using a combination of FPGA implementation and software simulation to assess scalability. The results demonstrated that our design process effectively reduces the control plane's area footprint compared to the data plane while maintaining scalability with network size.

                arXiv:2511.16060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imminent radio telescope observatories provide massive data rates making deep learning based processing appealing while simultaneously demanding real-time performance at low-energy; prohibiting the use of many artificial neural network based approaches. We begin tackling the scientifically existential challenge of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) detection by deploying deep Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on resource-constrained neuromorphic hardware. Our approach partitions large, pre-trained networks onto SynSense Xylo hardware using maximal splitting, a novel greedy algorithm. We validate this pipeline with on-chip power measurements, achieving instrument-scaled inference at 100mW. While our full-scale SNN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among SNN baselines, our experiments reveal a more important insight that a smaller un-partitioned model significantly outperforms larger, split models. This finding highlights that hardware co-design is paramount for optimal performance. Our work thus provides a practical deployment blueprint, a key insight into the challenges of model scaling, and reinforces radio astronomy as a demanding yet ideal domain for advancing applied neuromorphic computing.

                arXiv:2511.16485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Customized static operator design has enabled widespread application of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), but their search performance is transient during iterations and prone to degradation. Dynamic operators aim to address this but typically rely on predefined designs and localized parameter control during the search process, lacking adaptive optimization throughout evolution. To overcome these limitations, this work leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to perceive evolutionary dynamics and enable operator-level meta-evolution. The proposed framework, LLMs for Evolutionary Optimization (LLM4EO), comprises three components: knowledge-transfer-based operator design, evolution perception and analysis, and adaptive operator evolution. Firstly, initialization of operators is performed by transferring the strengths of classical operators via LLMs. Then, search preferences and potential limitations of operators are analyzed by integrating fitness performance and evolutionary features, accompanied by corresponding suggestions for improvement. Upon stagnation of population evolution, gene selection priorities of operators are dynamically optimized via improvement prompting strategies. This approach achieves co-evolution of populations and operators in the search, introducing a novel paradigm for enhancing the efficiency and adaptability of EAs. Finally, a series of validations on multiple benchmark datasets of the flexible job shop scheduling problem demonstrate that LLM4EO accelerates population evolution and outperforms both mainstream evolutionary programming and traditional EAs.

                arXiv:2506.22568v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) often require a trade-off between conflicting objectives, maximizing diversity and convergence in the objective space. This study presents an approach to improve the quality of MOP solutions by optimizing the dispersion in the decision space and the convergence in a specific region of the objective space. Our approach defines a Region of Interest (ROI) based on a cone representing the decision maker's preferences in the objective space, while enhancing the dispersion of solutions in the decision space using a uniformity measure. Combining solution concentration in the objective space with dispersion in the decision space intensifies the search for Pareto-optimal solutions while increasing solution diversity. When combined, these characteristics improve the quality of solutions and avoid the bias caused by clustering solutions in a specific region of the decision space. Preliminary experiments suggest that this method enhances multi-objective optimization by generating solutions that effectively balance dispersion and concentration, thereby mitigating bias in the decision space.

                arXiv:2511.16066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Application of neuromorphic edge devices for control is limited by the constraints on gradient-free online learning and scalability of the hardware across control problems. This paper introduces a synaptic Q-learning algorithm for the control of the classical Cartpole, where the Bellman equations are incorporated at the synaptic level. This formulation enables the iterative evolution of the network topology, represented as a directed graph, throughout the training process. This is followed by a similar approach called neuromorphic Bellman Memory Units (BMU(s)), which are implemented with the Neural Engineering Framework on Intel's Loihi neuromorphic chip. Topology evolution, in conjunction with mixed-signal computation, leverages the optimization of the number of neurons and synapses that could be used to design spike-based reinforcement learning accelerators. The proposed architecture can potentially reduce resource utilization on board, aiding the manufacturing of compact application-specific neuromorphic ICs. Moreover, the on-chip learning introduced in this work and implemented on a neuromorphic chip can enable adaptation to unseen control scenarios.

                arXiv:2511.16201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated algorithm design is entering a new phase: Large Language Models can now generate full optimisation (meta)heuristics, explore vast design spaces and adapt through iterative feedback. Yet this rapid progress is largely performance-driven and opaque. Current LLM-based approaches rarely reveal why a generated algorithm works, which components matter or how design choices relate to underlying problem structures. This paper argues that the next breakthrough will come not from more automation, but from coupling automation with understanding from systematic benchmarking. We outline a vision for explainable automated algorithm design, built on three pillars: (i) LLM-driven discovery of algorithmic variants, (ii) explainable benchmarking that attributes performance to components and hyperparameters and (iii) problem-class descriptors that connect algorithm behaviour to landscape structure. Together, these elements form a closed knowledge loop in which discovery, explanation and generalisation reinforce each other. We argue that this integration will shift the field from blind search to interpretable, class-specific algorithm design, accelerating progress while producing reusable scientific insight into when and why optimisation strategies succeed.

                arXiv:2504.08057v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quality-Diversity algorithms have transformed optimization by prioritizing the discovery of diverse, high-performing solutions over a single optimal result. However, traditional Quality-Diversity methods, such as MAP-Elites, rely heavily on predefined behavior descriptors and complete prior knowledge of the task to define the behavior space grid, limiting their flexibility and applicability. In this work, we introduce Vector Quantized-Elites (VQ-Elites), a novel Quality-Diversity algorithm that autonomously constructs a structured behavior space grid using unsupervised learning, eliminating the need for prior task-specific knowledge. At the core of VQ-Elites is the integration of Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders, which enables the dynamic learning of behavior descriptors and the generation of a structured, rather than unstructured, behavior space grid -- a significant advancement over existing unsupervised Quality-Diversity approaches. This design establishes VQ-Elites as a flexible, robust, and task-agnostic optimization framework. To further enhance the performance of unsupervised Quality-Diversity algorithms, we introduce behavior space bounding and cooperation mechanisms, which significantly improve convergence and performance, as well as the Effective Diversity Ratio and Coverage Diversity Score, two novel metrics that quantify the actual diversity in the unsupervised setting. We validate VQ-Elites on robotic arm pose-reaching, mobile robot space-covering, and MiniGrid exploration tasks. The results demonstrate its ability to efficiently generate diverse, high-quality solutions, emphasizing its adaptability, scalability, robustness to hyperparameters, and potential to extend Quality-Diversity optimization to complex, previously inaccessible domains.

                arXiv:2506.11286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale neuromorphic architectures consist of computing tiles that communicate spikes using a shared interconnect. The communication patterns in such systems are inherently sparse, asynchronous, and localized due to the spiking nature of neural events, characterized by temporal sparsity with occasional bursts of traffic. These characteristics necessitate interconnects optimized for handling high-activity bursts while consuming minimal power during idle periods. Dynamic segmented bus has been proposed a promising interconnect for its simplicity, scalability and low power consumption. However, deploying spiking neural network applications on such buses presents challenges, including substantial inter-cluster traffic, which can lead to network congestion, spike loss, and unnecessary energy expenditure. In this paper, we propose a three-step process to deploy SNN applications on dynamic segmented buses aiming to reduce spike loss and conserve energy. Firstly, we formulate optimization heuristics to mitigate spike loss and energy consumption based on application connectivity. Secondly, we analyze the application traffic to determine spike schedules that minimize traffic flooding. Lastly, we propose a routing algorithm to minimize spike traffic path crossings. We evaluate our approach using a cycle-accurate network simulator. The simulation results show that our algorithms can eliminate spike loss while keeping energy consumption significantly lower compared to conventional NoCs.

                arXiv:2511.13843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional numerical optimization presents a persistent challenge. This paper introduces Quasi-Adaptive Search with Asymptotic Reinitialization (QUASAR), an evolutionary algorithm to accelerate convergence in complex, non-differentiable problems afflicted by the curse of dimensionality.
  Evaluated on the notoriously difficult CEC2017 benchmark suite of 29 functions, QUASAR achieved the lowest overall rank sum (150) using the Friedman test, significantly outperforming L-SHADE (229) and standard DE (305) in the dimension-variant trials. QUASAR also proves computationally efficient, with run times averaging $1.4 \text{x}$ faster than DE and $7.8 \text{x}$ faster than L-SHADE ($p \ll 0.001$) in the population-variant trials.
  Building upon Differential Evolution (DE), QUASAR introduces a highly stochastic architecture to dynamically balance exploration and exploitation. Inspired by the probabilistic behavior of quantum particles in a stellar core, the algorithm implements three primary components that augment standard DE mechanisms: 1) probabilistically selected mutation strategies and scaling factors; 2) rank-based crossover rates; 3) asymptotically decaying reinitialization that leverages a covariance matrix of the best solutions to introduce high-quality genetic diversity.
  QUASAR's performance establishes it as an effective, user-friendly optimizer for complex high-dimensional problems.

                <p>A central mechanism of exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety and trauma-related disorders is fear extinction. However, the mechanisms underlying fear extinction are deficient in some individuals, leading to treatment resistance. Recent animal studies demonstrate that upon omission of the aversive, unconditioned stimulus (US) during fear extinction, dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) produce a prediction error (PE)-like signal. However, whether this VTA-DA neuronal PE-like signal is altered in animals exhibiting deficient fear extinction has not been studied. Here, we used a mouse model of impaired fear extinction [129S1/SvImJ (S1) inbred mouse strain] to monitor and manipulate VTA-DA neurons during extinction. Male DAT-Cre mice backcrossed onto an S1 background (S1-DAT-Cre) exhibited impaired extinction but normal VTA-DA neuron number, as compared with BL6-DAT-Cre mice. In vivo fiber photometry showed that impaired extinction in male S1-DAT-Cre mice was associated with abnormally sustained US omission-related VTA-DA neuronal calcium activity during extinction training and retrieval. Neither in vivo optogenetic photoexcitation of VTA-DA neuronal cell bodies nor their axons in the infralimbic cortex was sufficient to rescue deficient extinction in male S1-DAT-Cre mice, at least within the optogenetic and behavioral parameters used. These data suggest that alterations in the activity of VTA-DA neurons during extinction learning and retrieval may be associated with deficient fear extinction in male S1 mice and could potentially contribute to extinction impairments in patient populations.</p>

                <p>Ongoing efforts over the last 50 years have made data and methods more reproducible and transparent across the life sciences. This openness has led to transformative insights and vastly accelerated scientific progress (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B33">Gra&#x017E;ulis et al., 2012</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B54">Munaf&oacute; et al., 2017</cross-ref>). For example, structural biology (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B12">Bruno and Groom, 2014</cross-ref>) and genomics (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B9">Benson et al., 2013</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B64">Porter and Hajibabaei, 2018</cross-ref>) have undertaken systematic collection and publication of protein sequences and structures over the past half century. These data, in turn, have led to scientific breakthroughs that were unthinkable when data collection first began (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B41">Jumper et al., 2021</cross-ref>). We believe that neuroscience is poised to follow the same path, and that principles of open data and open science will transform our understanding of the nervous system in ways that are impossible to predict at the moment. New social structures supporting an active and open scientific community are essential (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B68">Saunders, 2022</cross-ref>) to facilitate and expand the still limited adoption of open science practices in our field (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B71">Schottdorf et al., 2024</cross-ref>). Unified by shared values of openness, we set out to organize a symposium for open data in neurophysiology (ODIN) to strengthen our community and facilitate transformative open neuroscience research at large. In this report, we synthesize insights from this first ODIN event. We also lay out plans for how to grow this movement, document emerging conversations, and propose a path toward a better and more transparent science of tomorrow.</p>

                Background Accurate staging guides melanoma treatment. Conventional imaging modalities like contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) is widely used but relies on morphology which may miss early spread. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) combines metabolic and anatomic data and may improve detection. Methods We conducted a single-centre retrospective diagnostic accuracy study at a tertiary university hospital in Tunisia (December 2019-February 2024). All adults with histologically confirmed melanoma undergoing whole body 18F-FDG PET/CT as well as CECT for initial staging or restaging were included. The reference standard was histopathology, otherwise composite verification with clinical/imaging follow-up ≥6 months. Outcomes were per-patient sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and accuracy, inter-modality agreement (Cohen’s κ), and management change attributable to 18F-FDG PET/CT. Results Of 51 screened, 35 patients were included (23 staging and 12 restaging). Compared with CECT, 18F-FDG PET/CT reclassified stage in 22/35 (62.9%), upstaging 14 (40.0%) and downstaging 8 (22.9%). For nodal disease, 18F-FDG PET/CT showed higher specificity (95.2%, 95% CI [77.3-99.8] versus 66.7%, 95% CI [44.7–84.4]) and accuracy (88.6%, 95% CI [73.3-96.8], versus 65.7%, 95% CI [47.8-80.9]) with similar sensitivity (78.6%, 95% CI [49.2-95.3] versus 64.3%, 95% CI [35.1-87.2]). For distant metastases, 18F-FDG PET/CT achieved markedly higher sensitivity (92.9%, 95% CI [66.1–99.8] versus 50.0%, 95% CI [23.0-77.0]) and accuracy (91.4%, 95% CI [76.9-98.2] versus 68.6%, CI [50.7-83.1]), with high specificity for both (90.5%, 95% CI [69.6-98.8] versus 81.0%, 95% CI [58.1–94.6]). Agreement with CECT was fair for nodes (κ=0.27) and poor for distant sites (κ=0.16). Management decisions were available in 32/35. 18F-FDG PET/CT changed treatment in 15/32 (46.9%). No adverse events occurred. Conclusions In this first Tunisian series, 18F-FDG PET/CT improved diagnostic performance over CECT, especially for distant metastases, and frequently redirects management. Findings support integrating its integration into melanoma care pathways when results may influence therapy.

                <p>by Jyotika Bahuguna, Timothy Verstynen, Jonathan E. Rubin</p>

All mammals exhibit flexible decision policies that depend, at least in part, on the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic (CBGT) pathways. Yet understanding how the complex connectivity, dynamics, and plasticity of CBGT circuits translate into experience-dependent shifts of decision policies represents a longstanding challenge in neuroscience. Here we present the results of a computational approach to address this problem. Specifically, we simulated decisions during the early learning process driven by CBGT circuits under baseline, unrewarded conditions using a spiking neural network, and fit an evidence accumulation model to the resulting behavior. Using canonical correlation analysis, we then replicated the identification of three control ensembles (<i>responsiveness</i>, <i>pliancy</i> and <i>choice</i>) within CBGT circuits, with each of these subnetworks mapping to a specific configuration of the evidence accumulation process. We subsequently simulated learning in a simple two-choice task with one optimal (i.e., rewarded) target and found that, during early stages of learning, feedback-driven dopaminergic plasticity on cortico-striatal synapses effectively increases reward rate over time. The learning-related changes in the decision policy can be decomposed in terms of the contributions of each control ensemble, whose influence is driven by sequential reward prediction errors on individual trials. Our results provide a clear and simple mechanism for how dopaminergic plasticity shifts subnetworks within CBGT circuits so as to increase reward rate by strategically modulating how evidence is used to drive decisions.

                <p>by Jingjing Tang, Aaron Rumack, Bryan Wilder, Roni Rosenfeld</p>

Epidemic data streams undergo frequent revisions due to reporting delays (“backfill”) and other factors. Relying on tentative surveillance values can seriously degrade the quality of situational awareness, forecasting accuracy and decision-making. We introduce Delphi Revision Forecast (Delphi-RF), a real-time data revision forecasting framework using nonparametric quantile regression, applicable to both counts and proportions (fractions) in public health reporting. By incorporating all available revisions up to a given estimation date, Delphi-RF models revision dynamics and generates distributional forecasts of finalized surveillance values. Applied to daily COVID-19 data (insurance claims, antigen tests, confirmed cases) and weekly dengue and influenza-like illness (ILI) case counts, Delphi-RF delivers accurate revision forecasts, particularly in early reporting stages. In addition, it improves computational efficiency by more than 10-100x compared to existing methods, making it a scalable solution for real-time public health surveillance.

                <p>by Rodolfo Blanco-Rodriguez, Tanya A. Miura, Esteban Hernandez-Vargas</p>

The integration of computational models with experimental data is a cornerstone for gaining insight into biomedical applications. However, parameter fitting procedures often require a vast availability and frequency of data that are challenging to obtain from a single source.
Here, we present a novel methodology called “CrossLabFit”, which is designed to integrate data from multiple laboratories, overcoming the constraints of single-lab data collection. Our approach harmonizes disparate qualitative assessments, ranging from different experimental labs to categorical observations, into a unified framework for parameter estimation. By using machine learning clustering, these qualitative constraints are represented as dynamic “feasible windows” that capture significant trends to which models must adhere. For numerical implementation, we developed a GPU-accelerated version of differential evolution to navigate the cost function that integrated quantitative and qualitative information.
We validate our approach across a series of case studies, demonstrating significant improvements in model accuracy and parameter identifiability. This work opens a new paradigm for collaborative science, enabling a methodological roadmap to combine and compare findings between studies to improve our understanding of biological systems and beyond.

Our software colors the base pairs in each pseudoknot layer, enabling the visualization of pseudoknot distribution within three-dimensional structures. Specifically, users can utilize the PseudoknotVisualizer as a PyMOL extension, applying it directly to RNA molecules loaded in PyMOL. Additionally, a Command Line Interface (CLI) is provided, allowing users to generate coloring commands in Chimera or PyMOL formats, which can then be manually copied and pasted for visualization. By facilitating the clear depiction of pseudoknots in RNA tertiary structures, this tool addresses significant challenges in the identification and visualization of pseudoknots in RNA structural analysis, thereby enhancing research productivity and expanding potential applications in molecular biology.

                <p>by Guillaume Mestdagh, Alexis De Angeli, Christophe Godin</p>

Plant cells control their volume by regulating the osmotic potential of their cytoplasm and vacuole. Water is attracted into the cell as the result of a cascade of solute exchanges between the cell subcompartments and the cell surroundings, which are governed by chemical, electrostatic and mechanical forces. Due to this multi-physics aspect and to couplings between volume changes and chemical effects, modeling these exchanges remains a challenge that has only been partially addressed. As interest for multi-compartment models grows in the plant cell community, this challenge calls for new modeling strategies. In this paper, we introduce an energy-based approach to couple chemical, electrical and mechanical processes taking place between several subcompartments of a plant cell. The contributions of all physical effects are gathered in an energy function, which allows us to derive the equations satisfied by each variable in a systematic way. We illustrate the properties of this modular, unified approach on the modeling of ion and water transport in a guard cell during stoma opening. We represent the stoma opening process as a quasi-static evolution driven by hydrogen pumps in the plasma and vacuolar membranes, and we show that the new formalism explains why the system varies in a particular direction in response to perturbations. Additional numerical simulations allow us to investigate the role of each hydrogen pump in this process. Altogether, we show that this energy-based approach highlights a hierarchy between the forces involved in the system, and to dissect the role of each physical effect in the complex behavior of the system.

                <p>by Matt Combes, Nathan Brown, Robin N. Thompson, Alexander Mastin, Peter Crow, Stephen Parnell</p>

Invasive plant pests and pathogens cause substantial environmental and economic damage. Visual inspection remains a central tenet of plant health surveys, but its sensitivity (probability of correctly identifying the presence of a pest) and specificity (probability of correctly identifying the absence of a pest) are not routinely quantified. As knowing sensitivity and specificity of visual inspection is critical for effective contingency planning and outbreak management, we address this deficiency using empirical data and statistical analyses. Twenty-three citizen scientist surveyors assessed up to 175 labelled oak trees for three symptoms of acute oak decline. The same trees were also assessed by an expert who has monitored these individual trees annually for over a decade. The sensitivity and specificity of surveyors was calculated using the expert data as the ‘gold-standard’ (i.e., assuming perfect sensitivity and specificity). The utility of an approach using Bayesian modelling to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of visual inspection in the absence of a rarely available ‘gold-standard’ dataset was then examined with simulated plant health survey datasets. There was large variation in sensitivity and specificity between surveyors and between different symptoms, although the sensitivity of detecting a symptom was positively related to the frequency of the symptom on a tree. By leveraging surveyor observations of two symptoms from a minimum of 80 trees on two sites, with reliable prior knowledge of sites with a higher (~0.6) and lower (~0.3) true disease prevalence we show that sensitivity and specificity can be estimated without ‘gold-standard’ data using Bayesian modelling. We highlight that sensitivity and specificity will depend on the symptoms of a pest or disease, the individual surveyor, and the survey protocol. This has consequences for how surveys are designed to detect and monitor outbreaks, as well as the interpretation of survey data that is used to inform outbreak management.

Microbiomes influence diverse ecosystems, and viruses increasingly appear to impose key constraints. While viromics has expanded genomic catalogs, host identification for these viruses remains challenging due to the limitations in scaling cultivation-based approaches and the uncertain reliability and relative low resolution of <i>in silico</i> predictions – particularly for understudied viral taxa. Towards this, Hi-C proximity ligation uses sequenced, cross-linked virus and host genomic fragments to infer virus-host linkages and has now been applied in at least 10 studies. However, its accuracy remains unknown. Here we assess Hi-C performance in recovering virus-host interactions using synthetic communities (SynComs) composed of four marine bacterial strains and nine phages with known interactions and then apply optimized bioinformatic protocols to natural soil samples. In SynComs, standard Hi-C sample preparations and analyses showed poor normalized contact score performance (26% specificity, 100% sensitivity, incorrect matches up to class level) that could be dramatically improved by <i>Z</i>-score filtering (<i>Z</i> ≥ 0.5, 99% specificity), though at reduced sensitivity (62% down from 100%). Detection limits were established as reproducibility was poor below minimal phage abundances of 10<sup>5</sup> PFU/mL. Applying optimized bioinformatic protocols to natural soil samples, we compared virus-host linkages inferred from proximity-ligated Hi-C sequencing with predictions generated by <i>in silico</i> homology-based and machine learning-based bioinformatic approaches. Prior to <i>Z</i>-score thresholding, agreement was relatively high at the phylum to family levels (72%), but not at the genus (43%) or species (15%) levels. <i>Z</i>-score thresholding reduced sensitivity (only 34% of predictions were retained), with only modest improvements in congruence with bioinformatic methods (48% or 18% at genus or species levels, respectively). Regardless, this led to 79 genus-level-congruent virus-host linkages and 293 new ones revealed by Hi-C alone, i.e., providing many new virus-host interactions to explore in already well-studied climate-critical soils. Overall, these findings provide empirical benchmarks and methodological guidelines to improve the accuracy and reliability of Hi-C for virus-host linkage studies in complex microbial communities.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003500">Sleep deprivation and sleep intensity exert distinct effects on cerebral vasomotion and brain pulsations driven by the respiratory and cardiac cycles</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sara Marie Ulv Larsen, Sebastian Camillo Holst, Anders Stevnhoved Olsen, Brice Ozenne, Dorte Bonde Zilstorff, Kristoffer Brendstrup-Brix, Pia Weikop, Simone Pleinert, Vesa Kiviniemi, Poul Jørgen Jennum, Maiken Nedergaard, Gitte Moos Knudsen</p>

The flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through the brain is driven by cerebral vasomotion, along with respiratory and cardiac forces. Growing evidence suggests that sleep facilitates this flow, yet the role of homeostatic sleep mechanisms remains largely unknown. In a circadian-controlled sleep and sleep deprivation study in humans, we used accelerated neuroimaging to investigate how sleep pressure and slow-wave-rich sleep affect low-frequency brain pulsations (LFPs; 0.012–0.034 Hz) as well as brain pulsations originating from the respiratory and cardiac cycles. These pulsations cause movement of CSF and brain tissue which may facilitate waste clearance. We also examined the origin of LFPs through pharmacological vasodilation of the cerebral vasculature with the adrenergic antagonist carvedilol in a randomized, cross-over, double-blinded, placebo-controlled design (NCT03576664). We find that sleep deprivation increases LFPs more than nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep does, with LFPs during sleep correlating with cognitive measures of sleep pressure. Conversely, NREM sleep (combined stages N2 and N3) enhances brain pulsations driven by the respiration and cardiac cycles, with more pronounced effects in gray and white matter than in the ventricles. The strength of these brain pulsations escalates with sleep depth (N3 > N2) and correlates with EEG delta power, a measure of slow wave activity. Moreover, carvedilol dampens LFPs, supporting that these reflect cerebral vasomotion. In summary, our findings indicate that heightened sleep pressure promotes vasomotion, whereas slow-wave-rich sleep amplifies respiration- and cardiac-driven brain pulsations, possibly indicating increased CSF flow to the brain. Together, this suggests that homeostatic sleep mechanisms are integral to human brain fluid dynamics and potentially also waste clearance.

                <p>by Shivani Sachdev, Swarnali Roy, Ross W. Cheloha</p>

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of plasma membrane-embedded signaling proteins. These receptors are involved in a wide array of physiological processes, marking them as attractive targets for drug development. Bitopic ligands, which are comprised of a pharmacophore that targets the receptor orthosteric site and a linked moiety that binds to a separate site, have considerable potential for addressing GPCR function. Here, we report the synthesis and evaluation of novel bitopic conjugates consisting of a small molecule pharmacophore that activates the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) linked to antibody fragments (nanobodies, Nbs). This approach leverages the high-affinity and specificity binding of Nbs to non orthosteric sites on engineered A2AR variants to provide bitopic Nb-ligand conjugates that stimulate strong and enduring signaling responses. We further demonstrate that such bitopic conjugates can induce activation by spanning two distinct receptor protomers. This property enables the selective targeting of receptor pairs over either individual receptor, as a form of “logic-gated” activity. We showcase the broad applicability of bitopic conjugates in this context by demonstrating their activity in targeting several pairs of co-expressed receptors, including GPCR monomers from different classes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this dual-targeting strategy initiates signaling responses that diverge from those induced by monovalent ligands. The ability to target receptor pairs using Nb-ligand conjugates offers a powerful strategy with potential for cell type-selective signaling and implications for GPCR drug discovery efforts more broadly.

                <p>Pathogenic <i>DMD</i> variants usually follow the reading-frame rule: out-of-frame changes cause Duchenne muscular dystrophy, whereas in-frame ones produce Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). We report a 23-year-old man with BMD-like weakness, calf hypertrophy, elevated creatine kinase, and dilated cardiomyopathy. A novel hemizygous c.2281delG variant converted an A₄GA₅ motif to A₉, predicting a frameshift; however, Western blot showed ~15% full-length dystrophin. cDNA and polymerse chain reaction (PCR)-free direct RNA sequencing demonstrated transcriptional slippage, adding 1 adenine (A₁₀) that restores the reading frame and dystrophin. This RNA-level rescue of an out-of-frame <i>DMD</i> variant explains the mild phenotype and highlights the importance of transcript-level analysis in dystrophinopathies.

                Fath et al. reveal that BDNF crosses cell membranes via a conserved C-terminal CPP sequence, independently of receptors or energy. Inside cells, BDNF binds KEAP1, promotes NRF2 nuclear translocation, and triggers a cytoprotective response. This evolutionarily conserved receptor-independent pathway enables extracellular BDNF to control cellular defenses beyond a classic neurotrophic role.

MICU2 loss during development results in neuronal overmigration in the cortex and anxiety-like behavior in mice that may contribute to the neurodevelopmental disorder observed in patients with the MICU2 null mutationreported previously.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108282">A stochastic RNA editing process targets a select number of sites in individual Drosophila glutamatergic motoneurons</a></h4>

              
                RNA editing is a post-transcriptional source of protein diversity and occurs across the animal kingdom. Given the complete profile of mRNA targets and their editing rate in individual cells is unclear, single-cell RNA transcriptomes obtained by Patch-seq from <i>Drosophila</i> larval glutamatergic motoneuron subtypes were analyzed to determine the most highly edited targets and identify single neuron editing rules. 316 high-confidence A-to-I canonical RNA edit sites were identified, with 60 causing missense amino acid changes predicted to alter proteins regulating membrane excitability, synaptic transmission, or neuronal function. Twenty-seven canonical sites were edited at &gt;90% frequency as observed for editing of mammalian AMPA receptors. However, most sites were edited at lower levels and generated variable expression of edited and unedited mRNAs, suggesting stochastic editing that may provide a mechanism to fine-tune synaptic function similar to alternative splicing. Noncanonical editing was also found to occur in these neurons, including a C-to-U edit that altered an amino acid in the capsid hinge domain of the synaptic plasticity regulator Arc1. Together, these data provide insights into how the RNA editing landscape may alter protein function to modulate the properties of two well-characterized neuronal populations in <i>Drosophila</i>.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101513">Cholecystokinin modulates age-dependent thalamocortical neuroplasticity</a></h4>

              
                The thalamocortical pathways exhibit neuroplasticity not only during the critical period but also in adulthood. In this study, we investigated how cholecystokinin (CCK) modulates age-dependent thalamocortical plasticity. Our findings demonstrated that CCK is expressed in thalamocortical neurons and that high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the thalamocortical pathway triggers the release of CCK in auditory cortex (ACx), as detected by a CCK sensor. HFS of the medial geniculate body (MGB) induced thalamocortical long-term potentiation (LTP) in wild-type young adult mice. However, knockdown of CCK expression in MGB neurons or blockade of the CCK-B receptor (CCKBR) in the ACx abolished HFS-induced LTP. Interestingly, this LTP could not be elicited in juvenile (3-week-old) or aged mice (over 18-month-old) due to distinct mechanisms: the absence of CCKBR in juveniles and the inability to release CCK in aged mice. Notably, exogenous administration of CCK into the ACx rescued LTP in aged mice and significantly improved frequency discrimination. These findings highlight the potential of CCK as a therapeutic intervention for ameliorating neuroplasticity deficits associated with thalamocortical connectivity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90627">Martinize2 and Vermouth provide a unified framework for molecular topology generation</a></h4>

              
                Ongoing advances in force field and computer hardware development enable the use of molecular dynamics (MD) to simulate increasingly complex systems with the ultimate goal of reaching cellular complexity. At the same time, rational design by high-throughput (HT) simulations is another forefront of MD. In these areas, the Martini coarse-grained force field, especially the latest version (i.e. v3), is being actively explored because it offers an enhanced spatial-temporal resolution. However, the automation tools for preparing simulations with the Martini force field, accompanying the previous version, were not designed for HT simulations or studies of complex cellular systems. Therefore, they become a major limiting factor. To address these shortcomings, we present the open-source <i>Vermouth</i> python library. <i>Vermouth</i> is designed to become the unified framework for developing programs, which prepare, run, and analyze Martini simulations of complex systems. To demonstrate the power of the <i>Vermouth</i> library, the <i>Martinize2</i> program is showcased as a generalization of the <i>martinize</i> script, originally aimed to set up simulations of proteins. In contrast to the previous version, <i>Martinize2</i> automatically handles protonation states in proteins and post-translation modifications, offers more options to fine-tune structural biases such as the elastic network (EN), and can convert non-protein molecules such as ligands. Finally, <i>Martinize2</i> is used in two high-complexity benchmarks. The entire I-TASSER protein template database as well as a subset of 200,000 structures from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database are converted to CG resolution and we illustrate how the checks on input structure quality can safeguard HT applications.

">Pathogenic IgG from long COVID patients with neurological sequelae triggers sensitive but not cognitive impairments upon transfer into mice</a></h4>

              
                Approximately 30% of long COVID patients still experience neurological symptoms (brain fog, pain, chronic fatigue) more than 4 months after the onset of COVID-19. This condition, known as neurological long COVID, remains poorly understood and might be explained by a persisting autoimmune response against nervous-derived self-antigens. The aim of this study is to determine whether IgG autoantibodies from long COVID patients with neurological sequelae can bind to central or peripheral nervous system epitopes and triggers neuropsychiatric symptoms upon passive transfer into mice, thereby mirroring patient-reported manifestations. Long COVID patients meeting the 2021 consensus WHO definition were included following a standardized neuropsychological assessment, while excluding patients with a medical history of autoimmune and neurological disorders. Age- and sex-matched asymptomatic individuals were used as healthy controls. Total IgGs were isolated using protein G purification and injected intraperitoneally into C57Bl6/J mice for four consecutive days. During the two weeks post-injections, behavioral tests assessed mechanical allodynia, thermal hyperalgesia, spatial working memory, depression, and anxiety. Mice injected with IgG from long COVID patients showed no difference with the control group in terms of anxiety or depression behaviors, as well as no impairment of short- or long-term spatial memories and thermal hyperalgesia. However, they displayed a transient decrease of paw withdrawal threshold during the first week. This effect was abolished when IgG-depleted serum or papain-digested IgGs were transferred. IgG from long COVID patients accumulated in the lumbar dorsal root ganglia of injected mice and colocalized with proprioceptive and nociceptive sensory neurons, without inducing local neuroinflammation or astrogliosis. These data demonstrate that IgGs from long COVID patients bind to peripheral sensory neurons and induce pain-related symptoms in mice. Our findings also support the hypothesis that autoantibodies mediate pain-related pathophysiology in the spectrum of long COVID symptoms.

">Developmental deviations of structural connectivity in youths with ADHD predict symptom and treatment outcomes</a></h4>

              
                Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) lacks validated biomarkers to track symptom development or guide treatment selection in youth. We quantified individual deviations from normative age-related trajectories of white-matter structural connectivity (SC) across two independent cohorts: 6,687 typically developing and 1,114 ADHD scans from the ABCD study, and 292 typically developing and 482 ADHD participants from a Chinese cohort. Youth with ADHD showed pronounced SC deviations, especially in higher-order association pathways. A subset of connections showed ADHD-specific developmental reductions in deviations beyond typical developmental patterns, and these changes mediated the age-related decline in ADHD symptoms. Longitudinal within-individual analyses demonstrated that decreases in deviation over two years tracked symptom improvement. Baseline deviations also predicted 12-week treatment response to atomoxetine, but not methylphenidate, and follow-up imaging revealed treatment-related reductions in deviation. Together, these findings identify SC deviation as a robust developmental biomarker with prognostic and theragnostic relevance for ADHD, supporting precision care through risk stratification, individualized pharmacotherapy selection, and objective monitoring of treatment effects.

">Epigenetic editing of Cartpt promotes acquisition and extinction of cocaine memory</a></h4>

              
                In classic disease models, removing a pathological insult restores homeostasis. Yet, addiction persists far beyond the period of active drug use. Cocaine abstinence induces changes in gene expression and neuronal signaling in reward-related brain regions that limit recovery during abstinence. We found that 2 weeks of abstinence increased Cartpt (cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript) in the mouse nucleus accumbens and decreased repressive H3K27me3 at the Cartpt locus. While endogenous CART peptide is best described for its anorexigenic function, it is also implicated in human addiction and dopamine homeostasis. To test the causal relevance of Cartpt chromatin remodeling, we used CRISPR-based epigenetic editing tools, dCas9-FOG1 and dCas9-JMJC-ZF, to manipulate H3K27me3 at Cartpt in vivo. Enriching H3K27me3 in D1 neurons repressed Cartpt expression and augmented acquisition and extinction of cocaine preference. These results show that CRISPR epigenetic editing can recapitulate endogenous chromatin states to modulate addiction-related behavior, highlighting broad therapeutic potential of both Cartpt and epigenetic editing.

">Synchronization of two active ears via binaural coupling</a></h4>

              
                The two ears of many non-mammalian vertebrates are acoustically coupled through an interaural cavity. Sounds can hit both the external and internal surfaces of the tympanic membranes, providing mechanical directional sensitivity for sound localization. This coupling may also give rise to binaural synchronization. In other words, each inner ear could influence the function of the other. Previous work in lizards demonstrates that binaural coupling affects the spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAEs) measured at each external auditory meatus, with properties indicative of binaural synchronization. However, it is unclear how binaural coupling and, consequently, synchronization contribute to SOAE generation, which is typically modelled as being localized to an individual ear. We simultaneously measured SOAEs at both ears of green anole lizards (Anolis carolinensis) and found robust relationships between them, including evidence that binaural synchronization could not be attributed to one ear uniformly driving the other. Instead, we observed frequency-dependent phase-locking between the two ears, primarily at frequencies where SOAE peaks occurred in both ears. While some pairs of ears were more strongly synchronized than others, we consistently found that binaural coupling could have greater effects on the resulting emissions than the coupling between generators within the same ear. We propose a framework for active hearing that incorporates binaural coupling, accounting for its effects on SOAE generation and sound localization in the green anole.

">APOE E4 Alzheimer's Risk Converges on an Oligodendrocyte Subtype in the Human Entorhinal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                The entorhinal cortex (ERC) is implicated in early progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we investigated the impact of established biological risk factors for AD, including APOE genotype (E2 versus E4 alleles), sex, and ancestry, on gene expression in the human ERC. We generated paired spatially-resolved transcriptomics (SRT) and single-nucleus RNA sequencing data (snRNA-seq) in postmortem human ERC tissue from middle aged brain donors with no history of AD. APOE-dependent changes in gene expression predominantly mapped to a transcriptionally-defined oligodendrocyte subtype, which varied substantially with ancestry, and suggested differences in oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. Integration of SRT and snRNA-seq data identified a common gene expression signature associated with APOE genotype, which we localized to the same oligodendrocyte subtype and a white matter spatial domain. This suggests that AD risk in ERC may be associated with disrupted oligodendrocyte function, potentially contributing to future neurodegeneration.

">Neural and Behavioral Responses to Social Norm Violations Across Trust and Fairness Contexts</a></h4>

              
                Fairness and trust are core components of social decision making, yet little is known about how individual differences shape neural responses across these contexts. Because the Trust Game (TG) and Ultimatum Game (UG) involve different forms of norm violation, betrayal and interpersonal unfairness, they allow us to test whether neural responses generalize across social contexts Using fMRI during both the TG and UG, we examined how trait-level social cognition interacts with brain systems supporting norm evaluation. Participants demonstrated robust sensitivity to fairness in the Ultimatum Game. A whole-brain psychophysiological interaction analysis revealed that connectivity between the posterior temporoparietal junction (pTPJ) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) during unfair offers from a human partner was moderated by the interaction between Autism Quotient (AQ) scores and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) response to betrayal in the Trust Game. Individuals with higher AQ showed distinct patterns of pTPJ-dlPFC coupling depending on their neural sensitivity to trust violations. These findings highlight a cross-task mechanism through which trait-level social cognition and trust related conflict signals shape network-level responses to interpersonal unfairness.

">Age-Dependent Effects of Paraquat-Induced Parkinsonism on Serum Alpha-Synuclein Expression, Substantia Nigra Histoarchitecture and Neurobehaviour in Male Wistar Rats</a></h4>

              
                Background Paraquat (PQ), a widely used herbicide, has been implicated in Parkinsons disease (PD)-like neurodegeneration through oxidative stress and alpha-synuclein (a-syn) dysregulation. Age is a critical determinant of vulnerability to neurotoxins. This study investigated age-dependent effects of paraquat-induced Parkinsonism on serum a-syn expression, substantia nigra histoarchitecture, and neurobehavior in male Wistar rats. Methods Sixty-three male Wistar rats were stratified into juvenile, young-adult, and adult cohorts and assigned to control, paraquat, or PQ+Recovery groups (n = 7). Paraquat (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered twice weekly for three weeks; recovery animals were monitored for two months. Neurobehavioral tests including hanging wire, open field, and Y-maze were conducted at baseline, post-exposure, and post-recovery. Serum and substantia nigra a-syn were quantified using ELISA, and histology assessed cytoarchitectural changes. Data were analyzed using t-tests and ANOVA (p is less than or equal to 0.05). Results Neurobehavioral outcomes showed no significant differences in spontaneous alternation across cohorts. Latency-to-fall remained stable in young-adult and juvenile rats but declined in adult PQ+Recovery animals (p = 0.05). Line crossings decreased in adult paraquat rats (p = 0.02). Urine pools decreased significantly in young-adult paraquat (p = 0.0010) and PQ+Recovery groups (p = 0.0016), with group effects in young-adult (p = 0.007) and juvenile cohorts (p = 0.047). Substantia nigra a-syn showed no significant differences (p > 0.22); serum a-syn differed in young adults (p = 0.039), with reduced levels in the recovery group (p = 0.047). Histology revealed paraquat-induced neuronal degeneration which was most severe in adults, and partial structural restoration after recovery period. Conclusion Paraquat induces mild, age-dependent neurotoxic effects, with adults showing the greatest vulnerability. Differential serum a-syn responses and histological findings highlight developmental stage as a key modulator of susceptibility and recovery following environmental neurotoxin exposure.

">Cumulative timing-dependent changes in corticospinal excitability during suprathreshold paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is widely used to assess inhibitory and facilitatory circuits within the primary motor cortex. However, accumulating evidence suggests that even brief TMS paradigms may induce unintended changes in corticospinal excitability. Here, we examined whether suprathreshold paired-pulse TMS delivered at inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) associated with intracortical facilitation or long-interval cortical inhibition (LICI) elicits cumulative changes in motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude. In experiment 1, we reanalysed data from 17 participants who received 20 suprathreshold paired-pulses at eight ISIs (10-200 ms) and 40 unconditioned single pulses. Stimulation was pseudo-randomised and distributed evenly across four blocks. A linear mixed-effects model assessed trial-wise changes in MEP amplitude across ISIs. We replicated the design in an independent sample (n=10, experiment 2). A significant trial-by-ISI interaction was observed in both cohorts. Specifically, MEP amplitudes increased across trials for ISIs of 20 and 30 ms (p<0.05), but remained stable at LICI-related ISIs (100-150 ms). A similar increase was also seen with single-pulse TMS. These findings demonstrate that suprathreshold paired-pulse TMS at short ISIs can cumulatively enhance corticospinal excitability during stimulation. Furthermore, the results suggest potential for using these protocols not just for probing cortical circuits, but also as interventions to modulate motor system excitability.

">Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation enhances emotional bias towards happiness in healthy young adults: A comparative study of electrical and ultrasound stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) is an emerging neuromodulation technique demonstrating promise in emotional regulation. This study investigated the acute effects of both electrical (E-taVNS) and ultrasound (U-taVNS) modalities on emotional bias using a facial emotion categorization task in healthy young adults. Fifty-nine participants underwent a single-blind, sham-controlled, within-subject design, with emotional bias assessed at pre-, during-, and post-stimulation phases. Our findings revealed that both E-taVNS and U-taVNS significantly enhanced emotional bias scores, shifting the perception of neutral and ambiguous faces towards positive interpretations and reducing negative emotional bias. No significant differences in efficacy were observed between the two stimulation modalities. Furthermore, individual differences in interoceptive awareness were found to be associated with the observed taVNS effects. These results suggest that both electrical and ultrasound taVNS can acutely modulate emotional regulation, highlighting the potential of taVNS as a non-invasive, well-tolerated alternative for interventions targeting emotional bias and mood disorders.

">Gut metabolite IPA alleviates white matter injury post-ICH by enhancing myelin debris phagocytosis via Stap1 inhibition</a></h4>

              
                Background: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) causes neurological dysfunction and white matter injury (WMI) characterized by myelin loss, axonal injury and myelin debris accumulation. Microglia-mediated debris clearance is critical for WMI repair. The microbiota-gut-brain axis plays an essential role in the central nervous system diseases, one of the ways in which gut microbiota affects brain is via producing metabolites. Indole-3-proprionic acid (IPA), a tryptophan-derived metabolite that mainly produced by Clostridium sporogenes, exhibits anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. However, its effect on ICH remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the IPA level after ICH and the therapeutic effects of IPA on neurological deficits and WMI, as well as the potential mechanisms underlying IPA-mediated neuroprotection. Methods: An ICH model was established using C57BL/6 mice, which then received intragastric IPA (20 mg/kg/day). Fecal abundance of IPA-related genes and IPA levels in feces and plasma were measured by qPCR and UPLC-MS/MS. Behavioral tests, qPCR, and immunofluorescence staining were used to assess neurological function, myelin integrity, and axonal injury. In vitro, BV2 microglia, with or without Stap1 knockdown, were co-cultured with myelin debris to assess IPA?s effects on phagocytosis. Additionally, targeted plasma IPA profiling was performed in 30 ICH patients and 30 matched healthy controls. Results: The relative abundance of IPA production-related genes and IPA levels in feces and plasma were significantly decreased after ICH and remained low into the chronical phase. After IPA administration, the neurological deficits, myelin loss and axonal injury of mice with ICH were significantly improved. In vitro, IPA increased BV2 microglia myelin debris phagocytosis by inhibiting Stap1 expression. IPA levels were significantly reduced in ICH patients, consistent with ICH mouse model. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrated that the gut microbiota-derived metabolite IPA could facilitate neurological deficits recovery and alleviate WMI, which could be a promising therapeutic strategy to improve ICH prognosis.

">Independent Filter Analysis for Group Discrimination in fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Traditional group-level fMRI analysis approaches, such as Independent Component Analysis (ICA), often rely on unsupervised dimensionality reduction to map subjects into a common feature space. While effective for capturing common variance across all subjects, the preservation of discriminative features between groups of participants is not guaranteed. To address this limitation, we introduce Independent Filter Analysis (IFA), a supervised extension of group ICA that explicitly models group-discriminative information as part of the dimensionality reduction steps. Prior to unmixing, IFA constructs a subspace that simultaneously retains both shared and group-specific information, enhancing sensitivity to group effects while preserving biological interpretability. We validated IFA using simulated data and paired condition comparisons from three Human Connectome Project (HCP) tasks. In the simulation, IFA achieved 95% classification accuracy, outperforming group ICA, which failed to detect subtle group differences. On the HCP data, IFA increased network matrix classification accuracy by up to 15% and produced spatial maps that more precisely reflected task-relevant differences.

">MExConn: A Mechanistically Interpretable Multi-Expert Framework for Multi-Organelle Segmentation in Connectomics</a></h4>

              
                Electron microscopy (EM) provides subcellular resolution which has made it a critical tool in fields such as cellular biology and connectomics. However, manual annotation of subcellular organelles in these EM images is extremely labor-intensive and impractical at scale. While computational segmentation methods have been developed, most existing approaches are limited to segmenting a single organelle at a time, neglecting the inherent shared information present in EM images containing multiple organelles. To address this, we present MExConn, the first known interpretable multi-expert U-Net architecture in the connectomics field that employs a shared encoder and multiple decoder heads to simultaneously segment multiple organelles from the same input EM image. MExConn significantly outperforms five baselines, including single-organelle model and four state of-the-art connectomics segmentation models in all evaluation metrics, reducing the Variation of Information by up to 33.54% on average across organelles. A key novelty of our approach is that MExConn offers mechanistic interpretability by revealing that the shared encoder learns shared representations essential for accurately segmenting multiple organelles. Through systematic analysis of encoder gradients with respect to each decoder output, we identify channel-wise importance profiles and reveal that many encoder channels are jointly essential for all organelles, while others are organelle-specific. Rigorous experiments on three connectomics datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MExConn in both segmentation performance and interpretability, establishing it as a principled approach for multi-organelle analysis in connectomics. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/abrarrahmanabir/MExConn.

">Impact of the pulse artifact on evoked activity in human wakefulness and sleep</a></h4>

              
                The investigation of the neural evoked response to the heartbeat quantified using electroencephalography (i.e., heartbeat evoked potentials or HEPs), has gained recent attention in neuroscience, notably as a measure of interoception, the sensory system responding to internal bodily states. One main challenge in measuring HEPs is their susceptibility to cardiac artifacts contamination, including the cardiac field artifact and the pulse artifact (PA), the latter possibly caused by the mechanical pressure of pulsating vessels. Here, we aimed at assessing the impact of PAs on HEPs and auditory evoked potentials (AEPs, a proxy of the neural responses to exteroceptive sensory stimuli). To this aim, we compared two pre-processing pipelines using independent component analysis in healthy volunteers (N=30). The first, standard, pipeline excluded ocular, muscle, sweating-related activity and cardiac-related activity stemming from the cardiac field artifact. The second, pairwise phase consistency (PPC) pipeline, in addition to the removal of the aforementioned components, used the quantitative metric of PPC between independent components and the ECG to remove the cardiac-related PA. We tested how these two pre-processing approaches influenced HEPs and AEPs recorded under diverse neurophysiological conditions (wakefulness, N2, N3, and REM sleep). Comparing the HEPs from the standard and the PPC approaches (cluster-based permutation statistics, p<0.05, two-tailed) revealed a significant effect of PAs, particularly in wakefulness, followed by REM and N2 sleep, with Cohen's d effect sizes of 1.92, 0.95 and 0.88, respectively. By contrast, PA correction had a negligible effect (p>0.05, two-tailed) on the HEPs in N3 sleep and on the AEPs in all vigilance states. Our results emphasize the need to account for the PA as a significant confounding factor when comparing HEPs across groups with varying vascular or cardiac conditions.

">Unveiling the Multifaceted Networks of the Left DLPFC for Precision TMS Targeting</a></h4>

              
                The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (lDLPFC) is the standard target for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to ameliorate treatment-resistant depression (TRD), yet non-response rates remain high. TMS efficacy has been linked to the stimulation site's functional connectivity, particularly its anti-correlation with the subgenual cingulate cortex (SGC). While this pragmatic strategy has demonstrated clinical utility, it offers limited insight into how the lDLPFC's network interactions contribute to site-dependent variability in treatment response. Here, we used connectivity-based parcellation within an lDLPFC region encompassing common TMS targets and adjacent areas to delineate functional subdivisions and characterize their connectivity to large-scale networks and behavioral associations. Our results revealed a hierarchical organization: a coarse two-pole antagonism between anterior-central and superior-posterior subregions and a finer nine-cluster architecture exposing lDLPFC's heterogeneity along anterior-posterior and ventral-dorsal axes. Anterior-central areas were strongly anti-correlated with SGC and default-mode network, positively connected with salience, dorsal attention, and control networks, and associated with cognitive control. In contrast, superior-posterior subregions displayed the inverse pattern, while ventral clusters engaged somatomotor and visual networks, and language-related processes. Central and superior-anterior clusters showed differentiated profiles, including associations with inhibition, social cognition, and perceptual functions. To aid clinical translation, we derived an lDLPFC likelihood map integrating granularities, highlighting anterior-central lDLPFC as the strongest TMS candidate considering the relevance of its connectivity and behavioral profiles to depression, while indicating that neighboring subregions have distinct functions. These findings underscore the lDLPFC's hierarchical and heterogeneous organization and provide a network-informed reference for developing individualized, symptom-specific TMS interventions.

                The hippocampus is a heterogeneous structure with cytoarchitectonically distinct subfields that exhibit heterogeneous lifespan trajectories and are differentially susceptible to diseases. Advances in high-resolution imaging have accelerated research on these structures, yet variability in segmentation protocols limits cross-study comparability. The Hippocampal Subfields Group (HSG) is an international consortium addressing this challenge by developing a reliable, accessible, and freely available segmentation protocol for high-resolution T2-weighted 3 tesla MRI scans (http://www.hippocampalsubfields.com). Here, we present the harmonized protocol for the posterior portion of the hippocampus (the 'tail'), complementing the previously established 'body' protocol, and with an anterior 'head' protocol under development. The tail protocol provides standardized definitions of the external boundaries for the posterior-most extent of the hippocampus, facilitating consistent segmentation from surrounding tissues. The research community was extensively involved through an online survey that incorporated comprehensive protocol details, feasibility assessments, tutorial videos, and illustrative segmentations. Through this collaborative process, consensus emerged to exclude subfield labeling in the hippocampal tail due to limited visibility of internal landmarks and substantial anatomical variability in this region. All proposed boundary guidelines were deemed clear and agreed upon via a Delphi procedure. The harmonized tail protocol has high intra- (Averaged ICC(2,1) > 0.98; Averaged Dice Similarity Coefficient = 0.92) and inter-rater reliability (Averaged ICC(2,k) > 0.98; Averaged Dice Similarity Coefficient = 0.86) and offers a practical framework for replicable segmentation. By establishing standardized guidelines, this protocol enhances comparability of findings across developmental, aging, and clinical research and is compatible with ongoing technological advances.

">Adult Drosophila aversion to caffeine requires a unique TrpA1 isoform and the PLC signaling cascade</a></h4>

              
                Taste in Drosophila melanogaster is crucial to survival, influencing feeding, mating, and egg laying behaviors. Taste organs are located on various parts of the body, including the legs, proboscis, wings, and ovipositor. Taste neurons detect chemicals via receptors like GRs, IRs, and TRPs, with bitter and sweet tastes linked to specific neurons (Gr66a+ and Gr5a+). Bitter substances such as caffeine activate neurons, resulting in rejection behavior. TrpA1 channels, associated with aversive responses, are involved in complex behaviors and could interact with taste receptors. Our results show that caffeine mixed with sucrose reduces proboscis extension in flies compared to sucrose alone, a response that requires only the TrpA1-E isoform out of the five possible ones. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that this avoidance requires TrpA1 and signaling via PLC and IP3-receptors in adult Gr66a+ neurons.

">COSTS AND BENEFITS OF ACTING TOGETHER: A NON-HUMAN PRIMATE MODEL OF COOPERATIVE DECISION-MAKING</a></h4>

              
                Cooperation is a crucial aspect of social behavior, allowing individuals to achieve goals unattainable alone. However, collective actions require costly inter-individual coordination, making continuous cost-benefit evaluation essential before engaging in cooperation. Non-human primate models can help uncover the evolutionary foundations of human cooperation and its underlying neural mechanisms. To this aim, we developed a novel paradigm to analyze the dyadic behavior of two macaques, who took turns in choosing between individual and cooperative actions to obtain variable rewards. Each monkey used a joystick to guide a cursor toward one of two targets, each indicating both the reward magnitude and the action type (i.e. 'solo action' or 'joint action') required to obtain their payoff. We first observed a linear improvement in dyadic performance with the expected reward magnitude. Although macaques tended to prefer individual actions, they selected to act jointly under favorable payoff conditions, indicating that voluntary cooperation in macaques can emerge as a reward-driven process. Logistic models of their choices revealed the subjective cost monkeys assigned to cooperation, which was consistent across subjects. Nonetheless, the gain rate across different sessions increased over time, suggesting that macaques possess the cognitive ability to optimize their dyadic strategies, by estimating not only the coordination costs but also the benefits of cooperation. We observed a progressive reduction in the subjective cost assigned to joint action, which was not directly dependent on performance improvements. Our findings suggest that non-human primates can weigh the costs and benefits of cooperation, highlighting their ability to dynamically adjust social strategies based on reward contingencies.

">Comparing Methods for Mass Univariate Analyses of Human EEG: Empirical Data and Simulations</a></h4>

              
                Electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely used method for investigating human brain dynamics. However, EEG analyses are frequently conducted with limited a priori knowledge regarding locations or latencies of meaningful statistical effects. This makes it difficult for researchers to form regions of interest (ROIs), which are then analyzed using traditional statistical models such as analysis of variance. In addition, exploratory studies, or studies interested in determining the exact temporal and spatial extent of a predicted effect may aim to examine many sensor locations and time points, often jointly. To address this, mass univariate analyses have become a valuable complement to ROI-based approaches. These methods attempt to correct for multiple comparisons while mitigating the risk of false positives and false negatives, thus enabling statistical inference in high-dimensional EEG data. Here, we review and evaluate different approaches for delineating spatial and temporal effect boundaries in three different datasets, focusing on within-subjects comparisons. Specifically, we focus on permutation-based approaches and their Bayesian alternatives to address condition differences in i) steady-state evoked responses, ii) event-related potentials, and iii) time-frequency data. Overall, simulation results indicate that cluster-based permutation tests provide a relatively liberal approach to correct for multiple comparisons across domains, with high sensitivity for detecting large effects. In contrast, the permutation-based tmax procedure yields the most conservative method across datasets. Bayesian approaches inherently are continuous in nature and thus strongly depend on the selection of thresholds for when support for a hypothesis is considered meaningful.

">Silmitasertib, an FDA-designated orphan CK2 Inhibitor, ameliorates neuropathology and motor dysfunction in a Huntington's disease mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease that manifests with progressive motor, cognitive, and psychological impairments. HD is caused by a polyQ (CAG) repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene, leading to the misfolding and aggregation of mutant HTT protein (mHTT) and the preferential degeneration of the striatum. Previously in our lab, we identified Protein Kinase CK2 as an important kinase involved in the pathophysiology of HD. Specifically, the alpha prime catalytic subunit of CK2 (CK2') is upregulated in HD, and genetic depletion of CK2' in HD mice results in improved motor behavior, decreased mutant Htt aggregation, and improved neuronal function. Silmitasertib (CX-4945) is an FDA designated orphan drug that inhibits CK2. This study aims to investigate whether CX-4945 treatment ameliorates HD pathology. We treated prodromal and late symptomatic HD mice, and used a variety of immunohistochemical, biochemical, physiological and behavioral approaches. We found that CX-4945 presented benefits in the amelioration of HD pathophysiology in both treated groups. Importantly, we found CX-4945 decreased mHtt aggregation, increased DARPP-32 expression and excitatory synapse density, restored homeostatic astrocyte phenotypes and ameliorated neuroinflammation and microgliosis, altogether resulting in improved motor behavior. These results support CX-4945 as a strong candidate for a targeted therapy to treat HD.

">A 4-pole Theory-Based Compensation Method using Multiple Loads for Impedance Spectroscopy of Porcine Brain Tissue</a></h4>

              
                Accurate determination of the electrical properties of brain tissue -conductivity and relative permittivity - is essential for modeling and optimizing neurostimulation and neuroimaging and modulation techniques such as EEG, MEG, TMS, and TES. However, large discrepancies in reported conductivity values highlight the methodological challenges associated with impedance measurements. In this study, we present a systematic evaluation of compensation methods in impedance spectroscopy to improve measurement accuracy using a self-developed four-point platinum electrode designed for biological tissue applications. Three compensation algorithms - open-short, open-short-load, and multiple-load - were implemented and compared using an RC parallel test circuit that emulated typical measurement conditions, with load resistances ranging from 250 Ohm to 5000 Ohm. Quantitative error analysis demonstrated that the multiple-load method achieved the lowest normalized root mean square error (3.4%) and superior stability across frequencies from 100 Hz to 1 MHz. The calibrated probe was subsequently applied to post mortem porcine brain tissue, yielding conductivity values of grey matter of 0.109 S/m and white matter of 0.074 S/m. These results are significantly lower than standard simulation parameters of 0.275 S/m, and 0.126 S/m for grey and white matter, respectively. Finite-element simulations revealed that using the measured conductivities increased electric field predictions by 2.1% for TMS and 46% for TES in the maximum electric field magnitude, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that accurate impedance compensation is critical for reliable characterization of brain tissue and for enhancing the precision of neurostimulation modeling in the future.

">A New Method for Optimal Placement of Tumor Treating Fields Electrodes</a></h4>

              
                Overview: Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) provide a non-invasive treatment option for newly diagnosed glioblastoma. While optimization of electrode placement is important to increase treatment efficacy, clinical therapy planning is done using an undisclosed and proprietary software (NovoTAL), which is clinically unvalidated. This study investigates a new computational approach for optimizing TTFields electrode placement and is compared to the current clinical standard. Methods: We developed a new computational pipeline integrating patient-specific anatomical data to optimize electrode configurations in five representative glioblastoma cases with diverse tumor locations and sizes. Two optimization strategies were employed: one maximizing electric field intensity at the tumor, and another enhancing coverage of the adjacent brain while maintaining sufficient tumor intensity. Results were compared to electrode placements generated by NovoTAL. Additional simulations with artificial tumors assessed the effects of tumor size and location. Results: Optimized electrode placements improved electric field intensity in tumors by 18%-34% compared to the clinical standard. Coverage-weighted optimizations provided broader field coverage without significantly compromising tumor intensity. Smaller or surface-adjacent tumors benefited most from optimization, achieving precise targeting and enhanced coverage. Extensive randomized placement analyses highlighted the superior performance of the optimized configurations. Analysis of artificial models showed consistent improvements across varying tumor locations and sizes. Conclusion: Personalized optimization of TTFields electrode placement significantly improves electric field targeting of tumors and adjacent brain regions. This approach outperforms standardized planning software and clinical practices and supports future development of adaptive, automated strategies for individualized TTFields therapy in glioblastoma.

">Longitudinal Exploration of Auditory Sensory-Perceptual Processing in CLN3 Disease (Juvenile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (Batten disease)): A High-Density Auditory Evoked Potential (AEP) Study.</a></h4>

              
                Background: There is currently limited information about sensory and perceptual abilities across the progression of CLN3 disease (Juvenile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis; Batten disease), a recessively inherited lysosomal storage disorder and a leading cause of childhood neurodegeneration. Clinical symptoms include vision loss, motor impairments, and cognitive challenges, making it difficult to accurately assess neurocognitive and perceptual abilities. Thus, there is a critical need to identify objective biomarkers that can be used to inform disease progression and track treatment response in this population. Methods: This exploratory study investigates longitudinal changes in auditory sensory perceptual processing in a small sample of individuals with genetically confirmed CLN3 disease (N=4; 3 male) compared to a cross-sectional sample of 60 neurotypical (NT) controls using high-density electroencephalography (EEG). We utilized a duration mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigm, identical to what has been used in our previous cross-sectional study. We examined the auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) of the standard tones across three different stimulus onset asynchrony conditions and examined the N1 and P2 components of the AEP. Results: We found age related differences in the amplitudes of the N1 and P2 components in individuals with CLN3 disease relative to NT controls. These amplitude differences were most notable in CLN3 disease when participants were presented with standard tones that had the slowest presentation rate. Specifically, N1 and P2 amplitudes were more negative than NT controls in childhood and adolescence and as CLN3 disease participants aged, the amplitude of the AEPs was greater than controls. Further, a more positive N1 amplitude during the longest stimulus presentation condition was associated with both reduced verbal intelligence and working memory abilities in CLN3 disease participants. Conclusions: Our preliminary findings parallel recently published work in a mouse model of CLN3 disease that showed both sex- and age-dependent disruptions in central auditory processing. Taken together, we demonstrate the utility of auditory EEG measures as a sensitive, objective and translational measure in CLN3 disease that may serve as a potential outcome measure useful in tracking disease progression. Continued work is needed in humans focused on sex-based differences and longitudinal changes of auditory processing in CLN3 disease.

">A validated panel of commercial antibodies for reliable detection of FET proteins.</a></h4>

              
                The FET protein family comprises the highly conserved RNA-binding proteins FUS, EWS and TAF15 which are implicated in RNA metabolism and neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS and FTLD. Despite their structural similarity, reliable detection of individual FET proteins remains challenging due to antibody cross-reactivity and inconsistent localisation patterns reported in the literature. To address this, we systematically evaluated 23 commercially available antibodies for specificity and performance across western blotting, immunocytochemistry, and immunohistochemistry. Using single and double shRNA knockdowns in HeLa cells, we confirmed target engagement and identified antibodies which were specific as well as those with significant cross-reactivity. Immunofluorescence in rat primary neurons and HeLa cells showed antibody and cell type dependent variations in nuclear and cytoplasmic localisation; from these, we identified a subset that demonstrated high-quality, region-specific staining in postmortem human brain tissue. Our findings highlight substantial variability in antibody performance and underscore the need for rigorous validation to ensure reproducibility in FET protein research. We present a validated panel of antibodies suitable for diverse applications, providing a critical resource for studies of FET protein biology and pathology.

">N6-methyladenosine RNA methylation is a novel epitranscriptomic regulator of excessive alcohol drinking and vulnerability to relapse</a></h4>

              
                While internal RNA modifications have been known for decades, the contribution of epitranscriptomics to alcohol use disorder (AUD) remains unexplored. Here we investigated, for the first time, the role of the most abundant mRNA modification, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in the regulation of alcohol drinking and alcohol mediated gene expression. The fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) plays a key role in erasing m6A RNA methylation marks. We generated brain m6A hypermethylated mice with selective deletion of FTO in neurons by crossing FTO-floxed mice (FTO-fl/fl) with the synapsin-1-CRE deleter line (Syn1-CRE). Neuronal FTO-deficient mice showed enhanced initial motivation for alcohol, achieved escalated (dependent) drinking more rapidly after repeated cycles of alcohol intoxication and were more susceptible to relapse to heavy drinking following a period of abstinence. Alcohol-naive neuronal FTO-deficient mice exhibited potentiated alcohol-induced anxiolytic and sedative effects and blunted anxiogenic responses, despite unaltered alcohol metabolism. We carried out RNA-Seq of enriched methylated RNA by immunoprecipitation (MeRIP) and RNA-Seq profiling of unenriched RNA to study alcohols effect on the epitranscriptomic and transcriptional landscape. We observed that a history of alcohol intoxication induces robust RNA m6A hypermethylation in the hippocampus and that FTO-deficiency markedly alters m6A methylation and transcriptional dynamics. GSEA pathway analysis showed that neuronal FTO deficiency induces addiction-relevant pathways and alters monoaminergic and GABAergic neurotransmission, providing a molecular basis for the heightened vulnerability to alcohol abuse. Our findings demonstrate that neuronal m6A RNA methylation is a novel regulator of excessive alcohol drinking and alcohol-dependent gene expression and its dysregulation may contribute to the pathogenesis AUD.

                <p>To navigate dynamic environments, animals must rapidly integrate sensory information and respond appropriately to gather rewards and avoid threats. It is well established that dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SNc) are key for creating associations between environmental stimuli (i.e., cues) and the outcomes they predict. Critically, it remains unclear how sensory information is integrated into DA pathways. The superior colliculus (SC) receives direct visual input and is positioned as a relay for DA neuron augmentation. We characterized the anatomy and functional impact of SC projections to the VTA/SNc in male and female rats. First, we show that neurons in the deep layers of SC synapse densely throughout the ventral midbrain, interfacing with projections to the striatum and ventral pallidum, and these SC projections excite DA and GABA neurons in the VTA/SNc in vivo. Despite this, cues predicting SC-&gt;VTA/SNc neuron activation did not reliably evoke behavior in an optogenetic pavlovian conditioning paradigm, and activation of SC-&gt;VTA/SNc neurons did not support primary reinforcement or produce place preference/avoidance. Instead, we find that stimulation of SC-&gt;VTA/SNc neurons evokes head turning. Focusing optogenetic activation solely onto DA neurons that receive input from the SC was sufficient to invigorate turning, but not reinforcement. Turning intensity increased with repeated stimulations, suggesting that this circuit may underlie sensorimotor learning for exploration and attentional switching. Together, our results show that collicular neurons contribute to cue-guided behaviors by controlling pose adjustments through interaction with DA neurons that preferentially engage movement instead of reward.</p>

                <p>Humans have an automatic tendency to imitate others&rsquo; actions, a process facilitated by the action observation network (AON). While motor nodes of the AON, such as the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) and the supplementary motor area (SMA), are engaged during automatic imitation, the distinct roles of their projections to the primary motor cortex (M1) remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the plasticity and functional role of PMv-to-M1 and SMA-to-M1 pathways in healthy humans of either sex. We used a combination of corticocortical paired associative stimulation (ccPAS) to modulate cortical connectivity strength and drift diffusion modeling to study the impact of ccPAS on the latent cognitive processes underlying automatic imitation. Our results show that manipulating PMv-to-M1 connectivity increases the baseline tendency to imitate actions, shifting the response toward or away from an imitative response when connectivity in this circuit is enhanced or hindered, respectively. Conversely, strengthening SMA-to-M1 connectivity does not affect this bias but improves contextual information integration, facilitating task-appropriate behavior, reflected by the drift rate parameter. These findings demonstrate a double dissociation in the functional roles of PMv-to-M1 and SMA-to-M1 pathways: the former pathway drives the automatic imitation bias, while the latter modulates the integration of contextual information to regulate imitation. By combining network-based brain stimulation with advanced behavioral analysis, this study provides causal evidence for the distinct cognitive functions supported by the PMv-to-M1 and SMA-to-M1 pathways in the facilitation and regulation of automatic imitation. Our findings offer insights into the neural mechanisms governing imitation and its context-dependent modulation.</p>

                <p>Aging affects the reproductive system, although its impact on GnRH neurons is mainly unexplored. Thus, we compared the transcriptome and electrophysiology of GnRH neurons obtained from female middle-aged (MA, 400&ndash;430&nbsp;d) and young (Y, 70&nbsp;d), diestrous mice, respectively. Transcriptomic analysis revealed reproductive senescence-related molecular changes in one-third of the MA mice. The upregulated genes (<I>n</I> = 225) were linked to immune signaling, olfactory- and vomeronasal receptors. The downregulated genes (<I>n</I> = 233) were related to mRNA processing, G-protein&ndash;coupled receptors, oxidative phosphorylation, electron transport, and estrogen signaling. In addition, ion channel (Na, K, Ca), neurotransmitter (ACh, GABA, glutamate), and various neuropeptide receptor-coding genes showed differential expression indicating functional alterations of the cells. Accordingly, whole-cell patch&ndash;clamp recordings revealed a twofold increase in spontaneous firing frequency of MA-GnRH neurons. Significant changes were also observed in characteristics of action potentials and afterhyperpolarization amplitudes. Conspicuously, miniature postsynaptic currents were absent in 72% of MA-GnRH neurons, and pharmacological blockade of GABA<SUB>A</SUB> and glutamate receptors didn't affect the firing rate. However, administration of their ligands evoked inward currents and facilitated firing in both animal groups, although with a decreased efficacy in MA animals. MA-GnRH neurons sustained responsiveness to estradiol, G-protein inhibition, and kisspeptin (KP) like those of young animals. While KP receptor antagonist, KP-234, diminished firing frequency of MA-GnRH neurons, it had no effect on young GnRH cells. Collectively, these findings revealed that both the transcriptome and electrophysiological activity of GnRH neurons change at middle age and the explored alterations are hallmarks of early phase of reproductive senescence.</p>

                <p>The auditory brainstem response (ABR) is a critical tool for assessing auditory brainstem function in biomedical mouse models. Remarkably, despite its importance, the origins of ABR waves specific to mice remain poorly identified. Here, we used EEG source reconstruction to reevaluate the mouse-specific ABR origins. We recorded the topography of ABRs using high-density EEG from the skull of adult mice of either sex combined with parallel multielectrode recordings in the auditory cortex. Individual ABR waves showed a series of distinct spatial topographies across the skull. Wave I&rsquo; was strongly lateralized, supporting its auditory nerve origin. Waves II/III were also lateralized but had a more frontal distribution, supporting an origin in the cochlear nucleus and olivary complex. A distinct shift in wave IV topography showed focused activity directly above the inferior colliculus (IC). Source localization with beamforming supported the origin of wave IV and V in the IC. In addition, the slow IC wave, P<SUB>0</SUB>, temporally overlapped with responses in the auditory cortex. We identify ABR wave IV as a marker of IC activity, separating earlier brainstem contributions (cochlear nucleus, olivary complex) from later thalamic and cortical components. This finding improves the anatomical specificity of the mouse ABR as a noninvasive marker in biomedical mouse models.</p>

                <p>Gating processes that regulate sensory input into visual working memory (WM) and the execution of planned actions share neural mechanisms, suggesting a mutual interaction. In a preregistered study (Open Science Framework), we examined how this interaction may result in sensory interference during WM storage using a delayed match-to-sample task. Participants (12 males, 20 females) memorized the color of a target stimulus for later report on a color wheel. The shape of the target indicated which hand they would adjust the color wheel with. During the retention interval, an interference task was presented, requiring a response with either the same or different hand as the main task. In half of the interference trials, the interfering task cue was also colored to introduce visual interference. EEG results showed early motor planning during sensory encoding, evidenced by mu/beta suppression contralateral to the responding hand. The interference task only impaired WM performance when it included an irrelevant color, indicating that the interference effect was primarily driven by the irrelevant sensory information. In addition, color reporting in the WM task was biased toward the irrelevant color. This was more pronounced when both tasks were performed with the same hand, suggesting a selective gating mechanism dependent on motor control processes. This effect was mitigated by a control mechanism, which was evident in frontal theta activity, where higher power predicted lower bias on the single-trial level. Our findings thus reveal that sensory WM updating can be induced by interfering motor actions, which can be compensated by a reactive control mechanism.</p>

                <p>Listeners effortlessly extract multi-dimensional auditory objects, such as a localized talker, from complex acoustic scenes. However, the neural mechanisms that enable simultaneous encoding and linking of distinct sound features&mdash;such as a talker&rsquo;s voice and location&mdash;are not fully understood. Using invasive intracranial recordings in seven neurosurgical patients (four male, three female), we investigated how the human auditory cortex processes and integrates these features during naturalistic multi-talker scenes and how attentional mechanisms modulate such feature integration. We found that cortical sites exhibit a continuum of feature sensitivity, ranging from single-feature-sensitive sites (responsive primarily to voice spectral features or to location features) to dual-feature-sensitive sites (responsive to both features). At the population level, neural response patterns from both single- and dual-feature-sensitive sites jointly encoded the attended talker&rsquo;s voice and location. Notably, single-feature-sensitive sites encoded their primary feature with greater precision but also represented coarse information about the secondary feature. Sites selectively tracking a single, attended speech stream concurrently encoded both voice and location features, demonstrating a link between selective attention and feature integration. Additionally, attention selectively enhanced temporal coherence between voice- and location-sensitive sites, suggesting that temporal synchronization serves as a mechanism for linking these features. Our findings highlight two complementary neural mechanisms&mdash;joint population coding and temporal coherence&mdash;that enable the integration of voice and location features in the auditory cortex. These results provide new insights into the distributed, multi-dimensional nature of auditory object formation during active listening in complex environments.</p>

                <p>Exposure to loud and/or prolonged noise damages the cochlea and triggers downstream brain changes, resulting in hearing loss and altered speech comprehension. It remains unclear however whether noise exposure also compromises the cochlear efferent system; a feedback pathway originates in the brain that fine-tunes hearing sensitivity in the cochlea. Recent evidence suggests that lateral olivocochlear (LOC) efferent system supports hearing recovery by sustaining auditory nerve activity for several weeks after acoustic trauma (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B53">Sitko et al., 2025</cross-ref>); however, the underlying neural mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. To address this gap, we examined the long-term effects of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) on the spontaneous action potential (AP) firing pattern in mouse LOC neurons of either sex. Under normal conditions, these neurons display a characteristic burst firing pattern driven by Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel-mediated membrane voltage oscillations. One week following noise exposure, hearing thresholds were significantly elevated, and the duration of AP bursts was increased, as a result of an enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> current. Moreover, LOC neurons exhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation (CDI) of Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents&mdash;a key process that shapes the duration of voltage oscillations&mdash;whose properties were also modified following noise exposure. Interestingly, our data suggest that the interplay between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activation, CDI, and outward leak currents is sufficient to sustain the oscillating behavior of LOC neurons. We propose that NIHL increases efferent activity, thereby enhancing the release of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, which may support long-lasting restoration of sensory coding in the damaged cochlea.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/47/e0909252025?rss=1">Hippocampal Drift Rate Reflects the Temporal Organization of Memories</a></h4>

              
                <p>When freely recalling past events, individuals tend to successively remember stimuli that were studied close together in time&mdash;a phenomenon known as temporal clustering. Temporal clustering is thought to occur because stimuli are encoded in relation to a slowly drifting internal context; this internal context representation is then reinstated during recall, leading to clustered recall of stimuli that share a similar internal context. While several lines of evidence implicate the hippocampus in supporting internal context representations, there is limited evidence directly linking hippocampal drift during memory encoding to subsequent temporal clustering during recall. In a human fMRI experiment (<I>n</I> = 38; 20 females and 18 males), we sought to influence the rate of internal context change during memory encoding and tested for corresponding effects on (1) temporal clustering and (2) hippocampal drift rate. To influence internal context, we manipulated the rate at which background scenes "switched" while a list of words was encoded. Afterward, subjects freely recalled as many words as possible. While switch rate had no effect on the total number of words recalled, it significantly influenced the degree of temporal clustering. Specifically, a higher switch rate was associated with less temporal clustering. Strikingly, this pattern was mirrored by drift rate in the hippocampus: a higher switch rate was associated with significantly lower hippocampal autocorrelation (more drift). Moreover, individual differences in hippocampal autocorrelation were positively correlated with temporal clustering. Collectively, this suggests that hippocampal drift rate during encoding and temporal clustering during recall each reflects a common internal context representation.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/47/e0979252025?rss=1">Effects of Partial Occlusion on Response Dynamics and Interregional Processing within Primate Superior Temporal Sulcus</a></h4>

              
                <p>Recognizing partially occluded objects is a critical visual function that primates perform with ease, yet the underlying neural mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Previous studies in the macaque inferotemporal cortex have reported mixed results on whether occlusion delays and reduces responses to partially occluded objects. To address this, we recorded single-unit activity from body-responsive regions of the middle and anterior superior temporal sulcus (STS) in male macaques while presenting body stimuli with varying levels of occlusion using a dot pattern. Occlusion reduced response strength and increased onset latency in both regions, and even low occlusion levels altered response dynamics by increasing the difference between the response trough and second peak. While body selectivity was preserved, body decoding accuracy declined and was delayed as occlusion increased. In contrast to some prior reports, we found no consistent enhancement of body decoding during the late response phase. By controlling for information loss and clutter introduced by the occluder, we found that reductions in response strength were partly due to the deletion of body features, whereas changes in response dynamics primarily reflected interactions between the occluder and the remaining body features. Occlusion delayed the first but not the second response peak, suggesting distinct mechanisms for these phases. Peak decoding at high occlusion levels emerged later in anterior than middle STS, indicating a feedforward component. However, representational similarity analysis combined with Granger causality suggested enhanced feedback from anterior to middle STS under high occlusion. Together, these results highlight the response dynamics supporting robust recognition under occlusion.</p>

                <p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) triggers a cascade of secondary pathologies&mdash;such as neuroinflammation and glial activation&mdash;contributing to progressive neuronal loss and hindering functional recovery. While therapeutic hypothermia has shown neuroprotective potential, its clinical application is limited by systemic complications. Recent discoveries have identified hypothalamic Q neurons, whose activation induces a reversible, hibernation-like hypothermic state, termed Q neuron-induced hypothermic/hypometabolic states (QIH), without the need for external cooling. However, whether QIH can mitigate brain injury remains unknown. In this study, we examined the therapeutic effects of QIH following acute brain injury in male mice. Using a dorsal striatal stab injury model, we found that QIH-treated mice displayed significantly improved motor performance and grip strength compared with controls. Histological analyses revealed enhanced neuronal survival in the perilesional striatum, accompanied by markedly reduced astrocytic gliosis and microglial accumulation at the injury site. To investigate the mechanisms underlying these improvements, we employed a medial prefrontal cortex injury model and observed that QIH robustly suppressed astrocytic and microglial activation, as indicated by reduced GFAP and Iba1 expression. Additionally, QIH decreased the number of CD16/32- and CD68-positive microglia and downregulated iNOS expression, suggesting that QIH dampens both oxidative and phagocytic inflammatory responses. Morphometric analysis further revealed a shift toward ramified and rod-shaped microglia, phenotypes associated with neuroprotection. Our findings demonstrate that QIH ameliorates early neuroinflammation, preserves neuronal integrity, and promotes functional recovery following brain injury. These results highlight QIH as a novel and physiologically grounded neuroprotective strategy that may overcome the limitations of conventional hypothermia-based interventions.</p>

                <p>The olfactory bulb (OB) is one of the few regions in the adult brain that receives newly generated neuronal precursors throughout the lifespan of animals. These neuronal precursors differentiate into OB interneurons, mostly granule cells (GCs), and integrate into the bulbar network by forming dendro-dendritic reciprocal synapses with OB principal neurons. The ultrastructural properties and plasticity of these synapses and whether they are distinct from those formed by early-born, resident GCs remain unknown. In the present study, we assessed the ultrastructural properties of dendro-dendritic reciprocal synapses formed by either adult-born or resident, early-born GCs with principal neurons in mice of both sexes and studied their plasticity following sensory deprivation and odor learning. The synapses formed by either adult-born or resident, early-born GCs with principal bulbar neurons were undistinguishable in terms of area, diameter, and aspect ratio. In contrast, the synapses formed by adult-born GCs were characterized by a smaller synaptic cleft and a larger density of total and docked synaptic vesicles than synapses formed by resident GCs. Sensory deprivation and odor learning decreased and increased, respectively, the overall density and the number of docked synaptic vesicles in adult-born and resident GCs forming synapses with principal neurons. Our results revealed important differences in the ultrastructural properties of synapses formed by interneurons born at distinct developmental stages and revealed their plasticity in response to sensory deprivation and odor learning.</p>

                <p>High-frequency bursts in the hippocampus, known as ripples (80&ndash;120&nbsp;Hz in humans), have been shown to support episodic memory processes. However, converging recent evidence in rodent models and human neuroimaging suggests that the hippocampus may be involved in a wider range of memory domains, including motor sequence learning (MSL). Nevertheless, no direct link between hippocampal ripples and MSL has been established yet. Here, we recorded intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) from the hippocampus in 20 epilepsy patients (11 males and 9 females) during an MSL task in which participants showed steady improvement across nine 30&nbsp;s typing blocks interspersed with 30&nbsp;s rest ("offline") periods. We first demonstrated that ripple rates strongly increased during rest relative to typing blocks. Importantly, ripple rates during rest periods tracked behavioral improvements, both across learning blocks and across participants. These findings suggest that hippocampal ripples during rest periods play a role in facilitating motor sequence learning.</p>

                <p>Similar to motor skill learning in mammals, vocal learning in songbirds requires a set of interconnected brain areas that make up an analogous basal ganglia&ndash;thalamocortical circuit known as the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP). Although neural activity in the AFP has been extensively investigated during awake singing, very little is known about its neural activity patterns during other behavioral states. Here, we used chronically implanted Neuropixels probes to investigate spontaneous neural activity in the AFP during natural sleep and awake periods in male zebra finches. We found that during sleep, neuron populations in the pallial region LMAN (lateral magnocellular nucleus of the nidopallium) spontaneously exhibited synchronized bursts that were characterized by a negative sharp deflection in the local field potential (LFP) and a transient increase in gamma power. LMAN population bursts occurred primarily during non-rapid eye movement sleep and were highly reminiscent of sharp-wave ripple activity observed in the rodent hippocampus. We also examined the functional connectivity within the AFP by calculating the pairwise LFP coherence. As expected, delta and theta band coherence within LMAN and Area X was higher during sleep compared with awake periods. Contrary to our expectations, we did not observe strong coherence between LMAN and Area X during sleep, suggesting that the input from LMAN into Area X is spatially restricted. Overall, these results provide the first description of spontaneous neural dynamics within the AFP across behavioral states.</p>

                <p>Layer 6 corticothalamic neurons (CTs) provide strong feedback input that is crucial to perception and cognition in normal and pathological states; however, the synaptic properties of this input remain largely unknown, especially in pathology. Here, we examined the synaptic properties of CT axon terminals in the medial geniculate body (MGB), the auditory thalamus, in normal hearing male and female mice and in a mouse model of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), also in male and female mice. In normal hearing mice, we found that the amplitude of CT-evoked excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) to the core-type ventral subdivision of the auditory thalamus (MGv), which mainly conveys rapid sensory information, is larger compared with the amplitude of CT-evoked EPSC to the matrix-type dorsal subdivision of the auditory thalamus (MGd), which likely conveys higher-order internal state information. This is due to higher axonal density and/or axonal recruitment in CT-&gt;MGv compared with CT-&gt;MGd synapses. After noise trauma, we observed enhanced short-term facilitation in CT-&gt;MGd but not CT-&gt;MGv synapses. Our findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism of short-term synaptic plasticity after NIHL via which CTs enhance the throughput of matrix-type thalamus, likely to improve perceptual recovery via higher-order contextual modulation.</p>

                Background Investment decision making is a critical aspect of financial planning. It involves allocating the financial resources to various investment avenues with an objective of generating future returns. Behavioral finance provides a theoretical framework for understanding psychological biases investment decision making which changes the assumptions of traditional finance. This study examines five important behavioral biases such as heuristics, prospect theory, emotions, market impact, and herding behavior on investment decision-making and portfolio management by considering investor experience and financial literacy as moderating factors. Methods Primary data was collected from individual investors in the BSE and NSE using a structured questionnaire administered through a purposive random sampling. Resulting in 151 complete responses were obtained and were considered valid for the purpose of our study. PLS-SEM was used to test the proposed hypotheses as well as the moderating effect Results Study finding indicates that heuristics have a positive and statistically significant effect on investment decisions, while prospect theory, emotions, market impact, and herding behavior showed no significant direct influence. The moderation analysis reveals that both investor experience and financial literacy significantly moderate the effects of emotions and market impact on investment decisions. However, their influence on heuristics, prospect theory, and herding behavior was statistically insignificant. Conclusions The results of this study lead to several conclusions. In this present study only one behavioral bias heuristics (HU) demonstrated a significant direct influence on investment decisions. In contrast, other behavioral biases such as prospect theory (P), emotions (E), market impact (M), and herding behavior (HB) do not significantly affect investment decisions (p > 0.05). The moderating effect of investors’ experience and financial literacy investor behavior are minimal. The result underscores that improving financial education, skills, knowledge and gaining experience may help investors regulate emotional and trend-based decisions but may not be sufficient to address more instinctive cognitive biases. The significance of the study provides important implications for financial educators, advisors, policymakers and stock market authorities regarding the need for behaviorally informed investor training, decision-support systems, and informed advisory services to promote rational investment behavior.

                Background Traumatic injuries remain critical public health concerns, placing psychosocial and economic burdens on individuals, families, and healthcare systems. Despite being a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally, especially in low-and middle-income countries, few studies have examined predictors of injury severity in pre-hospital settings. Most research focuses on injury incidence, with limited attention to pre-hospital factors. We aimed assessing the prevalence of severe injuries and their associated factors among patients managed by pre-hospital emergency services. Methods A cross-sectional study was utilized medical registry data from 1,162 RTI victims. Demographic, epidemiological, and clinical information were collected, with injuries categorized as severe or non-severe based on the Injury Severity Score. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models were conducted to indicate associated factors of severe injury. Results Among 1162 victims, 165 (14%) experienced severe injury. Our results showed that females were less likely to experience severe injury (aOR=0.47, 95%CI:0.26–0.79) than males. Regarding trauma mechanism, car-to-pedestrian collisions (aOR=2.3, 95%CI:1.25–4.1), car-to-motorcycle collisions considerably increased the likelihoods of severe injury (aOR=3.88, 95%CI:1.16–13.05) compared to car-only crashes. Alcohol users were more likely to experience severe injury (aOR=3.37; 95%CI: 2.04-5.56) than non-users. Those who travelled distance ranged 21-40 km had higher likelihoods (aOR=2.91, 95%CI:1.27–6.63), while those with more than 40 km faced higher likelihoods of severe injury (aOR=2.64, 95% CI:1.11–6.25) than individuals with less than 20 km to reach to a healthcare facility. Those with extremity injuries (aOR=0.28, 95% CI:0.15–0.52), chest injuries (aOR=0.40, 95%CI:0.23–0.71, p=.002) had lower likelihoods of severe injury than those with head trauma. Conclusion This study provides valuable insights into the factors influencing injury severity in the pre-hospital setting. The findings underscore the importance of strengthening early identification and rapid stabilization of high-risk patients during pre-hospital care. Future research using prospective longitudinal designs is recommended to confirm causality.

We present Epydemix, an open-source Python package for the development and calibration of stochastic compartmental epidemic models. The framework supports flexible model structures that incorporate demographic information, age-stratified contact matrices, and dynamic public health interventions. A key feature of Epydemix is its integration of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) techniques to perform parameter inference and model calibration through comparison between observed and simulated data. The package offers a range of ABC methods such as simple rejection sampling, simulation-budget-constrained rejection, and Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC). Epydemix is modular, and supports ABC-based calibration both for models defined within the package and for those developed externally. To demonstrate the computational framework capabilities, we discuss usage examples that include (i) simulating an intervention-driven model with time-varying parameters, and (ii) benchmarking calibration performance using synthetic epidemic data. We further illustrate the use of the package in a retrospective case study that includes scenario projections under alternative intervention assumptions. By lowering the barrier for the implementation of computational and inference approaches, Epydemix makes epidemic modeling more accessible to a wider range of users, from academic researchers to public health professionals.

Mathematical and computational models are often used to forecast respiratory infectious disease burden, including to inform healthcare capacity. We aimed to characterize pathways of clinical progression associated with SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections using data from patients aged 0 to >90 years in an integrated healthcare system, whose encounters were monitored across all levels of acuity spanning virtual, ambulatory, and inpatient care settings. Using parametric survival models, we estimated probabilities of progression and distributions of time to progression from each setting to all higher-acuity settings on a cascade encompassing the following classes of events or encounters: symptoms onset; diagnostic testing; telehealth or other virtual care appointment; outpatient physician office visit; urgent care presentation; emergency department presentation; hospital admission; mechanical ventilation; and death. Our analyses included data from 59,668, 22,705, and 1,668 episodes associated with positive SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV tests, respectively, between 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024. First clinical encounters occurred in inpatient settings for only 4.7%, 3.4%, and 18.7% of SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV episodes, respectively, with median times (interquartile range) of 6.8 (3.6-13.2), 6.6 (3.5-12.1), and 6.4 (3.8-10.6) days from symptoms onset to admission. Overall, 7.9% of SARS-CoV-2 episodes, 5.8% of influenza episodes, and 33.8% of RSV episodes resulted in inpatient admission, ventilation, or death. Between 40.4-62.1%, 71.6-87.3%, and 47.9-58.7% of SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV infections, respectively, had encounters in lower-acuity virtual care, outpatient, or urgent care settings. For all three viruses, the proportions of cases receiving care at each level of acuity increased with older age and greater numbers of comorbid conditions. Median durations of hospital stay were 4.2 (2.6, 7.3), 4.0 (2.3, 6.8), and 4.3 (2.5, 7.4) days for SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV episodes resulting in admission. These estimates provide a basis for modeling real-world clinical care requirements and the progression of respiratory viral infections.

The deficiency of α1-antitrypsin protein is a genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates within hepatocytes, leading to liver dysfunction. In the lung, it is found in macrophages, bronchial and epithelial alveolar cells type 2, leading to pulmonary emphysema. Despite extensive research, the precise mechanism underlying the formation of α1-antitrypsin inclusion bodies remain elusive. In this study, we combine equilibrium and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the intricate process of α1-antitrypsin condensate formation and maturation. Our mechanistic model explains cluster accumulation—specifically the onset of this pathogenesis—through the emergence of phase-separated liquid-like protein droplets, which subsequently undergo inter-protein <i>β</i>-sheet transitions between misfolded variants, resulting in solid-like clusters. We find that this mechanism only applies to the misfolded variant, Z-α1-antitrypsin, which phase-separates driven by its disordered C-terminus. In contrast, the native protein, M-α1-antitrypsin, shows much lower propensity to phase-separate and later form kinetically trapped aggregates. Furthermore, we explore how Z-α1-antitrypsin exhibits an increased capacity to form condensates near external walls with different types of interactions. Such conditions can be similar to those found within the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, where phase separation and hardening take place. Overall, our results shed light on the molecular basis of α1-antitrypsin-related disorders and provide valuable microscopic insights for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting protein misfolding and aggregation-related disorders.

                <p>by Yirong Xiang, Jules C. Hancox, Henggui Zhang</p>

Patients with abbreviated cardiac repolarization are at increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular and atrial fibrillation (AF). In this computational simulation study, we investigated pro-arrhythmic effects of loss-of-function missense mutations in <i>CACNA1C</i> (A39V and G490R Cav1.2) identified in patients with a phenotype combining Brugada syndrome with shorter-than-normal QT intervals. Biophysically-detailed computational models of human atrial cells were modified to incorporate the functional impact of the <i>CACNA1C</i> encoded A39V and G490R mutations on the reduction of the maximal conductance (g<sub>CaL</sub>) of L-type calcium channels (LTCC). Varying levels of g<sub>CaL</sub> reduction were considered. Effects of deficient LTCC on atrial excitation and propagation were investigated by using cellular and multi-dimensional tissue models that included a one-dimensional atrial strand, a two-dimensional idealized atrial sheet and three-dimensional human atria with realistic anatomical structure and detailed electrophysiology. Our results showed that reduced LTCC activity from the <i>CACNA1C</i> A39V and G490R mutations accelerated atrial repolarization, leading to shortened action potential duration and effective refractory period, as well as the loss of their rate-dependence. At the tissue level, decreased g<sub>CaL</sub> shortened the wavelength of atrial excitation waves, slowed down atrial conduction velocity (CV) at low pacing rates but increased it at high pacing rates. It also showed bi-phasic arrhythmogenic effects in One-dimensional (1D), Two-dimensional (2D) and Three-dimensional (3D) tissue simulations. A large reduction in I<sub>CaL</sub> increased tissue susceptibility to initiation and maintenance of atrial re-entrant excitation waves, while a moderate reduction showed anti-arrhythmic effects due to an increased meandering area of re-entrant excitation waves that led to early self-termination of the reentry. In conclusion, this study provides new mechanistic insights into understanding of biphasic effects of loss-of-function LTCC mutations on atrial pro-arrhythmias.

                <p>by Yanqi Wu, Vieyiti K. Kouadio, Thomas R. Usherwood, Justin Li, Margaret Bisher, Reshum Aurora, Aaron Z. Lam, Alice R. Lam, Abigail K. R. Lytton-Jean, Scott R. Manalis, Teemu P. Miettinen</p>

Marine phytoplankton face eco-evolutionary pressure to regulate their vertical position in the ocean to access light, which is abundant towards the surface, and nutrients, which are found deeper down the water column. All phytoplankton experience gravitational sinking, which can contribute to their vertical migration. However, the biophysical and molecular mechanisms that impact gravitational sinking have not been systematically characterized across taxa and environmental conditions. Here, we combine simulations with measurements of cell mass, volume, and composition to investigate the effects of nutrient availability on gravitational sinking in nine representative unicellular pico- and nanoplankton species. We find that gravitational sinking becomes faster in most species when starved, but the biophysical changes responsible for this vary across species and starvation conditions. For example, the faster sinking of <i>Chaetoceros calcitrans</i> is nearly exclusively driven by cell density whereas that of <i>Emiliania huxleyi</i> is due to cell volume. On the molecular level, the altered sinking is predominantly attributed to changes in cellular dry contents, rather than water. For example, starch accumulation increases sinking in three green algae species, and lipid accumulation decreases sinking in <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i>. Overall, our work reveals that phytoplankton physiology has evolved multiple mechanisms that impact gravitational sinking in response to starvation, possibly to support the vertical migration of the cell.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen provides the proper redox environment for disulfide bond formation, which is essential for the correct folding of proteins entering the secretory pathway and forming membranes. However, the precise mechanisms by which disruptions in protein folding within the ER activate proteostatic mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that in <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> the antineoplastic agent hydroxyurea (HU) induces a transient perinuclear ER expansion, Bip1 accumulation, and the clustering of nuclear pore complexes in a specific region of the nuclear envelope. This striking phenotype is mimicked by diamide (DIA), a specific inducer of thiol stress, and can be prevented or rapidly reversed by dithiothreitol, a reducing agent, suggesting that ER expansion results from disulfide stress. Furthermore, HU or DIA treatments resulted in the accumulation of misfolded proteins in cytoplasmic foci containing Hsp104 disaggregase and Hsp70/Ssa1 chaperones. Our data show that HU impacts redox-dependent protein folding, impairs the secretory pathway, and activates specific proteostatic mechanisms in both the ER and the cytoplasm.

Attacks from molecular parasites such as mobile genetic elements (MGEs) have driven the evolution of defense systems in bacterial genomes. Yet, despite significant advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms of these bacterial immune systems, we have only a rudimentary understanding of their ecology and evolution. Bacteria exist as part of complex microbiomes, but community ecology and microbiome research has yet to characterize the impacts of interactions between MGEs and defense mechanisms upon the structure, dynamics and evolution of microbiomes. This Essay introduces and discusses the interplay between bacterial community dynamics and bacterial immune systems, speculating about how these reciprocal interactions may shape microbial community structure and function.

                Background Early and accurate prediction of Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) is critical to reducing cardiovascular mortality through timely intervention. While deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in disease prediction, many lack interpretability, generalizability, and fairness—particularly when deployed across demographically diverse populations. These shortcomings limit clinical adoption and risk reinforcing healthcare disparities. Methods This study proposes a novel model: X-TLRABiLSTM (Explainable Transfer Learning–based Residual Attention Bidirectional LSTM). The architecture integrates transfer learning from pre-trained cardiovascular models into a BiLSTM framework with residual attention layers to improve temporal feature extraction and convergence. To ensure transparency, the model incorporates SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to quantify the contribution of each clinical feature to the final prediction. Additionally, a demographic reweighting strategy is applied to the training process to reduce bias across subgroups defined by age, gender, and ethnicity. The model was evaluated on the UCI Heart Disease dataset using 10-fold cross-validation. Results The X-TLRABiLSTM model achieved a classification accuracy of 98.2%, with an F1-score of 98.1% and an AUC of 99.1%, outperforming standard ML classifiers and state-of-the-art DL baselines. SHAP-based interpretability analysis highlighted clinically relevant predictors such as chest pain type, ST depression, and thalassemia. A fairness-aware reweighting strategy was applied during training, and fairness evaluation revealed minimal performance disparity across demographic subgroups, with F1-score gaps ≤ 0.6% and error rate gaps ≤ 0.4%. Confusion matrix analysis demonstrated low false-positive and false-negative rates, reinforcing the model’s reliability for clinical deployment. Conclusions X-TLRABiLSTM offers a highly accurate, interpretable, and demographically fair framework for IHD prognosis. By combining transfer learning, residual attention, explainable AI, and fairness-aware optimization, this model advances trustworthy AI in healthcare. Its successful performance on benchmark clinical data supports its potential for real-world integration in ethical, AI-assisted cardiovascular diagnostics.

                Background Neonatal jaundice is one of the most prevalent conditions during first week of life causing morbidity and even mortality in few, especially in low – middle income countries. Although visual inspection for jaundice has been a time tested method, serum bilirubin is the gold standard investigation of choice. Due to this, newborns receive many heel or vein pricks for testing, hence the transcutaneous bilirubinometer can be a helpful non-invasive tool for diagnosing jaundice requiring phototherapy. Methods This prospective study was carried out in a tertiary care hospital in Mangalore, Karnataka to compare a non invasive method of detecting bilirubin levels and serum bilirubin levels. Performance of a transcutaneous bilirubinometer Dräger Jaundice Meter JM-105 was assessed against routine venous serum bilirubin testing before phototherapy during neonatal care in the first two weeks of life. Results were derived by analysing the correlation coefficient between two methods and direct agreement was analysed using Bland Altman analysis. Results Total of 271 neonates (>35 weeks) were included in the study. Transcutaneous bilirubinometry and serum bilirubin values were done on all of them in the first week of life. Correlation analysis showed significant relationship with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.629. Values of transcutaneous bilirubinometer showed excellent agreement with venous serum bilirubin concentration in Bland Altman analysis. Conclusions The transcutaneous bilirubinometer is a reliable tool to screen neonates and identify those needing phototherapy there by reducing invasive blood sampling.
