     alt="Topological reorganization of brain network might contribute to the resilience of cognitive functioning in mildly disabled relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis"/>
<p>In this study, we propose that the resilience of structural hub disruption compensated by functional connectivity in the DMN underlies the stable disability compensating by the aging of RRMS.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory and demyelinating disease which leads to impairment in several functional systems including cognition. Alteration of brain networks is linked to disability and its progression. However, results are mostly cross-sectional and yet contradictory as putative adaptive and maladaptive mechanisms were found. Here, we aimed to explore longitudinal reorganization of brain networks over 2-years by combining diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and a comprehensive neuropsychological-battery. In 37 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and 39 healthy-controls, cognition remained stable over-time. We reconstructed network models based on the three modalities and analyzed connectivity in relation to the hierarchical topology and functional subnetworks. Network models were compared across modalities and in their association with cognition using linear-mixed-effect-regression models. Loss of hub connectivity and global reduction was observed on a structural level over-years (<i>p</i> &lt; .010), which was similar for functional MEG-networks but not for fMRI-networks. Structural hub connectivity increased in controls (<i>p</i> = .044), suggesting a physiological mechanism of healthy aging. Despite a general loss in structural connectivity in RRMS, hub connectivity was preserved (<i>p</i> = .002) over-time in default-mode-network (DMN). MEG-networks were similar to DTI and weakly correlated with fMRI in MS (<i>p</i> &lt; .050). Lower structural (<i>β</i> between .23–.33) and both lower (<i>β</i> between .40–.59) and higher functional connectivity (<i>β</i> = −.54) in DMN was associated with poorer performance in attention and memory in RRMS (<i>p</i> &lt; .001). MEG-networks involved no association with cognition. Here, cognitive stability despite ongoing neurodegeneration might indicate a resilience mechanism of DMN hubs mimicking a physiological reorganization observed in healthy aging.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Fewer COVID‐19 neurological complications with dexamethasone and remdesivir</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess the impact of treatment with dexamethasone, remdesivir or both on neurological complications in acute COVID-19.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used observational data from the International Severe Acute and emerging Respiratory Infection Consortium (ISARIC) WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK (CCP-UK). Hospital inpatients aged ≥18 years with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted between 31 January 2020 and 29 June 2021 were included. Treatment allocation was non-blinded and performed by reporting clinicians. A propensity scoring methodology was used to minimize confounding. Treatment with remdesivir, dexamethasone or both was assessed against standard of care. The primary outcome was a neurological complication occurring at the point of death, discharge, or resolution of the COVID-19 clinical episode.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Out of 89,297 hospital inpatients, 64,088 had severe COVID-19 and 25,209 had non-hypoxic COVID-19. Neurological complications developed in 4.8% and 4.5% respectively. In both groups, neurological complications associated with increased mortality, ICU admission, worse self-care on discharge and time to recovery. In severe COVID-19, treatment with dexamethasone (n=21,129), remdesivir (n=1,428) and both combined (n=10,846) associated with a lower frequency of neurological complications: OR=0.76 (95% CI=0.69-0.83), OR 0.69 (95% CI=0.51-0.90) and OR=0.54, (95% CI=0.47-0.61) respectively. In non-hypoxic COVID-19, dexamethasone (n=2,580) associated with less neurological complications (OR=0.78, 95% CI 0.62-0.97), while the dexamethasone/remdesivir combination (n=460) showed a similar trend (OR=0.63, 95% CI=0.31-1.15).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Treatment with dexamethasone, remdesivir or both in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 associated with a lower frequency of neurological complications in an additive manner, such that the greatest benefit was observed in patients who received both drugs together.</p>

	<p>Female-specific risk factors for stroke have gradually received attention. The relationship between ischemic stroke and adenomyosis, a benign uterine disorder commonly present in parous women, is underrecognized. We aimed to provide an overview of the epidemiology, pathophysiological mechanisms, clinical characteristics, diagnostic considerations, and potential therapeutic strategies of adenomyosis-associated ischemic stroke. We shared our experience with the diagnosis and management of a patient, and summarized current findings and knowledge gaps of this disease based on previous literature. The relevant studies were searched in English and Chinese databases up to April 2022 using the keywords &amp;amp;ldquo;ischemic stroke&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;cerebral infarction&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;adenomyosis&amp;amp;rdquo;. Then, we provided a narrative review of the retrieved articles. Finally, the data of 32 cases were analyzed. We found that increased levels of carbohydrate antigen 125 and D-dimer and decreased level of hemoglobin are biomarkers of adenomyosis-associated ischemic stroke. In addition, hypercoagulability might be a key mechanism leading to thromboembolism in the cerebrovascular system. Additional studies are needed to find optimal prevention strategies for the disease. A better understanding of this &amp;amp;ldquo;rare&amp;amp;rdquo; pathogenesis of ischemic stroke may inform a more precise diagnosis and effective prevention strategy in middle-aged women with embolic stroke of undetermined source.</p>

	<p>This study pursued two goals: (1) to establish range of motion (ROM) demand tiers (i.e., low, moderate, high) specific to the jaw (J), lower lip (LL), posterior tongue (PT), and anterior tongue (AT) for multisyllabic words based on the articulatory performance of neurotypical talkers and (2) to identify demand- and disease-specific articulatory performance characteristics in talkers with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). J, LL, PT, and AT movements of 12 talkers with ALS, 12 talkers with PD, and 12 controls were recorded using electromagnetic articulography. Vertical ROM, average speed, and movement duration were measured. Results showed that in talkers with PD, J and LL ROM were already significantly reduced at the lowest tier whereas PT and AT ROM were only significantly reduced at moderate and high tiers. In talkers with ALS, J ROM was significantly reduced at the moderate tier whereas LL, PT, and AT ROM were only significantly reduced at the highest tier. In both clinical groups, significantly reduced J and LL speeds could already be observed at the lowest tier whereas significantly reduced AT speeds could only be observed at the highest tier. PT speeds were already significantly reduced at the lowest tier in the ALS group but not until the moderate tier in the PD group. Finally, movement duration, but not ROM or speed performance, differentiated between ALS and PD even at the lowest tier. Results suggest that articulatory deficits vary with stimuli-specific motor demands across articulators and clinical groups.</p>

     alt="Comparative analysis of astrocytes in the prefrontal cortex of primates: Insights into the evolution of human brain energetics"/>
<p>We quantified astrocytes expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein in human and nonhuman primates. We report that astrocyte density, soma volume, and ratio of astrocytes to total glia cells in layer I of Brodmann.s area 9 increased significantly with brain size enlargement and was greatest in humans. Roman numerals denote cortical layer. Scale bars = 25 µm.

</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Astrocytes are the main homeostatic cell of the brain involved in many processes related to cognition, immune response, and energy expenditure. It has been suggested that the distribution of astrocytes is associated with brain size, and that they are specialized in humans. To evaluate these, we quantified astrocyte density, soma volume, and total glia density in layer I and white matter in Brodmann's area 9 of humans, chimpanzees, baboons, and macaques. We found that layer I astrocyte density, soma volume, and ratio of astrocytes to total glia cells were highest in humans and increased with brain size. Overall glia density in layer I and white matter were relatively invariant across brain sizes, potentially due to their important metabolic functions on a per volume basis. We also quantified two transporters involved in metabolism through the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle, excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). We expected these transporters would be increased in human brains due to their high rate of metabolic consumption and associated gene activity. While humans have higher EAAT2 cell density, GLUT1 vessel volume, and GLUT1 area fraction compared to baboons and chimpanzees, they did not differ from macaques. Therefore, EAAT2 and GLUT1 are not related to increased energetic demands of the human brain. Taken together, these data provide evidence that astrocytes play a unique role in both brain expansion and evolution among primates, with an emphasis on layer I astrocytes having a potentially significant role in human-specific metabolic processing and cognition.</p>

     alt="3D-atlas of the brain of the cockroach Rhyparobia maderae"/><p>Cockroaches are model organisms for research on olfaction, spatial orientation and circadian control of behavior. To facilitate further studies on these topics, we provide a detailed 3D atlas of brain neuropils, fiber tracts, and commissures of the cockroach <i>Rhyparobia maderae</i>, which reveals novel insights into the organization of the cockroach brain.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The Madeira cockroach <i>Rhyparobia maderae</i> is a nocturnal insect and a prominent model organism for the study of circadian rhythms. Its master circadian clock, controlling circadian locomotor activity and sleep–wake cycles, is located in the accessory medulla of the optic lobe. For a better understanding of brain regions controlled by the circadian clock and brain organization of this insect in general, we created a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of all neuropils of the cerebral ganglia based on anti-synapsin and anti-γ-aminobutyric acid immunolabeling of whole mount brains. Forty-nine major neuropils were identified and three-dimensionally reconstructed. Single-cell dye fills complement the data and provide evidence for distinct subdivisions of certain brain areas. Most neuropils defined in the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> could be distinguished in the cockroach as well. However, some neuropils identified in the fruit fly do not exist as distinct entities in the cockroach while others are lacking in the fruit fly. In addition to neuropils, major fiber systems, tracts, and commissures were reconstructed and served as important landmarks separating brain areas. Being a nocturnal insect, <i>R. maderae</i> is an important new species to the growing collection of 3D insect brain atlases and only the second hemimetabolous insect, for which a detailed 3D brain atlas is available. This atlas will be highly valuable for an evolutionary comparison of insect brain organization and will greatly facilitate addressing brain areas that are supervised by the circadian clock.</p>

The visual part of this nucleus in carnivores is the perigeniculate nucleus located dorsal to the lateral geniculate nucleus. The perigeniculate nucleus participates in the modulation of visual processing and in the transition of synchronized slow rhythmicity during sleep into desynchronized high-frequency activity during arousal and consists of inhibitory neurons. The main neurochemical markers for perigeniculate neurons are glutamic acid decarboxylase and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein parvalbumin. Previous studies of postnatal development focused on the morphological features of the perigeniculate nucleus; however, its neurochemistry remains poorly understood. In this study, we focused on the postnatal development of perigeniculate neurons using immunohistochemical labeling of parvalbumin, two related Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins (calretinin and calbindin), glutamic acid decarboxylase, and a common neuronal protein, NeuN, in kittens that were 0–123 days old and in adult cats. In parallel with the well-known dominant neuronal populations expressing parvalbumin and GAD67 and persisting until adulthood, transient populations expressing calretinin and calbindin were observed. The calbindin-positive neurons were similar to the main perigeniculate population and showed close morphological features and parvalbumin coexpression. In contrast, the calretinin-positive neurons differed in their morphological characteristics and did not express GAD67, thus distinguishing them from the majority of perigeniculate neurons. A possible link between these populations was revealed, and the development of thalamocortical processing is discussed.</p>

     alt="Neuropeptide S (NPS) neurons: Parabrachial identity and novel distributions"/>
<p>Neuropeptide S (NPS) neurons in the parabrachial region are a subset of <i>Atoh1</i>-derived, <i>Foxp2</i>-expressing neurons that do not express <i>Pdyn</i>, <i>Calca</i>, or <i>Cck</i>. We also identified novel populations of NPS neurons from Cre-reporter expression in the nucleus incertus, anterior hypothalamus, and lateral habenula.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuropeptide S (NPS) increases wakefulness. A small number of neurons in the brainstem express <i>Nps</i>. These neurons are located in or near the parabrachial nucleus (PB), but we know very little about their ontogeny, connectivity, and function. To identify <i>Nps</i>-expressing neurons within the molecular framework of the PB region, we used in situ hybridization, immunofluorescence, and Cre-reporter labeling in mice. The primary concentration of <i>Nps</i>-expressing neurons borders the lateral lemniscus at far-rostral levels of the lateral PB. Caudal to this main cluster, <i>Nps</i>-expressing neurons scatter through the PB and form a secondary concentration medial to the locus coeruleus (LC). Most <i>Nps</i>-expressing neurons in the PB region are <i>Atoh1</i>-derived, <i>Foxp2</i>-expressing, and mutually exclusive with neurons expressing <i>Calca</i> or <i>Lmx1b</i>. Among <i>Foxp2</i>-expressing PB neurons, those expressing <i>Nps</i> are distinct from intermingled subsets expressing <i>Cck</i> or <i>Pdyn</i>. Examining <i>Nps</i> Cre-reporter expression throughout the brain identified novel populations of neurons in the nucleus incertus, anterior hypothalamus, and lateral habenula. This information will help focus experimental questions about the connectivity and function of NPS neurons.</p>

This study quantifies the proportion of myenteric nerve cell bodies along the mouse colon that are immunoreactive to CGRP. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Quantitative data of biological systems provide valuable baseline information for understanding pathology, experimental perturbations, and computational modeling. In mouse colon, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is expressed by myenteric neurons with multiaxonal (Dogiel type II) morphology, characteristic of intrinsic primary afferent neurons (IPANs). Analogous neurons in other species and gut regions represent 5–35% of myenteric neurons. We aimed to quantify proportions of CGRP-immunopositive (CGRP+) myenteric neurons. Colchicine-treated wholemount preparations of proximal, mid, and distal colon were labeled for HuC/D, CGRP, nitric oxide synthase (NOS), and peripherin (Per). The pan-neuronal markers (Hu+/Per+) co-labeled 94% of neurons. Hu+/Per– neurons comprised ∼6%, but Hu-/Per+ cells were rare. Thus, quantification was based on Hu+ myenteric neurons (8576 total; 1225 ± 239 per animal, <i>n</i> = 7). CGRP+ cell bodies were significantly larger than the average of all Hu+ neurons (329 ± 13 vs. 261 ± 12 μm<sup>2</sup>, <i>p</i> &lt; .0001). CGRP+ neurons comprised 19% ± 3% of myenteric neurons without significant regional variation. NOS+ neurons comprised 42% ± 2% of myenteric neurons overall, representing a lower proportion in proximal colon, compared to mid and distal colon (38% ± 2%, 44% ± 2%, and 44% ± 3%, respectively). Peripherin immunolabeling revealed cell body and axonal morphology in some myenteric neurons. Whether all CGRP+ neurons were multiaxonal could not be addressed using peripherin immunolabeling. However, of 118 putatively multiaxonal neurons first identified based on peripherin immunoreactivity, all were CGRP+ (<i>n</i> = 4). In conclusion, CGRP+ myenteric neurons in mouse colon were comprehensively quantified, occurring within a range expected of a putative IPAN marker. All Per+ multiaxonal neurons, characteristic of Dogiel type II/IPAN morphology, were CGRP+.</p>

     alt="Tonotopic differentiation of presynaptic neurotransmitter-releasing machinery in the auditory brainstem during the prehearing period and its selective deficits in Fmr1 knockout mice"/>
<p>We identified protein-specific and age-dependent tonotopic distributions of five key presynaptic proteins in the developing auditory brainstem and their selective alterations in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice. The tonotopic maturation of the presynaptic machinery may provide a potential mechanism for tonotopic differentiation of neurotransmission during normal and abnormal development of auditory circuits.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Tonotopic organization is a fundamental feature of the auditory system. In the developing auditory brainstem, the ontogeny and maturation of neurotransmission progress from high to low frequencies along the tonotopic axis. To explore the underlying mechanism of this tonotopic development, we aim to determine whether the presynaptic machinery responsible for neurotransmitter release is tonotopically differentiated during development. In the current study, we examined vesicular neurotransmitter transporters and calcium sensors, two central players responsible for loading neurotransmitter into synaptic vesicles and for triggering neurotransmitter release in a calcium-dependent manner, respectively. Using immunocytochemistry, we characterized the distribution patterns of vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) 1 and 2, vesicular gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter (VGAT), and calcium sensor synaptotagmin (Syt) 1 and 2 in the developing mouse medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). We identified tonotopic gradients of VGLUT1, VGAT, Syt1, and Syt2 in the first postnatal week, with higher protein densities in the more medial (high-frequency) portion of the MNTB. These gradients gradually flattened before the onset of hearing. In contrast, VGLUT2 was distributed relatively uniformly along the tonotopic axis during this prehearing period. In mice lacking Fragile X mental retardation protein, an mRNA-binding protein that regulates synaptic development and plasticity, progress to achieve the mature-like organization was altered for VGLUT1, Syt1, and Syt2, but not for VGAT. Together, our results identified novel organization patterns of selective presynaptic proteins in immature auditory synapses, providing a potential mechanism that may contribute to tonotopic differentiation of neurotransmission during normal and abnormal development.</p>

     alt="Diversity in spatial frequency, temporal frequency, and speed tuning across mouse visual cortical areas and layers"/>
<p>Using extracellular electrophysiology and two-photon calcium imaging genetically targeted to different layer 5 cell classes, we characterize the spatial frequency (SF), temporal frequency (TF), and speed tuning of deep (layer 5/6) cortical neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual cortical areas anterolateral (AL) and posteromedial (PM). We find that deep-layer neurons, like superficial layer neurons, are functionally specialized for different spatial and temporal frequencies in different visual areas. However, we also found a larger range of preferred SFs and TFs than previously reported in superficial cortical layers. We also find that direction tuning is much more prominent for layer 5 extratelencephalically than layer 5 intratelencephalically projecting neurons in multiple visual areas.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The mouse visual system consists of several visual cortical areas thought to be specialized for different visual features and/or tasks. Previous studies have revealed differences between primary visual cortex (V1) and other higher visual areas, namely, anterolateral (AL) and posteromedial (PM), and their tuning preferences for spatial and temporal frequency. However, these differences have primarily been characterized using methods that are biased toward superficial layers of cortex, such as two-photon calcium imaging. Fewer studies have investigated cell types in deeper layers of these areas and their tuning preferences. Because superficial versus deep-layer neurons and different types of deep-layer neurons are known to have different feedforward and feedback inputs and outputs, comparing the tuning preferences of these groups is important for understanding cortical visual information processing. In this study, we used extracellular electrophysiology and two-photon calcium imaging targeted toward two different layer 5 cell classes to characterize their tuning properties in V1, AL, and PM. We find that deep-layer neurons, similar to superficial layer neurons, are also specialized for different spatial and temporal frequencies, with the strongest differences between AL and V1, and AL and PM, but not V1 and PM. However, we note that the deep-layer neuron populations preferred a larger range of SFs and TFs compared to previous studies. We also find that extratelencephalically projecting layer 5 neurons are more direction selective than intratelencephalically projecting layer 5 neurons.</p>

     alt="Quantitative spatial analysis reveals that the local axons of lamina I projection neurons and interneurons exhibit distributions that predict distinct roles in spinal sensory processing"/>
<p>Quantitative analyses of spinal lamina I projection neurons (PNs) and interneurons (INs) revealed almost identical dendritic patterns but local axon collateral distribution patterns that are distinct. INs mostly establish connections within the superficial dorsal horn and may bridge its medial and lateral halves. PNs also relay their input locally, to deeper laminae of the spinal gray matter and may link other ascending systems and participate directly in the nociceptive withdrawal reflex.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Our knowledge about the detailed wiring of neuronal circuits in the spinal dorsal horn (DH), where initial sensory processing takes place, is still very sparse. While a substantial amount of data is available on the somatodendritic morphology of DH neurons, the laminar and segmental distribution patterns and consequential function of individual axons are much less characterized. In the present study, we fully reconstructed the axonal and dendritic processes of 10 projection neurons (PNs) and 15 interneurons (INs) in lamina I of the rat, to reveal quantitative differences in their distribution. We also performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to test the predicted function of certain axon collaterals. In line with our earlier qualitative description, we found that lamina I INs in the lateral aspect of the superficial DH send axon collaterals toward the medial part and occupy mostly laminae I–III, providing anatomical basis for a lateromedial flow of information within the DH. Local axon collaterals of PNs were more extensively distributed including dorsal commissural axon collaterals that might refer to those reported earlier linking the lateral aspect of the left and right DHs. PN collaterals dominated the dorsolateral funiculus and laminae IV–VI, suggesting propriospinal and ventral connections. Indeed, patch-clamp recordings confirmed the existence of a dorsoventral excitatory drive upon activation of neurokinin-1 receptors that, although being expressed in various lamina I neurons, are specifically enriched in PNs. In summary, lamina I PNs and INs have almost identical dendritic input fields, while their segmental axon collateral distribution patterns are distinct. INs, whose somata reside in lamina I, establish local connections, may show asymmetry, and contribute to bridging the medial and lateral halves of the DH. PNs, on the other hand, preferably relay their integrated dendritic input to deeper laminae of the spinal gray matter where it might be linked to other ascending pathways or the premotor network, resulting in a putative direct contribution to the nociceptive withdrawal reflex.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">HDAC6 Inhibition Reverses Cisplatin-Induced Mechanical Hypersensitivity via Tonic Delta Opioid Receptor Signaling</a></h4>

              
                <p>Peripheral neuropathic pain induced by the chemotherapeutic cisplatin can persist for months to years after treatment. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) inhibitors have therapeutic potential for cisplatin-induced neuropathic pain since they persistently reverse mechanical hypersensitivity and spontaneous pain in rodent models. Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying reversal of mechanical hypersensitivity in male and female mice by a 2 week treatment with an HDAC6 inhibitor, administered 3 d after the last dose of cisplatin. Mechanical hypersensitivity in animals of both sexes treated with the HDAC6 inhibitor was temporarily reinstated by a single injection of the neutral opioid receptor antagonist 6&beta;-naltrexol or the peripherally restricted opioid receptor antagonist naloxone methiodide. These results suggest that tonic peripheral opioid ligand-receptor signaling mediates reversal of cisplatin-induced mechanical hypersensitivity after treatment with an HDAC6 inhibitor. Pointing to a specific role for  opioid receptors (DORs), <I>Oprd1</I> expression was decreased in DRG neurons following cisplatin administration, but normalized after treatment with an HDAC6 inhibitor. Mechanical hypersensitivity was temporarily reinstated in both sexes by a single injection of the DOR antagonist naltrindole. Consistently, HDAC6 inhibition failed to reverse cisplatin-induced hypersensitivity when DORs were genetically deleted from advillin<sup>+</sup> neurons. Mechanical hypersensitivity was also temporarily reinstated in both sexes by a single injection of a neutralizing antibody against the DOR ligand met-enkephalin. In conclusion, we reveal that treatment with an HDAC6 inhibitor induces tonic enkephalin-DOR signaling in peripheral sensory neurons to suppress mechanical hypersensitivity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Over one-fourth of cancer survivors suffer from intractable painful chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), which can last for months to years after treatment ends. HDAC6 inhibition is a novel strategy to reverse CIPN without negatively interfering with tumor growth, but the mechanisms responsible for persistent reversal are not well understood. We built on evidence that the endogenous opioid system contributes to the spontaneous, apparent resolution of pain caused by nerve damage or inflammation, referred to as latent sensitization. We show that blocking the  opioid receptor or its ligand enkephalin unmasks CIPN in mice treated with an HDAC6 inhibitor (latent sensitization). Our work provides insight into the mechanisms by which treatment with an HDAC6 inhibitor apparently reverses CIPN.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Gap-Junction Mutation Reveals That Outer Hair Cell Extracellular Receptor Potentials Drive High-Frequency Cochlear Amplification</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cochlear amplification enables the enormous dynamic range of hearing through amplifying cochlear responses to low- to moderate-level sounds and compressing them to loud sounds. Amplification is attributed to voltage-dependent electromotility of mechanosensory outer hair cells (OHCs) driven by changing voltages developed across their cell membranes. At low frequencies, these voltage changes are dominated by intracellular receptor potentials (RPs). However, OHC membranes have electrical low-pass filter properties that attenuate high-frequency RPs, which should potentially attenuate amplification of high-frequency cochlear responses and impede high-frequency hearing. We made <I>in vivo</I> intracellular and extracellular electrophysiological measurements from the organ of Corti of male and female mice of the CBA/J strain, with excellent high-frequency hearing, and from the CD-1 mouse strain, which has sensitive hearing below 12 kHz but loses high-frequency hearing within a few weeks postpartum. The CD-1 mouse strain was transfected with an A88V mutation of the connexin 30 gap-junction protein. By blocking the action of the GJ protein to reduce input resistance, the mutation increased the OHC extracellular RP (ERP) magnitude and rescued high-frequency hearing. However, by increasing the organ of Corti resistance, the mutation rescued high-frequency hearing through preserving the OHC extracellular RP (ERP) magnitude. We measured the voltage developed across the basolateral membranes of OHCs, which controls their electromotility, for low- to high-frequency sounds in male and female mice of the CD-1 strain that expressed the A88V mutation. We demonstrate that ERPs, not RPs, drive OHC motility and cochlear amplification at high frequencies because at high frequencies, ERPs are not frequency attenuated, exceed RPs in magnitude, and are appropriately timed to provide cochlear amplification.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Cochlear amplification, which enables the enormous dynamic range of hearing, is attributed to voltage-dependent electromotility of the mechanosensory outer hair cells (OHCs) driven by sound-induced voltage changes across their membranes. OHC intracellular receptor potentials are electrically low-pass filtered, which should hinder high-frequency hearing. We measured the intracellular and extracellular voltages that control OHC electromotility <I>in vivo</I> in a mouse strain with impaired high-frequency hearing. A gap-junction mutation of the strain rescued high-frequency hearing, increased organ of Corti resistance, and preserved large OHC extracellular receptor potentials but reduced OHC intracellular receptor potentials and impaired low-frequency hearing. We concluded intracellular potentials drive OHC motility at low frequencies and extracellular receptor potentials drive OHC motility and cochlear amplification at high frequencies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Somatotopy of Mouse Spinothalamic Innervation and the Localization of a Noxious Stimulus Requires Deleted in Colorectal Carcinoma Expression by Phox2a Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Anterolateral system (AS) neurons transmit pain signals from the spinal cord to the brain. Their morphology, anatomy, and physiological properties have been extensively characterized and suggest that specific AS neurons and their brain targets are concerned with the discriminatory aspects of noxious stimuli, such as their location or intensity, and their motivational/emotive dimension. Among the recently unraveled molecular markers of AS neurons is the developmentally expressed transcription factor Phox2a, providing us with the opportunity to selectively disrupt the embryonic wiring of AS neurons to gain insights into the logic of their adult function. As mice with a spinal-cord-specific loss of the netrin-1 receptor deleted in colorectal carcinoma (DCC) have increased AS neuron innervation of ipsilateral brain targets and defective noxious stimulus localization or topognosis, we generated mice of either sex carrying a deletion of <I>Dcc</I> in Phox2a neurons. Such <I>Dcc<sup>Phox2a</sup></I> mice displayed impaired topognosis along the rostrocaudal axis but with little effect on left-right discrimination and normal aversive responses. Anatomical tracing experiments in <I>Dcc<sup>Phox2a</sup></I> mice revealed defective targeting of cervical and lumbar AS axons within the thalamus. Furthermore, genetic labeling of AS axons revealed their expression of DCC on their arrival in the brain, at a time when many of their target neurons are being born and express <I>Ntn1</I>. Our experiments suggest a postcommissural crossing function for netrin-1:DCC signaling during the formation of somatotopically ordered maps and are consistent with a discriminatory function of some of the Phox2a AS neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How nociceptive (pain) signals are relayed from the body to the brain remains an important question relevant to our understanding of the basic physiology of pain perception. Previous studies have demonstrated that the AS is a main effector of this function. It is composed of AS neurons located in the spinal cord that receive signals from nociceptive sensory neurons that detect noxious stimuli. In this study, we generate a genetic miswiring of mouse AS neurons that results in a decreased ability to perceive the location of a painful stimulus. The precise nature of this defect sheds light on the function of different kinds of AS neurons and how pain information may be organized.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Activity-Induced Cortical Glutamatergic Neuron Nascent Proteins</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuronal activity initiates signaling cascades that culminate in diverse outcomes including structural and functional neuronal plasticity, and metabolic changes. While studies have revealed activity-dependent neuronal cell type-specific transcriptional changes, unbiased quantitative analysis of cell-specific activity-induced dynamics in newly synthesized proteins (NSPs) synthesis <I>in vivo</I> has been complicated by cellular heterogeneity and a relatively low abundance of NSPs within the proteome in the brain. Here we combined targeted expression of mutant MetRS (methionine tRNA synthetase) in genetically defined cortical glutamatergic neurons with tight temporal control of treatment with the noncanonical amino acid, azidonorleucine, to biotinylate NSPs within a short period after pharmacologically induced seizure in male and female mice. By purifying peptides tagged with heavy or light biotin-alkynes and using direct tandem mass spectrometry detection of biotinylated peptides, we quantified activity-induced changes in cortical glutamatergic neuron NSPs. Seizure triggered significant changes in ~300 NSPs, 33% of which were decreased by seizure. Proteins mediating excitatory and inhibitory synaptic plasticity, including SynGAP1, Pak3, GEPH1, Copine-6, and collybistin, and DNA and chromatin remodeling proteins, including Rad21, Smarca2, and Ddb1, are differentially synthesized in response to activity. Proteins likely to play homeostatic roles in response to activity, such as regulators of proteastasis, intracellular ion control, and cytoskeleton remodeling proteins, are activity induced. Conversely, seizure decreased newly synthetized NCAM, among others, suggesting that seizure induced degradation. Overall, we identified quantitative changes in the activity-induced nascent proteome from genetically defined cortical glutamatergic neurons as a strategy to discover downstream mediators of neuronal plasticity and generate hypotheses regarding their function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Activity-induced neuronal and synaptic plasticity are mediated by changes in the protein landscape, including changes in the activity-induced newly synthesized proteins; however, identifying neuronal cell type-specific nascent proteome dynamics in the intact brain has been technically challenging. We conducted an unbiased proteomic screen from which we identified significant activity-induced changes in ~300 newly synthesized proteins in genetically defined cortical glutamatergic neurons within 20 h after pharmacologically induced seizure. Bioinformatic analysis of the dynamic nascent proteome indicates that the newly synthesized proteins play diverse roles in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic plasticity, chromatin remodeling, homeostatic mechanisms, and proteasomal and metabolic functions, extending our understanding of the diversity of plasticity mechanisms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Visual Deprivation Selectively Reduces Thalamic Reticular Nucleus-Mediated Inhibition of the Auditory Thalamus in Adults</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sensory loss leads to widespread cross-modal plasticity across brain areas to allow the remaining senses to guide behavior. While multimodal sensory interactions are often attributed to higher-order sensory areas, cross-modal plasticity has been observed at the level of synaptic changes even across primary sensory cortices. In particular, vision loss leads to widespread circuit adaptation in the primary auditory cortex (A1) even in adults. Here we report using mice of both sexes in which cross-modal plasticity occurs even earlier in the sensory-processing pathway at the level of the thalamus in a modality-selective manner. A week of visual deprivation reduced inhibitory synaptic transmission from the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) to the primary auditory thalamus (MGBv) without changes to the primary visual thalamus (dLGN). The plasticity of TRN inhibition to MGBv was observed as a reduction in postsynaptic gain and short-term depression. There was no observable plasticity of the cortical feedback excitatory synaptic transmission from the primary visual cortex to dLGN or TRN and A1 to MGBv, which suggests that the visual deprivation-induced plasticity occurs predominantly at the level of thalamic inhibition. We provide evidence that visual deprivation-induced change in the short-term depression of TRN inhibition to MGBv involves endocannabinoid CB1 receptors. TRN inhibition is considered critical for sensory gating, selective attention, and multimodal performances; hence, its plasticity has implications for sensory processing. Our results suggest that selective disinhibition and altered short-term dynamics of TRN inhibition in the spared thalamic nucleus support cross-modal plasticity in the adult brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Losing vision triggers adaptation of the brain to enhance the processing of the remaining senses, which can be observed as better auditory performance in blind subjects. We previously found that depriving vision of adult rodents produces widespread circuit reorganization in the primary auditory cortex and enhances auditory processing at a neural level. Here we report that visual deprivation-induced plasticity in adults occurs much earlier in the auditory pathway, at the level of thalamic inhibition. Sensory processing is largely gated at the level of the thalamus via strong cortical feedback inhibition mediated through the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). We found that TRN inhibition of the auditory thalamus is selectively reduced by visual deprivation, thus playing a role in adult cross-modal plasticity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cortical Ripples during NREM Sleep and Waking in Humans</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hippocampal ripples index the reconstruction of spatiotemporal neuronal firing patterns essential for the consolidation of memories in the cortex during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM). Recently, cortical ripples in humans have been shown to enfold the replay of neuron firing patterns during cued recall. Here, using intracranial recordings from 18 patients (12 female), we show that cortical ripples also occur during NREM in humans, with similar density, oscillation frequency (~90 Hz), duration, and amplitude to waking. Ripples occurred in all cortical regions with similar characteristics, unrelated to putative hippocampal connectivity, and were less dense and robust in higher association areas. Putative pyramidal and interneuron spiking phase-locked to cortical ripples during NREM, with phase delays consistent with ripple generation through pyramidal&ndash;interneuron feedback. Cortical ripples were smaller in amplitude than hippocampal ripples but were similar in density, frequency, and duration. Cortical ripples during NREM typically occurred just before the upstate peak, often during spindles. Upstates and spindles have previously been associated with memory consolidation, and we found that cortical ripples grouped cofiring between units within the window of spike timing-dependent plasticity. Thus, human NREM cortical ripples are as follows: ubiquitous and stereotyped with a tightly focused oscillation frequency; similar to hippocampal ripples; associated with upstates and spindles; and associated with unit cofiring. These properties are consistent with cortical ripples possibly contributing to memory consolidation and other functions during NREM in humans.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In rodents, hippocampal ripples organize replay during sleep to promote memory consolidation in the cortex, where ripples also occur. However, evidence for cortical ripples in human sleep is limited, and their anatomic distribution and physiological properties are unexplored. Here, using human intracranial recordings, we demonstrate that ripples occur throughout the cortex during waking and sleep with highly stereotyped characteristics. During sleep, cortical ripples tend to occur during spindles on the down-to-upstate transition, and thus participate in a sequence of sleep waves that is important for consolidation. Furthermore, cortical ripples organize single-unit spiking with timing optimal to facilitate plasticity. Therefore, cortical ripples in humans possess essential physiological properties to support memory and other cognitive functions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Retrosplenial and Hippocampal Synchrony during Retrieval of Old Memories in Macaques</a></h4>

              
                <p>Memory for events from the distant past relies on multiple brain regions, but little is known about the underlying neural dynamics that give rise to such abilities. We recorded neural activity in the hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex of two female rhesus macaques as they visually selected targets in year-old and newly acquired object-scene associations. Whereas hippocampal activity was unchanging with memory age, the retrosplenial cortex responded with greater magnitude alpha oscillations (10&ndash;15 Hz) and greater phase locking to memory-guided eye movements during retrieval of old events. A similar old-memory enhancement was observed in the anterior cingulate cortex but in a beta2/gamma band (28&ndash;35 Hz). In contrast, remote retrieval was associated with decreased gamma-band synchrony between the hippocampus and each neocortical area. The increasing retrosplenial alpha oscillation and decreasing hippocampocortical synchrony with memory age may signify a shift in frank memory allocation or, alternatively, changes in selection among distributed memory representations in the primate brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Memory depends on multiple brain regions, whose involvement is thought to change with time. Here, we recorded neuronal population activity from the hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex as nonhuman primates searched for objects embedded in scenes. These memoranda were either newly presented or a year old. Remembering old material drove stronger oscillations in the retrosplenial cortex and led to a greater locking of neural activity to search movements. Remembering new material revealed stronger oscillatory synchrony between the hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex. These results suggest that with age, memories may come to rely more exclusively on neocortical oscillations for retrieval and search guidance and less on long-range coupling with the hippocampus.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Structure-Function Dissociations of Human Hippocampal Subfield Stiffness and Memory Performance</a></h4>

              
                <p>Aging and neurodegenerative diseases lead to decline in thinking and memory ability. The subfields of the hippocampus (HCsf) play important roles in memory formation and recall. Imaging techniques sensitive to the underlying HCsf tissue microstructure can reveal unique structure&ndash;function associations and their vulnerability in aging and disease. The goal of this study was to use magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), a noninvasive MR imaging-based technique that can quantitatively image the viscoelastic mechanical properties of tissue to determine the associations of HCsf stiffness with different cognitive domains across the lifespan. Eighty-eight adult participants completed the study (age 23&ndash;81 years, male/female 36/51), in which we aimed to determine which HCsf regions most strongly correlated with different memory performance outcomes and if viscoelasticity of specific HCsf regions mediated the relationship between age and performance. Our results revealed that both interference cost on a verbal memory task and relational memory task performance were significantly related to cornu ammonis 1&ndash;2 (CA1&ndash;CA2) stiffness (<I>p</I> = 0.018 and <I>p</I> = 0.011, respectively), with CA1&ndash;CA2 stiffness significantly mediating the relationship between age and interference cost performance (<I>p</I> = 0.031). There were also significant associations between delayed free verbal recall performance and stiffness of both the dentate gyrus&ndash;cornu ammonis 3 (DG&ndash;CA3; <I>p</I> = 0.016) and subiculum (SUB; <I>p</I> = 0.032) regions. This further exemplifies the functional specialization of HCsf in declarative memory and the potential use of MRE measures as clinical biomarkers in assessing brain health in aging and disease.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hippocampal subfields are cytoarchitecturally unique structures involved in distinct aspects of memory processing. Magnetic resonance elastography is a technique that can noninvasively image tissue viscoelastic mechanical properties, potentially serving as sensitive biomarkers of aging and neurodegeneration related to functional outcomes. High-resolution <I>in vivo</I> imaging has invigorated interest in determining subfield functional specialization and their differential vulnerability in aging and disease. Applying MRE to probe subfield-specific cognitive correlates will indicate that measures of subfield stiffness can determine the integrity of structures supporting specific domains of memory performance. These findings will further validate our high-resolution MRE method and support the potential use of subfield stiffness measures as clinical biomarkers in classifying aging and disease states.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">History of Previous Midlife Estradiol Treatment Permanently Alters Interactions of Brain Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 Signaling and Hippocampal Estrogen Synthesis to Enhance Cognitive Aging in a Rat Model of Menopause</a></h4>

              
                <p>Across species, including humans, elevated levels of brain estrogen receptor (ER) &alpha; are associated with enhanced cognitive aging, even in the absence of circulating estrogens. In rodents, short-term estrogen treatment, such as that commonly used in the menopausal transition, results in long-term increases in ER&alpha; levels in the hippocampus, leading to enhanced memory long after termination of estrogen treatment. However, mechanisms by which increased levels of brain ER&alpha; enhances cognitive aging remain unclear. Here we demonstrate in aging female rats that insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which can activate ER via ligand-independent mechanisms, requires concomitant synthesis of brain-derived neuroestrogens to phosphorylate ER&alpha; via MAPK signaling, ultimately resulting in enhanced memory. In a rat model of menopause involving long-term ovarian hormone deprivation, hippocampal neuroestrogen activity decreases, altering IGF-1 activity and resulting in impaired memory. However, this process is reversed by short-term estradiol treatment. Forty days of estradiol exposure following ovariectomy results in maintenance of neuroestrogen levels that persist beyond the period of hormone treatment, allowing for continued interactions between IGF-1 and neuroestrogen signaling, elevated levels of hippocampal ER&alpha;, and ultimately enhanced memory. Collectively, results demonstrate that short-term estradiol use following loss of ovarian function has long-lasting effects on hippocampal function and memory by dynamically regulating cellular mechanisms that promote activity of ER&alpha; in the absence of circulating estrogens. Translational impacts of these findings suggest lasting cognitive benefits of short-term estrogen use near menopause and highlight the importance of hippocampal ER&alpha;, independent from the role of circulating estrogens, in regulating memory in aging females.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Declines in ovarian hormones following menopause coincide with increased risk of cognitive decline. Because of potential health risks, current recommendations are that menopausal estrogen therapy be limited to a few years. Long-term consequences for the brain and memory of this short-term midlife estrogen therapy are unclear. Here, in a rodent model of menopause, we determined mechanisms by which short-term midlife estrogen exposure can enhance hippocampal function and memory with cognitive benefits and molecular changes enduring long after termination of estrogen exposure. Our model indicates long-lasting benefits of maintaining hippocampal estrogen receptor function in the absence of ongoing estrogen exposure and suggests potential strategies for combating age-related cognitive decline.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">CBP Is Required for Establishing Adaptive Gene Programs in the Adult Mouse Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Environmental factors and life experiences impinge on brain circuits triggering adaptive changes. Epigenetic regulators contribute to this neuroadaptation by enhancing or suppressing specific gene programs. The paralogous transcriptional coactivators and lysine acetyltransferases CREB binding protein (CBP) and p300 are involved in brain plasticity and stimulus-dependent transcription, but their specific roles in neuroadaptation are not fully understood. Here we investigated the impact of eliminating either CBP or p300 in excitatory neurons of the adult forebrain of mice from both sexes using inducible and cell type-restricted knock-out strains. The elimination of CBP, but not p300, reduced the expression and chromatin acetylation of plasticity genes, dampened activity-driven transcription, and caused memory deficits. The defects became more prominent in elderly mice and in paradigms that involved enduring changes in transcription, such as kindling and environmental enrichment, in which CBP loss interfered with the establishment of activity-induced transcriptional and epigenetic changes in response to stimulus or experience. These findings further strengthen the link between CBP deficiency in excitatory neurons and etiopathology in the nervous system.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How environmental conditions and life experiences impinge on mature brain circuits to elicit adaptive responses that favor the survival of the organism remains an outstanding question in neurosciences. Epigenetic regulators are thought to contribute to neuroadaptation by initiating or enhancing adaptive gene programs. In this article, we examined the role of CREB binding protein (CBP) and p300, two paralogous transcriptional coactivators and histone acetyltransferases involved in cognitive processes and intellectual disability, in neuroadaptation in adult hippocampal circuits. Our experiments demonstrate that CBP, but not its paralog p300, plays a highly specific role in the epigenetic regulation of neuronal plasticity gene programs in response to stimulus and provide unprecedented insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying neuroadaptation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Peripheral Auditory Nerve Impairment in a Mouse Model of Syndromic Autism</a></h4>

              
                <p>Dysfunction of the peripheral auditory nerve (AN) contributes to dynamic changes throughout the central auditory system, resulting in abnormal auditory processing, including hypersensitivity. Altered sound sensitivity is frequently observed in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), suggesting that AN deficits and changes in auditory information processing may contribute to ASD-associated symptoms, including social communication deficits and hyperacusis. The MEF2C transcription factor is associated with risk for several neurodevelopmental disorders, and mutations or deletions of <I>MEF2C</I> produce a haploinsufficiency syndrome characterized by ASD, language, and cognitive deficits. A mouse model of this syndromic ASD (<I>Mef2c</I>-Het) recapitulates many of the <I>MEF2C</I> haploinsufficiency syndrome-linked behaviors, including communication deficits. We show here that <I>Mef2c</I>-Het mice of both sexes exhibit functional impairment of the peripheral AN and a modest reduction in hearing sensitivity. We find that MEF2C is expressed during development in multiple AN and cochlear cell types; and in <I>Mef2c</I>-Het mice, we observe multiple cellular and molecular alterations associated with the AN, including abnormal myelination, neuronal degeneration, neuronal mitochondria dysfunction, and increased macrophage activation and cochlear inflammation. These results reveal the importance of MEF2C function in inner ear development and function and the engagement of immune cells and other non-neuronal cells, which suggests that microglia/macrophages and other non-neuronal cells might contribute, directly or indirectly, to AN dysfunction and ASD-related phenotypes. Finally, our study establishes a comprehensive approach for characterizing AN function at the physiological, cellular, and molecular levels in mice, which can be applied to animal models with a wide range of human auditory processing impairments.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This is the first report of peripheral auditory nerve (AN) impairment in a mouse model of human <I>MEF2C</I> haploinsufficiency syndrome that has well-characterized ASD-related behaviors, including communication deficits, hyperactivity, repetitive behavior, and social deficits. We identify multiple underlying cellular, subcellular, and molecular abnormalities that may contribute to peripheral AN impairment. Our findings also highlight the important roles of immune cells (e.g., cochlear macrophages) and other non-neuronal elements (e.g., glial cells and cells in the stria vascularis) in auditory impairment in ASD. The methodological significance of the study is the establishment of a comprehensive approach for evaluating peripheral AN function and impact of peripheral AN deficits with minimal hearing loss.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Loss of Activity-Induced Mitochondrial ATP Production Underlies the Synaptic Defects in a Drosophila Model of ALS</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mutations in the gene encoding vesicle-associated membrane protein B (VAPB) cause a familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Expression of an ALS-related variant of <I>vapb</I> (<I>vapb<sup>P58S</sup></I>) in <I>Drosophila</I> motor neurons results in morphologic changes at the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) characterized by the appearance of fewer, but larger, presynaptic boutons. Although diminished microtubule stability is known to underlie these morphologic changes, a mechanism for the loss of presynaptic microtubules has been lacking. By studying flies of both sexes, we demonstrate the suppression of <I>vapb<sup>P58S</sup></I>-induced changes in NMJ morphology by either a loss of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channels or the inhibition Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin (CaM)-activated kinase II (CaMKII). These data suggest that decreased stability of presynaptic microtubules at <I>vapb<sup>P58S</sup></I> NMJs results from hyperactivation of CaMKII because of elevated cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. We attribute the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dyshomeostasis to delayed extrusion of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Suggesting that this defect in Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion arose from an insufficient response to the bioenergetic demand of neural activity, depolarization-induced mitochondrial ATP production was diminished in <I>vapb<sup>P58S</sup></I> neurons. These findings point to bioenergetic dysfunction as a potential cause for the synaptic defects in <I>vapb<sup>P58S</sup></I>-expressing motor neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Whether the synchrony between the rates of ATP production and demand is lost in degenerating neurons remains poorly understood. We report that expression of a gene equivalent to an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-causing variant of vesicle-associated membrane protein B (VAPB) in fly neurons decouples mitochondrial ATP production from neuronal activity. Consequently, levels of ATP in mutant neurons are unable to keep up with the bioenergetic burden of neuronal activity. Reduced rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion, which could result from insufficient energy to power Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPases, results in the accumulation of residual Ca<sup>2+</sup> in mutant neurons and leads to alterations in synaptic vesicle (SV) release and synapse development. These findings suggest that synaptic defects in a model of ALS arise from the loss of activity-induced ATP production.</p>

                Background: Airborne transmission is the spread of an infectious agent caused by the dissemination of droplet nuclei (aerosols) that remain infectious when suspended in the air. We carried out a systematic review to identify, appraise and summarise the evidence from studies of the role of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We searched LitCovid, MedRxiv, Google Scholar and the WHO Covid-19 database from 1 February 2020 to 30 May 2022 and included studies on airborne transmission. Data were dual extracted, and we assessed quality using a modified QUADAS 2 risk of bias tool. Results: We included 128 primary studies and 29 reviews on airborne SARS-CoV-2. Of the 128 primary studies, 105 (82%) reported data on RT-PCR from air samples, 28 (22%) report cycle threshold values and 36 (28%) copies per sample volume. All primary studies were observational. The research often lacked standard methods, standard sampling sizes and reporting items. We found 69 descriptions of different air samplers deployed. Of the 80 in-hospital studies that reported binary RT-PCR tests, 362/3079 air samples from 75 studies conducted in hospital ward environments were positive (median 8%, IQR=0 to 23%); 23 studies reported 74/703 RT-PCR positive air samples in the ICU setting (median 17%, IQR=0% to 38%) Thirty-eight studies reported potential air transmission in the outdoors or in the community. Twenty-six studies attempted viral culture, none of which definitively demonstrated that replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 could be recovered in the air. Conclusion:  SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detectable intermittently in the air in various settings. Standardized guidelines for conducting and reporting research on airborne transmission are needed. The lack of recoverable viral culture of SARS-CoV-2 from air samples prevents firm conclusions about the definitive role of airborne transmission in SARS-CoV-2.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Hypoxic preconditioning promotes survival of human adipose derived mesenchymal stem cell via expression of prosurvival and proangiogenic biomarkers [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Contributing factors for improved survival of human adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (h-AMSCs) cultured through hypoxia preconditioning, in example apoptosis inhibition involving BCL2 and HSP27 expression, trigger signal expression (VEGF), SCF expression, OCT-4 expression, and CD44+ expression. The objective if this study was to explain the mechanism and role of hypoxic preconditioning and the optimal duration of hypoxic preconditioning exposure to improve survival of h-AMSCs. Methods: An experimental laboratory explorative study (in vitro) with hypoxic preconditioning in h-AMSCs cultures. This research was conducted through four stages. First, isolation of h-AMSCs culture from adipose tissue of patients. Second, the characterization of h-AMSCs from adipose tissue by phenotype (flowcytometry) through CD44+, CD90+ and CD45-expression before being pre-conditioned for hypoxic treatment. Third, the hypoxic preconditioning in h-AMSCs culture (in vitro) was performed with an oxygen concentration of 1% for 24, 48 and 72 hours. Fourth, observation of survival from h-AMSCs culture was tested on the role of CD44+, VEGF, SCF, OCT-4, BCL2, HSP27 with Flowcytometry and apoptotic inhibition by Tunnel Assay method. Results: The result of regression test showed that time difference had an effect on VEGF expression (p<0.001;β=-0.482) and hypoxia condition also influenced VEGF expression (p<0.001;β=0.774). The result of path analysis showed that SCF had effect on OCT-4 expression (p<0.001; β=0.985). The regression test results showed that time effects on HSP27 expression (p<0.001; β=0.398) and hypoxia precondition also affects HSP27 expression (p<0.001; β=0.847). Pathway analysis showed that BCL2 expression inhibited apoptosis (p=0.030; β=-0.442) and HSP27 expression also inhibited apoptosis (p<0,001;β=-0.487). Conclusion: Hypoxic preconditioning of h-AMSC culture has proven to increase the expression of VEGF, SCF, OCT-4, and BCL2 and HSP27. This study demonstrated and explained the existence of a new mechanism of increased h-AMSC survival in cultures with hypoxic preconditioning (O2 1%) via VEGF, SCF, OCT-4, BCL2, and HSP 27.

                In this study we quantify the accuracy of scoring the quality of research grants using a finite set of distinct categories (1, 2, …., k), when the unobserved grant score is a continuous random variable comprising a true quality score and measurement error, both normally distributed. We vary the number of categories, the number of assessors that score the same grant and a signal-to-noise ratio parameter. We show that the loss of information of scoring a small number of categories (k > 5) compared to scoring on a continuous scale is very small, so that increasing the number of scoring categories is unlikely to lead to an improvement in the outcomes of scoring systems. In addition, we model the effect of grant assessors scoring too close to the mean and show that this results in only a very small reduction in the accuracy of scoring.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Chemical equilibrium model comprising calcaneus bone mineral density, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and physical work capacity in premenopausal women [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: During menopause, bone density decreases, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) rapidly increases; a decrease in the estrogen level is a common factor in these phenomena. Methods: In this study, we focused on the fact that menopause is a spontaneous process, and aimed to derive the conditions that mitigate the decline in the osteo sono-assessment index (OSI), an index of bone mineral density (BMD), using a chemical equilibrium model. We attempted to establish the relationship between variables related to female hormone secretion (OSI, LDL-C) and a variable related to work capacity (physical work capacity [PWC] at 75% of maximal heart rate) by analogy, using the fact that Gibbs free energy, a thermodynamic variable related to spontaneous change, is related by three variables. Results: Consequently, if linearity is established between PWC and OSI when LDL-C is used as the standard, then the analogy of chemical equilibrium can be established between the deviation values of these three variables, with equilibrium constant K. Finally, the theoretically determined equilibrium model with constant K was applied to data obtained from the Sports Program Service (SPS) of the Yokohama Sports Medical Center. Conclusions: The present study suggests that the decrease in bone density could be alleviated by promoting an increase in LDL-C or by mitigating the decrease in PWC. In discussing personal health, mitigating bone density loss and maintaining a high work capacity are important components, which should also take into account the appropriate levels of LDL-C.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">DPCfam: Unsupervised protein family classification by Density Peak Clustering of large sequence datasets</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Elena Tea Russo, Federico Barone, Alex Bateman, Stefano Cozzini, Marco Punta, Alessandro Laio</p>

Proteins that are known only at a sequence level outnumber those with an experimental characterization by orders of magnitude. Classifying protein regions (domains) into homologous families can generate testable functional hypotheses for yet unannotated sequences. Existing domain family resources typically use at least some degree of manual curation: they grow slowly over time and leave a large fraction of the protein sequence space unclassified. We here describe automatic clustering by Density Peak Clustering of UniRef50 v. 2017_07, a protein sequence database including approximately 23M sequences. We performed a radical re-implementation of a pipeline we previously developed in order to allow handling millions of sequences and data volumes of the order of 3 TeraBytes. The modified pipeline, which we call DPCfam, finds ∼ 45,000 protein clusters in UniRef50. Our automatic classification is in close correspondence to the ones of the Pfam and ECOD resources: in particular, about 81% of medium-large Pfam families and 80% of ECOD families can be mapped to clusters generated by DPCfam. In addition, our protocol finds more than 14,000 clusters constituted of protein regions with no Pfam annotation, which are therefore candidates for representing novel protein families. These results are made available to the scientific community through a dedicated repository.

Microphysiological systems (MPS) are powerful tools for emulating human physiology and replicating disease progression <i>in vitro</i>. MPS could be better predictors of human outcome than current animal models, but mechanistic interpretation and <i>in vivo</i> extrapolation of the experimental results remain significant challenges. Here, we address these challenges using an integrated experimental-computational approach. This approach allows for <i>in silico</i> representation and predictions of glucose metabolism in a previously reported MPS with two organ compartments (liver and pancreas) connected in a closed loop with circulating medium. We developed a computational model describing glucose metabolism over 15 days of culture in the MPS. The model was calibrated on an experiment-specific basis using data from seven experiments, where HepaRG single-liver or liver-islet cultures were exposed to both normal and hyperglycemic conditions resembling high blood glucose levels in diabetes. The calibrated models reproduced the fast (i.e. hourly) variations in glucose and insulin observed in the MPS experiments, as well as the long-term (i.e. over weeks) decline in both glucose tolerance and insulin secretion. We also investigated the behaviour of the system under hypoglycemia by simulating this condition in <i>silico</i>, and the model could correctly predict the glucose and insulin responses measured in new MPS experiments. Last, we used the computational model to translate the experimental results to humans, showing good agreement with published data of the glucose response to a meal in healthy subjects. The integrated experimental-computational framework opens new avenues for future investigations toward disease mechanisms and the development of new therapies for metabolic disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Ab initio predictions for 3D structure and stability of single- and double-stranded DNAs in ion solutions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Zi-Chun Mu, Ya-Lan Tan, Ben-Gong Zhang, Jie Liu, Ya-Zhou Shi</p>

The three-dimensional (3D) structure and stability of DNA are essential to understand/control their biological functions and aid the development of novel materials. In this work, we present a coarse-grained (CG) model for DNA based on the RNA CG model proposed by us, to predict 3D structures and stability for both dsDNA and ssDNA from the sequence. Combined with a Monte Carlo simulated annealing algorithm and CG force fields involving the sequence-dependent base-pairing/stacking interactions and an implicit electrostatic potential, the present model successfully folds 20 dsDNAs (≤52nt) and 20 ssDNAs (≤74nt) into the corresponding native-like structures just from their sequences, with an overall mean RMSD of 3.4Å from the experimental structures. For DNAs with various lengths and sequences, the present model can make reliable predictions on stability, e.g., for 27 dsDNAs with/without bulge/internal loops and 24 ssDNAs including pseudoknot, the mean deviation of predicted melting temperatures from the corresponding experimental data is only ~2.0°C. Furthermore, the model also quantificationally predicts the effects of monovalent or divalent ions on the structure stability of ssDNAs/dsDNAs.

                Background: The academic environment is critical for advancing knowledge through research and training of students who will serve as researchers, advocates, and leaders in the future, yet there is limited data on how the higher institution-based research enterprise is being impacted by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The current study examines the perceived and expected impact of COVID-19 on engaging in a higher education institution setting, particularly focusing on student engagement in research and conduct of human subject research (HSR). Method: The authors collected an online survey with faculty and staff in a large US university system focused on education, research, and service (6/8/2020-7/10/2020; N=709). The authors performed bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models to examine the differences in research impact by HSR. Results: The majority of survey respondents (i.e., faculty and staff from a large US university system) perceived and expected at least some impact of COVID-19 on research and reported the impact to be negative. Researchers reported increased challenges in recruiting students for research activities and providing research-related learning opportunities for students. While COVID-19 impacted both HSR and non-HSR, HSR investigators have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. Conclusions: Efforts are needed to further understand and overcome research challenges so that the university-based research environment can flourish for all researchers across disciplines and overcome the potentially lost learning opportunities for students. Lessons learned will help address future challenges to academic research activities and providing student research training.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Arithmetic in the signing brain: Differences and similarities in arithmetic processing between deaf signers and hearing non‐signers</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Deaf signers and hearing non-signers have previously been shown to recruit partially different brain regions during simple arithmetic. In light of the triple code model, the differences were interpreted as relating to stronger recruitment of the verbal system of numerical processing, that is, left angular and inferior frontal gyrus, in hearing non-signers, and of the quantity system of numerical processing, that is, right horizontal intraparietal sulcus, for deaf signers. The main aim of the present study was to better understand similarities and differences in the neural correlates supporting arithmetic in deaf compared to hearing individuals. Twenty-nine adult deaf signers and 29 hearing non-signers were enrolled in an functional magnetic resonance imaging study of simple and difficult subtraction and multiplication. Brain imaging data were analyzed using whole-brain analysis, region of interest analysis, and functional connectivity analysis. Although the groups were matched on age, gender, and nonverbal intelligence, the deaf group performed generally poorer than the hearing group in arithmetic. Nevertheless, we found generally similar networks to be involved for both groups, the only exception being the involvement of the left inferior frontal gyrus. This region was activated significantly stronger for the hearing compared to the deaf group but showed stronger functional connectivity with the left superior temporal gyrus in the deaf, compared to the hearing, group. These results lend no support to increased recruitment of the quantity system in deaf signers. Perhaps the reason for performance differences is to be found in other brain regions not included in the original triple code model.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Methods to study adult hippocampal neurogenesis in humans and across the phylogeny</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus hosts the continuous addition of new neurons throughout life—a phenomenon named adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). Here we revisit the occurrence of AHN in more than 110 mammalian species, including humans, and discuss the further validation of these data by single-cell RNAseq and other alternative techniques. In this regard, our recent studies have addressed the long-standing controversy in the field, namely whether cells positive for AHN markers are present in the adult human dentate gyrus (DG). Here we review how we developed a tightly controlled methodology, based on the use of high-quality brain samples (characterized by short postmortem delays and ≤24 h of fixation in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde), to address human AHN. We review that the detection of AHN markers in samples fixed for 24 h required mild antigen retrieval and chemical elimination of autofluorescence. However, these steps were not necessary for samples subjected to shorter fixation periods. Moreover, the detection of labile epitopes (such as Nestin) in the human hippocampus required the use of mild detergents. The application of this strictly controlled methodology allowed reconstruction of the entire AHN process, thus revealing the presence of neural stem cells, proliferative progenitors, neuroblasts, and immature neurons at distinct stages of differentiation in the human DG. The data reviewed here demonstrate that methodology is of utmost importance when studying AHN by means of distinct techniques across the phylogenetic scale. In this regard, we summarize the major findings made by our group that emphasize that overlooking fundamental technical principles might have consequences for any given research field.</p>

                The hypothalamus is a brain region that integrates signals from the periphery and the environment to maintain organismal homeostasis. To do so, specialized hypothalamic neuropeptidergic neurons control a range of processes, such as sleep, feeding, the stress response, and hormone release. These processes are altered with age, which can affect longevity and contribute to disease status. Technological advances, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, are upending assumptions about the transcriptional identity of cell types in the hypothalamus and revealing how distinct cell types change with age.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Nested mechanosensory feedback actively damps visually guided head movements in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Executing agile locomotion requires animals to integrate sensory feedback, often from multiple sources. For example, human gaze is mediated by multiple feedback loops that integrate visual and vestibular information. A central challenge in studying biological feedback loops is that they are nested and dynamically coupled. Here, we develop a framework based on control theory for unraveling nested feedback systems and apply it to study gaze stabilization in the fruit fly (Drosophila). By combining experimental and mathematical methods to manipulate control topologies, we uncovered the role of body-generated mechanosensory feedback nested within visual feedback in the control of head movements. We discovered that visual feedback changed the tuning of head movements across visual motion frequencies whereas mechanosensory feedback damped head movements. Head saccades had slower dynamics when the body was free to move, further pointing to the role of damping via mechanosensory feedback. By comparing head responses between self-generated and externally generated body motion, we revealed a nonlinear gating of mechanosensory feedback that is motor-context dependent. Altogether, our findings reveal the role of nested feedback loops in flies and uncover mechanisms that reconcile differences in head kinematics between body-free and body-fixed flies. Our framework is generalizable to biological and robotic systems relying on nested feedback control for guiding locomotion.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Architecture of the chikungunya virus replication organelle</a></h4>

              
                <i>Alphaviruses</i> are mosquito-borne viruses that cause serious disease in humans and other mammals. Along with its mosquito vector, the <i>Alphaviru</i>s chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has spread explosively in the last 20 years, and there is no approved treatment for chikungunya fever. On the plasma membrane of the infected cell, CHIKV generates dedicated organelles for viral RNA replication, so-called spherules. Whereas structures exist for several viral proteins that make up the spherule, the architecture of the full organelle is unknown. Here, we use cryo-electron tomography to image CHIKV spherules in their cellular context. This reveals that the viral protein nsP1 serves as a base for the assembly of a larger protein complex at the neck of the membrane bud. Biochemical assays show that the viral helicase-protease nsP2, while having no membrane affinity on its own, is recruited to membranes by nsP1. The tomograms further reveal that full-sized spherules contain a single copy of the viral genome in double-stranded form. Finally, we present a mathematical model that explains the membrane remodeling of the spherule in terms of the pressure exerted on the membrane by the polymerizing RNA, which provides a good agreement with the experimental data. The energy released by RNA polymerization is found to be sufficient to remodel the membrane to the characteristic spherule shape.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Single-cell analysis of skeletal muscle macrophages reveals age-associated functional subpopulations</a></h4>

              
                Tissue-resident macrophages represent a group of highly responsive innate immune cells that acquire diverse functions by polarizing towards distinct subpopulations. The subpopulations of macrophages that reside in skeletal muscle (SKM) and their changes during aging are poorly characterized. By single-cell transcriptomic analysis with unsupervised clustering, we found eleven distinct macrophage clusters in male mouse SKM with enriched gene expression programs linked to reparative, proinflammatory, phagocytotic, proliferative, and senescence-associated functions. Using a complementary classification, membrane markers LYVE1 and MHCII identified four macrophage subgroups: LYVE1-/MHCII<sup>hi</sup> (M1-like, classically activated), LYVE1+/MHCII<sup>lo</sup> (M2-like, alternatively activated), and two new subgroups, LYVE1+/MHCII<sup>hi</sup> and LYVE1-/MHCII<sup>lo</sup>. Notably, one new subgroup, LYVE1+/MHCII<sup>hi</sup>, had traits of both M2 and M1 macrophages, while the other new subgroup, LYVE1-/MHCII<sup>lo</sup>, displayed strong phagocytotic capacity. Flow cytometric analysis validated the presence of the four macrophage subgroups in SKM, and found that LYVE1- macrophages were more abundant than LYVE1+ macrophages in old SKM. A striking increase in proinflammatory markers (<i>S100a8</i> and <i>S100a9</i> mRNAs) and senescence-related markers (<i>Gpnmb</i> and <i>Spp1</i> mRNAs) was evident in macrophage clusters from older mice. In sum, we have identified dynamically polarized SKM macrophages and propose that specific macrophage subpopulations contribute to the proinflammatory and senescent traits of old SKM.

                How the cuticles of the roughly 4.5 million species of ecdysozoan animals are constructed is not well understood. Here, we systematically mine gene expression datasets to uncover the spatiotemporal blueprint for how the chitin-based pharyngeal cuticle of the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> is built. We demonstrate that the blueprint correctly predicts expression patterns and functional relevance to cuticle development. We find that as larvae prepare to molt, catabolic enzymes are upregulated and the genes that encode chitin synthase, chitin cross-linkers, and homologs of amyloid regulators subsequently peak in expression. 48% of the gene products secreted during the molt are predicted to be intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), many of which belong to four distinct families whose transcripts are expressed in overlapping waves. These include the IDPAs, IDPBs, and IDPCs, which are introduced for the first time here. All four families have sequence properties that drive phase separation and we demonstrate phase-separation for one exemplar <i>in vitro</i>. This systematic analysis represents the first blueprint for cuticle construction and highlights the massive contribution that phase-separating materials make to the structure.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Therapeutic resistance in acute myeloid leukemia cells is mediated by a novel ATM/mTOR pathway regulating oxidative phosphorylation</a></h4>

              
                While leukemic cells are susceptible to various therapeutic insults, residence in the bone marrow microenvironment typically confers protection from a wide range of drugs. Thus, understanding the unique molecular changes elicited by the marrow is of critical importance towards improving therapeutic outcomes. In the present study, we demonstrate that aberrant activation of oxidative phosphorylation serves to induce therapeutic resistance in FLT3 mutant human AML cells challenged with FLT3 inhibitor drugs. Importantly, our findings show that AML cells are protected from apoptosis following FLT3 inhibition due to marrow-mediated activation of ATM, which in turn up-regulates oxidative phosphorylation via mTOR signaling. mTOR is required for the bone marrow stroma-dependent maintenance of protein translation, with selective polysome enrichment of oxidative phosphorylation transcripts, despite FLT3 inhibition. To investigate the therapeutic significance of this finding, we tested the mTOR inhibitor everolimus in combination with the FLT3 inhibitor quizartinib in primary human AML xenograft models. While marrow resident AML cells were highly resistant to quizartinib alone, the addition of everolimus induced profound reduction in tumor burden and prevented relapse. Taken together, these data provide a novel mechanistic understanding of marrow-based therapeutic resistance, and a promising strategy for improved treatment of FLT3 mutant AML patients.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A conditional strategy for cell-type specific labeling of endogenous excitatory synapses in Drosophila reveals subsynaptic architecture</a></h4>

              
                Chemical neurotransmission occurs at specialized contacts where presynaptic neurotransmitter release machinery apposes clusters of postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors and signaling molecules. A series of elegantly complex events underlies the recruitment of pre- and postsynaptic proteins to sites of neuronal connection and enables the correct three-dimensional synaptic organization that underlies circuit processing and computation. To better study the developmental events of synaptogenesis in individual neurons, we need cell-type specific strategies to visualize the individual proteins at their endogenous levels at synapses. Though such strategies exist for a variety of presynaptic proteins, postsynaptic proteins remain less studied due to a paucity of reagents that allow visualization of endogenous individual postsynapses in a cell-type specific manner. To study excitatory postsynapses, we engineered dlg1[4K], a conditional, epitope-tagged marker of the excitatory postsynaptic density in Drosophila. In combination with binary expression systems, dlg1[4K] effectively labels postsynaptic regions at both peripheral neuromuscular and central synapses in larvae and adults. Using dlg1[4K], we find that distinct rules govern the postsynaptic organization of different adult neuron classes, that multiple binary expression systems can concurrently label pre- and postsynaptic regions of synapses in a cell-type-specific manner, and for the first time, visualize neuronal DLG1 at the neuromuscular junction. These results validate a novel strategy for conditional postsynaptic labeling without the caveats of overexpression and demonstrate new principles of subsynaptic organization. The use of dlg1[4K] marks a notable advancement in studying cell-type specific synaptic organization in Drosophila and the first example of a general postsynaptic marker to complement existing presynaptic strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Two forms of asynchronous release with distinctive spatiotemporal dynamics in central synapses</a></h4>

              
                Asynchronous release is a ubiquitous form of neurotransmitter release that persists for tens to hundreds of milliseconds after an action potential (AP). How asynchronous release is organized and regulated at the synaptic active zone (AZ) remains debatable. Using nanoscale-precision imaging of individual release events in rat hippocampal synapses, we observed two spatially distinct subpopulations of asynchronous events, ~75% of which occurred inside the AZ and with a bias towards the AZ center, while ~25% occurred outside of the functionally defined AZ, i.e., ectopically. The two subpopulations also differed markedly in temporal properties, with ectopic events occurring at significantly longer time intervals from synchronous events. Both forms of asynchronous release did not, to a large extent, utilize the same release sites as synchronous events. Both asynchronous event subpopulations also differ from synchronous events in some aspects of exo-endocytosis coupling. Specifically, for synchronous but not asynchronous events, coupling with the fast calcium-dependent endocytosis had a gradient decreasing from the AZ center towards its periphery. These results identify two distinct subpopulations of asynchronous release events with distinctive spatiotemporal organization and coupling to endocytic mechanisms.

                Within the vertebrate neocortex and other telencephalic structures, molecularly-defined neurons tend to segregate at first order into inhibitory (GABAergic) and excitatory (glutamatergic) types. We used single-nucleus RNA sequencing, analyzing over 2.4 million brain cells sampled from 16 locations in a primate (the common marmoset) to ask whether (1) neurons generally segregate by neurotransmitter status, and (2) neurons expressing the same neurotransmitters share additional molecular features in common, beyond the few genes directly responsible for neurotransmitter synthesis and release. Unexpectedly, we find the answer to both is "no": there is a surprising degree of transcriptional similarity between GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons found in the same brain structure, and there is generally little in common between glutamatergic neurons residing in phylogenetically divergent brain structures. The origin effect is permanent: we find that cell types that cross cephalic boundaries in development retain the transcriptional identities of their birthplaces. GABAergic interneurons, which migrate widely, follow highly specialized and distinct distributions in striatum and neocortex. We use interneuron-restricted AAVs to reveal the morphological diversity of molecularly defined types. Our analyses expose how lineage and functional class sculpt the transcriptional identity and biodistribution of primate neurons.

	<p>Behavioural Activation (BA) is associated with a substantial evidence base for treatment of acute unipolar depression, and has promise as an easily disseminable psychological intervention for bipolar depression. Using a randomised multiple baseline case series design we examined the feasibility and acceptability of an adapted version of BA in a U.K. outpatient sample of 12 adults with acute bipolar depression. Participants were allocated at random to a 3&amp;amp;ndash;8 week wait period before being offered up to 20 sessions of BA. They completed outcome measures at intake, pre- and post-treatment and weekly symptom measures across the study period. Retention in therapy was high (11/12 participants completed the target minimum number of sessions), and all participants returning acceptability measures reported high levels of satisfaction with the intervention. No therapy-related serious adverse events were reported, nor were there exacerbations in manic symptoms that were judged to be a result of the intervention. The pattern of change on outcome measures is consistent with the potential for clinical benefit; six of the nine participants with a stable baseline showed clinically significant improvement on the primary outcome measure. The findings suggest adapted BA for bipolar depression is a feasible and acceptable approach that merits further investigation.</p>

	<p>Introduction: The approval process for MRI safety of implants includes physical observations and an experimental evaluation in artificial settings to simulate the in vivo effect. This contains the observation of temperature changes and artificial current generation by the magnetic field. From these findings, the safety of an implant and its effect on the patient can be estimated. MRI safety is based on an in vivo evaluation of adverse events after the approval process, but an actual analysis of the effect on different tissues is not followed. The effect of MRI scanning in cochlea implantees on their residual hearing as the correlate of the hair cell function is so far unknown, therefore the aim of the present study was to observe the effect of 3 T MRI on the residual hearing of cochlea implantees. Material and Methods: In this prospective study, we performed a 3 T MRI T2 2D MS Drive sequence in eight cochlea-implanted ears. Before and after the MRI scan, a bone conduction pure tone audiogram (BC PTA) was performed. All cochlea implantees had a pre-scanning threshold of low frequency residual hearing between 20 dB and 65 dB. Results: Low frequency mean residual hearing was not affected by the 3 T T2 2D MS Drive sequence. We observed a pre-scanning threshold at 250 Hz of 42.9 (SD 3.9) dB and for 500 Hz 57.1 (SD 6.4) dB. Post-scanning BC PTA was for 250 Hz 42.1 (SD 3.9) dB and for 500 Hz 57.1 (SD 5.7) dB. Conclusion: 3 T MRI scanning has no significant functional effect on the hair cells in cochlea implantees in low frequencies with a T2 2D MS Drive sequence.</p>

	<p>Olfactory hedonic evaluation is the primary dimension of olfactory perception and thus central to our sense of smell. It involves complex interactions between brain regions associated with sensory, affective and reward processing. Despite a recent increase in interest, several aspects of olfactory hedonic evaluation remain ambiguous: uncertainty surrounds the communication between, and interaction among, brain areas during hedonic evaluation of olfactory stimuli with different levels of pleasantness, as well as the corresponding supporting oscillatory mechanisms. In our study we investigated changes in functional interactions among brain areas in response to odor stimuli using electroencephalography (EEG). To this goal, functional connectivity networks were estimated based on phase synchronization between EEG signals using the weighted phase lag index (wPLI). Graph theoretic metrics were subsequently used to quantify the resulting changes in functional connectivity of relevant brain regions involved in olfactory hedonic evaluation. Our results indicate that odor stimuli of different hedonic values evoke significantly different interaction patterns among brain regions within the olfactory cortex, as well as in the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices. Furthermore, significant hemispheric laterality effects have been observed in the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices, specifically in the beta ((13&amp;amp;ndash;30) Hz) and gamma ((30&amp;amp;ndash;40) Hz) frequency bands.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Transcriptional Profile of the Developing Subthalamic Nucleus</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a small, excitatory nucleus that regulates the output of basal ganglia motor circuits. The functions of the STN and its role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease are now well established. However, some basic characteristics like the developmental origin and molecular phenotype of neuronal subpopulations are still being debated. The classical model of forebrain development attributed the origin of STN within the diencephalon. Recent studies of gene expression patterns exposed shortcomings of the classical model. To accommodate these findings, the prosomeric model was developed. In this concept, STN develops within the hypothalamic primordium, which is no longer a part of the diencephalic primordium. This concept is further supported by the expression patterns of many transcription factors. It is interesting to note that many transcription factors involved in the development of the STN are also involved in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders. Thus, the study of neurodevelopmental disorders could provide us with valuable information on the roles of these transcription factors in the development and maintenance of STN phenotype. In this review, we summarize historical theories about the developmental origin of the STN and interpret the gene expression data within the prosomeric conceptual framework. Finally, we discuss the importance of neurodevelopmental disorders for the development of the STN and its potential role in the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Neuronal excitation/inhibition (E/I) imbalance is a potential cause of neuronal network malfunctioning in Alzheimer's disease (AD), contributing to cognitive dysfunction. Here, we used a novel approach combining transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) to probe cortical excitability in different brain areas known to be directly involved in AD pathology.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed TMS-EEG recordings targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (l-DLPFC), the left posterior parietal cortex (l-PPC), and the precuneus (PC) in a large sample of patients with mild-to-moderate AD (n = 65) that were compared with a group of age-matched healthy controls (n = 21).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that patients with AD are characterized by a regional cortical hyperexcitability in the PC and, to some extent, in the frontal lobe, as measured by TMS-evoked potentials. Notably, cortical excitability assessed over the l-PPC was comparable between the 2 groups. Furthermore, we found that the individual level of PC excitability was associated with the level of cognitive impairment, as measured with Mini-Mental State Examination, and with corticospinal fluid levels of Aβ<sub>42</sub>.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data provide novel evidence that precuneus cortical hyperexcitability is a key feature of synaptic dysfunction in patients with AD. The current results point to the combined approach of TMS and EEG as a novel promising technique to measure hyperexcitability in patients with AD. This index could represent a useful biomarker to stage disease severity and evaluate response to novel therapies. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Cell population dynamics in the course of adult hippocampal neurogenesis: Remaining unknowns</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neural stem cells (NSCs) generate new neurons throughout life in the mammalian hippocampus. The distinct developmental steps in the course of adult neurogenesis, including NSC activation, expansion, and neuronal integration, are increasingly well characterized down to the molecular level. However, substantial gaps remain in our knowledge about regulators and mechanisms involved in this biological process. This review highlights three long-standing unknowns. First, we discuss potency and identity of NSCs and the quest for a unifying model of short- and long-term self-renewal dynamics. Next, we examine cell death, specifically focusing on the early demise of newborn cells. Then, we outline the current knowledge on cell integration dynamics, discussing which (if any) neurons are replaced by newly added neurons in the hippocampal circuits. For each of these unknowns, we summarize the trajectory of studies leading to the current state of knowledge. Finally, we offer suggestions on how to fill the remaining gaps by taking advantage of novel technology to reveal currently hidden secrets in the course of adult hippocampal neurogenesis.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Altered expression response upon repeated gene repression in single yeast cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lea Schuh, Igor Kukhtevich, Poonam Bheda, Melanie Schulz, Maria Bordukova, Robert Schneider, Carsten Marr</p>

Cells must continuously adjust to changing environments and, thus, have evolved mechanisms allowing them to respond to repeated stimuli. While faster gene induction upon a repeated stimulus is known as reinduction memory, responses to repeated repression have been less studied so far. Here, we studied gene repression across repeated carbon source shifts in over 1,500 single <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> cells. By monitoring the expression of a carbon source-responsive gene, galactokinase 1 (<i>Gal1</i>), and fitting a mathematical model to the single-cell data, we observed a faster response upon repeated repressions at the population level. Exploiting our single-cell data and quantitative modeling approach, we discovered that the faster response is mediated by a shortened repression response delay, the estimated time between carbon source shift and Gal1 protein production termination. Interestingly, we can exclude two alternative hypotheses, i) stronger dilution because of e.g., increased proliferation, and ii) a larger fraction of repressing cells upon repeated repressions. Collectively, our study provides a quantitative description of repression kinetics in single cells and allows us to pinpoint potential mechanisms underlying a faster response upon repeated repression. The computational results of our study can serve as the starting point for experimental follow-up studies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Widespread expression of the ancient HERV-K (HML-2) provirus group in normal human tissues</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Aidan Burn, Farrah Roy, Michael Freeman, John M. Coffin</p>

Human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) transcripts are known to be highly expressed in cancers, yet their activity in nondiseased tissue is largely unknown. Using the GTEx RNA-seq dataset from normal tissue sampled at autopsy, we characterized individual expression of the recent HERV-K (HML-2) provirus group across 13,000 different samples of 54 different tissues from 948 individuals. HML-2 transcripts could be identified in every tissue sampled and were elevated in the cerebellum, pituitary, testis, and thyroid. A total of 37 different individual proviruses were expressed in 1 or more tissues, representing all 3 LTR5 subgroups. Nine proviruses were identified as having long terminal repeat (LTR)-driven transcription, 7 of which belonged to the most recent LTR5HS subgroup. Proviruses of different subgroups displayed a bias in tissue expression, which may be associated with differences in transcription factor binding sites in their LTRs. Provirus expression was greater in evolutionarily older proviruses with an earliest shared ancestor of gorilla or older. HML-2 expression was significantly affected by biological sex in 1 tissue, while age and timing of death (Hardy score) had little effect. Proviruses containing intact <i>gag</i>, <i>pro</i>, and <i>env</i> open reading frames (ORFs) were expressed in the dataset, with almost every tissue measured potentially expressing at least 1 intact ORF (<i>gag</i>).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Interplay between COVID-19 vaccines and social measures for ending the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The development and authorization of COVID-19 vaccines has provided the clearest path forward to eliminate community spread and thus end the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. However, the limited pace at which the vaccine can be administered motivates the question, to what extent must we continue to adhere to social intervention measures such as mask wearing and social distancing? Methods: We develop a mathematical model of COVID-19 spread incorporating both vaccine dynamics and socio-epidemiological parameters. We use this model to study two important measures of disease control and eradication, the effective reproductive number Rt and the peak intensive care unit (ICU) caseload, over three key parameters: social measure adherence, vaccination rate, and vaccination coverage. Results: Our results suggest that, due to the slow pace of vaccine administration, social measures must be maintained by a large proportion of the population until a sufficient proportion of the population becomes vaccinated for the pandemic to be eradicated. By contrast, with reduced adherence to social measures, hospital ICU cases will greatly exceed capacity, resulting in increased avoidable loss of life. We then investigate the threat of localized outbreaks in low-vaccinated populations that have removed all social intervention mandates, and show that such populations could remain highly susceptible to major outbreaks particularly in the face of more easily transmissible variants.  Conclusions: These findings highlight the complex interplay involved between vaccination and social protective measures, and indicate the practical importance of continuing with extant social measures while vaccines are scaled up to allow the development of the herd immunity needed to end or control SARS-CoV-2 sustainably.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effect of chewing-betel habits on blood glucose levels in the Karo ethnic community, Karo district [version 3; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The chewing Betel habit is a hereditary tradition from the ancestors of the Batak-Karo tribe, Indonesia. Karo people believe that chewing betel habit is their unifier. The chewing-betel habit process begins with concocting a mixture of ingredients such as betel leaf, lime, gambier, areca nut, and with or without tobacco addition, then chewed slowly. Our previous study showed that gambier extracts (Uncaria gambier Roxb), can reduce blood glucose levels(BGL) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)patients. This study aimed to analyze whether the habit of chewing betel can affect BGL in the Karo ethnic community in the Karo district. Methods: In total, 48 participants from the Karo community were divided into 4 groups (n=12 per group), namely: I. non-T2DM participants without chewing betel habits; II. non-T2DM participants with chewing-betel habit; III. T2DM participants without chewing-betel habit and IV. T2DM participants with chewing-betel habit. The sampling technique was consecutive sampling. The data were collected by interviews and blood sampling (fasting and 2 hours postprandial (2hPP)). The collected data were analyzed by paired t-test, Independent sample t-test, Wilcoxon, and Mann-Whitney with a significance level of p-value <0.05. Results: This study showed that fasting BGL condition in group-I compared to group II (84.33±12.32 vs 81.00±4.84) mg/dl and group-III compared to group-IV (196.25±104.81 vs 150.00±42.45) mg/dl had no significant difference. Also, the BGL of 2hPP condition in group-I compared to group-II (111.25 ±22.62 vs 108.33±18.99) mg/dl, and group-III compared to group-IV (314.92±128.97 vs 229.25±58.26) mg/dl, in statistically there was no difference (p>0.05). Although the data showed that group-III was higher than group-IV. Conclusions: This study concludes that with or without chewing-betel habits affect blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes subjects (Groups III and IV).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Conceptualizing university students’ food choices based on theory of planned behavior [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Several students use hostel facilities offered by their colleges and universities while pursuing higher education. A crucial change is witnessed in their food habits during their stay at the campus, which is vastly different from their home experience. Method: The study employs the theory of planned behavior to conceptualize and understand food choices of university students, while following the qualitative research methodology and the phenomenological approach. The snowball sampling method is applied to select participants for the study. We selected twenty-six undergraduate and postgraduate students pursuing programs in technical and health science from a private university at Udupi with residence in the university campus for two to four years. Interviews with candidates were conducted online and audio-recorded with participants’ consent. Results: The transcribed interviews were coded and categorized to obtain themes, which were then conceptualized to develop the model based on theory of planned behavior. The duration of their stay in campus allowed students to gain a perspective on the food events and the food they consumed at university dining facility (UDF) guided by factors, such as taste, price, availability of time(during academic activity), accessibility to healthy food, academic stress and lack of knowledge on nutrition. Two factors emerged from the interviews, one, there was no display in the dining facility about the nutritional value of the food served; and, second, students preferred to dine out on unhealthy food rather than at the university because food from outside the campus , even though unhealthy, was easier on the pocket. Conclusion: The study provides insights into the role of UDF in serving healthy and nutritional food to students for better health and improved academic performance. This work brings to light the relationship between students’ food choices and their impact on academic performance.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">HormonomicsDB: a novel workflow for the untargeted analysis of plant growth regulators and hormones [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Metabolomics is the simultaneous determination of all metabolites in a system. Despite significant advances in the field, compound identification remains a challenge. Prior knowledge of the compound classes of interest can improve metabolite identification. Hormones are a small signaling molecules, which function in coordination to direct all aspects of development, function and reproduction in living systems and which also pose challenges as environmental contaminants. Hormones are inherently present at low levels in tissues, stored in many forms and mobilized rapidly in response to a stimulus making them difficult to measure, identify and quantify.   Methods: An in-depth literature review was performed for known hormones, their precursors, metabolites and conjugates in plants to generate the database and an RShiny App developed to enable web-based searches against the database. An accompanying liquid chromatography – mass spectrometry (LC-MS) protocol was developed with retention time prediction in Retip. A meta-analysis of 14 plant metabolomics studies was used for validation.   Results: We developed HormonomicsDB, a tool which can be used to query an untargeted mass spectrometry (MS) dataset against a database of more than 200 known hormones, their precursors and metabolites. The protocol encompasses sample preparation, analysis, data processing and hormone annotation and is designed to minimize degradation of labile hormones. The plant system is used a model to illustrate the workflow and data acquisition and interpretation. Analytical conditions were standardized to a 30 min analysis time using a common solvent system to allow for easy transfer by a researcher with basic knowledge of MS. Incorporation of synthetic biotransformations enables prediction of novel metabolites.   Conclusions: HormonomicsDB is suitable for use on any LC-MS based system with compatible column and buffer system, enables the characterization of the known hormonome across a diversity of samples, and hypothesis generation to reveal knew insights into hormone signaling networks.

                Introduction: Sleep is important in humans, and it is affected by lifestyle changes. Improper sleep leads to serious physiological problems and disorders that occurs in human brain/scalp. These physiological changes and electrical activity of the human brain are recorded as electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. This paper describes the detection of a major sleep disorder \textit{i.e.}, sleep apnea (SA).  Methods: In this paper, sleep apnea is measured using various artifacts taken from the subjects. The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is used to extract characteristics from an electroencephalogram (EEG) signal and to detect sleep. This is used to determine whether a person has obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or central sleep apnea (CSA). The wavelet technique is used to split the EEG signal into five frequency bands: delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma.  Results: For these five frequency bands, the mean, standard deviation, variance, maximum, minimum, and energy are computed.  Discussion: A sleep problem is detected based on these characteristics.

                The ethics of compulsive treatment (CT) is a medical, social and legal discussion that reemerged after the ratification by 181 countries of the 2007 United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD). The optional protocol of the UN-CRPD was ratified by 86 countries aiming to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights. It also determined the need to review mental health laws as under this light treatment of persons with disabilities, particularly those with mental disorders, cannot accept the use of CT. This selective review of literature aims to clarify inputs from clinical psychiatry adding evidence to the multi-disciplinary discussion. It provides contradictory evidence on how patients experience CT and its impact on their mental health and treatment programs, also which are main reasons for the use of CT and what efforts in psychiatry have been made to reduce, replace and refine it.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Quality of life of Jordanian menopausal working and retired women and its associated factors: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Life expectancy of Jordanian women has increased, indicating that the number of women entering menopausal age, during the prime of their working life, will also increase. Therefore, assessments of the quality of life (QoL) of working and retired women and factors associated with overall wellbeing, are essential for the provision of quality services and care. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 200 Jordanian women between the ages of 45 to 60 years old.  The Utian QOL tool was used to assess the quality of life among menopausal women.  Multiple regressions were used to determine predictors for QoL for the whole sample and for each group of working and retired women. Results: The study shows that the total QoL for women was 77.5 ±14.4, with a significant difference (p=.023) in total QoL and the occupational domain (p=.003) between working and retired women. Employed women with fewer chronic diseases and using frequent preventive measures had a higher QoL compared to others. Conclusion: Working itself might be an important indicator for better a quality of life among menopausal women. Better working conditions and more attention from the health care providers for the menopausal changes and the preventive measures could enhance women’s perceived QoL in addition to increasing their productivity.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Small vessel primary angiitis of the central nervous system is a rare and often severe disease characterized by central nervous system-restricted inflammatory vasculitis on histopathology. Diagnosis requires brain biopsy for confirmation and is suggested prior to starting immunotherapy when feasible. However, emerging evidence suggests that other neuroinflammatory conditions may have a clinical and radiographic phenotype that mimics small vessel primary angiitis, at times with overlapping pathologic features as well. Such diagnoses, including anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody associated disease and central nervous system-restricted hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, can be non-invasively diagnosed with serum antibody or genetic testing that would prompt different monitoring and treatment paradigms. To determine the ultimate diagnosis of patients who were suspected prior to biopsy to have small vessel primary angiitis, we reviewed the clinical, radiographic and pathological features of a cohort of patients at a single center undergoing brain biopsy for non-oncologic indications.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical data was retrospectively extracted from the medical record. Pathology and neuroimaging review was conducted.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 21 patients over a 19-year time-period, of whom 14 (66.7%) were ultimately diagnosed with entities other than small vessel primary angiitis that would have obviated the need for brain biopsy. Diagnoses included anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody associated disease (n=9), central nervous system-restricted hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (n=3), anti-GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor encephalitis (n=1), and Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (n=1).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study highlights the importance of pursuing now readily available non-invasive testing for mimicking diagnoses before performing a brain biopsy for suspected small vessel primary angiitis of the central nervous system.</p>

                Early zygotic transcription in Drosophila embryos takes place entirely during the short S phases of nuclear division cycles. Cho et al. demonstrate that rapid onset of transcription depends on DNA replication in each cycle. Delayed initiation of transcription allows unimpeded elongation of nascent transcripts behind advancing replication forks.

Pradhan et al. show that DNA-binding proteins do not pose barriers to DNA-loop-extruding SMC complexes. Roadblocks larger than the SMC ring size cannot inhibit loop extrusion, which points to a non-topological loop extrusion mechanism.

                Anderson et al. show that SARS-CoV-2 infections elicit high levels of original antigenic sin-like antibodies that bind efficiently to the spike of common seasonal human coronaviruses but poorly to the spike of SARS-CoV-2. They find that SARS-CoV-2 vaccination elicits lower levels of original antigenic sin-like antibodies.

                Peters et al. show that visuomotor associative learning promotes visual responses in the mouse dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. These responses are independent of behavioral context. They arise synchronously with learning, with a step-like increase that matches the increase in performance seen on the day when a mouse learns the visuomotor association.

                IL-17RA is the shared co-receptor for several IL-17 family members. Goepfert et al. show that IL-17 induces IL-17RA dimerization, which then drives the formation of a 2:2:2 hexameric signaling assembly with IL-17RC. Furthermore, IL-17RA dimerization potentiates IL-17 signaling in immortalized primary human keratinocytes, compared with cells expressing a dimerization-defective IL-17RA variant.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">A systemic cell stress signal confers neuronal resilience toward oxidative stress in a Hedgehog-dependent manner</a></h4>

              
                Whether and how neurons can communicate stress to other neurons is poorly understood. Chung et al. demonstrate that oxidative stress in neurons leads to secretion of cell non-autonomous stress signaling protein. This protein, TAILS, induces neuronal resilience against cell stress in recipient cells in an SHH-dependent manner.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Oligodendroglial macroautophagy is essential for myelin sheath turnover to prevent neurodegeneration and death</a></h4>

              
                Oligodendrocytes assemble myelin and support the axons they myelinate. Aber et al. report that oligodendrocytes coordinate autophagy and endocytosis to turn over myelin. The absence of oligodendroglial autophagy causes myelin abnormalities, behavioral dysfunction, glial and neurodegeneration, and death, demonstrating the importance of this process for a healthy CNS.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Activity-dependent translation dynamically alters the proteome of the perisynaptic astrocyte process</a></h4>

              
                Across biological systems, localized and signal-mediated translation of proteins enables independent reactions by distinct compartments of the cell. It has been demonstrated previously that astrocytes have localized translation. Sapkota et al. demonstrate that astrocytic translation is regulated by neuronal activity, providing a mechanism for astrocytes to respond dynamically to nearby demands.

                Terada et al. conduct two-photon calcium imaging to reveal how different behavioral contexts are converted into the same goal-directed motor output in the motor cortex. They find that context-motor transformation occurs dynamically in M2 → M1 axons and M1 L2/3, and that it is associated with improvement in motor performance.

                In this study, we utilise fluorescence lifetime imaging of NAD(P)H-based cellular autofluorescence as a non-invasive modality to classify two contrasting states of human macrophages by proxy of their governing metabolic state. Macrophages derived from human blood-circulating monocytes were polarised using established protocols and metabolically challenged using small molecules to validate their responding metabolic actions in extracellular acidification and oxygen consumption. Large field-of-view images of individual polarised macrophages were obtained using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). These were challenged in real time with small-molecule perturbations of metabolism during imaging. We uncovered FLIM parameters that are pronounced under the action of carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), which strongly stratifies the phenotype of polarised human macrophages; however, this performance is impacted by donor variability when analysing the data at a single-cell level. The stratification and parameters emanating from a full field-of-view and single-cell FLIM approach serve as the basis for machine learning models. Applying a random forests model, we identify three strongly governing FLIM parameters, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC-AUC) value of 0.944 and out-of-bag (OBB) error rate of 16.67% when classifying human macrophages in a full field-of-view image. To conclude, 2P-FLIM with the integration of machine learning models is showed to be a powerful technique for analysis of both human macrophage metabolism and polarisation at full FoV and single-cell level.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structural and thermodynamic analyses of the β-to-α transformation in RfaH reveal principles of fold-switching proteins</a></h4>

              
                The two-domain protein RfaH, a paralog of the universally conserved NusG/Spt5 transcription factors, is regulated by autoinhibition coupled to the reversible conformational switch of its 60-residue C-terminal KOW domain between an α-hairpin and a β-barrel. In contrast, NusG/Spt5-KOW domains only occur in the β-barrel state. To understand the principles underlying the drastic fold switch in RfaH, we elucidated the thermodynamic stability and the structural dynamics of two RfaH- and four NusG/Spt5-KOW domains by combining biophysical and structural biology methods. We find that the RfaH-KOW β-barrel is thermodynamically less stable than that of most NusG/Spt5-KOWs and we show that it is in equilibrium with a globally unfolded species, which, strikingly, contains two helical regions that prime the transition towards the α-hairpin. Our results suggest that transiently structured elements in the unfolded conformation might drive the global folding transition in metamorphic proteins in general.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Lack of ownership of mobile phones could hinder the rollout of mHealth interventions in Africa</a></h4>

              
                Mobile Health interventions, which require ownership of mobile phones, are being investigated throughout Africa. We estimate the percentage of individuals who own mobile phones in 33 African countries, identify a relationship between ownership and proximity to a health clinic (HC), and quantify inequities in ownership. We investigate basic mobile phone (BPs) and smartphones (SPs): SPs can connect to the internet, BPs cannot. We use nationally representative data collected in 2017-2018 from 44,224 individuals in Round 7 of the Afrobarometer surveys. We use Bayesian Multilevel Logistic regression models for our analyses. We find 82% of individuals in the 33 countries own mobile phones: 42% BPs, 40% SPs. Individuals who live close to an HC have higher odds of ownership than those who do not (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.31, Bayesian 95% Highest Posterior Density [HPD] region: 1.24-1.39). Men, compared with women, have over twice the odds of ownership (aOR: 2.37, 95% HPD region: 1.96-2.84). Urban residents, compared with rural residents, have almost three times the odds (aOR: 2.66, 95% HPD region: 2.22-3.18) and, amongst mobile phone owners, nearly three times the odds of owning an SP (aOR: 2.67, 95% HPD region: 2.33-3.10). Ownership increases with age, peaks in 26-40 year olds, then decreases. Individuals under 30 are more likely to own an SP than a BP, older individuals more likely to own a BP than an SP. Probability of ownership decreases with the Lived Poverty Index; however, some of the poorest individuals own SPs. If the digital devices needed for mHealth interventions are not equally available within the population (which we have found is the current situation), rolling out mHealth interventions in Africa is likely to propagate already existing inequities in access to healthcare.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Tissue-specific mitochondrial HIGD1C promotes oxygen sensitivity in carotid body chemoreceptors</a></h4>

              
                Mammalian carotid body arterial chemoreceptors function as an early warning system for hypoxia, triggering acute life-saving arousal and cardiorespiratory reflexes. To serve this role, carotid body glomus cells are highly sensitive to decreases in oxygen availability. While the mitochondria and plasma membrane signaling proteins have been implicated in oxygen sensing by glomus cells, the mechanism underlying their mitochondrial sensitivity to hypoxia compared to other cells is unknown. Here, we identify HIGD1C, a novel hypoxia-inducible gene domain factor isoform, as an electron transport chain Complex IV-interacting protein that is almost exclusively expressed in the carotid body and is therefore not generally necessary for mitochondrial function. Importantly, HIGD1C is required for carotid body oxygen sensing and enhances Complex IV sensitivity to hypoxia. Thus, we propose that HIGD1C promotes exquisite oxygen sensing by the carotid body, illustrating how specialized mitochondria can be used as sentinels of metabolic stress to elicit essential adaptive behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Inhibited KdpFABC transitions into an E1 off-cycle state</a></h4>

              
                KdpFABC is a high-affinity prokaryotic K<sup>+</sup> uptake system that forms a functional chimera between a channel-like subunit (KdpA) and a P-type ATPase (KdpB). At high K<sup>+</sup> levels, KdpFABC needs to be inhibited to prevent excessive K<sup>+</sup> accumulation to the point of toxicity. This is achieved by a phosphorylation of the serine residue in the TGES<sub>162</sub> motif in the A domain of the pump subunit KdpB (KdpB<sub>S162-P</sub>). Here, we explore the structural basis of inhibition by KdpB<sub>S162</sub> phosphorylation by determining the conformational landscape of KdpFABC under inhibiting and non-inhibiting conditions. Under turnover conditions, we identified a new inhibited KdpFABC state that we termed E1P tight, which is not part of the canonical Post-Albers transport cycle of P-type ATPases. It likely represents the biochemically described stalled E1P state adopted by KdpFABC upon KdpB<sub>S162</sub> phosphorylation. The E1P tight state exhibits a compact fold of the three cytoplasmic domains and is likely adopted when the transition from high-energy E1P states to E2P states is unsuccessful. This study represents a structural characterization of a biologically relevant off-cycle state in the P-type ATPase family and supports the emerging discussion of P-type ATPase regulation by such states.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Arguments for the biological and predictive relevance of the proportional recovery rule</a></h4>

              
                The proportional recovery rule (PRR) posits that most stroke survivors can expect to reduce a fixed proportion of their motor impairment. As a statistical model, the PRR explicitly relates change scores to baseline values - an approach that arises in many scientific domains but has the potential to introduce artifacts and flawed conclusions. We describe approaches that can assess associations between baseline and changes from baseline while avoiding artifacts due either to mathematical coupling or regression to the mean. We also describe methods that can compare different biological models of recovery. Across several real datasets in stroke recovery, we find evidence for non-artifactual associations between baseline and change, and support for the PRR compared to alternative models. We also introduce a statistical perspective that can be used to assess future models. We conclude that the PRR remains a biologically relevant model of stroke recovery.

                Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) is a double-stranded DNA molecule found in various organisms, including humans. In the past few decades, the research on eccDNA has mainly focused on cancers and their associated diseases. Advancements in modern omics technologies have reinvigorated research on eccDNA and shed light on the role of these molecules in a range of diseases and normal cell phenotypes. In this review, we first summarize the formation of eccDNA and its modes of action in eukaryotic cells. We then outline eccDNA as a disease biomarker and reveal its regulatory mechanism. We finally discuss the future prospects of eccDNA, including basic research and clinical application. Thus, with the deepening of understanding and exploration of eccDNAs, they hold great promise in future biomedical research and clinical translational application.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Spatial modeling reveals nuclear phosphorylation and subcellular shuttling of YAP upon drug-induced liver injury</a></h4>

              
                The Hippo signaling pathway controls cell proliferation and tissue regeneration via its transcriptional effectors yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). The canonical pathway topology is characterized by sequential phosphorylation of kinases in the cytoplasm that defines the subcellular localization of YAP and TAZ. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling the nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling dynamics of both factors under physiological and tissue-damaging conditions are poorly understood. By implementing experimental in vitro data, partial differential equation modeling, as well as automated image analysis, we demonstrate that nuclear phosphorylation contributes to differences between YAP and TAZ localization in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Treatment of hepatocyte-derived cells with hepatotoxic acetaminophen (APAP) induces a biphasic protein phosphorylation eventually leading to nuclear protein enrichment of YAP but not TAZ. APAP-dependent regulation of nuclear/cytoplasmic YAP shuttling is not an unspecific cellular response but relies on the sequential induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT, synonym: protein kinase B), as well as elevated nuclear interaction between YAP and AKT. Mouse experiments confirm this sequence of events illustrated by the expression of ROS-, AKT-, and YAP-specific gene signatures upon APAP administration. In summary, our data illustrate the importance of nuclear processes in the regulation of Hippo pathway activity. YAP and TAZ exhibit different shuttling dynamics, which explains distinct cellular responses of both factors under physiological and tissue-damaging conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A phenotype-based forward genetic screen identifies Dnajb6 as a sick sinus syndrome gene</a></h4>

              
                Previously we showed the generation of a protein trap library made with the gene-break transposon (GBT) in zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) that could be used to facilitate novel functional genome annotation towards understanding molecular underpinnings of human diseases (Ichino et al, 2020). Here, we report a significant application of this library for discovering essential genes for heart rhythm disorders such as sick sinus syndrome (SSS). SSS is a group of heart rhythm disorders caused by malfunction of the sinus node, the heart's primary pacemaker. Partially owing to its aging-associated phenotypic manifestation and low expressivity, molecular mechanisms of SSS remain difficult to decipher. From 609 GBT lines screened, we generated a collection of 35 zebrafish insertional cardiac (ZIC) mutants in which each mutant traps a gene with cardiac expression. We further employed electrocardiographic measurements to screen these 35 ZIC lines and identified three GBT mutants with SSS-like phenotypes. More detailed functional studies on one of the arrhythmogenic mutants, <i>GBT411</i>, in both zebrafish and mouse models unveiled <i>Dnajb6</i> as a novel SSS causative gene with a unique expression pattern within the subpopulation of sinus node pacemaker cardiomyocytes that partially overlaps with the expression of hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide gated channel 4 (Hcn4), supporting heterogeneity of the cardiac pacemaker cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Delineating the transcriptional landscape and clonal diversity of virus-specific CD4+ T cells during chronic viral infection</a></h4>

              
                CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells responding to chronic viral infection often acquire a dysfunctional phenotype that is characterized by a progressive loss in Th1 differentiation and function, as well as an upregulation of multiple co-inhibitory receptors. Conversely, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and particularly Tfh cells, gradually increase their production of IL-21 during chronic viral infection, which is critical to sustain humoral immunity and also effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses. Recent evidence further indicates that a memory-like CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population also develops in the face of persistent infection, although how the transcriptional landscape of this subset, along with the Th1 and Tfh cell subsets from chronic infection, differ from their acute infection counterparts remains unclear. Additionally, whether cell-intrinsic factors such as TCR usage influence CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell fate commitment during chronic infection has not previously been studied. Herein, we perform single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) combined with single-cell T cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq) on virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from mice infected with chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection. We identify several transcriptionally distinct states among the Th1, Tfh, and memory-like T cell subsets that form at the peak of chronic infection, including the presence of a previously unrecognized Slamf7<sup>+</sup> subset with cytolytic features, and show that the relative distribution of these populations differs substantially between acute and persistent LCMV infection. Moreover, while the progeny of most T cell clones displays membership within each of these transcriptionally unique populations, overall supporting a one cell-multiple fate model, a small fraction of clones display a biased cell fate decision, suggesting that TCR usage may impact CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell development during chronic viral infection. Importantly, a comparative analysis further reveals both subset-specific and core gene expression programs that are differentially regulated between CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells responding to acute and chronic viral infection. Together, these data may serve as a useful framework and allow for a detailed interrogation into the clonal distribution and transcriptional circuits underlying CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation during chronic viral infection.

                Early telencephalic development involves patterning of the distinct regions and fate specification of the neural stem cells (NSCs). These processes, mainly characterized in rodents, remain elusive in primates and thus our understanding of conserved and species-specific features. Here, we profiled 761,529 single-cell transcriptomes from multiple regions of the prenatal macaque telencephalon. We defined the molecular programs of the early organizing centers and their cross-talk with NSCs, finding primate-biased signaling active in the antero-ventral telencephalon. Regional transcriptomic divergences were evident at early states of neocortical NSC progression and in differentiated neurons and astrocytes, more than in intermediate transitions. Finally, we show that neuropsychiatric disease- and brain cancer-risk genes have putative early roles in the telencephalic organizers' activity and across cortical NSC progression.

                Soluble aggregates of amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}), often called oligomers, are believed to be principal drivers of neurotoxicity, spreading of pathology, and symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but little is known about their structures in human brain. A{beta} oligomers have been defined as aggregates found in supernatants following ultracentrifugation of aqueous extracts. We now report the unexpected presence of abundant A{beta} fibrils in high-speed supernatants from AD brains that were extracted by soaking in aqueous buffer. The fibrils did not appear to form during extract preparation, and their numbers by EM correlated with ELISA quantification of aggregated A{beta}42. Cryo-EM structures of A{beta} fibrils from aqueous extracts were identical to those from sarkosyl-insoluble AD brain homogenates. The fibrils in aqueous extracts were immunolabeled by lecanemab, an A{beta} aggregate-directed antibody reported to improve cognitive outcomes in AD. We conclude that A{beta} fibrils are abundant in aqueous extracts from AD brains and have the same structures as those from amyloid plaques. These findings have implications for understanding the nature of A{beta} oligomers and for designing oligomer-preferring therapeutic antibodies.

                Analogue signaling is the phenomenon by which subthreshold activity in the dendrites and soma of neurons is transmitted down the axon. Although it has been demonstrated in many different preparations, the extent and physiological role of analogue signaling for subthreshold, somatodendritic spontaneous activity have not been studied in detail. In order to address this we performed simultaneous, whole-cell recordings of the soma and axon of young cerebellar interneurons. We show that the somatodendritic spontaneous glutamatergic events are transmitted down the axon for significant distances and produce a measurable change in the voltage of the axonal varicosities. By combining electrophysiological recordings in the culture preparation and in slices, we further show that the analogously transmitted EPSPs can affect GABA release significantly, and that this effect is not due to a modification in the axonal AP shape or amplitude.

                Previous studies in human patients and rodent models of Parkinson's disease (PD) have established neuroprotection of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNC) by physical exercise, but the precise origin of this neuroprotective effect has yet to be elucidated. In this study, we tested a hypothesis that enhanced activity of DA neurons in SNC results in neuroprotection using the unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) injection model in mice. To increase activity of DA neurons chronically and specifically, we injected an adeno-associated viral vector carrying a step-function luminopsin (SFL) - a fusion protein of light-emitting Gaussia luciferase and light-sensing step-function channelrhodopsin 2 - into SNC ipsilateral to 6-OHDA using the pan-neuronal human synapsin I promoter or the Cre-lox system in transgenic mice expressing the recombinase under control of the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) promoter. Upon application of SFL substrate, coelenterazine (CTZ), the luciferase moiety of luminopsin emits bioluminescence which in turn activate the opsin moiety. Daily injection of CTZ for 4 weeks ameliorated a stereotypical behavior, namely ipsiversive rotations, induced by unilateral 6-OHDA. In addition, postmortem immunohistochemistry against TH revealed less severe neurodegeneration of DA neurons compared to vehicle-injected control animals. Furthermore, when mice were pretreated with ANA-12, a selective antagonist for tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), the behavioral improvement and neuroprotective effect were diminished. These results suggest that increased neuronal activity of DA neurons provides neuroprotection against 6-OHDA injury and alleviates its symptoms through the brain-derived neurotrophic factor-TrkB pathway.

                Auditory roughness resulting of fast temporal beatings is often studied by summing two pure tones with close frequencies. Interestingly, the tactile counterpart of auditory roughness can be provided through touch with vibrotactile actuators. However, whether auditory roughness could also be perceived through touch, and whether they exhibit similar characteristics is unclear. Here, auditory roughness perception and its tactile counterpart were evaluated using similar two pure tones stimuli. Results revealed similar roughness curves in both modalities suggesting similar sensory processing. This study attests of the relevance of such a paradigm for investing auditory and tactile roughness in a multisensory fashion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Variability of visual field maps in human early extrastriate cortex challenges the canonical model of organization of V2 and V3</a></h4>

              
                Visual field maps in human early extrastriate areas (V2 and V3) are traditionally thought to form mirror-image representations which surround the primary visual cortex (V1). According to this scheme, V2 and V3 form nearly symmetrical halves with respect to the calcarine sulcus, with the dorsal halves representing the lower contralateral quadrants, and the ventral halves representing the upper contralateral quadrants. This arrangement is considered to be consistent across individuals, and thus predictable with reasonable accuracy using templates. However, data that deviate from this expected pattern have been observed, but mainly treated as artifactual. Here we systematically investigate individual variability in the visual field maps of human early visual cortex using the large-scale 7T Human Connectome Project (HCP) retinotopy dataset. Our results demonstrate substantial and principled inter-individual variability in early visual retinotopy. Visual field representation in the dorsal portions of V2 and V3 were more variable than their ventral counterparts, including substantial departures from the expected mirror-symmetrical patterns. Surprisingly, only one-third of individuals had maps that conformed to the expected pattern. In addition, retinotopic maps in the left hemisphere were more variable than those in the right hemisphere. Our findings challenge the current view that inter-individual variability in early extrastriate cortex is negligible, and that the dorsal portions of V2 and V3 are roughly mirror images of their ventral counterparts.

                We introduce HumanBrainAtlas, an initiative to construct a highly detailed, open-access atlas of the living human brain that combines high-resolution in vivo MR imaging and detailed segmentations previously possible only in histological preparations. Here, we present and evaluate the first step of this initiative: a comprehensive dataset of two healthy male volunteers reconstructed to a 0.25 mm3 isotropic resolution for T1w, T2w and DWI contrasts. Multiple high-resolution acquisitions were collected for each contrast and each participant, followed by averaging using symmetric group-wise normalisation (Advanced Normalisation Tools). The resulting image quality permits structural parcellations rivalling histology-based atlases, while maintaining the advantages of in vivo MRI. For example, components of the thalamus, hypothalamus, and hippocampus - difficult or often impossible to identify using standard MRI protocols, can be identified within the present data. Our data are virtually distortion free, fully 3D, and compatible with existing in vivo Neuroimaging analysis tools. The dataset is suitable for teaching and is publicly available via our website (www.hba.neura.edu.au), which also provides data processing scripts. Instead of focusing on coordinates in an averaged brain space, our approach focuses on providing an example segmentation at great detail in the high quality individual brain, this serves as an illustration on what features contrasts and relations can be used to interpret MRI datasets, in research, clinical and education settings.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex-dimorphic neuroprotective effect of CD163 in an alpha-synuclein mouse model Of Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                The aggregation of alpha-synuclein (a-syn) and immune activation are both pathological events related to the neurodegenerative process in Parkinson's disease (PD). The PD-associated immune response involves both brain and peripheral immune cells, although little is known about the immune proteins relevant for such response. CD163 is a scavenger receptor specifically expressed in the monocytic lineage, but normally not in microglia. Therefore, the presence of CD163 positive cells into the brain in PD rodent models and in PD patients suggest a monocytic infiltration or otherwise ectopic CD163 expression. In addition, changes in CD163 expression profiles observed in PD patients might indicate a role for CD163-expressing cells in the disease. To elucidate the relevance of the CD163 receptor in the a-syn-induced immune events in PD and associated degeneration we injected murine a-syn pre-formed fibrils (PFF), or monomeric a-syn into the striatum of CD163 knockout (KO) mice and wild-type (WT) littermates. Injection of a-syn PFF in CD163KO females led to impaired early immune responses as revealed by the lack of ability to upregulate MHCII, CD68, GFAP, and promote CD4 and CD8 T cell infiltration after a-syn PFF injection. An early and long-lasting sensorimotor impairment was observed in a-syn PFF CD163KO males but not in the females. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that CD163 deletion induced phenotypic changes of macrophages and microglia in the brain that potentially impact the motor behavior and neuronal health induced by a-syn in a sex-dependent manner. After 6 months, CD163KO females showed an exacerbated immune response and a-syn pathology associated with autophagic defects, which ultimately led to increased dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Overall, our results support a novel sex-dimorphic neuroprotective role for CD163 in the a-syn-induced neuropathology and immune response.

                Recent studies show significant similarities between the representations humans and deep neural networks (DNNs) generate for faces. However, two critical aspects of human face recognition are overlooked by these networks. First, human face recognition is mostly concerned with familiar faces, which are encoded by visual and semantic information, while current DNNs solely rely on visual information. Second, humans represent familiar faces in memory, but representational similarities with DNNs were only investigated for human perception. To address this gap, we combined visual (VGG-16), visual-semantic (CLIP), and natural language processing (NLP) DNNs to predict human representations of familiar faces in perception and memory. The visual-semantic network substantially improved predictions beyond the visual network, revealing a new visual-semantic representation in human perception and memory. The NLP network further improved predictions of human representations in memory. Thus, a complete account of human face recognition should go beyond vision and incorporate visual-semantic, and semantic representations.

                Adolescent cocaine exposure (ACE) increases the risk of suffering psychiatric disorders including anxiety in later life, which is a big public health concern with limited treating options. Consistent with our previous study, we found that ACE mice exhibited obvious anxiety-like behaviors in their adulthood, which was efficiently suppressed by electro-acupuncture (EA) at acupoints of Baihui (GV 20) and Yintang (GV 29) with stimulus of a mixed frequency of 2/100 Hz for 28 withdrawal days. In the claustrum (CL) of ACE mice, more CaMKII-positive neurons (CaMKIICL) were activated, accompanied with increased expression of dopamine receptor 1 (D1R) on them (D1RCaMKII) and phosphorylated-EKR (p-ERK), p-CREB, and BDNF protein levels. Local blockade of CL D1R by SCH23390 or specific knockdown of CL D1RCaMKII by virus suppressed both anxiety-like behaviors and CaMKIICL activity in ACE mice of adulthood, indicating the critical role of CL D1RCaMKII in ACE-enhanced anxiety. Importantly, EA treatment suppressed CaMKIICL activity and D1RCaMKII staining, along with attenuated levels of p-CREB and BDNF in CL of ACE mice. Collectively, our study for the first time identified a novel molecular mechanism of CL D1RCaMKII and CaMKIICL activity in the process of ACE-increased anxiety in adulthood. Further, by targeting CL D1RCaMKII, EA at acupoints of GV 20 and GV 29 serves as preventative strategy to adolescent drugs exposure-induced anxiety in the later life.

                Tau phosphorylation and aggregation is the final common pathway for neuronal toxicity across multiple neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration. We have previously shown that the fetal brain expresses high levels of phosphorylated tau, and even tau aggregates, without apparent toxic effects. The mechanisms for this remarkable resilience, however, remain unclear. In order to identify potential mediators of this resilience, we used bead-linked total tau immunoprecipitation in human fetal, adult, and Alzheimer disease brains. We then used heterologous transfection in HEK 293T cells followed by co-immunoprecipitation, mass photometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to further characterize the interaction of tau with one of our top hits, 14-3-3-beta. We found significant differences between the tau interactome in fetal and AD brain, with little difference between adult and AD. There were significant differences in tau interaction with 14-3-3 family proteins between fetal and AD brain. We then determined that the 14-3-3 isoform with the highest difference, 14-3-3-beta, preferentially interacts with 4R tau in vitro, forming a complex consisting of two 14-3-3-beta, and one tau molecule. NMR studies using 15N-labeled phosphorylated tau showed that the binding site for 14-3-3 was in the microtubule binding region of tau, which is truncated in 3R tau through the exclusion of exon 10. Our findings suggest that there are marked differences between the phospho-tau interactome in fetal and Alzheimer disease brain, including differences in interaction with the critical 14-3-3 family of protein chaperones, which may explain, in part, the resilience of fetal brain to tau toxicity.

                The skin transmits affective signals that integrate into our social vocabulary. As the socio-affective aspects of touch are likely processed in the amygdala, we compared neural responses to social grooming and gentle airflow recorded from the amygdala and the primary somatosensory cortex of non-human primates. Neurons in the somatosensory cortex responded to both types of tactile stimuli. In the amygdala, however, neurons did not respond to individual grooming sweeps even though grooming elicited autonomic states indicative of positive affect. Instead, many showed changes in baseline firing rates that persisted throughout the grooming bout. Such baseline fluctuations were attributed to social context because the presence of the groomer alone could account for the observed changes in baseline activity. It appears, therefore, that during grooming, the amygdala stops responding to external inputs on a short time scale but remains responsive to social context (or the associated affective states) on longer time scales.

                Depression affects 280 million people globally and is considered a prodromal feature for increasingly prevalent neurodegenerative conditions including Parkinson's disease (PD). With age-related neurodegeneration on the rise, it's important to consider non-invasive, inexpensive interventions such as dance. Dance has emerged as a complementary treatment that may support adaptive neuroplasticity while diminishing motor and non-motor symptoms including depression. Although dance has been shown to impact brain structures and functions with improvements in motor and psychological symptoms, the neural mechanisms underlying depression/mood remain elusive. Our observational study tracks the relationship between depression scores and functional neuroimaging measures for subgenual cingulate gyrus (SCG). While learning choreography over an 8-month period, 34 dancers [23 people with PD] completed GDS questionnaires before and after their community dance classes. Seventeen of these dancers had BOLD fMRI scans conducted using learning-related protocols to examine underlying neural mechanisms for moving to music over 4 times points of learning. A significant decrease in depression scores correlated with a reduced BOLD signal from SCG, a putative node in the neural network of depression. Conclusions: This is the first study to clearly find a correlation with a neural substrate involved in mood changes as a function of dance for PD. Not only do the results contribute to understanding neural mechanisms involved in adaptive plasticity with a learning task, but they also uncover reduced activity within SCG during longitudinal therapeutic dance interventions. These results are especially illuminating since SCG is a controversial target in deep brain stimulation (DBS) used in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD).

                Aging is associated with loss of circadian immune responses and circadian gene transcription in peripheral macrophages. Microglia, the resident macrophages of the brain, also show diurnal rhythmicity in regulating local immune responses and synaptic remodeling. To investigate the interaction between aging and microglial circadian rhythmicity, we examined mice deficient in the core clock transcription factor, BMAL1. Aging Cd11bcre;Bmallox/lox mice demonstrated accelerated cognitive decline in association with suppressed hippocampal long-term potentiation and increases in immature dendritic spines. C1q deposition at synapses and synaptic engulfment were significantly decreased in aging Bmal1-deficient microglia, suggesting that BMAL1 plays a role in regulating synaptic pruning in aging. In addition to accelerated age-associated hippocampal deficits, Cd11bcre;Bmallox/lox mice also showed deficits in the sleep-wake cycle with increased wakefulness across light and dark phases. These results highlight an essential role of microglial BMAL1 in maintenance of synapse homeostasis in the aging brain.

                Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is the leading genetic cause of infant mortality. The advent of approved treatments for this devastating condition has significantly changed SMA patients' life expectancy and quality of life. Nevertheless, these are not without limitations, and research efforts are underway to develop new approaches to be used alone and in combination, to ensure improved and long-lasting benefits for SMA patients. Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMT) are emerging as druggable epigenetic targets, with several small molecule PRMT inhibitors already in clinical trial stage. From a screen of highly potent and selective next generation epigenetic small molecules, we have identified MS023, a potent and selective type I PRMT inhibitor, able to promote SMN2 exon 7 inclusion and increase SMN protein levels in preclinical SMA model, by inhibiting the binding of splicing factor hnRNPA1 to SMN2 pre-mRNA. Treatment of SMA mice with MS023 results in amelioration of the disease phenotype, with strong synergistic amplification of the positive effect when delivered in combination with the SMN2-targeting antisense oligonucleotide nusinersen. Moreover, transcriptomic analysis revealed that MS023 treatment has very minimal off-target effects and that the added benefit of the combination therapy is mainly attributable to targeting neuroinflammation. Our study warrants further clinical investigation of PRMT inhibition both as a stand-alone and add-on therapy for SMA patients.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Encoding surprise by retinal ganglion cells</a></h4>

              
                The efficient coding hypothesis posits that early sensory neurons transmit maximal information about sensory stimuli, given internal constraints. A central prediction of this theory is that neurons should preferentially encode stimuli that are most surprising. Previous studies suggest this may be the case in early visual areas, where many neurons respond strongly to rare or surprising stimuli. For example, previous research showed that when presented with a rhythmic sequence of full-field flashes, many retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) respond strongly at the instance the flash sequence stops, and when another flash would be expected. This phenomenon is called the `omitted stimulus response'. However, it is not known whether the responses of these cells varies in a graded way depending on the level of stimulus surprise. To investigate this, we presented retinal neurons with extended sequences of stochastic flashes. With this stimulus, the surprise associated with a particular flash/silence, could be quantified analytically, and varied in a graded manner depending on the previous sequences of flashes and silences. Interestingly, we found that RGC responses could be well explained by a simple normative model, which described how they optimally combined their prior expectations and recent stimulus history, so as to encode surprise. Further, much of the diversity in RGC responses could be explained by the model, due to the different prior expectations that different neurons had about the stimulus statistics. These results suggest that even as early as the retina many cells encode surprise, relative to their own, internally generated expectations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Local Hebbian Rule Based Model of Invariant Object Representation and Classification.</a></h4>

              
                Our recognition of an object is consistent across conditions, unaffected by motion, perspective, rotation, and corruption. This robustness is thought to be enabled by invariant object representations, but how the brain achieves it remains unknown. In artificial neural networks, learning to represent objects is simulated as an optimization process. The system reduces discrepancies between actual and desired outputs by updating specific connections through mechanisms such as error backpropagation. These operations are biologically implausible primarily because they require individual connections at all levels to be sensitive to errors found at the late stages of the network. On the other hand, learning in the nervous system occurs locally, and synaptic changes depend only on pre- and post-synaptic activities. It is unclear how local updates translate into coordinated changes across large populations of neurons and lead to sophisticated cognitive functions. Here we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve robust and invariant object representations in naturally observed network architectures using only biologically realistic local learning rules. Adopting operations fundamentally different from current ANN models, unsupervised recurrent networks can learn to represent and categorize objects through sensory experiences without propagating or detecting errors. This white box, fully interpretable networks can extract clean images from their corrupted forms and produce representations prospectively robust against unfamiliar perturbations. Continuous learning does not cause catastrophic forgetting commonly observed in ANNs. Without explicit instructions, the networks can classify objects and represent the identity of 3D objects regardless of perspective, size, or position. These findings have substantial implications for understanding how biological brains achieve invariant object representation and for developing biologically realistic intelligent networks that are efficient and robust.

                Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are produced by all cell types and are found in all tissues and biofluids. EV proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids are a "nano-snapshot" of the parent cell that may be used for novel diagnostics of various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders. Currently, diagnosis of the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, Parkinson's disease (PD), relies on manifestations of late-stage progression, which may furthermore associate with other neurodegenerative diseases such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Here, we profiled surface markers and other protein contents of brain-derived extracellular vesicles (bd-EVs) from PD (n= 24), PSP (n=25) and control (n=24). bdEVs displayed tetraspanins and certain microglia, astrocyte, and neuron markers, while quantitative proteomics revealed enrichment of several proteins in PD vs. control and/or PSP, including clathrin heavy chain 1 and 14-3-3 protein gamma. This characterization of EVs in the source tissue provides insights into local dynamics as well as biomarker candidates for investigation in peripheral fluids.

                How is information processed in the cerebral cortex? To answer this question a lot of effort has been undertaken to create novel and to further develop existing neuroimaging techniques. Thus, a high spatial resolution of fMRI devices was the key to exactly localize cognitive processes. Furthermore, an increase in time-resolution and number of recording channels of electro-physiological setups has opened the door to investigate the exact timing of neural activity. However, in most cases the recorded signal is averaged over many (stimulus) repetitions, which erases the fine-structure of the neural signal. Here, we show that an unsupervised machine learning approach can be used to extract meaningful information from electro-physiological recordings on a single-trial base. We use an auto-encoder network to reduce the dimensions of single local field potential (LFP) events to create interpretable clusters of different neural activity patterns. Strikingly, certain LFP shapes correspond to latency differences in different recording channels. Hence, LFP shapes can be used to determine the direction of information flux in the cerebral cortex. Furthermore, after clustering, we decoded the cluster centroids to reverse-engineer the underlying prototypical LFP event shapes. To evaluate our approach, we applied it to both neural extra-cellular recordings in rodents, and intra-cranial EEG recordings in humans. Finally, we find that single channel LFP event shapes during spontaneous activity sample from the realm of possible stimulus evoked event shapes. A finding which so far has only been demonstrated for multi-channel population coding.

                Biometric-based personal identification models are generally considered to be accurate and secure because biological signals are too complex and person-specific to be fabricated, and EMG signals, in particular, have been used as biological identification tokens due to their high dimension and non-linearity. We investigate the possibility of effectively attacking EMG-based identification models with biological adversarial input via a novel EMG signal individual style transformer based on a generative adversarial network. EMG hand gesture data from eighteen subjects and three well-recognized deep EMG classifiers were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack methods. The proposed methods achieved an average of 99.41% success rate on confusing identification models and an average of 91.51% success rate on manipulating identification models. These results demonstrate that EMG classifiers based on deep neural networks can be vulnerable to synthetic data attacks. The proof-of-concept results reveal that synthetic EMG biological signals must be considered in biological identification system design across a vast array of relevant biometric systems to ensure personal identification security for individuals and institutions.

                Neural processing of a navigational goal requires the continuous comparison between the current heading and the intended goal direction. While the neural basis underlying the current heading is well-studied in insects, the coding of the goal direction is completely unexplored. Here, we identify for the first time neurons that encode goal direction in the brain of a navigating insect, the monarch butterfly. The spatial tuning of these neurons accurately correlates with the animal's goal direction while being unaffected by compass perturbations. Thus, they specifically encode the goal direction similar to goal neurons described in the mammalian brain. Taken together, a navigation network based on goal-direction and heading-direction neurons generates steering commands that efficiently guides the monarch butterflies to their migratory goal.

                Empathy impairments are an important part of a broader affective impairments defining the youth antisocial phenotype callous-unemotional (CU) traits and the DSM-5 low prosocial emotion (LPE) specifier. While functional connectivity underlying empathy and CU traits have been well studied, less is known about what functional connections underly differences in empathy amongst adolescents qualifying for the LPE specifier. Such information can provide mechanistic distinctions for this clinically relevant specifier. The present study uses connectome-based predictive modeling that uses whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity data to predict cognitive and affective empathy for those meeting the LPE specifier (n= 29) and those that do not (n= 57). Additionally, we tested if models of empathy generalized between groups as well as density differences for each model of empathy between groups. Results indicate the LPE group had lower cognitive and affective empathy as well as higher CU traits and conduct problems. Negative and positive models were identified for affective empathy for both groups, but only the negative model for the LPE and positive model for the normative group reliably predicted cognitive empathy. Models predicting empathy did not generalize between groups. Density differences within the default mode, salience, executive control, limbic, and cerebellar networks were found as well as between the executive control, salience, and default mode networks. And, importantly, connections between the executive control and default mode networks characterized empathy differences the LPE group such that more positive connections characterized cognitive differences and less negative connections characterized affective differences. These findings indicate neural differences in empathy for those meeting LPE criteria that may explain decrements in empathy amongst these youth. These findings support theoretical accounts of empathy decrements in the LPE clinical specifier and extend them to identify specific circuits accounting for variation in empathy impairments. The identified negative models help understand what connections inhibit empathy whereas the positive models reveal what brain patterns are being used to support empathy in those with the LPE specifier. LPE differences from the normative group and could be an appropriate biomarker for predicting CU trait severity. Replication and validation using other large datasets are important next steps.

                Neurofeedback procedures are attracting increasing attention in the neuroscience community. Based on the principle that participants, through suitable feedback, may learn to affect specific aspects of their brain activity, neurofeedback has been applied to basic research, translational, and clinical science alike. A large segment of the extant empirical research as well as review articles have focused on the extent to which neurofeedback interventions affect mental health outcomes, cognitive capacity, aging, and other complex behaviors. Another segment has aimed to characterize the extent to which neurofeedback affects the targeted neural processes. At this time, there is no current systematic review of the effects of neurofeedback on healthy participants performance in experimental tasks. Such a review is relevant in this rapidly evolving field because changes in experimental task performance are traditionally considered a hallmark of changing neurocognitive processes, often established in neurotypical individuals. This systematic review addresses this gap in the literature using the PRISMA method, building on earlier reviews on the same topic. Empirical studies using EEG or fMRI to alter brain processes linked to established, well-defined cognitive and affective laboratory tasks were reviewed. Substantial variability was found regarding the nature of the control for placebo effects, the implementation of the feedback, and the neural targets of feedback. Importantly, only a minority of the studies reported statistically meaningful effects of neurofeedback on performance in cognitive and affective tasks. Examining effect sizes and p-values in a subset of studies found no evidence for reporting bias, while also not finding systematic relations between study characteristics such as sample size or experimental control on the one hand and efficacy on the other. Implications for future work are discussed.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">MYT1L is required for suppressing earlier neuronal development programs in the adult mouse brain</a></h4>

              
                In vitro studies indicate the neurodevelopmental disorder gene Myelin Transcription Factor 1 Like (MYT1L) suppresses non-neuronal lineage genes during fibroblast-to-neuron direct differentiation. However, MYT1L's molecular and cellular functions during differentiation in the mammalian brain have not been fully characterized. Here, we found that MYT1L loss leads to up-regulated deep layer (DL) but down-regulated upper layer (UL) neuron gene expression, corresponding to an increased ratio of DL/UL neurons in mouse cortex. To define potential mechanisms, we conducted Cleavage Under Targets & Release Using Nuclease (CUT&RUN) to map MYT1L binding targets in mouse developing cortex and adult prefrontal cortex (PFC), and to map epigenetic changes due to MYT1L mutation. We found MYT1L mainly binds to open chromatin, but with different transcription factor co-occupancies between promoters and enhancers. Likewise, multi-omic dataset integration revealed that, at promoters, MYT1L loss does not change chromatin accessibility but does increase H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, activating both a subset of earlier neuronal development genes as well as Bcl11b, a key regulator for DL neuron development. Meanwhile, we discovered that MYT1L normally represses the activity of neurogenic enhancers associated with neuronal migration and neuronal projection development by closing chromatin structures and promoting removal of active histone marks. Further, we show MYT1L interacts with SIN3B and HDAC2 in vivo, providing potential mechanisms underlying any repressive effects on histone acetylation and gene expression. Overall, our findings provide a comprehensive map of MYT1L binding in vivo and mechanistic insights to how MYT1L facilitates neuronal maturation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">CRF neurons of the BNST promote resilience by blunting the internal experience of aversion.</a></h4>

              
                The Bed Nucleus of the Stria Terminalis (BNST) has been studied extensively for its role in coordinating what appears to be often opposing adaptive behaviors. However, what is missing in the literature is the link between internal affective states and the adaptive stress behaviors they motivate. Previously, we uncovered a stress window during which neuronal activity of Corticotropin-Releasing Factor (CRF) expressing neurons of the oval nucleus of the BNST, (BNSTovCRF) maintains resilient behavior through self-sustained activation1. Here, we explore how BNSTovCRF neurons achieve this through shifting the valence of stress contexts to represent a less aversive experience. Using cell-type-selective optogenetics and transgenic Crf-ChR2 mice, we show that BNSTovCRF induces resiliency through dampening the deleterious effects of social defeat encoding, enhancing the positive salience of both appetitive and aversive stimuli, shifting socio-affective bias, and promoting tolerability of non-social physical stress. Adaptive responses to stress typically emanate as a response to negative internal states by external stimuli; here we show that in resilient mice, stressful environments are less aversive than susceptible mice, suggesting a different motivational capacity to endure stress in this group. Thus, we describe a novel role for BNSTovCRF neurons in resisting the emotional effects of cumulative stress by reducing the internal experience of aversion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The open field assay is influenced by room temperature and by drugs that affect core body temperature</a></h4>

              
                The open field assay is used to study anxiety-related traits and anxiolytic drugs in rodents. This assay entails measuring locomotor activity and time spent in the center of a chamber that is maintained at ambient room temperature. However, the ambient temperature in most laboratories varies daily and seasonally and can differ substantially between buildings. Here, we sought to evaluate how varying ambient temperature and core body temperature (CBT) affected open field locomotor activity and center time of wild-type (WT) and Trpm8 knock-out (Trpm8-/-) mice. TRPM8 is an ion channel that detects cool temperatures and is activated by cooling agents, including icilin and menthol. We found that the cooling agent icilin increased CBT and profoundly reduced distance traveled and center time of WT mice relative to vehicle controls. Likewise, cooling the ambient temperature to 4{degrees}C reduced distance traveled and center time of WT mice relative to Trpm8-/- mice. Conversely, the TRPM8 antagonist (M8-B) reduced CBT and increased distance traveled and center time of WT mice when tested at 4{degrees}C. Predictably, the TRPM8 antagonist (M8-B) had no effect on CBT or open field behavior of Trpm8-/- mice. The anxiolytic diazepam reduced CBT in both WT and Trpm8-/- mice. When tested at 4{degrees}C, diazepam increased distance traveled and center time in WT mice but did not alter open field behavior of Trpm8-/- mice. Our study shows that environmental temperature and drugs that affect CBT can influence locomotor behavior and center time in the open field assay, highlighting temperature (ambient and core) as sources of environmental and physiologic variability in this commonly used behavioral assay.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reduced Folate Carrier 1 is Present in Retinal Microvessels and Contributes to the Regulation of The Inner Blood Retinal Barrier in Health and Retinal Ischemia</a></h4>

              
                The inner blood-retina barrier (BRB) resembles the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and is comprised of a single layer endothelium sealed with tight junctions whose abluminal surface is ensheathed by pericytes. The inner BRB is essential for providing a constant and controlled flow of nutrients and molecules to meet metabolic needs. Accordingly, the inner BRB harbors numerous carriers providing the exchange of molecules between blood and retina. One of these carriers is Reduced Folate Carrier 1 (RFC1), which functions as a folate transporter, and has been one of the most consistently detected genes in cerebral pericytes in a recent meta-analysis. The presence of RFC1 protein and its functions in retinal pericytes and microvessels have been overlooked so far despite the similarities between retinal and cerebral microcirculation. In this report, our purposes were to assess the presence of RFC1 protein in retinal microvessels and surrounding pericytes, and modify to increase or decrease RFC1 levels to explore its roles in healthy and ischemic retinal microvessels. Our analyses on whole mount retinas, and trypsin digest preparations from adult Swiss albino mice with concomitant pericyte and endothelial cell markers have shown the presence of RFC1 protein in the inner BRB and colocalization with pericytes. In vivo modifications of RFC1 expression levels were accomplished by intravitreal delivery of genetic and pharmacological agents. Knocking down RFC1 expression via custom-designed short interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in microvascular dysfunction which was presented by the disintegration of tight junction proteins and the main basal membrane protein collagen-4. This was accompanied by extensive endogenous IgG extravasation suggesting impairment in the barrier functions. On the other hand, delivering RFC1 expressing lentiviral vector to overexpress RFC1 in the retina induced immunosignal increase in tight junction proteins and collagen-4 confirming the role of RFC1 in the inner BRB functions. Administration of methotrexate (MTX), the pharmacological competitive inhibitor of folate, resulted in increased levels of RFC1. In retinal ischemia models, one-hour retinal ischemia increased RFC1 levels and decreased collagen-4 and occludin levels. These effects could be partially reversed with pre-treatment by RFC1 expressing lentiviral vector. All these indicate the importance of RFC1 levels in the pathophysiology of retinal ischemia, a prevalent cause of blindness worldwide. In conclusion, our study clarifies the presence of RFC1 in inner BRB and offers a novel perspective on RFC1, other than being a folate carrier, as a regulator of inner BRB in healthy and ischemic retinas.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Vogt-Bailey index: a local gradient analysis</a></h4>

              
                In this work, we take a closer look at the Vogt-Bailey (VB) index, proposed in (Bajada et al, 2020) as a tool for studying local functional homogeneity in the human cortex. We interpret the VB index in terms of the minimum ratio cut, a weighted graph cut that indicates whether a network can easily be disconnected into two parts having a comparable number of nodes. In our case, the nodes of the network consist of a brain vertex/voxel and its nearest neighbours, and a given edge is weighted according to the affinity of the nodes it connects (as reflected by the modified Pearson correlation between their fMRI time series). Consequently, the minimum ratio cut quantifies the degree of similarity in local brain activity. We compare the performance of the VB index with that of the Regional Homogeneity (ReHo) algorithm, commonly used to assess whether voxels in close proximity have synchronised fMRI signals, and find that the VB index is uniquely placed to detect sharp changes in the (local) functional organization of the human cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Canonical and Non-Canonical Psychedelic Drugs Induce Common Network Changes in Human Cortex</a></h4>

              
                The neurobiology of the psychedelic experience is not fully elucidated. Identifying common brain network changes induced by both canonical (i.e., acting at the 5-HT2 receptor) and non-canonical psychedelics would provide mechanistic insight into state-specific characteristics. We analyzed whole-brain functional connectivity based on resting-state fMRI data in humans, acquired before and during the administration of nitrous oxide, ketamine, and lysergic acid diethylamide. We report that, despite distinct molecular mechanisms and modes of delivery, all three psychedelics reduced within-network functional connectivity and enhanced between-network functional connectivity. More specifically, all drugs tested increased connectivity between right temporoparietal junction and bilateral intraparietal sulcus as well as between precuneus and left intraparietal sulcus. These regions fall within the posterior cortical hot zone, posited to mediate the content of consciousness. Thus, both canonical and non-canonical psychedelics modulate networks within an area of known relevance for conscious experience, identifying a biologically plausible candidate for their subjective effects.

	<p>The main objective of this study was to demonstrate that computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling can be used to study the contribution of covert and overt vascular architecture to the risk for cerebrovascular disease in sickle cell disease (SCD) and to determine the mechanisms of response to therapy such as chronic red blood cell (cRBC) transfusions. We analyzed baseline (screening), pre-randomization and study exit magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) images from 10 (5 each from the transfusion and observation arms) pediatric sickle SCD participants in the silent cerebral infarct transfusion (SIT) trial using CFD modeling. We reconstructed the intracranial portion of the internal carotid artery and branches and extracted the geometry using 3D Slicer. We cut specific portions of the large intracranial artery to include segments of the internal carotid, middle, anterior, and posterior cerebral arteries such that the vessel segment analyzed extended from the intracranial beginning of the internal carotid artery up to immediately after (~0.25 inches) the middle cerebral artery branching point. Cut models were imported into Ansys 2021R2/2022R1 and laminar and time-dependent flow simulation was performed. Change in time averaged mean velocity, wall shear stress, and vessel tortuosity were compared between the observation and cRBC arms. We did not observe a correlation between time averaged mean velocity (TAMV) and mean transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocity at study entry. There was also no difference in change in time average mean velocity, wall shear stress (WSS), and vessel tortuosity between the observation and cRBC transfusion arms. WSS and TAMV were abnormal for 2 (developed TIA) out of the 3 participants (one participant had silent cerebral infarctions) that developed neurovascular outcomes. CFD approaches allow for the evaluation of vascular topology and hemodynamics in SCD using MRA images. In this proof of principle study, we show that CFD could be a useful tool and we intend to carry out future studies with a larger sample to enable more robust conclusions.</p>

	<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has proven to be a challenge for healthcare systems, especially in terms of the care of patients with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD). Age is one of the major risk factors for severe forms of COVID-19, most probably due to the presence of comorbidities and inflammations. It is known that SARS-CoV-2 invades nerve endings and olfactory nerves through the binding of the spike protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. This interaction triggers an inflammatory cascade that results in cognitive impairment. In turn, the isoform of apolipoprotein-E4 (APOE-4&amp;amp;epsilon;) in AD is a risk factor for increased neuroinflammation through microglia activation, increased oxidative stress, and neurodegeneration. AD and SARS-CoV-2 are associated with increases in levels of inflammatory markers, as well as increases in levels of APOE-4&amp;amp;epsilon;, ACE2 and oxidative stress. Thus, there is a synergistic relationship between AD and SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the social isolation and other health measures resulting from the pandemic have led to a higher level of anxiety and depression among AD patients, a situation which may lead to a decline in cognitive function. Therefore, there is a need to develop strategies for keeping the patient calm but active.</p>

	<p>Source activity was extracted from resting-state magnetoencephalography data of 103 subjects aged 18&amp;amp;ndash;60 years. The directionality of information flow was computed from the regional time courses using delay symbolic transfer entropy and phase entropy. The analysis yielded a dynamic source connectivity profile, disentangling the direction, strength, and time delay of the underlying causal interactions, producing independent time delays for cross-frequency amplitude-to-amplitude and phase-to-phase coupling. The computation of the dominant intrinsic coupling mode (DoCM) allowed me to estimate the probability distribution of the DoCM independently of phase and amplitude. The results support earlier observations of a posterior-to-anterior information flow for phase dynamics in {&amp;amp;alpha;1, &amp;amp;alpha;2, &amp;amp;beta;, &amp;amp;gamma;} and an opposite flow (anterior to posterior) in &amp;amp;theta;. Amplitude dynamics reveal posterior-to-anterior information flow in {&amp;amp;alpha;1, &amp;amp;alpha;2, &amp;amp;gamma;}, a sensory-motor &amp;amp;beta;-oriented pattern, and an anterior-to-posterior pattern in {&amp;amp;delta;, &amp;amp;theta;}. The DoCM between intra- and cross-frequency couplings (CFC) are reported here for the first time and independently for amplitude and phase; in both domains {&amp;amp;delta;, &amp;amp;theta;, &amp;amp;alpha;1}, frequencies are the main contributors to DoCM. Finally, a novel brain age index (BAI) is introduced, defined as the ratio of the probability distribution of inter- over intra-frequency couplings. This ratio shows a universal age trajectory: a rapid rise from the end of adolescence, reaching a peak in adulthood, and declining slowly thereafter. The universal pattern is seen in the BAI of each frequency studied and for both amplitude and phase domains. No such universal age dependence was previously reported.</p>

	<p>Since depression remains a major public health issue there is a constant need for new and more efficient therapeutic strategies based on the mechanisms involved in the aetiology of depression. Thus, the pathogenic link between depression and inflammation is considered to play a potential key role in the development of such therapies. This review summarizes the results of various pharmacological (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin, cyclooxygenase inhibitors, cytokine inhibitors, corticosteroids, statins, minocycline, N-acetyl cysteine, omega-3 fatty acids and probiotics) and non-pharmacological interventions (electroconvulsive therapy, physical exercise and psychological therapy) and outlines their efficacy and discusses potential challenges. Both conventional and non-conventional anti-inflammatory drugs showed promising results according to the specific group of patients. The pre-existing pro-inflammatory status was, in most cases, a predictor for clinical efficacy and, in some cases, a correlation between clinical improvement and changes in various biomarkers was found. Some of the non-pharmacological interventions (physical exercise and electroconvulsive therapy) have also showed beneficial effects for depressive patients with elevated inflammatory markers. Treatments with anti-inflammatory action may improve clinical outcomes in depression, at least for some categories of patients, thus opening the way for a future personalised approach to patients with unipolar depression regarding the inflammation-related mechanism.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Emx1-Cre Is Expressed in Peripheral Autonomic Ganglia That Regulate Central Cardiorespiratory Functions</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The Emx1-IRES-Cre transgenic mouse is commonly used to direct genetic recombination in forebrain excitatory neurons. However, the original study reported that Emx1-Cre is also expressed embryonically in peripheral autonomic ganglia, which could potentially affect the interpretation of targeted circuitry contributing to systemic phenotypes. Here, we report that Emx1-Cre is expressed in the afferent vagus nerve system involved in autonomic cardiorespiratory regulatory pathways. Our imaging studies revealed expression of Emx1-Cre driven tdtomato fluorescence in the afferent vagus nerve innervating the dorsal medulla of brainstem, cell bodies in the nodose ganglion, and their potential target structures at the carotid bifurcation such as the carotid sinus and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG). Photostimulation of the afferent terminals in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) <I>in vitro</I> using Emx1-Cre driven ChR2 reliably evoked EPSCs in the postsynaptic neurons with electrophysiological characteristics consistent with the vagus afferent nerves. In addition, optogenetic stimulation targeting the Emx1-Cre expressing structures identified in this study, such as vagus nerve, carotid bifurcation, and the dorsal medulla surface transiently depressed cardiorespiratory rate in urethane anesthetized mice <I>in vivo</I>. Together, our study demonstrates that Emx1-IRES-Cre is expressed in the key peripheral autonomic nerve system and can modulate cardiorespiratory function independently of forebrain expression. These results raise caution when interpreting systemic phenotypes of Emx1-IRES-Cre conditional recombinant mice, and also suggest the utility of this line to investigate modulators of the afferent vagal system.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Perinatal Morphine Exposure Leads to Sex-Dependent Executive Function Deficits and Microglial Changes in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Children exposed prenatally to opioids are at an increased risk for behavioral problems and executive function deficits. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) and amygdala (AMG) regulate executive function and social behavior and are sensitive to opioids prenatally. Opioids can bind to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to activate microglia, which may be developmentally important for synaptic pruning. Therefore, we tested the effects of perinatal morphine exposure on executive function and social behavior in male and female mouse offspring, along with microglial-related and synaptic-related outcomes. Dams were injected once daily subcutaneously with saline (<I>n</I> = 8) or morphine (MO; 10 mg/kg; <I>n</I> = 12) throughout pregestation, gestation, and lactation until offspring were weaned on postnatal day 21 (P21). Male MO offspring had impairments in attention and accuracy in the five-choice serial reaction time task, while female MO offspring were less affected. Targeted gene expression analysis at P21 in the PFC identified alterations in microglial-related and TLR4-related genes, while immunohistochemical analysis in adult brains indicated decreased microglial Iba1 and phagocytic CD68 proteins in the PFC and AMG in males, but females had an increase. Further, both male and female MO offspring had increased social preference. Overall, these data demonstrate male vulnerability to executive function deficits in response to perinatal opioid exposure and evidence for disruptions in neuron&ndash;microglial signaling.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Frmpd1 Facilitates Trafficking of G-Protein Transducin and Modulates Synaptic Function in Rod Photoreceptors of Mammalian Retina</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Trafficking of transducin (G&alpha;<SUB>t</SUB>) in rod photoreceptors is critical for adaptive and modulatory responses of the retina to varying light intensities. In addition to fine-tuning phototransduction gain in rod outer segments (OSs), light-induced translocation of G&alpha;<SUB>t</SUB> to the rod synapse enhances rod to rod bipolar synaptic transmission. Here, we show that the rod-specific loss of Frmpd1 (FERM and PDZ domain containing 1), in the retina of both female and male mice, results in delayed return of G&alpha;<SUB>t</SUB> from the synapse back to outer segments in the dark, compromising the capacity of rods to recover from light adaptation. Frmpd1 directly interacts with Gpsm2 (G-protein signaling modulator 2), and the two proteins are required for appropriate sensitization of rod-rod bipolar signaling under saturating light conditions. These studies provide insight into how the trafficking and function of G&alpha;<SUB>t</SUB> is modulated to optimize the photoresponse and synaptic transmission of rod photoreceptors in a light-dependent manner.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Commanding or Being a Simple Intermediary: How Does It Affect Moral Behavior and Related Brain Mechanisms?</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Psychology and neuroscience research have shown that fractioning operations among several individuals along a hierarchical chain allows diffusing responsibility between components of the chain, which has the potential to disinhibit antisocial actions. Here, we present two studies, one using fMRI (Study 1) and one using EEG (Study 2), designed to help understand how commanding or being in an intermediary position impacts the sense of agency and empathy for pain. In the age of military drones, we also explored whether commanding a human or robot agent influences these measures. This was done within a single behavioral paradigm in which participants could freely decide whether or not to send painful shocks to another participant in exchange for money. In Study 1, fMRI reveals that activation in social cognition-related and empathy-related brain regions was equally low when witnessing a victim receive a painful shock while participants were either commander or simple intermediary transmitting an order, compared with being the agent directly delivering the shock. In Study 2, results indicated that the sense of agency did not differ between commanders and intermediary, no matter whether the executing agent was a robot or a human. However, we observed that the neural response over P3 event-related potential was higher when the executing agent was a robot compared with a human. Source reconstruction of the EEG signal revealed that this effect was mediated by areas including the insula and ACC. Results are discussed regarding the interplay between the sense of agency and empathy for pain for decision-making.</p>

                <p>Here, we report the generation and comprehensive characterization of a knock-in mouse model for the hotspot p.Arg87Cys variant of the cytoplasmic FMR1-interacting protein 2 (<i>CYFIP2</i>) gene, which was recently identified in individuals diagnosed with West syndrome, a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. The <i>Cyfip2</i>
<sup>
   <i>+/R87C</i>
</sup> mice recapitulated many neurological and neurobehavioral phenotypes of the patients, including spasm-like movements, microcephaly, and impaired social communication. Age-progressive cytoarchitectural disorganization and gliosis were also identified in the hippocampus of <i>Cyfip2</i>
<sup>
   <i>+/R87C</i>
</sup> mice. Beyond identifying a decrease in CYFIP2 protein levels in the <i>Cyfip2</i>
<sup>
   <i>+/R87C</i>

                <p>Risk of sudden death in multiple system atrophy (MSA) is greatest during sleep with unknown mechanisms<b>.</b> We compared nocturnal pulse event frequency in 46 MSA patients and age-sex matched controls undergoing overnight pulse oximetry. Nocturnal oxyhemoglobin desaturation indices (ODI) and pulse event indices (PEI) were recorded and relationships between pulse oximetry variables and survival were analyzed. MSA patients had lower PEI (3.1 ± 5.3 vs. 12.8 ± 10.8, p &lt;0.001) despite greater hypoxic burden and similar frequency of respiratory events. Nocturnal pulse events were not associated with severity of daytime autonomic failure. Two MSA patients had suspected sudden death, both with severely reduced PEI. MSA patients have fewer nocturnal pulse events compared with controls, despite similar respiratory event frequency, suggesting abnormal cardiac responses to sleep disordered breathing. Whether this contributes to sudden death in MSA requires further study.</p>

                The article presents a dataset on the characteristics of stablecoins. Stablecoins represent a relatively young but increasingly important branch of the cryptocurrency market. Although they all share the same goal of maintaining a stable value in the digital market, they form a highly heterogeneous group. They differ in terms of collateral and stabilization mechanism, peg, availability of the technical documentation, presence on crypto exchanges or age. The dataset is cross-sectional and was created based on internet research. Individual information was collected from websites of the stablecoin projects and a crypto-data aggregator, and to a lesser extent from other auxiliary sources (websites related to finance and cryptocurrencies). The dataset is unique as there are no publicly available databases encompassing the features of stablecoins. It can be used in all stablecoin-related analyses to characterise the examined coins and to investigate the relationship between cryptocurrency market developments and stablecoin features.

                Background: Medicines that are expired or deteriorated within a household must be disposed of in an effective and environmentally friendly manner, to the point that they do not end up being a risk to the community and the environment. To do this, the members of Peruvian households must have the knowledge and the appropriate attitude, together with the necessary tools for the effective disposal of these drugs. For this reason, the research objective is as follows: to evaluates the relationship between the level of knowledge and attitudes on how to dispose of medicines in households in the district of San Juan de Miraflores. Methods: Hypothetical-deductive, quantitative approach, applied type and non-experimental, observational design, for which 385 households in the district of San Juan de Miraflores were surveyed. Results: 48.3% of the respondents have an average level of knowledge of how to dispose of medicines. 93.2% of the respondents have a positive attitude towards the disposal of medicines, and there is a relationship between the level of knowledge and attitude towards the disposal of medicines (P-value = 0.000). Conclusions: Increased knowledge is associated with a better attitude to the disposal of medicines.

                Background: Given the chemical richness of medicinal plants (Bidens pilosa L. and Croton floccosus) in Ecuador, they are considered the natural source of numerous medicines. Methods: The leaves were dried at 40°C and 50°C and the extracts were characterized by means of phytochemical screening, verifying the presence of secondary metabolites such as alkaloids, reducing sugars, phenols, flavonoids, tannins and saponins. Three extraction processes were carried out, with two solvents of different polarities: hexane and ethanol. The extraction methods that were applied to the leaves of the plants were Soxhlet, ultrasonic bath and maceration, the latter two at room temperature and Soxhlet at the boiling temperature of the solvent. Determination of the total content of phenols and flavonoids is carried out using the Follin-Ciocalteau colorimetric reaction, Quercetin standard, Aluminum Chloride solution measured with a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The antioxidant activity was performed with the DPPH radical and measured with the same equipment. Results: The highest content of total phenols obtained by employing the Soxhlet method for extraction when the material was dried at 50°C was 48.609 ± 0.370 mg GAE/g of dry sample for Bidens pilosa L. while in the case of Croton floccosus it was 128.212 ± 0.601 mg GAE/g of dry sample obtained from the extraction by means of maceration. Finally, the antioxidant activity against the 1.1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl radical was determined, and it was found that the Bidens pilosa L. species performed better and responded better to the test, with an IC50 value of 239.33 µg/mL, than Croton floccosus (IC50 of 644.125 µg/mL). Conclusions: The following preliminary phytochemical study of the Bidens pilosa L. and Croton floccosus plants provided important information on the content of secondary metabolites and response to the DPPH radical reported for the first time in Ecuador, which may be future use for medicinal application.

It is expected that the global AI race will pave the way for another rise and fall of great powers in the international system, similar to the impact caused by the three industrial revolutions of the past. The literature in IR identifies three major powers – namely, the United States of America (USA), China, and Russia, as the leading contenders in this AI race. The ongoing AI-enabled fourth industrial revolution is all the more unique due to the markedly different approaches these three powers have adopted for integrating AI into their military, political, and socio-economic spheres. The AI strategies of these countries further reflect their capabilities and intentions towards how they plan on employing the technology to elevate their prestige and power status in the international system. This paper draws from a historiography of the First, Second, and Third Industrial Revolutions to study how technological innovations have altered relative power capabilities of nations, triggering a re-ordering of power hierarchies at a systemic level. Drawing from this understanding, it analyses the nature of AI as an emerging technology and assesses whether it can cause systemic alterations. It critically examines and compares the AI strategies of the USA, China, and Russia as leading contenders in the global AI race and outlines their strengths and weaknesses. It further draws from the Adoption Capacity Theory to argue that the AI race may well be determined by the relative capacity of the major institutions in each of these countries to manage and adapt to the disruptions this technology is bound to bring to the fore.

                Background: The aim was to evaluate the antifungal activity of propolis extract against Candida albicans (or C. albicans) in patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis. Methods: The research presents a quantitative approach with an experimental design, with a population of C. albicans strains isolated from patients diagnosed with vulvovaginal candidiasis who were admitted to the Gynecology Service of the Maria del Socorro Clinic, district of Ate, Lima; a sample of 34 strains was chosen in total, considering three repetitions per strain, obtaining 102 experimental units. The antifungal susceptibility test was carried out by the disc diffusion plate method using a single concentration of propolis extract, with fluconazole as a positive control. Results: Propolis extract was shown to inhibit all strains of C. albicans, as was fluconazole, with the effect of the latter being significantly greater than that of the product under investigation. Conclusions: The conclusion is that propolis extract does show antifungal activity against C. albicans in patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The contradictory effects of coffee intake on periodontal health: a systematic review [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Drinking coffee is known to have both positive and negative aftermath on periodontal health. The current study is aiming to systematically review the impact of coffee consumption on periodontal health status. Methods: An article search was carried out in two electronic databases (PUBMED and Web of Sciences). The assessment of the included articles were conducted using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tool. Data were analyzed qualitatively. Result: A total of 10 articles were included in this study. Most (5) of the studies discovered a negative correlation between coffee intake and periodontal health, while 4 other studies found the protective effect of daily coffee consumption against alveolar bone loss. Last, only one study found that coffee intake did not relate with periodontitis. Conclusion: The effect of coffee consumption on periodontal health was fragmented since coffee has complex components that may give either beneficial effects or negative impact on periodontal health.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evaluation of clinical, histology, TNF-α, and collagen expressions on oral ulcer in rats after treatment with areca nut and chrysanthemum oral gel [version 4; peer review: 1 approved, 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Areca nut (Areca catechu Linn.) is the seed of the fruit of the oriental palm that is commonly used among Southeast Asian communities. Chrysanthemum (Dendrathema grandiflora) is a flowering plant originating from East Asia and dominantly grows in China. Both of these plants have strong antioxidant activities. To investigate the mechanism of their wound healing activities, we prepared areca nut and chrysanthemum polyethylene oral gel and performed several in vivo assays using Sprague–Dawley rats. Methods: Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into five groups: Negative control group (rats with base gel treatment), positive control group (rats treated with triamcinolone acetonide), F1 (treatment with 20% areca nut:80% chrysanthemum), F2 (treatment with 50% areca nut:50% chrysanthemum), and F3 (treatment with 80% areca nut:20% chrysanthemum). Traumatic ulcers were performed on the buccal mucosa of all experimental animals that received topical oral gel and triamcinolone acetonide twice a day for seven days. The clinical and histological characteristics were analyzed and scored. Results: During the six days, the ulcerated area receded linearly over time and was completely cicatrized in F2, F3, and positive control group (Dependent t-test, p<0.05). There were significant increases in body weight in F2 and positive control groups. There were no significant differences between groups in histology examination (Kruskal Wallis test, p<0.05). The moderate score of TNF-α levels was seen in F2 and positive control groups (ANOVA/Tukey test, p<0.05). In the collagenases assay, a high concentration of areca nut (F3) induced the abundance of collagen during the ulcer healing process. Conclusions: The combination of areca nut and chrysanthemum extract in the oral gel can optimize the healing of traumatic oral ulcers in Sprague-Dawley rats through the increase of TNF-α and collagen deposition.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Seroprevalence of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in domestic dogs and cats and its relationship with COVID-19 cases in the city of Villavicencio, Colombia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Since the beginning of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak, different animal species have been implicated as possible intermediate hosts that could facilitate the transmission of the virus between species. The detection of these hosts has intensified, reporting wild, zoo, farm, and pet animals. The goal of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins (IgG) in domestic dogs and cats and its epidemiological association with the frequency of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients in Villavicencio, Colombia. Methods: 300 dogs and 135 cats were randomly selected in a two-stage distribution by clusters according to COVID-19 cases (positive RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2) within the human population distributed within the eight communes of Villavicencio. Indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique was applied in order to determine anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in sera samples. Kernel density estimation was used to compare the prevalence of COVID-19 cases with the seropositivity of dogs and cats. Results: The overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 4.6% (95% CI=3.2-7.4). In canines, 3.67% (95% CI=2.1-6.4) and felines 6.67% (95% CI=3.6-12.18). Kernel density estimation indicated that seropositive cases were concentrated in the southwest region of the city. There was a positive association between SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in pet animals and their habitat in Commune 2 (adjusted OR=5.84; 95% CI=1.1-30.88). Spearman's correlation coefficients were weakly positive (p=0.32) between the ratio of COVID-19 cases in November 2020 and the results for domestic dogs and cats from the eight communes of Villavicencio. Conclusions: In the present research cats were more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection than dogs. This study provides the first positive results of anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA serological tests in domestic dogs and cats in Colombia with information about the virus transmission dynamics in Latin America during the COVID-19 pandemic.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Co-cultures of cerebellar slices from mice with different reelin genetic backgrounds as a model to study cortical lamination [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Reelin has fundamental functions in the developing and mature brain. Its absence gives rise to the Reeler phenotype in mice, the first described cerebellar mutation. In homozygous mutants missing the Reelin gene (reln-/-), neurons are incapable of correctly positioning themselves in layered brain areas such as the cerebral and cerebellar cortices. We here demonstrate that by employing ex vivo cultured cerebellar slices one can reduce the number of animals and use a non-recovery procedure to analyze the effects of Reelin on the migration of Purkinje neurons (PNs). Methods: We generated mouse hybrids (L7-GFPrelnF1/) with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged PNs, directly visible under fluorescence microscopy. We then cultured the slices obtained from mice with different reln genotypes and demonstrated that when the slices from reln-/- mutants were co-cultured with those from reln+/- mice, the Reelin produced by the latter induced migration of the PNs to partially rescue the normal layered cortical histology. We have confirmed this observation with Voronoi tessellation to analyze PN dispersion. Results: In images of the co-cultured slices from reln-/- mice, Voronoi polygons were larger than in single-cultured slices of the same genetic background but smaller than those generated from slices of reln+/- animals. The mean roundness factor, area disorder, and roundness factor homogeneity were different when slices from reln-/- mice were cultivated singularly or co-cultivated, supporting mathematically the transition from the clustered organization of the PNs in the absence of Reelin to a layered structure when the protein is supplied ex vivo. Conclusions: Neurobiologists are the primary target users of this 3Rs approach. They should adopt it for the possibility to study and manipulate ex vivo the activity of a brain-secreted or genetically engineered protein (scientific perspective), the potential reduction (up to 20%) of the animals used, and the total avoidance of severe surgery (3Rs perspective).
