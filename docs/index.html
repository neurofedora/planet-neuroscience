                Background Indonesia currently could not make it to the top ten global halal due to some external and internal factors, although it is the largest Muslim country. In the external sector, the competition map is getting tougher, while internally, there are handicaps in the form of weak public awareness of competition. As a country with the largest Muslim population in the world, Indonesia can become one of the largest markets in the world. As indicated in the Global Islamic Economic Report (GIER), Indonesia is one of the top ten countries that control the Islamic economic market, yet it fails to dominate its Islamic market. Accordingly, the government needs to play a stronger role through regulatory policies to encourage the development of the Islamic economic ecosystem in Indonesia (halal value chain). The purpose of this study is to find out and analyze the existence of Micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Indonesia in the world’s market for Halal products and Services. Methods The researchers have conducted a form of normative juridical research with the analytical descriptive method, namely by collecting, describing, analyzing, and presenting what is (das sein) and what ought to be (das sollen). Results Support from the government and stakeholders has not been optimal in improving welfare - capital access, management, and halal certification, so the existence of the global halal ecosystem has not yet impacted MSMEs’ ability to compete competitively. Conclusions The conclusion of this study shows that the quadruple helix innovation system is capable of guaranteeing the development of MSMEs in a manner to achieves a high level of competitiveness - efficiency, and effectiveness of the products and services produced.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-479/v2?src=rss">Effects of electroacupuncture on cognitive symptoms in major depressive disorder: a pilot study and randomized controlled trial [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Objectives To investigate the impact of electroacupuncture on cognitive function, quality of life (QoL), and depression severity in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods This double-blinded randomized controlled trial included 60 participants aged 18-55 with cognitive symptoms related to MDD at Thammasat University Hospital. Participants were divided into two groups: the electroacupuncture group combined with standard antidepressant treatment (EG; n=30) and the control group receiving standard care with placebo acupuncture (CG; n=30). The study assessed 1) executive functions using the Trail making test- B and Stroop Color and Word Test, 2) delayed recall, and 3) subjective cognitive complaint and Quality of life (QoL) using WHODAS 2.0. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Thai version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Baseline and post-intervention assessments were conducted over 10 weeks. Mann-Whitney U test analyzed treatment effects by comparing median differences between groups. Results Both groups exhibited similar demographics and cognitive traits. Cognitive improvement was observed in both groups at the endpoint. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed significantly higher median scores for subjective cognitive complaints in the EG compared to the CG (EG: Median = 5.5, CG: Median = 0.0, p=0.049). No serious side effects were identified from either electroacupuncture or placebo acupuncture. Conclusions Electroacupuncture improved subjective complaints in MDD patients with cognitive symptoms, but did not show effects on specific cognitive functions, QoL, or depressive symptoms. This study provides initial evidence supporting the potential of electroacupuncture in MDD patients with cognitive symptoms, suggesting opportunities for further research. Trial registration NCT06239740, February 2, 2024, ClinicalTrials.gov.

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/7/ENEURO.0068-24.2024?rss=1">Short-Term Memory Capacity Predicts Willingness to Expend Cognitive Effort for Reward</a></h4>

              
                <p>We must often decide whether the effort required for a task is worth the reward. Past rodent work suggests that willingness to deploy cognitive effort can be driven by individual differences in perceived reward value, depression, or chronic stress. However, many factors driving cognitive effort deployment&mdash;such as short-term memory ability&mdash;cannot easily be captured in rodents. Furthermore, we do not fully understand how individual differences in short-term memory ability, depression, chronic stress, and reward anticipation impact cognitive effort deployment for reward. Here, we examined whether these factors predict cognitive effort deployment for higher reward in an online visual short-term memory task. Undergraduate participants were grouped into high and low effort groups (<I>n</I><SUB>HighEffort</SUB> = 348, <I>n</I><SUB>LowEffort</SUB> = 81; <I>n</I><SUB>Female</SUB> = 332, <I>n</I><SUB>Male</SUB> = 92, <I>M</I><SUB>Age</SUB> = 20.37, <I>Range</I><SUB>Age</SUB> = 16&ndash;42) based on decisions in this task. After completing a monetary incentive task to measure reward anticipation, participants completed short-term memory task trials where they could choose to encode either fewer (low effort/reward) or more (high effort/reward) squares before reporting whether or not the color of a target square matched the square previously in that location. We found that only greater short-term memory ability predicted whether participants chose a much higher proportion of high versus low effort trials. Drift diffusion modeling showed that high effort group participants were more biased than low effort group participants toward selecting high effort trials. Our findings highlight the role of individual differences in cognitive effort ability in explaining cognitive effort deployment choices.</p>

                Background Coronavirus disease 2019 can spread rapidly. Surgery in the oral cavity poses a high risk of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The American Dental Association and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend the use of mouthwash containing 1.5% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or 0.2% povidone iodine (PI) to reduce the viral load in the upper respiratory tract and decrease the risk of transmission. The aim of the present study was to analyze the effect of mouth rinsing and gargling with mouthwash containing 1% PI, 0.5% PI, 3% H2O2, or 1.5% H2O2 and water on the cycle threshold (CT) value obtained by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Methods This study is a randomized single blind controlled clinical trial which has been registered in the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) registry on the 3rd February 2022 (Registration number: ISRCTN18356379). In total, 69 subjects recruited from Persahabatan General Hospital who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups or the control group. The subjects were instructed to gargle with 15 mL of mouthwash for 30 s in the oral cavity followed by 30 s in the back of the throat, three times per day for 5 days. CT values were collected on postprocedural days 1, 3, and 5. Results The results of the Friedman test significantly differed among the groups (n=15). The CT values increased from baseline (day 0) to postprocedural days 1, 3, and 5. Conclusions Mouth rinsing and gargling with mouthwash containing 1% PI, 0.5% PI, 3% H2O2, or 1.5% H2O2 and water increased the CT value.

                Background and aim During the past decade, the frequency of extrapulmonary forms of tuberculosis (TB) has increased. These forms are often miss-diagnosed. This statement of the TB epidemiological profile modification, conduct us to reflect about the utility of the Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) in active TB detection. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy performance of the TST for active tuberculosis detection. Methods This was a case-control, multicenter study conducted in 11 anti-TB centers in Tunisia (June-November2014). The cases were adults aged between 18 and 55 years with newly diagnosed and confirmed tuberculosis. Controls were free from tuberculosis. A data collection sheet was filled out and a TST was performed for each participant. Diagnostic accuracy measures of TST were estimated using Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) curve and Area Under Curve (AUC) to estimate sensitivity and specificity of a determined cut-off point. Results Overall, 1050 patients were enrolled, composed of 336 cases and 714 controls. The mean age was 38.3±11.8 years for cases and 33.6±11 years for controls. The mean diameter of the TST induration was significantly higher among cases than controls (13.7mm vs.6.2mm; p=10-6). AUC was 0.789 [95% CI: 0.758-0.819; p=0.01], corresponding to a moderate discriminating performance for this test. The most discriminative cut-off value of the TST, which was associated with the best sensitivity (73.7%) and specificity (76.6%) couple was   ≥ 11 mm with a Youden index of 0.503. Positive and Negative predictive values were 3.11% and 99.52%, respectively. Conclusions TST could be a useful tool used for active tuberculosis detection, with a moderate global performance and accepted sensitivity and specificity at the cut-off point of 11 mm. However, it cannot be considered as a gold standard test due to its multiple disadvantages.

                Abstract* A 20’s primiparous woman, following spontaneous expulsion of intrauterine death of the fetus at 30 weeks of gestation, presented on post-partum day 8 with acute onset flaccid quadriparesis and breathing difficulty, which had rapidly progressed to involve the legs on day 3 up to her upper limbs on post-partum day 5. Following examination, Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS) with ascending diaphragmatic involvement was diagnosed, and plasma exchange was initiated. She developed raised blood pressure, headache, sudden onset visual loss with 2 episodes of generalized seizures on post-partum day 14. Brain MRI and clinical suspicion helped diagnose Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES). The patient was treated with anticonvulsants and antihypertensive agents. She regained her vision over the next two days, completed the treatment for GBS, and made a good recovery with independence for advanced activities of daily living on follow-up.

                Endometriosis is a benign, estrogen-dependent, persistent chronic inflammatory heterogeneous condition that features adhesions caused by estrogen-dependent periodic bleeding. It is characterised by a widely spread fibrotic interstitium that comprising of fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, collagen fibres, extracellular proteins, inflammatory cells, and active angiogenesis found outside the uterus. Thus, fibrosis is recognized as a critical component because of which current treatments, such as hormonal therapy and surgical excision of lesions are largely ineffective with severe side effects, high recurrence rates, and significant morbidity. The symptoms include dysmenorrhea (cyclic or non-cyclic), dyspareunia, abdominal discomfort, and infertility. The significant lack of knowledge regarding the underlying root cause, etiology, and complex pathogenesis of this debilitating condition, makes it challenging to diagnose early and to implement therapeutic approaches with minimal side effects presenting substantial hurdles in endometriosis management. Research on understanding the pathogenesis of endometriosis is still ongoing to find biomarkers and develop non-hormonal therapeutic approaches. Current clinical research indicates a close relationship between endometriosis and fibrosis, which is thought to be tightly linked to pain, a major factor for the decline in the patient’s quality of life but little is known about the underlying pathophysiological cellular and molecular signaling pathways that lead to endometriosis-related fibrosis. The available experimental disease models have tremendous challenges in reproducing the human characteristics of the disease to assess treatment effectiveness. Future translational research on the topic has been hindered by the lack of an adequate fibrotic model of endometriosis emphasizing the necessity of etiological exploration. This review article’s goal is to examine recent developments in the field and pinpoint knowledge gaps that exist with a focus on the development of novel fibrotic mouse models for the early diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis and how this knowledge aids in the development of novel anti-fibrotic treatments which opens fresh avenues for a thorough investigation and extended research in the field of endometriosis.

                Background Sleep hygiene education (SHE) and lavender essential oil (LEO) inhalation are two effective strategies aimed at enhancing sleep quality and mood states. This study investigated the effects of a single SHE session combined with nightly LEO inhalation for 7 days of late-evening resistance training sessions on sleep quality and mood states in trained athletes. Methods Forty-two athletes were randomly assigned to four groups: a control group (CG), a SHE group (SHEG), a LEO group (LEOG), and a SHE + LEO group (CSLG). CG and LEOG maintained their sleep habits during the intervention, while SHEG and CSLG followed SHE recommendations. Additionally, LEOG and CSLG inhaled LEO nightly before sleep. Sleep patterns were recorded via actigraphy. The Brunel Mood Scale and the Hooper questionnaires were completed before and after the intervention. Results Sleep latency was lower in SHEG (p=0.001) and CSLG (p=0.012) compared to the CG. The subjective sleep score improved in SHEG, LEOG, and CSLG (p < 0.001), with greater improvement observed in SHEG (p = 0.002) and CSLG (p < 0.001) compared to CG at post-intervention. Additionally, significant improvements were observed in the Hooper index in the SHEG (p=0.048) and CSLG (p=0.027), with CSLG demonstrating higher scores compared to CG at the post-intervention assessment (p=0.026). Furthermore, the subjective fatigue score significantly decreased in the CSLG (p=0.009). Conclusions Combining SHE and LEO inhalation could be an effective strategy to enhance sleep latency, subjective sleep quality, and overall wellness, and reduce feelings of fatigue in trained athletes following late-evening resistance training sessions.

                Objective Tuberculosis is a global health challenge with one-third of the world’s population infected by it. Although ocular side effects of Anti-tubercular drugs are well known, the patients generally report late in the course which can result in irreversible vision loss. The purpose of this study was to study the visual field changes during the time course of anti-tubercular therapy (ATT). Methods A total of 48 patients were studied in this prospective type of study. All patients newly diagnosed with TB and started on treatment were included in the study. Baseline examination which included visual acuity, color vision, anterior segment, IOP, Amsler grid, fundus, and visual field test were performed before starting ATT and at 6-month follow-up. Results The mean age of the study population was 35.90 ± 10.2 years. 35 (72.9%) were males and 13 (27.1%) females. 32(66.6%) had pulmonary TB and the rest 16 (33.3%) had extrapulmonary TB. MDR TB was diagnosed in 27 (56.3%) of the patients with the rest 21 (43.8%) being drug sensitive. The baseline examination was normal in all 48 patients. 3(6.3%) out of 45 patients presented with visual complaints after the treatment initiation. Altogether 7 patients out of 48, had visual field defects at the 6-month follow-up. The incidence of visual field defects in our study was 14.6% with the value being significant (0.016). 8.3% had peripheral constriction of visual fields, 2.1% with Severe generalized depression of visual fields and 2.1% with central scotoma. Out of the 45 patients with no visual complaints at 6-month follow-up, 4 (8.33%) showed peripheral field constriction. Conclusion Visual field defects caused by ATT can precede clinical symptoms. Visual field evaluation can be an important tool for the early detection of optic neuropathy in patients receiving ATT in clinical settings where Visual evoked potential testing and RNFL-OCT are not available.

                <p>by Chrysovalantou Kalaitzidou, Georgios Grekas, Andreas Zilian, Charalambos Makridakis, Phoebus Rosakis</p>

We present a new model and extensive computations that explain the dramatic remodelling undergone by a fibrous collagen extracellular matrix (ECM), when subjected to contractile mechanical forces from embedded cells or cell clusters. This remodelling creates complex patterns, comprising multiple narrow localised bands of severe densification and fiber alignment, extending far into the ECM, often joining distant cells or cell clusters (such as tumours). Most previous models cannot capture this behaviour, as they assume stable mechanical fiber response with stress an increasing function of fiber stretch, and a restriction to small displacements. Our fully nonlinear network model distinguishes between two types of single-fiber nonlinearity: fibers that undergo stable (supercritical) buckling (as in previous work) versus fibers that suffer unstable (subcritical) buckling collapse. The model allows unrestricted, arbitrarily large displacements (geometric nonlinearity). Our assumptions on single-fiber instability are supported by recent simulations and experiments on buckling of individual beams with a hierarchical microstructure, such as collagen fibers. We use simple scenarios to illustrate, for the first time, two distinct compressive-instability mechanisms at work in our model: unstable buckling collapse of single fibers, and snap-through of multiple-fiber groups. The latter is possible even when single fibers are stable. Through simulations of large fiber networks, we show how these instabilities lead to spatially extended patterns of densification, fiber alignment and ECM remodelling induced by cell contraction. Our model is simple, but describes a very complex, multi-stable energy landscape, using sophisticated numerical optimisation methods that overcome the difficulties caused by instabilities in large systems. Our work opens up new ways of understanding the unique biomechanics of fibrous-network ECM, by fully accounting for nonlinearity and associated loss of stability in fiber networks. Our results provide new insights on tumour invasion and metastasis.

                <p>by Mahshid Fardadi, J. C. Leiter, Daniel C. Lu, Tetsuya Iwasaki</p>
Aim <p>After spinal cord injuries (SCIs), patients may develop either detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia (DSD) or urinary incontinence, depending on the level of the spinal injury. DSD and incontinence reflect the loss of coordinated neural control among the detrusor muscle, which increases bladder pressure to facilitate urination, and urethral sphincters and pelvic floor muscles, which control the bladder outlet to restrict or permit bladder emptying. Transcutaneous magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied to the spinal cord after SCI reduced DSD and incontinence. We defined, within a mathematical model, the minimum neuronal elements necessary to replicate neurogenic dysfunction of the bladder after a SCI and incorporated into this model the minimum additional neurophysiological features sufficient to replicate the improvements in bladder function associated with lumbar TMS of the spine in patients with SCI.</p> Methods <p>We created a computational model of the neural circuit of micturition based on Hodgkin-Huxley equations that replicated normal bladder function. We added interneurons and increased network complexity to reproduce dysfunctional micturition after SCI, and we increased the density and complexity of interactions of both inhibitory and excitatory lumbar spinal interneurons responsive to TMS to provide a more diverse set of spinal responses to intrinsic and extrinsic activation of spinal interneurons that remains after SCI.</p> Results <p>The model reproduced the re-emergence of a spinal voiding reflex after SCI. When we investigated the effect of monophasic and biphasic TMS at two frequencies applied at or below T10, the model replicated the improved coordination between detrusor and external urethral sphincter activity that has been observed clinically: low-frequency TMS (1 Hz) within the model normalized control of voiding after SCI, whereas high-frequency TMS (30 Hz) enhanced urine storage.</p> Conclusion <p>Neuroplasticity and increased complexity of interactions among lumbar interneurons, beyond what is necessary to simulate normal bladder function, must be present in order to replicate the effects of SCI on control of micturition, and both neuronal and network modifications of lumbar interneurons are essential to understand the mechanisms whereby TMS reduced bladder dysfunction after SCI.</p>

                <p>by Xiaoyu Yang, Giancarlo La Camera</p>

Evidence for metastable dynamics and its role in brain function is emerging at a fast pace and is changing our understanding of neural coding by putting an emphasis on hidden states of transient activity. Clustered networks of spiking neurons have enhanced synaptic connections among groups of neurons forming structures called cell assemblies; such networks are capable of producing metastable dynamics that is in agreement with many experimental results. However, it is unclear how a clustered network structure producing metastable dynamics may emerge from a fully local plasticity rule, i.e., a plasticity rule where each synapse has only access to the activity of the neurons it connects (as opposed to the activity of other neurons or other synapses). Here, we propose a local plasticity rule producing ongoing metastable dynamics in a deterministic, recurrent network of spiking neurons. The metastable dynamics co-exists with ongoing plasticity and is the consequence of a self-tuning mechanism that keeps the synaptic weights close to the instability line where memories are spontaneously reactivated. In turn, the synaptic structure is stable to ongoing dynamics and random perturbations, yet it remains sufficiently plastic to remap sensory representations to encode new sets of stimuli. Both the plasticity rule and the metastable dynamics scale well with network size, with synaptic stability increasing with the number of neurons. Overall, our results show that it is possible to generate metastable dynamics over meaningful hidden states using a simple but biologically plausible plasticity rule which co-exists with ongoing neural dynamics.

                <p>by Magdalena Miranda, Azul Silva, Juan Facundo Morici, Marcos Antonio Coletti, Mariano Belluscio, Pedro Bekinschtein</p>

Episodic memory is essential to navigate in a changing environment by recalling past events, creating new memories, and updating stored information from experience. Although the mechanisms for acquisition and consolidation have been profoundly studied, much less is known about memory retrieval. Hippocampal spatial representations are key for retrieval of contextually guided episodic memories. Indeed, hippocampal place cells exhibit stable location-specific activity which is thought to support contextual memory, but can also undergo remapping in response to environmental changes. It is unclear if remapping is directly related to the expression of different episodic memories. Here, using an incidental memory recognition task in rats, we showed that retrieval of a contextually guided memory is reflected by the levels of CA3 remapping, demonstrating a clear link between external cues, hippocampal remapping, and episodic memory retrieval that guides behavior. Furthermore, we describe NMDARs as key players in regulating the balance between retrieval and memory differentiation processes by controlling the reactivation of specific memory traces. While an increase in CA3 NMDAR activity boosts memory retrieval, dentate gyrus NMDAR activity enhances memory differentiation. Our results contribute to understanding how the hippocampal circuit sustains a flexible balance between memory formation and retrieval depending on the environmental cues and the internal representations of the individual. They also provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the contributions of hippocampal subregions to generate this balance.

                <p>by Emeline Dubois, Stéphanie Boisnard, Henri-Marc Bourbon, Kenza Yefsah, Karine Budin, Robert Debuchy, Liangran Zhang, Nancy Kleckner, Denise Zickler, Eric Espagne</p>

We show here that in the fungus <i>Sordaria macrospora</i>, the meiosis-specific HORMA-domain protein Hop1 is not essential for the basic early events of chromosome axis development, recombination initiation, or recombination-mediated homolog coalignment/pairing. In striking contrast, Hop1 plays a critical role at the leptotene/zygotene transition which is defined by transition from pairing to synaptonemal complex (SC) formation. During this transition, Hop1 is required for maintenance of normal axis structure, formation of SC from telomere to telomere, and development of recombination foci. These <i>hop1Δ</i> mutant defects are DSB dependent and require Sme4/Zip1-mediated progression of the interhomolog interaction program, potentially via a pre-SC role. The same phenotype occurs not only in <i>hop1Δ</i> but also in absence of the cohesin Rec8 and in <i>spo76-1</i>, a non-null mutant of cohesin-associated Spo76/Pds5. Thus, Hop1 and cohesins collaborate at this crucial step of meiotic prophase. In addition, analysis of 4 non-null mutants that lack this transition defect reveals that Hop1 also plays important roles in modulation of axis length, homolog-axis juxtaposition, interlock resolution, and spreading of the crossover interference signal. Finally, unexpected variations in crossover density point to the existence of effects that both enhance and limit crossover formation. Links to previously described roles of the protein in other organisms are discussed.

The fitness effects of new mutations determine key properties of evolutionary processes. Beneficial mutations drive evolution, yet selection is also shaped by the frequency of small-effect deleterious mutations, whose combined effect can burden otherwise adaptive lineages and alter evolutionary trajectories and outcomes in clonally evolving organisms such as viruses, microbes, and tumors. The small effect sizes of these important mutations have made accurate measurements of their rates difficult. In microbes, assessing the effect of mutations on growth can be especially instructive, as this complex phenotype is closely linked to fitness in clonally evolving organisms. Here, we perform high-throughput time-lapse microscopy on cells from mutation-accumulation strains to precisely infer the distribution of mutational effects on growth rate in the budding yeast, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. We show that mutational effects on growth rate are overwhelmingly negative, highly skewed towards very small effect sizes, and frequent enough to suggest that deleterious hitchhikers may impose a significant burden on evolving lineages. By using lines that accumulated mutations in either wild-type or slippage repair-defective backgrounds, we further disentangle the effects of 2 common types of mutations, single-nucleotide substitutions and simple sequence repeat indels, and show that they have distinct effects on yeast growth rate. Although the average effect of a simple sequence repeat mutation is very small (approximately 0.3%), many do alter growth rate, implying that this class of frequent mutations has an important evolutionary impact.

                <p>by Noga Preminger, Maya Schuldiner</p>

Mitochondrial shape and network formation have been primarily associated with the well-established processes of fission and fusion. However, recent research has unveiled an intricate and multifaceted landscape of mitochondrial morphology that extends far beyond the conventional fission–fusion paradigm. These less-explored dimensions harbor numerous unresolved mysteries.

                Background The relationship dynamics between postdoctoral researchers and their managers – typically Principal Investigators (PIs) - can directly and indirectly impact the professional development activities that postdocs participate in. Although career and development (C&D) conversations can be a platform through which both parties communicate about the postdoc’s development needs and career aspirations, it is unclear how frequently postdocs are having these types of conversations. Evidence from across the UK indicates that this group receive little feedback on their performance. Methods To explore interventions that could empower postdocs to initiate C&D conversations, we conducted a pilot study at the University of Cambridge where current postdocs were offered workshops utilizing two widely available professional development tools. Both workshops included 360-degree feedback interventions, and we hypothesized that the feedback gathered through these tools could give postdocs both a launching pad for facilitating a conversation with their PI and address the aforementioned feedback shortfall. Results Although most of the participant sample reported already having C&D conversations, those who did not report as such demonstrated mixed feelings about whether facilitating these types of discussions is even part of the PI role. Insights from participants’ engagement with the 360-degree feedback tools also show that participants were mindful of time constraints when seeking feedback, indicating that the usefulness of such interventions may be inhibited by wider cultural issues in the sector. Conclusions Through the development of what we call ‘the researcher development framework, this study highlights the shortcomings of using professional development interventions to address cultural issues.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27015?af=R">Lesions Causing Alice in Wonderland Syndrome Map to a Common Brain Network Linking Body and Size Perception</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AIWS) profoundly affects human perception of size and scale, particularly regarding one's own body and the environment. Its neuroanatomical basis has remained elusive, partly because brain lesions causing AIWS can occur in different brain regions. Here, we aimed to determine if brain lesions causing AIWS map to a distributed brain network.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A retrospective case–control study analyzing 37 cases of lesion-induced AIWS identified through systematic literature review was conducted. Using resting-state functional connectome data from 1,000 healthy individuals, the whole-brain connections of each lesion were estimated and contrasted with those from a control dataset comprising 1,073 lesions associated with 25 other neuropsychiatric syndromes. Additionally, connectivity findings from lesion-induced AIWS cases were compared with functional neuroimaging results from 5 non-lesional AIWS cases.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>AIWS-associated lesions were located in various brain regions with minimal overlap (≤33%). However, the majority of lesions (≥85%) demonstrated shared connectivity to the right extrastriate body area, known to be selectively activated by viewing body part images, and the inferior parietal cortex, involved in size and scale judgements. This pattern was uniquely characteristic of AIWS when compared with other neuropsychiatric disorders (family-wise error-corrected <i>p &lt;</i> 0.05) and consistent with functional neuroimaging observations in AIWS due to nonlesional causes (median correlation <i>r =</i> 0.56, interquartile range 0.24).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>AIWS-related perceptual distortions map to one common brain network, encompassing regions critical for body representation and size-scale processing. These findings lend insight into the neuroanatomical localization of higher-order perceptual functions, and may inform future therapeutic strategies for perceptual disorders.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Olfactory oscillations may enhance cognitive processing through coupling with beta (β, 15–30 Hz) and gamma (γ, 30–160 Hz) activity in the hippocampus (HPC). We hypothesize that coupling between olfactory bulb (OB) and HPC oscillations is increased by cholinergic activation in control rats and is reduced in kainic-acid-treated epileptic rats, a model of temporal lobe epilepsy. OB γ2 (63–100 Hz) power was higher during walking and immobility-awake (IMM) compared to sleep, while γ1 (30–57 Hz) power was higher during grooming than other behavioral states. Muscarinic cholinergic agonist pilocarpine (25 mg/kg ip) with peripheral muscarinic blockade increased OB power and OB-HPC coherence at β and γ1 frequency bands. A similar effect was found after physostigmine (0.5 mg/kg ip) but not scopolamine (10 mg/kg ip). Pilocarpine increased bicoherence and cross-frequency coherence (CFC) between OB slow waves (SW, 1–5 Hz) and hippocampal β, γ1 and γ2 waves, with stronger coherence at CA1 alveus and CA3c than CA1 stratum radiatum. Bicoherence further revealed a nonlinear interaction of β waves in OB with β waves at the CA1-alveus. Beta and γ1 waves in OB or HPC were segregated at one phase of the OB-SW, opposite to the phase of γ2 and γ3 (100–160 Hz) waves, suggesting independent temporal processing of β/γ1 versus γ2/γ3 waves. At CA1 radiatum, kainic-acid-treated epileptic rats compared to control rats showed decreased theta power, theta-β and theta-γ2 CFC during baseline walking, decreased CFC of HPC SW with γ2 and γ3 waves during baseline IMM, and decreased coupling of OB SW with β and γ2 waves at CA1 alveus after pilocarpine. It is concluded that β and γ waves in the OB and HPC are modulated by a slow respiratory rhythm, in a cholinergic and behavior-dependent manner, and OB-HPC functional connectivity at β and γ frequencies may enhance cognitive functions.</p>

                Background The study investigates the influence of antecedents of the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and personality traits on entrepreneurial intention and behaviour among engineering students in an emerging economy. It employs the extension of the TPB model by focusing on the intention-behaviour gap, an under-researched area in research. Furthermore, it investigates the moderating effect of entrepreneurial motivation on the relationship between intention and behaviour to improve conceptual model predictability. Methods A structured questionnaire was used to gather data from 1,564 engineering students, and the data were analyzed using structural equation modelling (SEM) with Amos software. Results The results revealed that subjective norms were the strongest predictor of entrepreneurial intention and behaviour, followed by entrepreneurial alertness, perceived behavioural control, attitude towards entrepreneurship, need for achievement, and risk tolerance. Moreover, the moderation analysis showed that entrepreneurial motivation was crucial in moderating the relationship between intention and behaviour. Conclusions The present conceptual model contributes to the existing TPB model by improving predictive power to understand the intention-behaviour relationship. The results of the study will assist policymakers, academicians of higher education institutions, and universities in developing policies, strategies, and curricula to engage more students in entrepreneurial activities.

                Inhibitory interneurons are thought to exhibit stereotyped patterns of activity. By imaging large populations of parvalbumin (PV) interneurons simultaneously at kilohertz speed, Huang et al. reveal dynamic and flexible “cell assemblies” formed by PV cells. These assemblies may support a much richer pattern of postsynaptic inhibition than previously thought.

                Spatial and temporal associations between sympatric species underpin biotic interactions, structure ecological assemblages, and sustain ecosystem functioning and stability. However, the resilience of interspecific spatiotemporal associations to human activity remains poorly understood, particularly in mountain forests where anthropogenic impacts are often pervasive. Here, we applied context-dependent Joint Species Distribution Models to a systematic camera-trap survey dataset from a global biodiversity hotspot in eastern Himalayas to understand how prominent human activities in mountain forests influence species associations within terrestrial mammal communities. We obtained 10,388 independent detections of 17 focal species (12 carnivores and five ungulates) from 322 stations over 43,163 camera days of effort. We identified a higher incidence of positive associations in habitats with higher levels of human modification (87%) and human presence (83%) compared to those located in habitats with lower human modification (64%) and human presence (65%) levels. We also detected a significant reduction of pairwise encounter time at increasing levels of human disturbance, corresponding to more frequent encounters between pairs of species. Our findings indicate that human activities can push mammals together into more frequent encounters and associations, which likely influences the coexistence and persistence of wildlife, with potential far-ranging ecological consequences.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94583">Editing of endogenous tubulins reveals varying effects of tubulin posttranslational modifications on axonal growth and regeneration</a></h4>

              
                Tubulin posttranslational modifications (PTMs) modulate the dynamic properties of microtubules and their interactions with other proteins. However, the effects of tubulin PTMs were often revealed indirectly through the deletion of modifying enzymes or the overexpression of tubulin mutants. In this study, we directly edited the endogenous tubulin loci to install PTM-mimicking or -disabling mutations and studied their effects on microtubule stability, neurite outgrowth, axonal regeneration, cargo transport, and sensory functions in the touch receptor neurons of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. We found that the status of β-tubulin S172 phosphorylation and K252 acetylation strongly affected microtubule dynamics, neurite growth, and regeneration, whereas α-tubulin K40 acetylation had little influence. Polyglutamylation and detyrosination in the tubulin C-terminal tail had more subtle effects on microtubule stability likely by modulating the interaction with kinesin-13. Overall, our study systematically assessed and compared several tubulin PTMs for their impacts on neuronal differentiation and regeneration and established an in vivo platform to test the function of tubulin PTMs in neurons.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93871">Heparan sulfate-dependent phase separation of CCL5 and its chemotactic activity</a></h4>

              
                Secreted chemokines form concentration gradients in target tissues to control migratory directions and patterns of immune cells in response to inflammatory stimulation; however, how the gradients are formed is much debated. Heparan sulfate (HS) binds to chemokines and modulates their activities. In this study, we investigated the roles of HS in the gradient formation and chemoattractant activity of CCL5 that is known to bind to HS. CCL5 and heparin underwent liquid–liquid phase separation and formed gradient, which was confirmed using CCL5 immobilized on heparin-beads. The biological implication of HS in CCL5 gradient formation was established in CHO-K1 (wild-type) and CHO-677 (lacking HS) cells by Transwell assay. The effect of HS on CCL5 chemoattractant activity was further proved by Transwell assay of human peripheral blood cells. Finally, peritoneal injection of the chemokines into mice showed reduced recruitment of inflammatory cells either by mutant CCL5 (lacking heparin-binding sequence) or by addition of heparin to wild-type CCL5. Our experimental data propose that co-phase separation of CCL5 with HS establishes a specific chemokine concentration gradient to trigger directional cell migration. The results warrant further investigation on other heparin-binding chemokines and allows for a more elaborate insight into disease process and new treatment strategies.

">Interhemispheric Connectivity of the Human Temporal Lobes</a></h4>

              
                Much is known regarding the major white matter pathways connecting the right and left temporal lobes, which project through the posterior corpus callosum, the anterior commissure, and the dorsal hippocampal commissure. However, details about the spatial location of these tracts are unclear, including their exact course and proximity to cortical and subcortical structures, the spatial relations between corpus callosum and anterior commissure projections, and the caudal extent of transcallosal connections within the splenium. We present an atlas of these tracts derived from high angular resolution diffusion tractography maps, providing improved visualization of the spatial relationships of these tracts. The data show several new details, including branching of the transcallosal pathway into medial and lateral divisions, projections of the transcallosal pathway into the external capsule and claustrum, complex patterns of overlap and interdigitation of the transcallosal and anterior commissure tracts, distinct dorsal and ventral regions of the splenium with high tract densities, and absence of temporal lobe projections in the caudal third of the splenium. Intersection of individual tract probability maps with individual cortical surfaces were used to identify likely regions with relatively higher cortical termination densities. These data should be useful for planning surgical approaches involving the temporal lobe and for developing functional-anatomical models of processes that depend on interhemispheric temporal lobe integration, including speech perception, semantic memory, and social cognition.

">Assessing the predictive value of peak alpha frequency for the sensitivity to pain</a></h4>

              
                Pain perception varies considerably between and within individuals. How the brain determines these variations has yet to be fully understood. The peak frequency of alpha oscillations (PAF) has recently been shown to predict an individual's sensitivity to longer-lasting experimental and clinical pain. PAF is, thus, discussed as a potential biomarker and novel target for neuromodulatory treatments of pain. Here, we scrutinized the generalizability of the relation between PAF and pain. We applied brief painful laser stimuli to 159 healthy participants and related inter- and intra-individual variations of pain perception to PAF measured with electroencephalography. Comprehensive multiverse analyses across two sessions did not provide consistent evidence for a predictive role of PAF for brief experimental pain. This indicates that the relationship between PAF and pain does not generalize to all types of pain and calls for a systematic exploration of the relationship between PAF, pain perception, and other neuropsychiatric symptoms.

">Dual roles of idling moments in past and future memories</a></h4>

              
                Every day, we experience new daily episodes and store new memories. Although memories are stored in corresponding engram cells, how different sets of engram cells are selected for current and next episodes, and how they create their memories, remains unclear. We report that in mice, hippocampal CA1 neurons show an organized synchronous activity in prelearning home cage sleep that correlates with the learning ensembles only in engram cells, termed preconfigured ensembles. Moreover, after learning, a subset of nonengram cells develops population activity, which is constructed during postlearning offline periods through synaptic depression and scaling, and then emerges to represent engram cells for new learning. Together, our findings indicate that during offline periods there are two parallel processes occurring: conserving of past memories through reactivation, and preparation for upcoming ones through offline synaptic plasticity mechanisms.

">Metabolic mode estimated by breathing reflects long-term motor memory</a></h4>

              
                Respiration is a crucial metabolic process that converts macronutrients and oxygen (O2) into energy and carbon dioxide (CO2), supporting motor actions. In addition to the energy demands for movements, the brain is a significant energy consumer for neural activity and plasticity. However, it is not known whether breathing patterns can serve as an indicator for them as they can for movement intensity. According to computational theory, motor memory updating involves fast and slow timescales, which may correspond to neural activity and plasticity. To investigate whether breathing patterns reflect these time constants, human experiments assessed short- and long-term memories while recording the O2-CO2 gas exchange. We found that the respiratory exchange ratio (RER), an indicator of metabolic mode, was not influenced by the execution and learning of the reaching movement and was stable within individuals but diverse across individuals. Interestingly, the individual differences in the RER reflect individual variation in long-term memory rather than short-term memory. Furthermore, to manipulate the RER, we provided 200 kcal of glucose immediately before the task. Surprisingly, 24-hour retention increased by 21%. Together, the RER would serve as a remarkable proxy for long-term motor memory and ingesting glucose would shift the neurophysiological idling state for learning.

">Disturbance of the Sense of Agency in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and its Modulation by Social Context</a></h4>

              
                Executing precise actions and perceiving them as one's own is a fundamental ability underlying the sense of agency (SoA). The SoA thereby heavily relies on the accuracy and reliability of forward models, capturing sensory movement consequences. Impairments thereof thus represent a promising candidate mechanism contributing to cases of SoA pathogenesis. In obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), for example, the feeling of control over one's actions is perturbed: Compulsive actions are often experienced as uncontrollable and performed without conscious awareness. At the same time, compulsions can be coupled with an inflated sense of illusory control for uncontrollable events. Here we studied self-action perception in virtual reality with and without veridical or rotated visual feedback about subjects' pointing movements to test whether patients' internal forward models are indeed less reliable compared to controls. Interestingly, OCD patients did not exhibit deficits in their accuracy and reliability of motor performance and self-action perception in the absence of visual feedback, suggesting intact forward models. Nonetheless, OCD patients weighted rotated visual action-feedback significantly stronger perceptually. Furthermore, they adapted their movement to this false feedback on a trial-by-trial basis. Finally, increasing the social relevance of action consequences led to stronger feedback weighting in all participants while this effect increased with the strength of OCD symptomatology under conditions with strongest social relevance. We suggest that internal forward models are equally reliable in OCD but their weight is pathologically decreased leading to patients' overreliance on explicit visual action-feedback and, more generally, to their over-attribution of unrelated events to themselves.

                Astrocytes provide crucial support for neurons, contributing to synaptogenesis, synaptic maintenance, and neurotransmitter recycling. Under pathological conditions, deregulation of astrocytes contributes to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers disease (AD), highlighting the growing interest in targeting astrocyte function to address early phases of AD pathogenesis. While most research in this field has focused on protein-coding genes, non-coding RNAs, particularly long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), have emerged as significant regulatory molecules. In this study, we identified the lncRNA PRDM16-DT as highly enriched in the human brain, where it is almost exclusively expressed in astrocytes. PRDM16-DT and its murine homolog, Prdm16os, are downregulated in the brains of AD patients and in AD models. In line with this, knockdown of PRDM16-DT and Prdm16os revealed its critical role in maintaining astrocyte homeostasis and supporting neuronal function by regulating genes essential for glutamate uptake, lactate release, and neuronal spine density through interactions with the RE1-Silencing Transcription factor (Rest) and Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). Notably, CRISPR-mediated overexpression of Prdm16os mitigated functional deficits in astrocytes induced by stimuli linked to AD pathogenesis. These findings underscore the importance of PRDM16-DT in astrocyte function and its potential as a novel therapeutic target for neurodegenerative disorders characterized by astrocyte dysfunction

">A Markovian neural barcode representing mesoscale cortical spatiotemporal dynamics.</a></h4>

              
                Mesoscale cortical dynamics consist of stereotyped patterns of recurring activity motifs, however the constraints and rules governing how these motifs assemble over time is not known. Here we propose a Continuous Time Markov Chain model that probabilistically describes the temporal sequence of activity motifs using Markov Elements derived using semi-binary non-negative matrix factorization. Although derived from a discovery sample, these can be applied to new recordings from new mice. Unwrapping the associated transition probability matrix creates a 'Markovian neural barcode' describing the probability of Markov element transitions as a compact and interpretable representation of neocortical dynamics. We show broad utility across a range of common mesoscale cortical imaging applications, ranging from time-locked events to pathological models. Moreover, it allows the discovery of new and emergent Markov Elements that unmask the flexibility of constraints governing cortical dynamics. The Markovian neural barcode provides a novel and powerful tool to characterize cortical function.

">Behavioral state regulates the dynamics of memory consolidation</a></h4>

              
                Long-term memories are consolidated over time, progressively becoming more stable and resistant to interference. Memory consolidation occurs offline and often involves transfer of memories from one brain site to another. For many motor memories, consolidation is thought to involve early learning in cerebellar cortex that is subsequently transferred to the cerebellar nuclei. Here we report that in mice, engaging in locomotor activity during training in a classical conditioning task shifts the critical time window for memory consolidation, from just after training sessions, to between trials, within sessions. This temporal shift requires natural patterns of cerebellar granule cell activity during intertrial intervals and is accompanied by earlier involvement of the downstream cerebellar nucleus. These results reveal that the critical time window for cerebellar memory consolidation can be surprisingly brief, on a timescale from seconds to minutes, and that it is dynamically regulated by behavioral state.

                A fundamental trait of intelligent behavior is the ability to respond selectively to stimuli with higher value. Where along the somatosensory hierarchy does information transition from a map of stimulus location to a map of stimulus value? To address this question, we recorded single-unit activity from populations of neurons in somatosensory cortex (S1) and midbrain superior colliculus (SC) in mice conditioned to respond to a positive-valued whisker stimulus and withhold responses using an adjacent, negative-valued whisker stimulus. The stimulus preference of the S1 population was equally weighted towards either whisker, in line with a somatotopic map. Surprisingly, we discovered a large population of SC neurons that were disproportionately biased towards the positive stimulus. This disproportionate bias was controlled by spike facilitation for the positive stimulus and spike suppression for the negative stimulus in single neurons. Removing the opportunity for mice to select the positive stimulus reduced stimulus bias in SC but not S1, suggesting that sensory processing in SC neurons was partially controlled by movement preparation. Similarly, the spontaneous firing rates of SC but not S1 neurons accurately predicted reaction times, suggesting that SC neurons play a persistent role in perceptual decision-making. Taken together, these data indicate that the somatotopic map in S1 is transformed into a value-based map in SC that encodes stimulus priority.

">Human Accelerated Regions regulate gene networks implicated in apical-to-basal neural progenitor fate transitions</a></h4>

              
                The evolution of the human cerebral cortex involved modifications in the composition and proliferative potential of the neural stem cell (NSC) niche during brain development. Human Accelerated Regions (HARs) exhibit a significant excess of human-specific sequence changes and have been implicated in human brain evolution. Multiple studies support that HARs include neurodevelopmental enhancers with novel activities in humans, but their biological functions in NSCs have not been empirically assessed at scale. Here we conducted a direct-capture Perturb-seq screen repressing 180 neurodevelopmentally active HARs in human iPSC-derived NSCs with single-cell transcriptional readout. After profiling >188,000 NSCs, we identified a set of HAR perturbations with convergent transcriptional effects on gene networks involved in NSC apicobasal polarity, a cellular process whose precise regulation is critical to the developmental emergence of basal radial glia (bRG), a progenitor population that is expanded in humans. Across multiple HAR perturbations, we found convergent dysregulation of specific apicobasal polarity and adherens junction regulators, including PARD3, ABI2, SETD2, and PCM1. We found that the repression of one candidate from the screen, HAR181, as well as its target gene CADM1, disrupted apical PARD3 localization and NSC rosette formation. Our findings reveal interconnected roles for HARs in NSC biology and cortical development and link specific HARs to processes implicated in human cortical expansion.

">The frontal cortex adjusts striatal integrator dynamics for flexible motor timing</a></h4>

              
                Flexible control of motor timing is crucial for behavior. Before movement begins, the frontal cortex and striatum exhibit ramping spiking activity, with variable ramp slopes anticipating movement onsets. This activity may function as an adjustable 'timer,' triggering actions at the desired timing. However, because the frontal cortex and striatum share similar ramping dynamics and are both necessary for timing behaviors, distinguishing their individual roles in this timer function remains challenging. To address this, we conducted perturbation experiments combined with multi-regional electrophysiology in mice performing a lick-timing task. Following transient silencing of the frontal cortex, cortical and striatal activity swiftly returned to pre-silencing levels and resumed ramping, leading to a shift in lick timing close to the silencing duration. Conversely, briefly inhibiting the striatum caused a gradual decrease in ramping activity in both regions, with ramping resuming from post-inhibition levels, shifting lick timing beyond the inhibition duration. Thus, inhibiting the frontal cortex and striatum effectively paused and rewound the timer, respectively. Additionally, the frontal cortex, but not the striatum, encodes trial-history information guiding lick timing. These findings suggest specialized functional allocations within the forebrain: the striatum temporally integrates input from the frontal cortex to generate ramping activity that regulates motor timing.

">Spatiotemporal patterns in cortical development: Age, puberty, and individual variability from 9 to 13 years of age</a></h4>

              
                Humans and nonhuman primate studies suggest that timing and tempo of cortical development varies neuroanatomically along a sensorimotor-to-association (S-A) axis. Prior human studies have reported a principal S-A axis across various modalities, but largely rely on cross-sectional samples with wide age-ranges. Here, we investigate developmental changes and individual variability in cortical organization along the S-A axis between the ages of 9-13 years using a large, longitudinal sample (N = 2487-3747, 46-50% female) from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (ABCD Study). This work assesses multiple aspects of neurodevelopment indexed by changes in cortical thickness, resting-state functional fluctuations, and cortical microarchitecture. First, we evaluated S-A organization in age-related changes and, then, computed individual-level S-A alignment in brain changes and assessing differences therein due to age, sex, and puberty. Varying degrees of linear and quadratic age-related brain changes were identified along the S-A axis. Yet, these patterns of cortical development were overshadowed by considerable individual variability in S-A alignment. Even within individuals, there was little correspondence between S-A patterning across the different aspects of neurodevelopment investigated (i.e., cortical morphology, microarchitecture, function). Some of the individual variation in developmental patterning of cortical morphology and microarchitecture was explained by age, sex, and pubertal development. Altogether, this work contextualizes prior findings that regional age differences do progress along an S-A axis at a group level, while highlighting broad variation in developmental change between individuals and between aspects of cortical development, in part due to sex and puberty.

">Longitudinal trajectories of brain development from infancy to school age and their relationship to literacy development</a></h4>

              
                Reading is one of the most complex skills that we utilize daily, and it involves the early development and interaction of various lower-level subskills, including phonological processing and oral language. These subskills recruit brain structures, which begin to develop long before the skill manifests and exhibit rapid development during infancy. However, how longitudinal trajectories of early brain development in these structures supports long-term acquisition of literacy subskills and subsequent reading is unclear. Children underwent structural and diffusion MRI scanning at multiple timepoints between infancy and second grade and were tested for literacy subskills in preschool and decoding and word reading in early elementary school. We developed and implemented a reproducible pipeline to generate longitudinal trajectories of early brain development to examine associations between these trajectories and literacy (sub)skills. Furthermore, we examined whether familial risk of reading difficulty and home literacy environment, two common literacy-related covariates, influenced those trajectories. Results showed that individual differences in curve features (e.g., intercepts and slopes) for longitudinal trajectories of volumetric, surface-based, and white matter organization measures in left-hemispheric reading-related regions and tracts were linked directly to phonological processing and indirectly to second-grade decoding and word reading skills via phonological processing. Altogether, these findings suggest that the brain bases of phonological processing, previously identified as the strongest behavioral predictor of reading and decoding skills, may already begin to develop early in infancy but undergo further refinement between birth and preschool. The present study underscores the importance of considering academic skill acquisition from the very beginning of life.

">Motor adaptation is reduced by symbolic compared to sensory feedback</a></h4>

              
                Motor adaptation, the process of reducing motor errors through feedback and practice, is an essential feature of human competence, allowing us to move accurately in dynamic and novel environments. Adaptation typically results from sensory feedback, with most learning driven by visual and proprioceptive feedback that arises with the movement. In humans, motor adaptation can also be driven by symbolic feedback. In the present study, we examine how implicit and explicit components of motor adaptation are modulated by symbolic feedback. We conducted three reaching experiments involving over 400 human participants to compare sensory and symbolic feedback using a task in which both types of learning processes could be operative (Experiment 1) or tasks in which learning was expected to be limited to only an explicit process (Experiments 2 and 3). Adaptation with symbolic feedback was dominated by explicit strategy use, with minimal evidence of implicit recalibration. Even when matched in terms of information content, adaptation to rotational and mirror reversal perturbations was slower in response to symbolic feedback compared to sensory feedback. Our results suggest that the abstract and indirect nature of symbolic feedback disrupts strategic reasoning and/or refinement, deepening our understanding of how feedback type influences the mechanisms of sensorimotor learning.

	<p>This prospective crossover study aimed to investigate the effect of binaural beat therapy music on soccer player performance. Between July 2023 and December 2023, 45 athletes (31 females/14 males, mean age = 20.47 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.99) wore Bluetooth earphones through which one of the following was given during initial 20 min warm-up exercises before undergoing repeated sprint ability tests: no music/fast-tempo music/fast-tempo music with background binaural beat therapy music. Heart rate change after warm-up exercises/repeated sprint ability (RSA) tests and the time to finish RSA tests were recorded. Despite no significant difference in heart rate increase after warm-up between the two genders regardless of intervention, larger increases after RSA tests were found in males following any of the three interventions (all p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) with the most notable difference observed after fast-tempo music (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). A significant effect size (r = 0.2) correlated with fast-tempo music during warm-up in either gender. Binaural beat therapy music during warm-up reached a significant effect size only when all participants were considered, suggesting limited benefits.</p>

">Transcranial focused ultrasound activates feedforward and feedback cortico-thalamo-cortical pathways by selectively activating excitatory neurons</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS) has been proven capable of altering focal neuronal activities and neural circuits non-invasively in both animals and humans. The abilities of tFUS for cell-type selection within the targeted area like somatosensory cortex have been shown to be parameter related. However, how neuronal subpopulations across neural pathways are affected, for example how tFUS affected neuronal connections between brain areas remains unclear. In this study, multi-site intracranial recordings were used to quantify the neuronal responses to tFUS stimulation at somatosensory cortex (S1), motor cortex (M1) and posterior medial thalamic nucleus (POm) of cortico-thalamo-cortical (CTC) pathway. We found that when targeting at S1 or POm, only regular spiking units (RSUs, putative excitatory neurons) responded to specific tFUS parameters (duty cycle: 6%-60% and pulse repetition frequency: 1500 and 3000 Hz ) during sonication. RSUs from the directly connected area (POm or S1) showed a synchronized response, which changed the directional correlation between RSUs from POm and S1. The tFUS induced excitation of RSUs activated the feedforward and feedback loops between cortex and thalamus, eliciting delayed neuronal responses of RSUs and delayed activities of fast spiking units (FSUs) by affecting local network. Our findings indicated that tFUS can modulate the CTC pathway through both feedforward and feedback loops, which could influence larger cortical areas including motor cortex.

">Dopamine transmission at D1 and D2 receptors in the nucleus accumbens contributes to the expression of incubation of cocaine craving</a></h4>

              
                Relapse represents a consistent clinical problem for individuals with substance use disorder. In the incubation of craving model of persistent craving and relapse, cue-induced drug seeking progressively intensifies or "incubates" during the first weeks of abstinence from drug self-administration and then remains high for months. Previously, we and others have demonstrated that expression of incubated cocaine craving requires strengthening of excitatory synaptic transmission in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcc). However, despite the importance of dopaminergic signaling in the NAcc for motivated behavior, little is known about the role that dopamine (DA) plays in the incubation of cocaine craving. Here we used fiber photometry to measure DA transients in the NAcc of male and female rats during cue-induced seeking tests conducted in early abstinence from cocaine self-administration, prior to incubation, and late abstinence, after incubation of craving has plateaued. We observed DA transients time-locked to cue-induced responding but their magnitude did not differ significantly when measured during early versus late abstinence seeking tests. Next, we tested for a functional role of these DA transients by injecting DA receptor antagonists into the NAcc just before the cue-induced seeking test. Blockade of either D1 or D2 DA receptors reduced cue-induced cocaine seeking after but not before incubation. We found no main effect of sex in our experiments. These results suggest that DA contributes to incubated cocaine seeking but the emergence of this role reflects changes in postsynaptic responsiveness to DA rather than presynaptic alterations.

">Laminar CBV and BOLD response-characteristics over time and space in the human primary somatosensory cortex at 7T</a></h4>

              
                Uncovering the cortical representation of the body has been at the core of human brain mapping for decades, with special attention given to the digits. In the last decade, advances in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technologies have opened the possibility of non-invasively unraveling the 3rd dimension of digit representations in humans along cortical layers. In laminar fMRI it is common to combine the use of the highly sensitive blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) contrast with cerebral blood volume sensitive measurements, like vascular space occupancy (VASO), that are more specific to the underlying neuronal populations. However, the spatial and temporal VASO response characteristics across cortical depth to passive stimulation of the digits are still unknown. Therefore, we characterized haemodynamic responses to vibrotactile stimulation of individual digit-tips across cortical depth at 0.75 mm in-plane spatial resolution using BOLD and VASO fMRI at 7T. We could identify digit-specific regions of interest (ROIs) in putative Brodmann area 3b, following the known anatomical organization. In the ROIs, the BOLD response increased towards the cortical surface due to the draining vein effect, while the VASO response was more shifted towards middle cortical layers, likely reflecting bottom-up input from the thalamus, as expected. Interestingly, we also found slightly negative BOLD and VASO responses for non-preferred digits in the ROIs, potentially indicating neuronal surround inhibition. Finally, we explored the temporal signal dynamics for BOLD and VASO as a function of distance from activation peaks resulting from stimulation of contralateral digits. With this analysis, we showed a triphasic response consisting of an initial peak and a subsequent negative deflection during stimulation, followed by a positive post-stimulus response in BOLD and to some extent in VASO. While similar responses were reported with invasive methods in animal models, here we demonstrate a potential neuronal excitation-inhibition mechanism in a center-surround architecture across layers in the human somatosensory cortex. Given that, unlike in animals, human experiments do not rely on anesthesia and can readily implement extensive behavioral testing, obtaining this effect in humans is an important step towards further uncovering the functional significance of the different aspects of the triphasic response.

">Large-Scale Motor Dynamics Associated with Reaching are Altered in Essential Tremor</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Essential Tremor (ET) is a common neurological disorder identified by involuntary rhythmic movements stemming from pathological synchronization within a network that overlaps significantly with the normal motor circuit. The efficacy of therapeutic brain stimulation for ET is impeded by a limited understanding of how tremor-related synchronization affects brain circuits and disrupts normal sensorimotor processing. This paper details the changes in brain-wide synchronization associated with ET and connects these to the oscillatory dynamics during voluntary movements. Methods: We used high-density electroencephalography (EEG, 11 controls, 12 patients), and for the first time in ET patients, optically pumped magnetoencephalography (OPM, 5 controls, 4 patients) to record brain activity during upper limb reaching. We localized and analysed brain sources that synchronize with pathological tremors, studying motor oscillations in these regions. Using a novel dimensionality reduction approach, we identified a set of simple, latent circuits with specific frequency characteristics and analysed their relationship to kinematics and tremor. Results: Despite slight reductions in velocity, ET patients demonstrated reaching movements with kinematics comparable to controls. Notably, key motor areas - including the supplementary motor area, lateral prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex, and motor cerebellum - were synchronized to tremor frequencies. Motor oscillations were significantly changed in patients with ET relative to controls, including a 15% increase in movement responsive desynchronization in the low beta (14-21 Hz) band which inversely correlated with tremor severity. Oscillations in the beta and theta bands were key predictors of patients' overall tremor levels. Latent state analysis in EEG and OPM data located these changes to fronto-parietal and premotor/prefrontal circuits. High tremor trials were associated with diminished post-movement beta rebound in frontoparietal and premotor circuits and an increase in sensorimotor gamma activity (30-60 Hz). Latent dynamics were predictive of changes in patients' movement velocity and hold stability, suggesting that increased movement related beta desynchronization may reflect a compensatory mechanism in the brain. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that ET leads to significant changes in the oscillatory dynamics within individual motor regions and broader networks. Specifically, we suggest that increased desynchronization of networks in ET enables successful execution of movement, by freeing neural resources otherwise entrained by pathological synchronization at tremor frequencies. Our findings, reproducible across both EEG and OPM recordings, underline how motor-related brain signals can predict subject level tremor severity and offer a new set of candidate biomarkers crucial for developing advanced closed-loop stimulation therapies for ET.

">Fast and reliable quantitative measures of white matter development with magnetic resonance fingerprinting</a></h4>

              
                Developmental cognitive neuroscience aims to shed light on evolving relationships between brain structure and cognitive development. To this end, quantitative methods that reliably measure individual differences in brain tissue properties are fundamental. Standard qualitative MRI sequences are influenced by scan parameters and hardware-related biases, and also lack physical units, making the analysis of individual differences problematic. In contrast, quantitative MRI can measure physical properties of the tissue but with the cost of long scan durations and sensitivity to motion. This poses a critical limitation for studying young children. Here, we examine the reliability and validity of an efficient quantitative multiparameter mapping method - Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) - in children scanned longitudinally. We focus on T1 values in white matter, since quantitative T1 values are known to primarily reflect myelin content, a key factor in brain development. Forty-nine children (age range 8-13y) completed two scanning sessions 2-4 months apart. In each session, two 2-minute 3D-MRF scans at 1mm isotropic resolution were collected to evaluate the effect of scan duration on image quality and scan-rescan reliability. A separate calibration scan was used to measure B0 inhomogeneity and correct for bias. We examined the impact of scan time and B0 inhomogeneity correction on scan-rescan reliability of values in white matter, by comparing single 2-min and combined two 2-min scans, with and without B0-correction. Whole-brain voxel-based reliability analysis showed that combining two 2-min MRF scans improved reliability (Pearson's r=0.87) compared with a single 2-min scan (r=0.84), while B0-correction had no effect on reliability in white matter (r=0.86 and 0.83 4-min vs 2-min). Using diffusion tractography, we delineated MRF-derived T1 profiles along major white matter fiber tracts and found similar or higher reliability for T1 from MRF compared to diffusion parameters (based on a 10-minute dMRI scan). Lastly, we found that T1 values in multiple white matter tracts were significantly correlated with age. In sum, MRF-derived T1 values were highly reliable in a longitudinal sample of children and replicated known age effects. Reliability in white matter was improved by longer scan duration but was not affected by B0-correction, making it a quick and straightforward scan to collect. We propose that MRF provides a promising avenue for acquiring quantitative brain metrics in children and patient populations where scan time and motion are of particular concern.

">A widespread electrical brain network encodes anxiety in health and depressive states</a></h4>

              
                In rodents, anxiety is charactered by heightened vigilance during low-threat and uncertain situations. Though activity in the frontal cortex and limbic system are fundamental to supporting this internal state, the underlying network architecture that integrates activity across brain regions to encode anxiety across animals and paradigms remains unclear. Here, we utilize parallel electrical recordings in freely behaving mice, translational paradigms known to induce anxiety, and machine learning to discover a multi-region network that encodes the anxious brain-state. The network is composed of circuits widely implicated in anxiety behavior, it generalizes across many behavioral contexts that induce anxiety, and it fails to encode multiple behavioral contexts that do not. Strikingly, the activity of this network is also principally altered in two mouse models of depression. Thus, we establish a network-level process whereby the brain encodes anxiety in health and disease.

">Dopamine-induced Relaxation of Connectivity Diversifies Burst Patterns in Cultured Hippocampal Networks</a></h4>

              
                The intricate interplay of neurotransmitters orchestrates a symphony of neural activity in the hippocampus, with dopamine emerging as a key conductor in this complex ensemble. Despite numerous studies uncovering the cellular mechanisms of dopamine, its influence on hippocampal neural networks remains elusive. Combining in vitro electrophysiological recordings of rat embryonic hippocampal neurons, pharmacological interventions, and computational analyses of spike trains, we found that dopamine induces a relaxation in network connectivity, characterised by a reduction in spike coherence. This relaxation expands the repertoire of burst dynamics within these hippocampal networks, a phenomenon notably absent under the administration of dopamine antagonists. Our study provides a thorough understanding of the roles of dopamine signalling in shaping functional networks of hippocampal neurons.

">A level adjusted cochlear frequency-to-place map for estimating tonotopic frequency mismatch with a cochlear implant</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: To provide a level-adjusted correction to the current standard relating anatomical cochlear place to characteristic frequency in humans, and to re-evaluate anatomical frequency mismatch in cochlear implant (CI) recipients considering this correction. It is hypothesized that a level-adjusted place-frequency function may represent a more accurate tonotopic benchmark for CIs in comparison to the current standard. Design: The present analytical study compiled data from fifteen previous animal studies that reported iso-intensity responses from cochlear structures at different stimulation levels. Extracted outcome measures were characteristic frequencies and centroid-based best frequencies at 70 dB SPL input from 47 specimens spanning a broad range of cochlear locations. A simple relationship was used to transform these measures to human estimates of characteristic and best frequencies, and non-linear regression was applied to these estimates to determine how the standard human place-frequency function should be adjusted to reflect best frequency rather than characteristic frequency. The proposed level-adjusted correction was then compared to average place-frequency positions of commonly used CI devices when programmed with clinical settings. Results: The present study showed that the best frequency at 70 dB SPL (BF70) tends to shift away from characteristic frequency (CF). The amount of shift was statistically significant (signed-rank test z = 5.143, p < 0.001), but the amount and direction of shift depended on cochlear location. At cochlear locations up to 600 degrees from the base, BF70 shifted downwards in frequency relative to CF by about 4 semitones on average. Beyond 600 degrees from the base, BF70 shifted upwards in frequency relative to CF by about 6 semitones on average. In terms of spread (90% prediction interval), the amount of shift between CF and BF70 varied from relatively no shift to nearly an octave of shift. With the new level-adjusted frequency-place function, the amount of anatomical frequency mismatch for devices programmed with standard of care settings is less extreme than originally thought, and may be nonexistent for all but the most apical electrodes. Conclusions: The present study validates the current standard for relating cochlear place to characteristic frequency, and introduces a level-adjusted correction for how best frequency shifts away from characteristic frequency at moderately loud stimulation levels. This correction may represent a more accurate tonotopic reference for CIs. To the extent that it does, its implementation may potentially enhance perceptual accommodation and speech understanding in CI users, thereby improving CI outcomes and contributing to advancements in the programming and clinical management of CIs.

">1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-Treated Adult Zebrafish as a Model for Parkinsons Disease</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine (DA) is a neuroprotective catecholamine and neurotransmitter that works to regulate cognitive functions (Channer et al., 2023). Patients affected by Parkinsons Disease (PD) experience a loss of dopaminergic neurons, lower levels of DA, and downregulated neural DA production. This leads to cognitive and physical decline that is the hallmark of PD. Currently, no cure exists for this prevalent neurodegenerative disease. Danio rerio, or zebrafish, have become an increasingly popular disease model used in PD pharmaceutical development. This model still requires extensive development to better characterize which PD features are adequately represented. Furthermore, the great majority of PD zebrafish models have been performed by treating embryos, which may not be relevant towards age-related human PD development. As an improvement, mature D. rerio (18 months) were treated with the neurotoxic prodrug 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) through intraperitoneal injection to induce Parkinsonianism. Behavioral analysis confirmed the disparity in movement between saline-injected control and the MPTP experimental group, in which swim distance and speed were significantly lowered seven days after MPTP injection. Simultaneously, cognitive decline was apparent in MPTP zebrafish compared to control, demonstrated by decreased alternation in a y-maze. RT-qPCR confirmed trends consistent with downregulation in Parkinsonian genetic markers, specifically DA transporter (DAT), MAO-B, PINK1. In summary, mature zebrafish injected with MPTP present with similar movement and cognitive decline as compared to human disease. Despite its benefits, this model does not appear to recapitulate full pathophysiology of the disease with the full profile of expected gene downregulation. Because of this, it is important that researchers looking for pharmacological interventions for PD only use this zebrafish model when targeting the human-relevant PD symptoms and causes that are represented.

">Activity-dependent synthesis of Emerin gates neuronal plasticity by regulating proteostasis</a></h4>

              
                Neurons dynamically regulate their proteome in response to sensory input, a key process underlying experience-dependent plasticity. We characterized the visual experience-dependent nascent proteome within a brief, defined time window after stimulation using an optimized metabolic labeling approach. Visual experience induced cell type-specific and age-dependent alterations in the nascent proteome, including proteostasis-related processes. We identified Emerin as the top activity-induced candidate plasticity protein and demonstrated that its rapid activity-induced synthesis is transcription-independent. In contrast to its nuclear localization and function in myocytes, activity-induced neuronal Emerin is abundant in the endoplasmic reticulum and broadly inhibits protein synthesis, including translation regulators and synaptic proteins. Downregulating Emerin shifted the dendritic spine population from predominantly mushroom morphology to filopodia and decreased network connectivity. In mice, decreased Emerin reduced visual response magnitude and impaired visual information processing. Our findings support an experience-dependent feed-forward role for Emerin in temporally gating neuronal plasticity by negatively regulating translation.

">EEG Electrodes and Where to Find Them: Automated Localization From 3D Scans</a></h4>

              
                Objective: The accurate localization of electroencephalography (EEG) electrode positions is crucial for accurate source localization. Recent advancements have proposed alternatives to labor-intensive, manual methods for spatial localization of the electrodes, employing technologies such as 3D scanning and laser scanning. These novel approaches often integrate Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) as part of the pipeline in localizing the electrodes. The limited global availability of MRI data restricts its use as a standard modality in several clinical scenarios. This limitation restricts the use of these advanced methods. Approach: In this paper, we present a novel, versatile approach that utilizes 3D scans to localize EEG electrode positions with high accuracy. Importantly, while our method can be integrated with MRI data if available, it is specifically designed to be highly effective even in the absence of MRI, thus expanding the potential for advanced EEG analysis in various resource-limited settings. Our solution implements a two-tiered approach involving landmark/fiducials localization and electrode localization, creating an end-to-end framework. Main results: The efficacy and robustness of our approach have been validated on an extensive dataset containing over 400 3D scans from 278 subjects. The framework identifies pre-auricular points and achieves correct electrode positioning accuracy in the range of 85.7% to 91.0%. Additionally, our framework includes a validation tool that permits manual adjustments and visual validation if required. Significance: This study represents, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first validation of such a method on a substantial dataset, thus ensuring the robustness and generalizability of our innovative approach. Our findings focus on developing a solution that facilitates source localization, contributing to the critical discussion on balancing cost effectiveness with methodological accuracy to promote wider adoption in both research and clinical settings.

">Coding odor modality in piriform cortex efficiently with low-dimensional subspaces: a Shared Covariance Decoding approach</a></h4>

              
                A fundamental question in neuroscience is how sensory signals are decoded from noisy cortical activity. We address this question in the olfactory system, decoding the route by which odorants arrive into the nasal cavity: through the nostrils during inhalation or sniffing (orthonasal), or through the back of the throat during exhalation (retronasal). We recently showed with modeling and novel experiments on anesthetized rats that orthonasal versus retronasal modality information is encoded in the olfactory bulb (OB, a pre-cortical region). However, key questions remain: is modality information transmitted from OB to anterior piriform cortex (aPC)? How can this information be extracted from a much noisier cortical population with overall less firing? With simultaneous spike recordings of populations of neurons in OB and aPC, we show that an unsupervised and biologically plausible algorithm we call Shared Covariance Decoding (SCD) can indeed linearly encode modality in low dimensional subspaces. Specifically, our SCD algorithm improves encoding of ortho/retro in aPC compared to Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Consistent with our theoretical analysis, when noise correlations between OB and aPC are low and OB well-encodes modality, modality in aPC tends to be encoded optimally with SCD. We observe that with several algorithms (LDA, SCD, optimal) that the decoding accuracy distributions are invariant when GABA_A (ant-)agonists (bicuculline and muscimol) are applied to OB. Overall, we show modality information can be encoded efficiently in piriform cortex.

">The distribution and evolutionary dynamics of dopaminergic neurons in molluscs</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine is one of the most versatile neurotransmitters in invertebrates. Its distribution and plethora of functions are likely coupled to feeding ecology, especially in Euthyneura (the largest clade of mollusks), which presents the broadest spectrum of environmental adaptations. Still, the analyses of dopamine-mediated signaling were dominated by studies of grazers. Here, we characterize the distribution of dopaminergic neurons in representatives of two distinct ecological groups: the sea angel - obligate predatory pelagic mollusk Clione limacina (Pteropoda, Gymnosomata) and its prey - the sea devil Limacina helicina (Pteropoda, Thecosomata) as well as the plankton eater Melibe leonina (Nudipleura, Nudibranchia). By using tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactivity (TH-ir) as a reporter, we showed that the dopaminergic system is moderately conservative among euthyneurans. Across all studied species, small numbers of dopaminergic neurons in the central ganglia contrast to significant diversification of TH-ir neurons in the peripheral nervous system, primarily representing sensory-like cells, which predominantly concentrated in the chemotactic areas and projecting afferent axons to the central nervous system. Combined with -tubulin immunoreactivity, this study illuminates the unprecedented complexity of peripheral neural systems in gastropod mollusks, with lineage-specific diversification of sensory and modulatory functions.

">Electrical and G-protein Regulation of CaV2.2 (N-type) Channels</a></h4>

              
                How G-proteins inhibit N-type, voltage-gated, calcium-selective channels (CaV2.2) during presynaptic inhibition is a decades-old question. G-proteins G{beta}{gamma} bind to intracellular CaV2.2 regions, but the inhibition is voltage-dependent. Using the hybrid electrophysiological and optical approach voltage-clamp fluorometry, we show that G{beta}{gamma} acts by selectively inhibiting a subset of the four different CaV2.2 voltage-sensor domains (VSDs I-IV). During regular "willing" gating, VSDs I and IV activation resemble pore opening, VSD III activation is hyperpolarized, and VSD II appears unresponsive to depolarization. In the presence of G{beta}{gamma}, CaV2.2 gating is "reluctant": pore opening and VSD-I activation are strongly and proportionally inhibited, VSD IV is modestly inhibited while VSD III is not. We propose that G{beta}{gamma} inhibition of VSD-I and -IV underlies reluctant CaV2.2 gating and subsequent presynaptic inhibition.

">Neural Heterogeneity Enhances Reliable Neural information Processing: Local Sensitivity and Globally Input-slaved Transient Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Cortical neuronal activity exhibits variability over time and across repeated stimulation trials, yet consistently represents stimulus features. However, the dynamical mechanism underlying this reliable representation and computation remains elusive. This study uncovers a mechanism that achieves reliable neural processing, leveraging a biologically plausible network model with spatial extension and neuronal timescale diversity. Our findings demonstrate that timescale diversity disrupts intrinsic coherent spatiotemporal patterns, enhancing local sensitivity and aligning neural network activity closely with inputs. This underscores the significant role of timescale diversity in shaping consistent stimulus representation, leading to local sensitivity and globally input-slaved transient dynamics, essential for reliable neural processing. This mechanism offers a potentially general framework for understanding the role of neural heterogeneity in reliable computation. Our work informs the design of new reservoir computing models endowed with liquid wave reservoirs for neuromorphic computing.

	<p>We conducted a multicenter, prospective study (EMBRACE) evaluating the real-life effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of eptinezumab (100 mg/300 mg)&amp;amp;mdash;a monoclonal antibody targeting the calcitonin-gene-related peptide (anti-CGRP mAb)&amp;amp;mdash;in high-frequency episodic migraine (HFEM) or chronic migraine (CM). The primary endpoint was the change in monthly migraine days (MMD) for HFEM or monthly headache days (MHD) for CM at weeks 9&amp;amp;ndash;12 compared to baseline. The secondary endpoints included changes in monthly analgesic intake (MAI), Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), Headache Impact Test (HIT-6), Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS), Migraine Interictal Burden Scale (MIBS-4), and responder rates. The safety analysis involved 44 subjects; the effectiveness analysis included 26 individuals. Eptinezumab was well-tolerated. In CM patients, eptinezumab significantly reduced MHD (&amp;amp;minus;16.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 9.9, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), MAI, NRS, HIT-6, MIDAS, and MIBS-4. In HFEM patients, it significantly reduced NRS, HIT-6, MIDAS, and MIBS-4, though reductions in MMD (&amp;amp;minus;3.3 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.5) and MAI were not statistically significant. Overall, &amp;amp;ge;50% and &amp;amp;ge;75% response rates were 61.5% and 30.8%, respectively (60% and 30% in non-responders to subcutaneous anti-CGRP mAbs). The clinical change was rated as much or very much improved by 61.0% of the patients. Eptinezumab demonstrated high effectiveness, safety, and tolerability in real-life among hard-to-treat migraine patients with multiple treatment failures, including anti-CGRP mAbs.</p>

	<p>The exploration of functional resting-state brain developmental parameters and measures can help to improve scientific, psychological, and medical applications. The present work focussed on both traditional approaches, such as topographical power analyses at the signal space level, and advanced approaches, such as the exploration of age-related dynamics of source space data. The results confirmed the expectation that the third life decade would show a kind of stability in oscillatory signal and source-space-related parameters. However, from a source dynamics perspective, different frequency ranges appear to develop quite differently, as reflected in age-related sequential network communication profiles. Among other discoveries, the left anterior cingulate source location could be shown to reduce bi-directional network communication in the lower alpha band, whereas it differentiated its uni- and bidirectional communication dynamics to sub-cortical and posterior brain locations. Higher alpha oscillations enhanced communication dynamics between the thalamus and particularly frontal areas. In conclusion, resting-state data appear to be, at least in part, functionally reorganized in the default mode network, while quantitative measures, such as topographical power and regional source activity, did not correlate with age in the third life decade. In line with other authors, we suggest the further development of a multi-perspective approach in biosignal analyses.</p>

<p>Lognormal-like skewed spine size distribution is maintained in tumor necrosis factor deficiency and receptor loss. Dendritic spines sizes are distributed lognormally with a high percentage of the population consisting of small spines and a small percentage of the population consisting of large spines. The logarithm of the data shows a normal distribution. In mice exhibiting TNF deficiency, the lognormal distribution is maintained, albeit with a differences in its width, with the TNF deficient mice having more small and large sized spines and less medium sized spines. This finding was also observed in mice lacking TNF-receptor 1 and partially in mice lacking TNF-receptor 2. In mice lacking both TNF-receptor 1 and receptor 2 the lognormal distribution of spine head sizes was maintained, however, the distribution was shifted to the left, indicating a globalised reduction in spine head sizes of all spines. Spines maintain a lognormal distribution in multiple different conditions including homo- and heterosynaptic plasticity, blockage of presynaptic transmitter release and genetic disruption of TNF or its receptors, strenghtening the concept of redistribution of spine head sizes as a crucial functional adaptation within the neuron.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Dendritic spines are sites of synaptic plasticity and their head size correlates with the strength of the corresponding synapse. We recently showed that the distribution of spine head sizes follows a lognormal-like distribution even after blockage of activity or plasticity induction. As the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) influences synaptic transmission and constitutive TNF and receptor (TNF-R)-deficiencies cause changes in spine head size distributions, we tested whether these genetic alterations disrupt the lognormality of spine head sizes. Furthermore, we distinguished between spines containing the actin-modulating protein synaptopodin (SP-positive), which is present in large, strong and stable spines and those lacking it (SP-negative). Our analysis revealed that neither TNF-deficiency nor the absence of TNF-R1, TNF-R2 or TNF-R 1 and 2 (TNF-R1/R2) degrades the general lognormal-like, skewed distribution of spine head sizes (all spines, SP-positive spines, SP-negative spines). However, TNF, TNF-R1 and TNF-R2-deficiency affected the width of the lognormal distribution, and TNF-R1/2-deficiency shifted the distribution to the left. Our findings demonstrate the robustness of the lognormal-like, skewed distribution, which is maintained even in the face of genetic manipulations that alter the distribution of spine head sizes. Our observations are in line with homeostatic adaptation mechanisms of neurons regulating the distribution of spines and their head sizes.</p>

                The brain’s choroid plexus (CP), which operates as an anatomical and functional ‘checkpoint’, regulates the communication between brain and periphery and contributes to the maintenance of healthy brain homeostasis throughout life. Evidence from mouse models and humans reveals a link between loss of CP checkpoint properties and dysregulation of the CP immune milieu as a conserved feature across diverse neurological conditions. In particular, we suggest that an imbalance between different immune signals at the CP, including CD4+ T cell-derived cytokines, type-I interferon, and complement components, can perpetuate brain inflammation and cognitive deterioration in aging and neurodegeneration. Furthermore, we highlight the role of CP metabolism in controlling CP inflammation, and propose that targeting molecules that regulate CP metabolism could be effective in safeguarding brain function.

                Microglia play key roles in shaping synaptic connectivity during neural circuits development. Whether microglia display human-specific features of structural and functional maturation is currently unknown. We show that the ancestral gene SRGAP2A and its human-specific (HS) paralogs SRGAP2B/C are not only expressed in cortical neurons but are the only HS gene duplications expressed in human microglia. Here, using combination of xenotransplantation of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived microglia and mouse genetic models, we demonstrate that (1) HS SRGAP2B/C are necessary and sufficient to induce neotenic features of microglia structural and functional maturation in a cell-autonomous manner, and (2) induction of SRGAP2-dependent neotenic features of microglia maturation non-cell autonomously impacts synaptic development in cortical pyramidal neurons. Our results reveal that, during human brain evolution, human-specific genes SRGAP2B/C coordinated the emergence of neotenic features of synaptic development by acting as genetic modifiers of both neurons and microglia.

	<p>Dysautonomic disorders are an increasingly studied group of conditions, either as isolated diseases or associated with other neurological disorders. There is growing interest in understanding how dysautonomia affects people with epilepsy, who may report autonomic symptoms before, during and after seizures. Furthermore, autonomic abnormalities appear to play a role in sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, likely contributing to the increased mortality rate described in epilepsy. To better understand the association between epilepsy and dysautonomia, we explored electrochemical skin conductance in a group of 18 children and young adults with epilepsy compared to 15 age- and sex-matched healthy controls by the SudoscanTM test. We found a significant difference in terms of electrochemical skin conductance, suggesting that people with epilepsy suffer significantly reduced conductance in small nerve fibers. Within patients, values were significantly different according to the type of epilepsy and to neuroimaging results, with lower conductance values in epilepsies of unknown origin and in patients with morphological abnormalities of the brain. Using a non-invasive test, we identified altered conductance of small sympathetic nerve fibers in children and young adults with epilepsy, suggesting underlying dysautonomia. Further studies are needed to investigate this association and to clarify its neurobiological substrates.</p>

	<p>Deficits in memory performance have been linked to a wide range of neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions. While many studies have assessed the memory impacts of individual conditions, this study considers a broader perspective by evaluating how memory recall is differentially associated with nine common neuropsychiatric conditions using data drawn from 55 international studies, aggregating 15,883 unique participants aged 15&amp;amp;ndash;90. The effects of dementia, mild cognitive impairment, Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, traumatic brain injury, stroke, depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder on immediate, short-, and long-delay verbal learning and memory (VLM) scores were estimated relative to matched healthy individuals. Random forest models identified age, years of education, and site as important VLM covariates. A Bayesian harmonization approach was used to isolate and remove site effects. Regression estimated the adjusted association of each clinical group with VLM scores. Memory deficits were strongly associated with dementia and schizophrenia (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), while neither depression nor ADHD showed consistent associations with VLM scores (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Differences associated with clinical conditions were larger for longer delayed recall duration items. By comparing VLM across clinical conditions, this study provides a foundation for enhanced diagnostic precision and offers new insights into disease management of comorbid disorders.</p>

	<p>Gi-coupled receptors, particularly cannabinoid receptors (CBRs), are considered perspective targets for treating brain pathologies, including epilepsy. However, the precise mechanism of the anticonvulsant effect of the CBR agonists remains unknown. We have found that WIN 55,212-2 (a CBR agonist) suppresses the synchronous oscillations of the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ ions (epileptiform activity) induced in the neurons of rat hippocampal neuron-glial cultures by bicuculline or NH4Cl. As we have demonstrated, the WIN 55,212-2 effect is mediated by CB1R receptors. The agonist suppresses Ca2+ inflow mediated by the voltage-gated calcium channels but does not alter the inflow mediated by NMDA, AMPA, and kainate receptors. We have also found that phospholipase C (PLC), protein kinase C (PKC), and G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ channels (GIRK channels) are involved in the molecular mechanism underlying the inhibitory action of CB1R activation against epileptiform activity. Thus, our results demonstrate that the antiepileptic action of CB1R agonists is mediated by different intracellular signaling cascades, including non-canonical PLC/PKC-associated pathways.</p>

	<p>Delayed therapy escape (DTE) is frequent after thalamic deep brain stimulation for essential tremor, leading to reduced quality of life, often with ataxic symptoms, and early recognition is challenging. Our goal was to examine whether a low-frequency rebound tremor of the left hand after switching off stimulation is useful as a diagnostic marker for DTE. In this cross-sectional study with additional retrospective analysis, we examined 31 patients with bilateral thalamic DBS &amp;amp;ge; 12 months for essential tremor, using quantitative assessments including video-based motion capture, Fahn&amp;amp;ndash;Tolosa&amp;amp;ndash;Marin Tremor Rating Scale (FTMTRS), and scale for the assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA). If available, preoperative (preOP) and 12-month postoperative assessments were included in the analysis. Evaluations occurred with DBS activated (ON) and deactivated (OFF). A higher ratio FTMTRS nowON/preOP indicated DTE. Preoperative FTMTRS scores were available for 16 patients, including 5 patients with DTE. The receiver operating characteristic analysis found an area under the curve of 0.86 (p = 0.024) for identification of DTE by low-frequency rebound tremor (i.e., OFF) on the left. In conclusion, it could serve as a potential diagnostic marker.</p>

	<p>BACKGROUND: Clinical dynamic posturography concentrates on the pitch and roll but not on the yaw plane instability measures. This emphasis may not represent the axis instability observed in clinical stance and gait tasks for patients with balance deficits in comparison to healthy control (HC) subjects, nor the expected instability based on correlations with vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) deficits. To examine the axis stability changes with vestibular loss, we measured trunk sway in all three directions (pitch, roll, and yaw) during the stance and gait tasks of patients with acute unilateral vestibular neuritis (aUVN) and compared the results with those of HC. Concurrent changes in VORs were also examined and correlated with trunk balance deficits. METHODS: The results of 11 patients (mean age of 61 years) recorded within 6 days of aUVN onset were compared within those of 8 age-matched healthy controls (HCs). All subjects performed a two-legged stance task&amp;amp;mdash;standing with eyes closed on foam (s2ecf), a semi-gait task&amp;amp;mdash;walking eight tandem steps (tan8), and four gait tasks&amp;amp;mdash;walking 3 m with head rotating laterally, pitching, or eyes closed (w3hr, w3hp, w3ec), and walking over four barriers 24 cm high, spaced 1 m apart (barr). The tasks&amp;amp;rsquo; peak-to-peak yaw, pitch and roll angles, and angular velocities were measured with a gyroscope system (SwayStarTM) mounted at L1-3 and combined into three, axis-specific, balance control indexes (BCI), using angles (a) for the tandem gait and barriers task, and angular velocities (v) for all other tasks, as follows: axis BCI = (2 &amp;amp;times; 2ecf)v + 1.5 &amp;amp;times; (w3hr + w3hp + w3ec)v + (tan8 + 12 &amp;amp;times; barr)a. RESULTS: Yaw and pitch BCIs were significantly (p &amp;amp;le; 0.004) greater (88 and 30%, respectively) than roll BCIs for aUVN patients. For HCs, only yaw but not pitch BCIs were greater (p = 0.002) than those of roll (72%). The order of BCI aUVN vs. HC differences was pitch, yaw, and roll at 55, 44, and 31%, respectively (p &amp;amp;le; 0.002). This difference with respect to roll corresponded to the known greater yaw plane than roll plane asymmetry (40 vs. 22%) following aUVN based on VOR responses. However, the lower pitch plane asymmetry (3.5%) in VOR responses did not correspond with the pitch plane instability observed in the balance control tests. The increases in pitch plane instability in UVL subjects were, however, highly correlated with those of roll and yaw. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that greater yaw than pitch and roll trunk motion during clinical balance tasks is common for aUVN patients and HCs. However, aUVN leads to a larger increase in pitch than yaw plane instability and a smaller increase in roll plane instability. This difference with respect to roll corresponds to the known greater yaw plane than roll plane asymmetry (40 vs. 22%) following aUVN observed in VOR responses. However, the lower pitch plane asymmetry (3.5%) in VOR responses does not correspond with the enhanced movements in the pitch plane, observed in balance control tasks. Whether asymmetries in vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials (Vemps) are better correlated with the deficits in pitch plane balance control remains to be investigated. The current results provide a strong rationale for the clinical testing of directional specific balance responses, especially yaw and pitch, and the linking of balance results for yaw and roll to VOR asymmetries.</p>

	<p>Chemsex is the interplay of substance use by men who have sex with men (MSM) in sexual contexts. The minority stress model and the identity process theory are explanatory models. In this study, we investigated whether (i) differences in certain psychosocial aspects (i.e., shame, aspects of queer identity, and sexual self-concepts) exist between chemsex users and non-users, and (ii) which factors influence an awareness of negative impacts in chemsex users. We conducted an anonymous, cross-sectional, online survey, including sociodemography, sexual history, history of substance use, validated scales for shame-proneness, aspects of queer identity, and sexual self-concepts. Our analysis comprised descriptive statistics, t-tests, Spearman&amp;amp;rsquo;s correlations, and a multiple linear regression model. We recorded a total of 3257 datasets with 107 chemsex users. Chemsex users showed higher rates for risky sexual behavior. Values for shame proneness, more negative aspects of queer identity, and sexual self-concepts were elevated in chemsex users with an awareness of negative impacts. Sexual anxiety, intravenous substance use, and having had a difficult process coming out were significant predictors of feeling negative impacts. Aspects of shame, queer identity aspects, and sexual self-concepts play an important role in the field of chemsex. Different explanatory models seem to be relevant for different subgroups of chemsex users. Chemsex users with an awareness of a problem were particularly vulnerable and distressed but had the highest motivation for change. Prevention, counseling, and care might profit from the inclusion of these aspects. Further anti-stigma campaigns and a specialization of the healthcare system are needed.

	<p>Anomia, characterized by difficulty in word retrieval, particularly action verbs, poses a significant challenge in post-stroke aphasia. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has gained attention for language processing investigations and interventions. This systematic review explores the potential of rTMS as a modality to address action-verb deficits in post-stroke aphasia. We searched MEDLINE via PubMed, CINAHL via Ebsco and Web of Science in February 2024 for English articles (1996&amp;amp;ndash;2024). Eligible studies involved post-stroke aphasia action naming rehabilitation with rTMS. In some of these studies, rTMS was combined with speech-language therapy. In total, 10 studies were included in this systematic review. These articles highlight the potential of rTMS in improving verb retrieval deficits. While significant improvements may not be evident, notable progress both before and after intervention is observed in this review. However, it also underscores the need for further research to enhance language recovery for individuals with post-stroke aphasia.</p>

	<p>Increasing evidence shows that virtual reality (VR) training is highly effective in cognitive and motor rehabilitation. Another modern form of training is cognitive&amp;amp;ndash;motor dual-task training (CMDT), which has been demonstrated to rapidly improve physical and cognitive functions in real environments. This study aims to test whether a VR-based CMDT protocol can be used for motor and cognitive skill enhancement in young, healthy subjects. For this aim, 24 university students participated in a randomized control trial. The experimental group participated in a 5-week virtual reality reaction training (VRRT), performing 30 min sessions once a week. The control group did not receive any training but was tested twice with the same measures and temporal distance as the experimental group. Before and after the intervention, motor, cognitive, and electrophysiological measures were assessed. The results showed that following VRRT, the response time for both physical and cognitive tests was improved by about 14% and 12%, respectively, while the control group did not show significant changes. Moreover, electrophysiological data revealed a significant increase in anticipatory motor readiness in premotor brain areas in the experimental group only; however, cognitive top&amp;amp;ndash;down control tended to be increased in prefrontal areas after VRRT. This training protocol in a VR modality seems to be as effective as other CMDT methodologies carried out in a real modality. Still, it has the advantages of being more flexible and more user-friendly compared to standard training. The VRRT&amp;amp;rsquo;s efficacy on physical and cognitive functions indicates that virtual reality applications can be used by the young population, not only for entertainment purposes but also in the form of cognitive&amp;amp;ndash;motor training.</p>

	<p>A body of experimental research has aimed to investigate processes underlying dream formation by examining the effects of a range of pre-sleep stimuli and events on subsequent dream content. Given its ever-growing presence and salience in people&amp;amp;rsquo;s everyday lives, pre-sleep media consumption stands out as a key variable that could influence people&amp;amp;rsquo;s dreams. We conducted a scoping review to evaluate the experimental evidence of the effects of pre-sleep exposure to visual media on dream content. A systematic search on PubMed, PsycInfo, and Web of Science using terms related to moving visual media and dreams yielded 29 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Overall, we found modest yet varied effects of pre-sleep exposure to visual media on dream content, with rates of stimulus-related incorporation ranging from 3% to 43% for REM dream reports, 4% to 30% for NREM sleep mentation reports, and between 11% and 35% for home dream reports. Our review highlights the large methodological heterogeneity and gaps across studies, the general difficulty in influencing dream content using pre-sleep exposure to visual media, and suggests promising venues for future research to advance our understanding of how and why digital media may impact people&amp;amp;rsquo;s dreams.</p>

                Background A neural network is a machine learning algorithm that can learn and make predictions by adjusting the strength of the connections between nodes. The sigmoid function is commonly used as an activation function in these nodes. This study explores the potential applicability of biological materials in the development of alternative activation functions. Methods Inspired by the fact that acetylcholine induces intestinal contractions that follow a sigmoid function, we used pharmacological data obtained from guinea pig ilea in a layered neural network for image classification tasks. Results and Conclusions We found that the intestinal data-based neural network with the same structure as a conventional three-layer perceptron achieved an impressive classification accuracy of 85.7% ± 0.6% based on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset (chance = 10%). Additionally, the neural network was trained to determine whether objects in photographs collected from the internet were digestible, achieving an accuracy of 88.5% ± 0.9% (chance = 50%). Our approach highlights the potential applicability of intestine data in neural computations based on pharmacological mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-301/v2?src=rss">Proposal of a domain model for 3D representation of buildings in Ecuador. [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                The accelerated urban sprawl of cities around the world presents major challenges for urban planning and land resource management. In this context, it is crucial to have a detailed 3D representation of buildings enriched with accurate alphanumeric information. A distinctive aspect of this proposal is its specific focus on the spatial unit corresponding to buildings. In order to propose a domain model for the 3D representation of buildings, the national standard of Ecuador and the international standard (ISO 19152:2012 LADM) were considered. The proposal includes a detailed specification of attributes, both for the general subclass of buildings and for their infrastructure. The application of the domain model proposal was crucial in a study area located in the Riobamba canton, due to the characteristics of the buildings in that area. For this purpose, a geodatabase was created in pgAdmin4 with official information, taking into account the structure of the proposed model and linking it with geospatial data for an adequate management and 3D representation of the buildings in an open-source Geographic Information System. This application improves cadastral management in the study region and has wider implications. This model is intended to serve as a benchmark for other countries facing similar challenges in cadastral management and 3D representation of buildings, promote efficient urban development and contribute to global sustainable development.

                Background Cesarean section is the most common obstetric procedure performed. This can lead to maternal anxiety, which is a significant contributor to postpartum depression. This can adversely affect pregnant women both mentally and emotionally, negatively impacting their well-being and family bonding. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the addition of an informative cesarean section operative steps video on the maternal anxiety score compared with standard pre-cesarean section care. Methods This randomized controlled trial was conducted at Thammasat University Hospital, Thailand, between April and September 2023. Pregnant women who underwent their first cesarean section were allocated to two groups: intervention and control groups. Participants in the intervention group were required to watch a 5-minute informative video that elaborately described the process from pre-operative steps until post-operative care on the day scheduled for cesarean delivery. All participants received the same routine pre-operative and post-operative care. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used to measure both populations on two occasions: the day of scheduled cesarean delivery and postpartum day 1. Results A total of 178 women were recruited. The demographic and obstetric characteristics were similar between the two groups. The pre-operative STAI scores of the intervention and control groups were 42.9 and 44.1 points, respectively, with no significant difference. However, the post-operative anxiety score showed a significant decline in the intervention group compared to that in the control group (p = 0.002). Moreover, most of the participants in the intervention group showed a low level of anxiety after the operation, while half of the control group remained at a moderate to high level score. Conclusions The provision of an informative educational video before cesarean delivery is a powerful tool that significantly reduces cesarean operative anxiety and improves health outcomes.

                <p>by Jaejoong Kim, Sarah M. Tashjian, Dean Mobbs</p>

Comparative research suggests that the hypothalamus is critical in switching between survival behaviors, yet it is unclear if this is the case in humans. Here, we investigate the role of the human hypothalamus in survival switching by introducing a paradigm where volunteers switch between hunting and escape in response to encounters with a virtual predator or prey. Given the small size and low tissue contrast of the hypothalamus, we used deep learning-based segmentation to identify the individual-specific hypothalamus and its subnuclei as well as an imaging sequence optimized for hypothalamic signal acquisition. Across 2 experiments, we employed computational models with identical structures to explain internal movement generation processes associated with hunting and escaping. Despite the shared structure, the models exhibited significantly different parameter values where escaping or hunting were accurately decodable just by computing the parameters of internal movement generation processes. In experiment 2, multi-voxel pattern analyses (MVPA) showed that the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and periaqueductal gray encode switching of survival behaviors while not encoding simple motor switching outside of the survival context. Furthermore, multi-voxel connectivity analyses revealed a network including the hypothalamus as encoding survival switching and how the hypothalamus is connected to other regions in this network. Finally, model-based fMRI analyses showed that a strong hypothalamic multi-voxel pattern of switching is predictive of optimal behavioral coordination after switching, especially when this signal was synchronized with the multi-voxel pattern of switching in the amygdala. Our study is the first to identify the role of the human hypothalamus in switching between survival behaviors and action organization after switching.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-222/v2?src=rss">Case Report: Urethral Diverticulum after Tubularised Incised Plate Repair of Distal Hypospadias: An Uncommon Complication. [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction A urethral diverticulum can be defined as a pocket that forms from the lining of the urethra and protrudes into the surrounding tissue, a condition which causes voiding dysfunction and may result as a rare complication of hypospadias repair surgery. Case report We report the case of a 2-year-old child who presented to us in 2019 complaining of a thin forceful stream, ballooning of the ventral aspect of the penis while voiding, and post-void dribbling. He has a history of undergoing a tubularised incised plate urethroplasty for distal penile hypospadias at 18-months-old. Ultrasound showed increased post-void residual volume and cystourethroscopy confirmed a urethral diverticulum extending from the subcorona to the base of the penis. The patient underwent partial excision of diverticulum, urethroplasty, and meatoplasty. He was followed-up 3 months later with complete resolution of his symptoms and a normal urinary stream with no urethral ballooning or dribbling. Conclusion Urethral diverticulum may present as a complication post hypospadias repair. Although it is rare, we believe that it is important for the patient’s parents to understand the possibility and know of the signs and symptoms in addition to attending regular outpatient clinic appointments in order to facilitate early management if needed. Furthermore, it is highly important for physicians to assess newborns for hypospadias before carrying out circumcision as it is a contraindication for the procedure.

                Abstract* Pleomorphic adenomas (PA) are the most prevalent benign salivary gland neoplasms. They may occur at any age, with a peak incidence between 40 and 60 years of age. They are more commonly observed in females (60%). These tumors can arise in both the major and minor salivary glands. Approximately 80% of these tumors are diagnosed in the parotid gland, whereas 10% arise in the minor salivary glands, mainly affecting the palates, followed by the lips and cheeks. This report describes two cases of unusual lesions that were diagnosed as (PA) in the minor salivary glands in our department via a review of the relevant literature. The first case involved an 83-year-old man who presented with a slow-growing swelling on the right side of the upper lip, and the second case involved a 45-year-old woman who presented with a slow-growing lesion on the palate. The presence of PA was confirmed histopathologically after surgical resection. Although relatively rare, PA is a benign lesion, the diagnosis of which must be known for appropriate therapeutic management.

                Background Coronavirus (COVID-19) is the causative agent of the most recent pandemic that hit the globe and has been the cause of a vast range of symptoms, including neurological symptoms. Bell’s palsy is an acute peripheral facial paralysis commonly associated with viral infections. Case presentation This case report describes a patient with incidental COVID-19 infection that led to acute unilateral peripheral facial paralysis, Bell’s palsy. Our patient is a 35-year-old male with no known comorbidities who was presenting with upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and was found to be positive for COVID-19. Soon after the onset of symptoms, he also developed right-sided facial weakness in association with his symptoms. A thorough examination revealed a peripheral neurological lesion. The diagnosis of Bell’s palsy secondary to COVID-19 virus infection was through the exclusion of other possible causes. Conclusions This case report suggests a potential link between Bell’s palsy and COVID-19, highlighting the importance of a comprehensive understanding of the neurological manifestations of COVID-19. Further research is essential to determine the significance of neuropathies in COVID-19 and enhance treatment strategies.

                Background Recall of medical instructions is associated with improved adherence to treatment. The recall of the Body Mass Index (BMI) is important for the improvement of adherence to treatments related to obesity. The burden of obesity all over the world has increased, including in many sub-Saharan African countries. This study measured the recall of BMI, shared decision-making (SDM), and patients’ demographics to determine if they were associated. Methods The study was conducted at a rural hospital outpatient clinic in South Western Uganda. Data were collected using a questionnaire and collaboRate-5 tool for measuring shared decision-making. Data were analysed using SPSS version 20. The chi-square test and Pearson coefficient test were done. Results Out of the 92 participants in this study, the median age was 36 years, in an age range of 18 to 87 years, the majority were male 54 (58.7%), most had a background of attending formal education 75 (81.5%), 79 (85.9%) were not able to recall their BMI; 13 (14.1%) were able to recall their BMI. Only gender among demographic factors studied was associated with recall of BMI (p = 0.027). Shared decision-making was associated with the recall of BMI (P < 0.001). Conclusions The proportion of patients who were not able to recall their BMI after the outpatient clinic visit was high. Gender and the use of SDM were associated with recall of BMI. Measured items describing the use of SDM were only reported among 21(22.8%) participants. SDM was underutilized during the study period at the outpatient clinic. There is a need to have continuous medical education on SDM.

                Background Expert consensus methods are regularly used in natural, social, and life sciences. This article explores the potential of applying these methods more frequently in humanities research. Methods The authors reviewed literature and applied the philosophical methods of conceptual analysis and conceptual engineering. Results This article identifies and describes six main elements of expert consensus methods. It also provides an overview of the different types of expert consensus methods regularly used in the natural, social, and life sciences: Delphi studies, nominal groups, consensus conferences, and Glaser’s state of the art method. Subsequently, each of these types is illustrated by an example from the sciences. The article also presents the potential of and objections to the application of expert consensus methods there. It gives four examples of expert consensus methods that were applied in humanities research, also presented in line with the six elements. Conclusions The comparisons and categorization show that, as in the natural, social, and life sciences, expert consensus methods in the humanities can in some instances potentially accelerate the epistemic process and enhance transparency, replicability, diversity, and fair processes. Nevertheless, expert consensus methods need to be fine-tuned to do justice to the unique nature and approaches of the humanities and therefore further research is needed.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-1067/v3?src=rss">Paravertebral vs. Epidural Analgesia for Liver Surgery (PEALS): Protocol for a randomized controlled pilot study [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Perioperative thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) is commonly used in hepatectomy patients since it is opioid-sparing. However, TEA has a high failure rate and is associated with potentially devastating complications (spinal haematoma) and the risk is increased with hepatectomy. Thus, some centres favour systemic opioid-based modalities which, in turn, are associated with inferior analgesia and well-known risks/side-effects. Hence, alternative analgesic methods are desirable. Paravertebral block (PVB) has been used in liver resection with advantages including haemodynamic stability, low failure rates, and low risk of spinal haematoma. The purpose of this pilot RCT is to compare continuous TEA (traditional standard of care is local anesthetic (LA) + opioids) with PVB (traditional standard of care is with LA without opioid) for patients undergoing hepatectomy. We hypothesise that pain outcomes will be comparable between groups, but PVB patients will require fewer perioperative vasopressors/blood products, have fewer opioid-related side effects and a shorter hospital length of stay. Methods With ethics approval, this non-inferiority, pilot RCT with a convenience sample of 50 hepatectomy patients will examine whether PVB imparts analgesia comparable to TEA but with fewer adverse effects. Primary outcomes are surrogates of analgesia for 72 h postoperatively (i.e., opioid consumption, time to first analgesic request and pain scores at rest and with coughing); Secondary outcomes are blood products/fluids administered; side effects/complications until 72 h postoperatively; length of hospital stay. The results will be used to plan a large multicentre trial comparing TEA vs. PVB in hepatectomy patients. This study has a high potential to positively impact the quality/safety of patient care.

                Töpfer et al. demonstrate that AdamTS proteases mediate local remodeling of the basement membrane of Drosophila egg chambers. Basement membrane remodeling establishes heterogeneity in the distribution of Collagen IV and in the micropattern of fiber-like structures that is important for proper egg chamber shape.

Freeburg et al. demonstrate that hepatocyte Vitamin D receptor (Vdr) coordinates hepatic and organismal energy metabolism in zebrafish, subject to nutritional cues, suggesting an evolutionary role for VDR as a transcriptional effector of nutrient availability.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92938">Neural interactions in the human frontal cortex dissociate reward and punishment learning</a></h4>

              
                How human prefrontal and insular regions interact while maximizing rewards and minimizing punishments is unknown. Capitalizing on human intracranial recordings, we demonstrate that the functional specificity toward reward or punishment learning is better disentangled by interactions compared to local representations. Prefrontal and insular cortices display non-selective neural populations to rewards and punishments. Non-selective responses, however, give rise to context-specific interareal interactions. We identify a reward subsystem with redundant interactions between the orbitofrontal and ventromedial prefrontal cortices, with a driving role of the latter. In addition, we find a punishment subsystem with redundant interactions between the insular and dorsolateral cortices, with a driving role of the insula. Finally, switching between reward and punishment learning is mediated by synergistic interactions between the two subsystems. These results provide a unifying explanation of distributed cortical representations and interactions supporting reward and punishment learning.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90278">Serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons in the dorsal raphe are differentially altered in a mouse model for parkinsonism</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by motor impairments caused by degeneration of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. In addition to these symptoms, PD patients often suffer from non-motor comorbidities including sleep and psychiatric disturbances, which are thought to depend on concomitant alterations of serotonergic and noradrenergic transmission. A primary locus of serotonergic neurons is the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), providing brain-wide serotonergic input. Here, we identified electrophysiological and morphological parameters to classify serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons in the murine DRN under control conditions and in a PD model, following striatal injection of the catecholamine toxin, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Electrical and morphological properties of both neuronal populations were altered by 6-OHDA. In serotonergic neurons, most changes were reversed when 6-OHDA was injected in combination with desipramine, a noradrenaline (NA) reuptake inhibitor, protecting the noradrenergic terminals. Our results show that the depletion of both NA and dopamine in the 6-OHDA mouse model causes changes in the DRN neural circuitry.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87753">GABAergic synaptic scaling is triggered by changes in spiking activity rather than AMPA receptor activation</a></h4>

              
                Homeostatic plasticity represents a set of mechanisms that are thought to recover some aspect of neural function. One such mechanism called AMPAergic scaling was thought to be a likely candidate to homeostatically control spiking activity. However, recent findings have forced us to reconsider this idea as several studies suggest AMPAergic scaling is not directly triggered by changes in spiking. Moreover, studies examining homeostatic perturbations <i>in vivo</i> have suggested that GABAergic synapses may be more critical in terms of spiking homeostasis. Here, we show results that GABAergic scaling can act to homeostatically control spiking levels. We found that perturbations which increased or decreased spiking in cortical cultures triggered multiplicative GABAergic upscaling and downscaling, respectively. In contrast, we found that changes in AMPA receptor (AMPAR) or GABAR transmission only influence GABAergic scaling through their indirect effect on spiking. We propose that GABAergic scaling represents a stronger candidate for spike rate homeostat than AMPAergic scaling.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94056">Self-inhibiting percolation and viral spreading in epithelial tissue</a></h4>

              
                SARS-CoV-2 induces delayed type-I/III interferon production, allowing it to escape the early innate immune response. The delay has been attributed to a deﬁciency in the ability of cells to sense viral replication upon infection, which in turn hampers activation of the antiviral state in bystander cells. Here, we introduce a cellular automaton model to investigate the spatiotemporal spreading of viral infection as a function of virus and host-dependent parameters. The model suggests that the considerable person-to-person heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 infections is a consequence of high sensitivity to slight variations in biological parameters near a critical threshold. It further suggests that within-host viral proliferation can be curtailed by the presence of remarkably few cells that are primed for IFN production. Thus, the observed heterogeneity in defense readiness of cells reﬂects a remarkably cost-eﬃcient strategy for protection.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94836">Modulation of biophysical properties of nucleocapsid protein in the mutant spectrum of SARS-CoV-2</a></h4>

              
                Genetic diversity is a hallmark of RNA viruses and the basis for their evolutionary success. Taking advantage of the uniquely large genomic database of SARS-CoV-2, we examine the impact of mutations across the spectrum of viable amino acid sequences on the biophysical phenotypes of the highly expressed and multifunctional nucleocapsid protein. We find variation in the physicochemical parameters of its extended intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) sufficient to allow local plasticity, but also observe functional constraints that similarly occur in related coronaviruses. In biophysical experiments with several N-protein species carrying mutations associated with major variants, we find that point mutations in the IDRs can have nonlocal impact and modulate thermodynamic stability, secondary structure, protein oligomeric state, particle formation, and liquid-liquid phase separation. In the Omicron variant, distant mutations in different IDRs have compensatory effects in shifting a delicate balance of interactions controlling protein assembly properties, and include the creation of a new protein-protein interaction interface in the N-terminal IDR through the defining P13L mutation. A picture emerges where genetic diversity is accompanied by significant variation in biophysical characteristics of functional N-protein species, in particular in the IDRs.

	<p>Respiratory dysfunction is an important hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Elevation of creatine kinase (CK) has been reported in 23&amp;amp;ndash;75% of ALS patients, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. This work aims to enlighten the role of CK as a prognostic factor of respiratory dysfunction in ALS. A retrospective analysis of demographic and clinical variables, CK, functional decline per month (&amp;amp;Delta;FS), forced vital capacity (%FVC), and mean amplitude of the phrenic nerve compound motor action potential (pCMAP) in 319 ALS patients was conducted. These measurements were evaluated at study entry, and patients were followed from the moment of first observation until death or last follow-up visit. High CK values were defined as above the 90th percentile (CK &amp;amp;ge; P90) adjusted to sex. We analyzed survival and time to non-invasive ventilation (NIV) as proxies for respiratory impairment. Linear regression analysis revealed that high CK was associated with male sex (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), spinal onset (p = 0.018), and FVC &amp;amp;ge; 80% (p = 0.038). CK was 23.4% higher in spinal-onset ALS patients (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). High CK levels were not linked with an increased risk of death (p = 0.334) in Cox multivariate regression analysis. CK &amp;amp;ge; P90 (HR = 1.001, p = 0.038), shorter disease duration (HR = 0.937, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), lower pCMAP (HR = 0.082, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and higher &amp;amp;Delta;FS (HR = 1.968, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) were risk factors for respiratory failure. The association between high CK levels and poorer respiratory outcomes could derive from cellular metabolic stress or a specific phenotype associated with faster respiratory decline. Our study suggests that CK measurement at diagnosis should be more extensively investigated as a possible marker of poor respiratory outcome in future studies, including a larger population of patients.</p>

	<p>Depression is clinically diagnosed when a defined constellation of symptoms manifests over a specific duration with notable severity. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is characterized by the presence of five or more symptoms persisting for at least two weeks. As a profound mental health condition affecting millions globally, depression presents a considerable challenge for researchers and clinicians alike. In pediatric and adolescent populations, depression can precipitate adverse outcomes, including substance abuse, academic difficulties, risky sexual behaviors, physical health problems, impaired social relationships, and a markedly elevated risk of suicide&amp;amp;mdash;up to thirty times higher than the general population. This paper details a study that evaluated the efficacy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) alone vs. CBT combined with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in a treatment program. The study cohort comprised sixteen (16) children and adolescents diagnosed with depression (eight males and eight females) and sixteen (16) typically developing peers (eight males and eight females) aged from 9 to 15 years (Mean age = 11.94, standard deviation = 2.02). Initial assessments employed Event-Related Potentials (ERPs), the Children&amp;amp;rsquo;s Depression Inventory (CDI), and reaction time measurements. The results reveal that participants with depression exhibit cognitive deficits in attention and memory, as evidenced by prolonged P300 latencies. Following intervention with either CBT alone or CBT combined with medication, the depressed participants demonstrated significant improvements, evidenced by lower CDI scores, reduced P300 latencies, and faster reaction times, both compared to their pre-treatment status and relative to the control group.</p>

	<p>Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a side effect of cancer treatment, often linked with pain complaints. Patients report mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity that may emerge during chemotherapy treatment and may persist after cancer remission. Whereas the latter situation disturbs the quality of life, life itself may be endangered by the appearance of CIPN during cancer treatment. The causes of CIPN have almost entirely been ascribed to the neurotoxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs in the peripheral nervous system. However, the central consequences of peripheral neuropathy are starting to be unraveled, namely in the supraspinal pain modulatory system. Based on our interests and experience in the field, we undertook a review of the brain-centered alterations that may underpin pain in CIPN. The changes in the descending pain modulation in CIPN models along with the functional and connectivity abnormalities in the brain of CIPN patients are analyzed. A translational analysis of preclinical findings about descending pain regulation during CIPN is reviewed considering the main neurochemical systems (serotoninergic and noradrenergic) targeted in CIPN management in patients, namely by antidepressants. In conclusion, this review highlights the importance of studying supraspinal areas involved in descending pain modulation to understand the pathophysiology of CIPN, which will probably allow a more personalized and effective CIPN treatment in the future.</p>

	<p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), major depressive disorder (MDD) is the fourth leading cause of disability worldwide and the second most common disease after cardiovascular events. Approximately 280 million people live with MDD, with incidence varying by age and gender (female to male ratio of approximately 2:1). Although a variety of antidepressants are available for the different forms of MDD, there is still a high degree of individual variability in response and tolerability. Given the complexity and clinical heterogeneity of these disorders, a shift from &amp;amp;ldquo;canonical treatment&amp;amp;rdquo; to personalized medicine with improved patient stratification is needed. OPADE is a non-profit study that researches biomarkers in MDD to tailor personalized drug treatments, integrating genetics, epigenetics, microbiome, immune response, and clinical data for analysis. A total of 350 patients between 14 and 50 years will be recruited in 6 Countries (Italy, Colombia, Spain, The Netherlands, Turkey) for 24 months. Real-time electroencephalogram (EEG) and patient cognitive assessment will be correlated with biological sample analysis. A patient empowerment tool will be deployed to ensure patient commitment and to translate patient stories into data. The resulting data will be used to train the artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) predictive tool.</p>

	<p>Menopause may increase the risk of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) dementia. This study aimed to use young plasma therapy (YPT) to improve dementia caused by AD in aged ovariectomized rats. Female Wistar rats were used in the following groups: (a) young (CY) (180&amp;amp;ndash;200 g, 2&amp;amp;ndash;3 months, n = 10) and (b) old groups (250&amp;amp;ndash;350 g, 22&amp;amp;ndash;24 months, n = 60). The old rats were randomly assigned to six sub-groups: (1) control, (2) sham, (3) ovariectomized group (OVX), (4) OVX + Alzheimer disease (OVX + AD), (5) OVX + AD+ 17&amp;amp;beta;-Estradiol (OVX + AD + E), and (6) OVX + AD + young plasma (OVX + AD + YP). Cognitive behaviors were evaluated using NOR, MWM, and PAL tests. MiR-134a, SIRT-1, CREB, and BDNF expressions were measured using real-time PCR and western blot, respectively. Oxidative stress in hippocampal tissue was assayed using ELISA kits. OVX and AD caused significant cognitive impairment (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), up-regulated miR-134a (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), down-regulated SIRT-1, CREB, and BDNF protein expression (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and decreased antioxidant marker levels (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) compared to the sham group. YPT significantly restored miR-134a (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), SIRT-1 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), CREB (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and BDNF (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) protein expression in OVX + AD rats. YPT, as much as or more than estrogen therapy (ERT), significantly improved oxidative stress and down-regulated miR-134a expression and the up-regulation of SIRT-1, CREB, and BDNF proteins in OVX + AD rats (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). YPT significantly improved histological alteration compared to the OVX + AD group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). As a non-pharmacological treatment, YPT can improve the expression of miR-134a and SIRT-1, CREB, and BDNF proteins as much as or more than estrogen therapy, ameliorating AD-induced dementia in aged OVX rats.</p>

	<p>This study examined the impact of personalizing muscle vibration parameters on trunk control. We assessed how altered trunk extensor muscle (TEM) proprioception affects seated trunk control in healthy controls (HCs). To explore the link between altered TEM proprioception and impaired trunk control in chronic low back pain (cLBP), we performed equivalence testing between HCs undergoing TEM vibration and cLBP without vibration. Twenty HCs performed active joint reposition error (AJRE) testing to determine personalized vibration parameters. Each participant maintained balance on an unstable chair with eyes open and closed, with and without TEM vibration. We compared trunk control between HCs and twenty age- and sex-matched cLBP participants, using mean velocity and 95% confidence ellipse area of center-of-pressure changes to quantify trunk postural control. Equivalence was examined by comparing mean difference scores to minimal detectable change values and calculating between-group effect sizes. Personalized vibration parameters led to larger lumbopelvic repositioning errors (d = 0.89) than any single vibration frequency (d = 0.31&amp;amp;ndash;0.36). In healthy adults with no back pain, vision had large effects on postural control (&amp;amp;eta;p2 = 0.604&amp;amp;ndash;0.842), but TEM vibration had no significant effects (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.105) or interactions with vision (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.423). Between-group effect sizes (d = 0.32&amp;amp;ndash;0.51) exceeded our threshold for performance equivalence (d &amp;amp;lt; 0.2). Muscle vibration altered position sense during AJRE testing, and personalizing parameters amplified this effect. However, TEM vibration had minimal impact on seated trunk postural control in adults with no back pain and did not lead to performance degradation comparable to that in cLBP.</p>

                Introduction and aim Periodontal disease, initiated by dental biofilm and influenced by various local and systemic factors, includes stress as a potential contributor to its progression. Despite associations with severe forms like acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, a comprehensive large-sample study linking stress to periodontal disease is lacking. This study aims to investigate the relationship between mental health and periodontal disease. Materials and Methods Leveraging data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), relevant information was extracted. Mental health was the exposure variable, and periodontal disease, assessed through indices following Eke et al.'s definition, served as the outcome. Covariates impacting periodontal disease were considered, and demographic and disease status analyses employed the Rao-Scott chi-squared test. A logistic regression model assessed mental health's impact on periodontal disease. Results Logistic regression indicated higher odds of periodontal disease among individuals feeling bad about themselves for more than half of the day (OR 1.170, 95% CI 0.533-2.474), though statistical significance was not reached. Periodontitis prevalence significantly varied based on marital status, with 6.6% of married and 10.8% of unmarried subjects affected. Notably, a statistically significant difference in periodontitis prevalence existed between subjects with health insurance (8.3%) and those without (16.5%). Conclusion Within study limitations, it is concluded that no significant difference exists in periodontal status between individuals with compromised mental health and those without. The findings underscore potential associations between mental health, marital status, and access to health insurance with periodontal disease.

                Background The goal of the Fifth Annual Baylor College of Medicine & DNAnexus Structural Variation Hackathon was to push forward the research on structural variants (SVs) by rapidly developing and deploying open-source software. The event took place in-person and virtually in August 2023, when 49 scientists from 14 countries and 8 U.S. states collaboratively worked on projects to address critical gaps in the field of genomics. The hackathon projects concentrated on developing bioinformatic workflows for the following challenges: RNA transcriptome comparison, simulation of mosaic variations, metagenomics, Mendelian variation, SVs in plant genomics, and assembly vs. mapping SV calling comparisons. Methods As a starting point we used publicly available data from state-of-the-art long- and short-read sequencing technologies. The workflows developed during the hackathon incorporated open-source software, as well as scripts written using Bash and Python. Moreover, we leveraged the advantages of Docker and Snakemake for workflow automation. Results The results of the hackathon consists of six prototype bioinformatic workflows that use open-source software for SV research. We made the workflows scalable and modular for usability and reproducibility. Furthermore, we tested the workflows on example public data to show that the workflows can work. The code and the data produced during the event have been made publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/collaborativebioinformatics) to reproduce and built upon in the future. Conclusions The following sections describe the motivation, lessons learned, and software produced by teams during the hackathon. Here, we describe in detail the objectives, value propositions, implementation, and use cases for our workflows. In summary, the article reports the advancements in the development of software for SV detection made during the hackathon.

                Background Increasing the participation of peer educators (PEs) to deliver HIV/AIDS services in a limited income context remains challenging, despite their profound effectiveness, and this has become more evident since the COVID-19 outbreak. This study examines the roles of PEs and the current challenges in delivering HIV/AIDS services in Vietnam. Methods A mixed-method approach was employed. The study was conducted in seven large provinces in Vietnam from December 2021 to March 2022. An online cross-sectional survey was administered to 63 health staff and 147 PEs to collect quantitative data on PEs’ roles. Qualitative interviews included seven focus-group discussions with 39 PEs and in-depth interviews with 25 key informants, including seven leaders and 14 health staff from district health centers and provincial centers for disease control (CDCs), one national-level HIV/AIDS program manager, one non-government organization representative, and two senior experts. Results Results show the diversified roles of PEs in delivering HIV/AIDS activities in Vietnam. The roles could be categorized into two main groups, including community-based activities and facilities-based activities. Prominent roles are identifying and referring customers to HIV testing services, conducting communication and education activities, and referring patients to treatment services. The study shows a decrease in the roles of PEs in delivering HIV/AIDS services in Vietnam despite the high demand for their participation from healthcare providers. Critical challenges in employing PEs in HIV/AIDS services are related to lack of funding, inadequate training, lack of recognition, and stigma. Conclusion To keep the right path to the goal of ending the HIV pandemic by 2030, it is important to maintain and increase the roles of PEs in delivering HIV/AIDS services. Raising better acknowledgment from stakeholders of PEs’ roles could help overcome the remaining challenges and expand their participation toward this goal.

                <p>by Youcheng Li, Leann Lac, Qian Liu, Pingzhao Hu</p>

Spatial transcriptomics has gained popularity over the past decade due to its ability to evaluate transcriptome data while preserving spatial information. Cell segmentation is a crucial step in spatial transcriptomic analysis, as it enables the avoidance of unpredictable tissue disentanglement steps. Although high-quality cell segmentation algorithms can aid in the extraction of valuable data, traditional methods are frequently non-spatial, do not account for spatial information efficiently, and perform poorly when confronted with the problem of spatial transcriptome cell segmentation with varying shapes. In this study, we propose ST-CellSeg, an image-based machine learning method for spatial transcriptomics that uses manifold for cell segmentation and is novel in its consideration of multi-scale information. We first construct a fully connected graph which acts as a spatial transcriptomic manifold. Using multi-scale data, we then determine the low-dimensional spatial probability distribution representation for cell segmentation. Using the adjusted Rand index (ARI), normalized mutual information (NMI), and Silhouette coefficient (SC) as model performance measures, the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms baseline models in selected datasets and is efficient in computational complexity.

Therapeutic interventions are designed to perturb the function of a biological system. However, there are many types of proteins that cannot be targeted with conventional small molecule drugs. Accordingly, many identified gene-regulatory drivers and downstream effectors are currently undruggable. Drivers and effectors are often connected by druggable signaling and regulatory intermediates. Methods to identify druggable intermediates therefore have general value in expanding the set of targets available for hypothesis-driven validation. Here we identify and prioritize potential druggable intermediates by developing a network perturbation theory, termed NetPert, for response functions of biological networks. Dynamics are defined by a network structure in which vertices represent genes and proteins, and edges represent gene-regulatory interactions and protein-protein interactions. Perturbation theory for network dynamics prioritizes targets that interfere with signaling from driver to response genes. Applications to organoid models for metastatic breast cancer demonstrate the ability of this mathematical framework to identify and prioritize druggable intermediates. While the short-time limit of the perturbation theory resembles betweenness centrality, NetPert is superior in generating target rankings that correlate with previous wet-lab assays and are more robust to incomplete or noisy network data. NetPert also performs better than a related graph diffusion approach. Wet-lab assays demonstrate that drugs for targets identified by NetPert, including targets that are not themselves differentially expressed, are active in suppressing additional metastatic phenotypes.

                <p>by Apolline Louvet, Clément Mantoux, Nathalie Machon</p>

As the spatial arrangement of trees planted along streets in cities makes their bases potential ecological corridors for the flora, urban tree bases may be a key contributor to the overall connectivity of the urban ecosystem. However, these tree bases are also a highly fragmented environment in which extinctions are frequent. The goal of this study was to assess the plant species’ ability to survive and spread through urban tree bases. To do so, we developed a Bayesian framework to assess the extinction risk of a plant metapopulation using presence/absence data, assuming that the occupancy dynamics was described by a Hidden Markov Model. The novelty of our approach is to take into account the combined effect of low-distance dispersal and the potential presence of a seed bank on the extinction risk. We introduced a metric of the extinction risk and examined its performance over a wide range of metapopulation parameters. We applied our framework to yearly floristic inventories carried out in 1324 tree bases in Paris, France. While local extinction risks were generally high, extinction risks at the street scale varied greatly from one species to another. We identified 10 plant species that could survive and spread through urban tree bases, and three plant traits correlated with the extinction risk at the metapopulation scale: the maximal height, and the beginning and end of the flowering period. Our results suggest that some plant species can use urban tree bases as ecological corridors despite high local extinction risks by forming a seed bank. We also identified other plant traits correlated with the ability to survive in tree bases, related to the action of gardeners. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that our Bayesian estimation framework based on percolation theory has the potential to be extended to more general metapopulations.

                <p>by Caleb J. Holt, Kenneth D. Miller, Yashar Ahmadian</p>

When stimulated, neural populations in the visual cortex exhibit fast rhythmic activity with frequencies in the gamma band (30-80 Hz). The gamma rhythm manifests as a broad resonance peak in the power-spectrum of recorded local field potentials, which exhibits various stimulus dependencies. In particular, in macaque primary visual cortex (V1), the gamma peak frequency increases with increasing stimulus contrast. Moreover, this contrast dependence is local: when contrast varies smoothly over visual space, the gamma peak frequency in each cortical column is controlled by the local contrast in that column’s receptive field. No parsimonious mechanistic explanation for these contrast dependencies of V1 gamma oscillations has been proposed. The stabilized supralinear network (SSN) is a mechanistic model of cortical circuits that has accounted for a range of visual cortical response nonlinearities and contextual modulations, as well as their contrast dependence. Here, we begin by showing that a reduced SSN model without retinotopy robustly captures the contrast dependence of gamma peak frequency, and provides a mechanistic explanation for this effect based on the observed non-saturating and supralinear input-output function of V1 neurons. Given this result, the local dependence on contrast can trivially be captured in a retinotopic SSN which however lacks horizontal synaptic connections between its cortical columns. However, long-range horizontal connections in V1 are in fact strong, and underlie contextual modulation effects such as surround suppression. We thus explored whether a retinotopically organized SSN model of V1 with strong excitatory horizontal connections can exhibit both surround suppression and the local contrast dependence of gamma peak frequency. We found that retinotopic SSNs can account for both effects, but only when the horizontal excitatory projections are composed of two components with different patterns of spatial fall-off with distance: a short-range component that only targets the source column, combined with a long-range component that targets columns neighboring the source column. We thus make a specific qualitative prediction for the spatial structure of horizontal connections in macaque V1, consistent with the columnar structure of cortex.

                <p>by Devon J. Boland, Nicola M. Ayres</p>

AlphaFold2 is an Artificial Intelligence-based program developed to predict the 3D structure of proteins given only their amino acid sequence at atomic resolution. Due to the accuracy and efficiency at which AlphaFold2 can generate 3D structure predictions and its widespread adoption into various aspects of biochemical research, the technique of protein structure prediction should be considered for incorporation into the undergraduate biochemistry curriculum. A module for introducing AlphaFold2 into a senior-level biochemistry laboratory classroom was developed. The module’s focus was to have students predict the structures of proteins from the MPOX 22 global outbreak virus isolate genome, which had no structures elucidated at that time. The goal of this study was to both determine the impact the module had on students and to develop a framework for introducing AlphaFold2 into the undergraduate curriculum so that instructors for biochemistry courses, regardless of their background in bioinformatics, could adapt the module into their classrooms.

Throughout history, humans have relied on plants as a source of medication, flavoring, and food. Plants synthesize large chemical libraries and release many of these compounds into the rhizosphere and atmosphere where they affect animal and microbe behavior. To survive, nematodes must have evolved the sensory capacity to distinguish plant-made small molecules (SMs) that are harmful and must be avoided from those that are beneficial and should be sought. This ability to classify chemical cues as a function of their value is fundamental to olfaction and represents a capacity shared by many animals, including humans. Here, we present an efficient platform based on multiwell plates, liquid handling instrumentation, inexpensive optical scanners, and bespoke software that can efficiently determine the valence (attraction or repulsion) of single SMs in the model nematode, <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. Using this integrated hardware-wetware-software platform, we screened 90 plant SMs and identified 37 that attracted or repelled wild-type animals but had no effect on mutants defective in chemosensory transduction. Genetic dissection indicates that for at least 10 of these SMs, response valence emerges from the integration of opposing signals, arguing that olfactory valence is often determined by integrating chemosensory signals over multiple lines of information. This study establishes that <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> is an effective discovery engine for determining chemotaxis valence and for identifying natural products detected by the chemosensory nervous system.

                <p>by Lingchao Ji, Beatriz C. Borges, David T. Martel, Calvin Wu, M. Charles Liberman, Susan E. Shore, Gabriel Corfas</p>

Loss of synapses between spiral ganglion neurons and inner hair cells (IHC synaptopathy) leads to an auditory neuropathy called hidden hearing loss (HHL) characterized by normal auditory thresholds but reduced amplitude of sound-evoked auditory potentials. It has been proposed that synaptopathy and HHL result in poor performance in challenging hearing tasks despite a normal audiogram. However, this has only been tested in animals after exposure to noise or ototoxic drugs, which can cause deficits beyond synaptopathy. Furthermore, the impact of supernumerary synapses on auditory processing has not been evaluated. Here, we studied mice in which IHC synapse counts were increased or decreased by altering neurotrophin 3 (Ntf3) expression in IHC supporting cells. As we previously showed, postnatal Ntf3 knockdown or overexpression reduces or increases, respectively, IHC synapse density and suprathreshold amplitude of sound-evoked auditory potentials without changing cochlear thresholds. We now show that IHC synapse density does not influence the magnitude of the acoustic startle reflex or its prepulse inhibition. In contrast, gap-prepulse inhibition, a behavioral test for auditory temporal processing, is reduced or enhanced according to Ntf3 expression levels. These results indicate that IHC synaptopathy causes temporal processing deficits predicted in HHL. Furthermore, the improvement in temporal acuity achieved by increasing Ntf3 expression and synapse density suggests a therapeutic strategy for improving hearing in noise for individuals with synaptopathy of various etiologies.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Although metabolic abnormalities are implicated in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases, their role in the development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains a subject of controversy. We aimed to identify the association between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and the risk of ALS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This study included 395,987 participants from the UK Biobank to investigate the relationship between MetS and ALS. Cox regression model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR). Stratified analyses were performed based on gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, and education level. Mediation analysis was conducted to explore potential mechanisms.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In this study, a total of 539 cases of ALS were recorded after a median follow-up of 13.7 years. Patients with MetS (defined harmonized) had a higher risk of developing ALS after adjusting for confounding factors (HR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.19–1.89). Specifically, hypertension and high triglycerides were linked to a higher risk of ALS (HR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.19–1.95; HR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.06–1.61, respectively). Moreover, the quantity of metabolic abnormalities showed significant results. Stratified analysis revealed that these associations are particularly significant in individuals with a BMI &lt;25. These findings remained stable after sensitivity analysis. Notably, mediation analysis identified potential metabolites and metabolomic mediators, including alkaline phosphatase, cystatin C, γ-glutamyl transferase, saturated fatty acids to total fatty acids percentage, and omega-6 fatty acids to omega-3 fatty acids ratio.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>MetS exhibits a robust association with an increased susceptibility to ALS, particularly in individuals with a lower BMI. Furthermore, metabolites and metabolomics, as potential mediators, provide invaluable insights into the intricate biological mechanisms. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate whether choroid plexus volumes in subacute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with neurological symptoms could indicate inflammatory activation or barrier dysfunction and assess their association with clinical data.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Choroid plexus volumes were measured in 28 subacute COVID-19 patients via cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), compared with those in infection-triggered non-COVID-19 encephalopathy patients (n = 25), asymptomatic individuals after COVID-19 (n = 21), and healthy controls (n = 21). Associations with inflammatory serum markers (peak counts of leukocytes, C-reactive protein [CRP], interleukin 6), an MRI-based marker of barrier dysfunction (CSF volume fraction [V-CSF]), and clinical parameters like olfactory performance and cognitive scores (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) were investigated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>COVID-19 patients showed significantly larger choroid plexus volumes than control groups (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.172). These volumes correlated significantly with peak leukocyte levels (<i>p</i> = 0.001, Pearson's r = 0.621) and V-CSF (<i>p</i> = 0.009, Spearman's rho = 0.534), but neither with CRP nor interleukin 6.

<p>In patients with subacute COVID-19, choroid plexus volume is a marker of central nervous system inflammation and barrier dysfunction in the presence of neurologic symptoms. The absence of plexus enlargement in infection-triggered non-COVID-19 encephalopathy suggests a specific severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 effect. This study also documents an increase in choroid plexus volume for the first time as a parainfectious event. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1183/v2?src=rss">The influence of the fourth industrial revolution in teaching and learning: the COVID-19 context [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background The aim of this paper was to explore how the Fourth Industrial Revolution shapes teaching and learning during COVID-19 in some of the schools located in the Gauteng and Mpumalanga provinces, South Africa. This paper employed qualitative interpretative multiple case study design. Purposive sampling was used to sample our participants. Methods We selected four teachers who separately taught at the early childhood development stage, intermediate phase, senior phase, and further education and training phases. Data was collected telephonically through semi-structured interviews with teachers from Limpopo, Gauteng and Mpumalanga provinces of South Africa. Data was collected from their experiences of COVID-19 from 2019 to 2021. Collected data was analysed using a typology approach whereby themes that derived from the literature reviewed and research questions were used. Results We inferred from the results of the paper that teachers had challenges with teaching and availability of learning resources, such as limited access to internet and socio-economic backgrounds, which hindered the integration of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in the teaching and learning process. There were also challenges related to teachers’ background on the usage of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the lack of school management teams support. The paper revealed that the integration of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in teaching and learning was affected negatively by the existence of the above-mentioned challenges, which needs to be addressed. Conclusions Therefore, we recommended that the government and stakeholders within the education sector provide resources such as smart-boards, computers, and network access in schools lacking such facilities, as well as providing professional development interventions and training teachers to have an in-depth understanding of the Fourth Industrial Revolution within the teaching and learning context.

                Fish species are commonly used as experimental models in the laboratory. DNA is routinely collected from these animals to permit identification of their genotype. The current standard procedure to sample DNA is fin clipping, which involves anaesthetising individuals and removing a portion of the caudal fin. While fin clipping reliably generates good quality DNA samples for downstream applications, there is evidence that it can alter health and welfare, and impact the fish’s behaviour. This in turn can result in greater variation in the data collected. In a recent study we adapted a skin swabbing protocol to collect DNA from small-bodied fish, including sticklebacks and zebrafish, without the use of analgesics, anaesthetics or sharp instruments. A rayon-tipped swab was used to collect mucus from the flank of the fish, which was then used for DNA extraction. We subsequently demonstrated that compared to fin clipping, skin swabbing triggered fewer changes in stress axis activation and behaviour. We also found that gene expression and behaviour data collected from swabbed fish were less variable than similar data collected from fish that had been fin clipped. This potentially allows smaller sample sizes in experimental groups to be used after skin swabbing, thereby reducing animal use. Here we provide a detailed protocol explaining how to collect DNA samples from small laboratory fish using skin swabs.

                Background Kimono is being reevaluated for its sustainability aspects, such as having fewer offcuts in the production process due to its structural differences from Western-style clothes and its high reusability due to the adaptability to individuals’ body shapes. On the other hand, once a common attire for daily wear in Japan, kimono has transitioned to being worn only on special events and the kimono-related industry has also shrunk. To stimulate demand for kimono, it is essential to familiarize younger generations with its potential as daily wear. Methods A questionnaire survey on perceptions of kimono was conducted among two groups in Japan: 211 college students and 50 kimono enthusiasts. The questionnaire included demographic questions and psychometric scales, primarily focusing on their kimono experiences, challenges associated with wearing kimono, their perceptions of kimono and Western-style clothes, and their attitudes towards kimono. Results The results revealed that a majority of students had worn kimono before, though they found it difficult to move while wearing it. In contrast, kimono enthusiasts evaluated it as easier to move, hard to become disheveled, and casual. They also rated the ease of wearing Western-style clothes lower compared to students, and this tendency intensified with the length of enthusiast experience. Furthermore, the findings indicated that enthusiasts regarded the kimono more as daily wear compared to students, while still deriving enjoyment from it as formal attire in special events. Conclusions These results suggest that the cognition that Western-style clothes are easy to move and kimono is not may change with experiences. Therefore, providing opportunities for people in Japan to acquire how to wear kimono in comfortable ways possibly impacts their perceptions of kimono.

                Background Various stemness markers (SOX2, OCT4, and NANOG) have been studied in odontogenic cysts and tumors. However, studies on SALL4 having similar properties of stemness has not been documented. Additionally, insight into fascin as a migratory molecule is less explored. In this study, the expression of SALL4 and fascin were evaluated in ameloblastoma, adenomatoid odontogenic tumor (AOT), odontogenic keratocyst (OKC), dentigerous cyst (DC), radicular cyst (RC), and calcifying odontogenic cyst (COC). Methods Semi-quantitative analysis of fascin and SALL4 immuno-positive cells was done in a total of 40 cases of ameloblastoma (11 plexiform, 12 follicular, 12 unicystic, and 5 desmoplastic) variants, 6 cases of AOT, 15 each of OKC, DC, RC and 5 of COC. Chi-square test was applied to evaluate the association between SALL4 and fascin expression in odontogenic cysts and tumors. Results Fascin immunopositivity was observed in peripheral ameloblast-like cells, and the expression was weak or absent in stellate reticulum-like cells. A moderate to weak immune-reactivity to SALL4 was observed in the cytoplasm of ameloblastoma, epithelial cells of dentigerous and radicular cysts, having a marked inflammatory infiltrate, which was an interesting observation. COC and AOT had negative to weak expressions. No recurrence has been reported. Conclusions Expression of fascin in ameloblastomas elucidate their role in motility and localized invasion. Its expression in less aggressive lesions like DC, COC, AOT will incite to explore the other functional properties of fascin. SALL4 expression in the cytoplasm of odontogenic cysts and tumors may represent inactive or mutant forms which requires further validation.

                Background Technology has completely transformed healthcare, starting with X-ray machines and MRIs to telehealth and robotic surgeries to e-health records. The launch of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) serves as a milestone in medical history, offering benefits such as smaller incisions, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery, making it a preferred surgical option. This study mainly explores patients’ willingness to adopt robot-assisted surgery (RAS) technology in a surgical intervention and is assessed in the backdrop of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Methods This research project employs a post-positivist research philosophy and a cross-sectional research design. A structured, pre-tested questionnaire was used to collect data from 280 respondents. Results The results revealed that trust had a significant impact on Perceived Usefulness (β = 0.099) and Perceived Ease of Use (β = .157), and eHealth literacy had a significant impact on Perceived Ease of Use (β = 0.438) and Perceived Usefulness (β = 0.454). Additionally, Perceived Usefulness partially influenced behavioral intention (β = 0.123), and attitude had a significant influence on behavioral intention (β = 0.612). The analysis revealed an insignificant impact of eHealth literacy on Perceived Usefulness (β = 0.067). The Standard Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) value was <0.8. Mediation analysis also revealed partial mediation between the constructs. The SRMR rating of this model is 0.067, indicating that it fits the data well. Conclusion This study revealed that a patient's intention will be high if he or she believes that RAS is beneficial in treating his or her ailment. In comparison, information related to RAS is clearly known, and it does not directly affect selection intention. eHealth literacy is a significant antecedent to patients’ behavioral intention. Hence, the healthcare industry must devise strategies to promote the acceptance of RAS at all levels.

                Background In Sierra Leone, the National Emergency Medical Services (NEMS) was designed to facilitate maternal and under-five referrals. During the COVID-19 pandemic, health facilities were repurposed and mobility restrictions were introduced, and this might have negatively influenced access to care. Thus, we compared utilization, timeliness and outcomes of referrals between the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods. Methods This was a cohort study using routinely collected data by the NEMS. There were 65 weeks in the pre-COVID-19 period (week one of January 2019 to week three of March 2020) and 91 weeks in the COVID-19 period (week four of March 2020 to week four of December 2021). We compared weekly referrals and the duration from initiating the NEMS for a referral to the patient reaching the receiving facility (prehospital delay) using the Mann–Whitney U test. Chi-squared tests were used to compare the mode of transportation and referral outcomes. Results Compared to the pre-COVID-19 period, there was significant decrease during the COVID-19 period in the median number of weekly maternal referrals (277 to 205), under-five referrals (177 to 104) and transfers on NEMS ambulances (348 to 269). The prehospital delays increased during the COVID-19 period for both maternal (72 to 86 minutes) and under-five (75 to 90 minutes) referrals (p<0.001). The percentage of NEMS ambulance transfers for maternal referrals was similar in both periods (90%), but for under-five referrals this decreased between the pre-COVID-19 (72%) and COVID-19 (68%) periods. In both periods, maternal (98%) and under-five (96%) referrals were successfully admitted to the receiving facilities. Conclusions The performance of the NEMS system in terms of referrals reaching the receiving health facilities was maintained during the pandemic. However, there is a need to sustain the current performance of the NEMS system while making more efforts to increase utilization and reduce delays during outbreaks/pandemics.

                Richter’s hernia is a rare type of abdominal wall hernia characterized by high morbidity and mortality. It occurs when the anti-mesenteric border of the bowel is partially trapped in a tight hernial ring. The femoral ring is the most common site, with the ileum being the most frequently involved intestinal segment. However, the advent of laparoscopic surgery has introduced another potential site for Richter’s hernia formation. In our region, this pathological entity is exceptionally diagnosed due to limited access to abdominal imaging and delayed management. Additionally, the wide variety of clinical manifestations resulting from incomplete intestinal obstruction makes it particularly difficult to diagnose. Consequently, it is usually identified during surgery. We present here the case of two adult patients (a 33-yeairs-old woman and a 59-year-old man), the first with a history of surgical procedures and the second with a spontaneously reducible painless inguinal swelling. They were transferred to the surgical emergency department for an acute abdomen with abdominal distension and cessation of matter and gas. Clinical and paraclinical examinations (including hydroaeric level on abdominal X-ray) indicated mechanical intestinal obstruction. Emergency laparotomy, necessitated by the unavailability of abdominal computed tomography due to financial constraints, confirmed the diagnosis of Richter's hernia, with the first case located in the right inguinal region and the second in the linea alba. Surgical management involved reduction of the hernia contents and suture repair in both cases. Despite requiring bowel resection in the second patient, the postoperative course was straightforward. These two rare cases highlight that emergency exploratory laparotomy is the cornerstone of Richter hernia management in resource-limited conditions.

                Liver transplantation is the ultimate therapeutic option for patients with end-stage liver disease. The clinical management of transplant patients significantly impacts their prognosis, with outcomes influenced by multiple interacting variables. Cardiovascular complications count as a leading cause of both short-term and long-term morbidity and mortality in liver transplant recipients. In this respect, accurate risk assessment and stratification are crucial for optimizing clinical outcomes. Modern artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have significant potential for early risk prediction, providing comprehensive risk assessments in both diagnosed cohorts and early clinical phase patients. This systematic review examines the state of the art in AI applications for predicting cardiovascular risks in liver transplantation, identifying current issues, challenges, and future research directions. We reviewed articles from digital repositories such as PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and ScienceDirect published between 2000 and 2023, using keywords including artificial intelligence, machine learning, cardiovascular, and liver transplantation. Our analysis revealed a diverse range of machine learning algorithms used in this domain. Despite the potential, only 12 papers met the criteria for adequate topic coverage, highlighting a scarcity of research at this intersection. Key challenges include integrating diverse datasets, isolating cardiovascular effects amid multifaceted influences, ensuring data quality and quantity, and the issues to extrapolate machine learning models to day-to-day clinical practice. Nevertheless, leveraging AI for risk prediction in liver transplantation could significantly enhance patient management and resource optimization, indicating a shift towards more personalized and effective medical practices.

                Background Statistical process control (SPC) is utiled in manufacturing and service applications. It is used to monitor the behavior of the process, also to discover and solve the issues in internal systems. SPC allows immediate corrective actions to prevent defects and maintain process stability. There are two types of control charts are available in the literature: variable control charts and attribute control charts. Methods The use of attribute control charts for two positively skewed distributions such as power function distribution and weighted power function distribution is discussed in this research paper. We compared the behavior of both types of control charts and presented the results in form of tables. Results We conclude that control charts under a weighted power function distribution perform better than control charts using a power function distribution. Furthermore, these results will help in the early detection of errors that enhance the process reliability of the telecommunications and financing industries.

                Background Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is an effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Automatic positive airway pressure (APAP) at home might be an alternative choice to identify optimal treatment pressure for OSA patients requiring CPAP treatment. Data on the association of effective treatment pressure between laboratory polysomnography (in-lab PSG) and home APAP has been limited. The aim of this study was to determine the correlation of effective CPAP pressure between in-lab PSG and home APAP. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted. OSA participants aged 18 years or older who required CPAP therapy were included. Patients underwent in-lab PSG with manual CPAP titration to identify an effective treatment pressure. Patients also underwent APAP at home for 2 weeks to identify 95 percentile treatment pressure as an effective pressure. Results Fifty OSA patients (82% male) were included. Mean age was 48.9±14.6 years. Body mass index was 28.7±6.1 kg/m2. Polysomnographic data showed the effective treatment pressure of 10.4±2.9 cmH2O and the apnea-hypopnea index was 55.1±29.0 events/hour. Severe OSA was 76%. Home APAP data showed effective treatment pressure of 10.8±1.8 cmH2O. There was positive correlation of effective pressure between home APAP and in-lab PSG (r=0.472, P=0.001). The equation for predicting an in-lab effective pressure was: predicted pressure (cmH2O) = 2 + (home APAP ⁎ 0.78). Bland-Altman analysis showed good agreement between them, with a low mean difference of -0.428 cmH2O and 96% within the limit of agreement. Conclusions Home APAP pressure is moderately positively correlated with in-lab PSG effective pressure. The accuracy of home APAP is in agreement with in-lab PSG with manual CPAP titration. This APAP might be able to determine an effective therapeutic pressure in the sleep laboratory for OSA treatment.

                Background Sexual violence is prevalent in higher education institutions in Nigeria and stakeholders have encouraged staff and students to blow the whistle whenever they fall victim to or are aware of any sexual violence case. However, there is lack of data about whether the staff and students of these institutions have the intention to blow the whistle internally (within the institution) or not. There is also a lack of data on the existing reporting mechanisms or preferred whistleblowing mechanisms in these institutions. These have hindered the analysis of stakeholders’ opinions on this topic. Methods This data note presents a comprehensive quantitative and qualitative data set collected from staff and students of three categories of government owned higher education institutions (Universities, Polytechnics, Colleges of Education) in Nigeria. Data collection was between February and December, 2021, during which quantitative data were collected from 21,937 students and 3,108 staff. Qualitatively, 138 students and 111 staff participated in a total of 35 focus group discussion sessions. The study provides unique information on respondents’ attitude, self-efficacy, and subjective norm to sexual violence whistleblowing. It also provides information on self-reported sexual violence experiences, whistleblowing intention, reporting systems in higher institutions and the preferred sexual violence whistleblowing mechanisms. Conclusions In this data note, we provide a detailed account of the variables in the dataset and then highlight the potential of this study to contribute to improved sexual violence reporting in higher education institutions, thereby reducing the occurrence of the social menace.

                Background Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness characterized by psychosis, apathy, social withdrawal, and cognitive impairment, which results in impaired functioning in work, school, parenting, self-care, independent living, interpersonal relationships, and leisure time. Method A systematic search was conducted using Arksey and O’Malley’s framework with studies published on leisure-based intervention from January 1990 to December 2023. Results The review included 11 articles in the study. In total two studies were pilot interventional study, one randomized controlled study, one case-control, one retrospective study, three were cross sectional, one was cross sectional longitudinal study and two were qualitative in nature. Studies used different types of leisure activities like cooking group, discussions, board games, arts and craft, painting, beading, sewing, clay work, paper craft, etc were used as an intervention. Qualitative studies found that individuals with schizophrenia spent less time in social and leisure activities and more time relaxing and doing nothing. Conclusion The study highlights the need to conduct further research on leisure-based interventions using various study designs like randomized controlled trials and mixed methods to understand its effectiveness among individuals with schizophrenia.

                Background: Ludwig's angina is a potentially life-threatening disease characterized by diffuse bilateral cellulitis with an odontogenic origin. This unique infection is now rare owing to the antibiotic era. Case: This patient presented to the emergency room with trismus, jaw and neck swelling, mild respiratory distress with tachypnea, hyperthermia, and panic. Clinical examination and radiographic evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of Ludwig's angina. As it is a quickly spreading infection, the patient was taken up for immediate surgical decompression leading to pus drainage, removal of the offending tooth, bacterial culture and sensitivity, and administration of empirical antibiotics. As we had operated promptly, there was no need for emergency airway intervention, and the patient had immediate relief from airway distress. Conclusions: Early accurate diagnosis with conservative surgical decompression, thereby negating the need for airway intervention, was vital to avoiding mortality which is always possible in such an expeditious infection.

                Background For more than 150 years, dental amalgam (DA) has been popular as a dental restorative material. Many organizations oppose its use due to perceived toxicity and environmental concerns. Hence, this study aimed to explore the continued use of DA from a South Indian dental practitioners’ perspective. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted among fifty-two private and public dental practitioners of Udupi district in Southern India. A self‑administered questionnaire was distributed, that involved assessment of their preferences, continuation of use and concerns of using DA as a restorative material. The percentage contribution of each variable was calculated. Preferences for continuation of use of silver amalgam based upon the age, experience and mercury toxicity as a risk factor were analyzed using Students-t test and Fisher’s Exact Test test. Results Most dentists were satisfied (87%) with the results of the DA, found minimal failures (96%) and found DA more economical (89%). More than half (54%) of the participants reported that they would not continue the use of DA owing to mercury toxicity and environmental concerns. Dentists with higher age and longer clinical experience preferred continuation of DA. Conclusions Despite satisfaction with DA for its minimal failure, longevity and affordability, the authors found that most practitioners did not prefer its continued usage. This highlights their concerns over mercury toxicity and soft tissue lesions and accentuates their community social responsibility. There is also an urgent need to educate dentists on mercury hygiene, mercury waste management and disposal.

                Background Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the head and neck pose a challenge in their management due to their local aggressiveness and high recurrence risk. This study aimed to analyze literature on head and neck AVM recurrence post-treatment and identify the most effective strategy with a lower recurrence rate. Objectives To analyse existing literature on the recurrence of head and neck AVMs following treatment. Our goal was to identify the most effective treatment option with a lower recurrence rate. Methods We conducted a thorough literature search using PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus, from year 2000 to the present. Our analysis focused on key endpoints, specifically the recurrence rates of head and neck AVMs following various treatment approaches. Results Out of the initial pool of 108 screened articles, a total of 83 patients were deemed suitable for inclusion in the literature review. The reviewed articles demonstrated that appropriate diagnostic tests were documented in 95% of the included studies. Among the patients, 37.3% had previously undergone interventions and were currently dealing with regrowth masses. Notably, 56.6% of patients underwent a combined approach involving both endovascular and surgical methods, while 25.3% opted for a surgical-only approach, and only 18.1% pursued an endovascular-only approach. The studies showed a promising curing rate of AVMs, with a success rate of 94%, albeit with a complication rate of 32.5%. The average follow-up duration for all patients was 26 months, with a standard deviation of 20.5 months. Out of the 83 patients, 5 experienced recurrence, with single-modality approach. Interestingly, no patients who received a multi-modality of treatments experienced recurrence or regrowth of the AVM mass within the follow up period. Conclusion The multi-modality approach outperformed single-modality treatments in preventing AVM recurrence. These findings highlight the importance of a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach in the management of these complex vascular anomalies.

                Changes in pupil size offer a rich, continuous, and integrated neurophysiological readout of attention and cognition. I here briefly reintroduce examples of a vast, forgotten literature, full of inspiring ideas, which described attentional modulations of pupil size decades earlier than often assumed. I outline parallels between these early studies and recent developments in pupillometry.

The TCR-induced transcription factor IRF4 promotes proliferation and PD-1 expression but hampers effector functions and expression of NF-κB-regulated genes. They also compared CD8 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes to activated T cells in patients with COVID-19.

Additionally, they find that BACH1-induced ferroptotic FGF21 secretion contributes to obesity suppression and longevity in vivo.

                Liu et al. find a mechanism deployed by cells to respond to ER stress. The unfolded protein response (UPR) selectively down-regulates a subunit of the signal recognition particle, SRP14. This causes a decrease of protein translocation into the ER lumen, thus reducing ER burden to alleviate cellular stress.

                Cellular stress may contribute to neurodegeneration. Huang et al. demonstrate that stress-induced nuclear condensation of the neurodegeneration-linked TDP-43 protein causes its transient inactivation and loss of function in splicing. Although these changes are reversible, some TDP-43 splicing targets, e.g., STMN2, recover slowly, rendering them prone to misregulation under chronic stress.
