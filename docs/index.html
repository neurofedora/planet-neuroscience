	<p>Tinnitus is a common phantom auditory percept believed to be related to plastic changes in the brain due to hearing loss. However, tinnitus can also occur in the absence of any clinical hearing loss. In this case, since there is no hearing loss, the mechanisms that drive plastic changes remain largely enigmatic. Previous studies showed subtle differences in sound-evoked brain activity associated with tinnitus in subjects with tinnitus and otherwise normal hearing, but the results are not consistent across studies. Here, we aimed to investigate these differences using monaural rather than binaural stimuli. Sound-evoked responses were measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in participants with and without tinnitus. All participants had clinically normal audiograms. The stimuli were pure tones with frequencies between 353 and 8000 Hz, presented monaurally. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the response in the auditory cortex revealed no difference in tonotopic organization, which confirmed earlier studies. A GLM analysis showed hyperactivity in the lateral areas of the bilateral auditory cortex. Consistent with the tonotopic map, this hyperactivity mainly occurred in response to low stimulus frequencies. This may be related to hyperacusis, which was associated with tinnitus found in the parahippocampus. This may reflect an interference between tinnitus and spatial orientation.</p>

">Multimodal identification of the mouse brain using simultaneous Ca2+ imaging and fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Individual differences in neuroimaging are of interest to clinical and cognitive neuroscientists based on their potential for guiding the personalized treatment of various heterogeneous neurological conditions and diseases. Despite many advantages, the workhorse in this arena, BOLD (blood-oxygen-level-dependent) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) suffers from low spatiotemporal resolution and specificity as well as a propensity for noise and spurious signal corruption. To better understand individual differences in BOLD-fMRI data, we can use animal models where fMRI, alongside complementary but more invasive contrasts, can be accessed. Here, we apply simultaneous wide-field fluorescence calcium imaging and BOLD-fMRI in mice to interrogate individual differences using a connectome-based identification framework adopted from the human fMRI literature. This approach yields high spatiotemporal resolution cell-type specific signals (here, from glia, excitatory, as well as inhibitory interneurons) from the whole cortex. We found mouse multimodal connectome-based identification to be successful and explored various features of these data.

">Digital cognitive assessments as low-burden markers for predicting future cognitive decline and tau accumulation across the Alzheimer's spectrum</a></h4>

              
                Digital cognitive assessments, particularly those that can be done at home, present as low burden biomarkers for participants and patients alike, but their effectiveness in diagnosis of Alzheimer's or predicting its trajectory is still unclear. Here, we assessed what utility or added value these digital cognitive assessments provide for identifying those at high risk for cognitive decline. We analyzed >500 ADNI participants who underwent a brief digital cognitive assessment and amyloid/tau PET scans, examining their ability to distinguish cognitive status and predict cognitive decline. Performance on the digital cognitive assessment were superior to both cortical amyloid and entorhinal tau in detecting mild cognitive impairment and future cognitive decline, with mnemonic discrimination deficits emerging as the most critical measure for predicting decline and future tau accumulation. Digital assessments are effective in identifying at-risk individuals, supporting their utility as low-burden tools for early Alzheimer's detection and monitoring.

">Hippocampal mGluR5 levels are comparable in Alzheimer's and control brains, and divergently influenced by amyloid and tau in control brain</a></h4>

              
                Background: Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) modulates excitatory glutamatergic synaptic transmission and plays an important role in learning and memory formation and in neurodegeneration and amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Conflicting results on the cerebral mGluR5 levels in AD have been reported based on in vivo and postmortem studies. Here, we aimed to assess alterations in hippocampal mGluR5 expression in AD, and the associations between mGluR5 expression and pathologies. Methods: Immunofluorescence staining for mGluR5 was performed on postmortem brain tissue from 34 AD patients and 31 nondemented controls (NCs) and from aged 3xTg and arcA{beta} model mice of AD. Autoradiography was performed on brain tissue slices from arcA{beta} mice using mGluR5 tracer [18F]PSS232. Analysis of different cellular source of GRM5 RNA in human and mouse brains was performed. Proteomic profiling and pathway analysis were performed on hippocampal tissue from aged 3xTg mice and wild-type mice. Results: No differences in hippocampal mGluR5 expression or entorhinal cortical GRM5 RNA levels were detected between the AD and NC groups. Hippocampal mGluR5 levels increased with Braak stage and decreased with amyloid level in the NC group. No correlations were detected between the levels of mGluR5 and amyloid, tau, or Iba1/P2X7R in the hippocampus of AD patients and NC cases. Ex vivo autoradiography revealed comparable cerebral levels of [18F]PSS232 in arcA{beta} mice compared to nontransgenic mice. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses revealed that the Shank3, Grm5 and glutamatergic pathways were upregulated in hippocampal tissue from aged 3xTg mice compared to wild-type mice. Conclusion: This study revealed no difference in hippocampal mGluR5 levels between AD patients and NCs and revealed the divergent influence of amyloid and tau pathologies on hippocampal mGluR5 levels in NCs. Species differences were observed in the GRM5 RNA level as well as at the cellular location.

">Early life intestinal inflammation alters gut microbiome, impairing gut-brain communication and reproductive behavior in mice</a></h4>

              
                Despite recent advances in understanding the connection between the gut microbiota and the brain, there remains a wide knowledge gap in how gut inflammation impacts brain development. Microbiota-derived metabolite signaling from the gut to the brain is required for normal development of microglia, the brain's resident immune cells. Disruption of the microbiota-brain communication has been linked to impaired behaviours and Autism Spectrum Disorder. We hypothesized that intestinal inflammation in early life would negatively affect neurodevelopment through dysregulation of microbiota communication to brain microglia. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel pediatric model of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). IBD is an incurable condition affecting millions of people worldwide, characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation, and has comorbid symptoms of anxiety, depression and cognitive impairment. Significantly, 25% of IBD patients are diagnosed during childhood, and the effect of chronic inflammation during this critical period of development is largely unknown. We developed a chemical model of pediatric chronic IBD by repeatedly treating juvenile mice with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in drinking water. DSS-treated mice displayed increased intestinal inflammation, altered microbiota and changes in circulating metabolites. We also found that alterations in gut microbiota had long-term impacts on female microglia and male sex-specific behaviours and testosterone regulation, consistent with delayed puberty observed in male IBD patients. Our research expands our understanding of microbiota-microglia communication underlying development. The gut-brain axis is an exciting target for personalized medicine as microbiome manipulations could be feasible for early intervention to reverse deficits due to juvenile inflammation.

">Molecular Specializations Underlying Phenotypic Differences in Inner Ear Hair Cells of Zebrafish and Mice</a></h4>

              
                Hair cells (HCs) are the sensory receptors of the auditory and vestibular systems in the inner ears of vertebrates that selectively transduce mechanical stimuli into electrical activity. Although all HCs have the hallmark stereocilia bundle for mechanotransduction, HCs in non-mammals and mammals differ in their molecular specialization in the apical, basolateral and synaptic membranes. HCs of non-mammals, such as zebrafish (zHCs), are electrically tuned to specific frequencies and possess an active process in the stereocilia bundle to amplify sound signals. Mammalian cochlear HCs, in contrast, are not electrically tuned and achieve amplification by somatic motility of outer HCs (OHCs). To understand the genetic mechanisms underlying differences among adult zebrafish and mammalian cochlear HCs, we compared their RNA-seq-characterized transcriptomes, focusing on protein-coding orthologous genes related to HC specialization. There was considerable shared expression of gene orthologs among the HCs, including those genes associated with mechanotransduction, ion transport/channels, and synaptic signaling. For example, both zebrafish and mouse HCs express Tmc1, Lhfpl5, Tmie, Cib2, Cacna1d, Cacnb2, Otof, Pclo and Slc17a8. However, there were some notable differences in expression among zHCs, OHCs, and inner HCs (IHCs), which likely underlie the distinctive physiological properties of each cell type. Tmc2 and Cib3 were not detected in adult mouse HCs but tmc2a and b and cib3 were highly expressed in zHCs. Mouse HCs express Kcna10, Kcnj13, Kcnj16, and Kcnq4, which were not detected in zHCs. Chrna9 and Chrna10 were expressed in mouse HCs. In contrast, chrna10 was not detected in zHCs. OHCs highly express Slc26a5 which encodes the motor protein prestin that contributes to OHC electromotility. However, zHCs have only weak expression of slc26a5, and subsequently showed no voltage dependent electromotility when measured. Notably, the zHCs expressed more paralogous genes including those associated with HC-specific functions and transcriptional activity, though it is unknown whether they have functions similar to their mammalian counterparts. There was overlap in the expressed genes associated with a known hearing phenotype. Our analyses unveil substantial differences in gene expression patterns that may explain phenotypic specialization of zebrafish and mouse HCs. This dataset also includes several protein-coding genes to further the functional characterization of HCs and study of HC evolution from non-mammals to mammals.

">Angiogenesis in the mature mouse cortex is governed in a region specific and Notch1 dependent manner</a></h4>

              
                Cerebral angiogenesis is well appreciated in development and after injury, but the extent to which it occurs across cortical regions in normal adult mice and underlying mechanisms, is incompletely understood. Using in vivo imaging, we show that angiogenesis in anterior-medial cortical regions (retrosplenial and sensorimotor cortex), was exceptionally rare. By contrast, angiogenesis was significantly elevated in posterior-lateral regions such as visual cortex, primarily within 200 microns of the cortical surface. There were no regional differences in vessel pruning or sex effects except for the length and depth of new capillaries. To understand mechanisms, we surveyed gene expression and found Notch related genes were enriched in ultra-stable retrosplenial versus visual cortex. Using endothelial specific knockdown of Notch1, cerebral angiogenesis was significantly increased along with genes implicated in angiogenesis (Apln, Angpt2, Cdkn1a). Our study shows that angiogenesis is regionally dependent and manipulations of Notch1 signaling could unlock the angiogenic potential of the mature vasculature.

">A connectomics-driven analysis reveals novel characterization of border regions in mouse visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Leveraging retinotopic maps to parcellate the visual cortex into its respective sub-regions has long been a canonical approach to characterizing the functional organization of visual areas in the mouse brain. However, with the advent of extensive connectomics datasets like MICrONS, we can now perform more granular analyses on biological neural networks, enabling us to better characterize the structural and functional profile of the visual cortex. In this work, we propose a statistical framework for analyzing the MICrONS dataset, focusing our efforts on the network encompassed by the retinotopically-induced V1, RL, and AL visual areas. In particular, we bridge the gap between connectomics and retinotopy by identifying several structural and functional differences between these regions. Most notably, by placing our attention on the borders between these regions, we demonstrate how connectomics, in some ways, supersedes retinotopy, providing evidence for two major findings. One, by comparing the V1-RL and RL-AL border regions, we show that not all borders in the visual cortex are the same with respect to structure and function. Two, we propose a novel interpretation for the V1-RL border region in particular, motivating it as a subnetwork that possesses heightened synaptic connectivity and more synchronous neural activity. Going one step further, we analyze structure and function in tandem by measuring information flow along synapses, demonstrating that the V1-RL border serves as a bridge for communication between the V1 and RL visual areas, offering justification as to why it presents itself uniquely with respect to both structure and function.

">Characterization of sleep in a mouse model of CLN3 disease revealed sex-specific sleep disturbances</a></h4>

              
                The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are a group of recessively inherited neurodegenerative diseases characterized by lysosomal storage of fluorescent materials. CLN3 disease, or juvenile Batten disease, is the most common NCL that is caused by mutations in the Ceroid Lipofuscinosis, Neuronal 3 (CLN3) gene. Sleep disturbances are among the most common symptoms associated with CLN3 disease, yet this is understudied and has not been delineated in an animal model of the disease. The current study utilized a non-invasive, automated piezoelectric motion sensing system (PiezoSleep) to classify sleep and wakefulness in a Cln3Dex1-6/Dex1-6 (Cln3KO) mouse model and age- and sex-matched wild-type (WT) controls. The sleep-wake classification by PiezoSleep was found to be about 90% accurate when validated against simultaneous gold standard polysomnographic recordings including electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) in a small cohort of WT and Cln3KO mice. Our large cohort PiezoSleep study reveals sleep abnormalities during the light period (LP) in male Cln3KO mice compared to WT male, and more subtle differences in Cln3KO female mice throughout the dark period (DP) compared to WT female, recapitulating sleep abnormalities seen in CLN3 disease patients. Our characterization of sleep in a mouse model of CLN3 disease contributes to a better understanding of the sleep disturbances commonly reported for CLN3 disease and other NCLs, which will facilitate the development of new disease treatment and management strategies.

">Estimating steady-state evoked potentials in the limit of short data duration and low stimulation frequency.</a></h4>

              
                Because of their high signal-to-noise ratio and robustness to artifacts, Steady-State Evoked Potentials (SSEP) - the periodic responses elicited by periodic stimulation designs - are increasingly used in human neuroscience for measuring stimulus-specific brain responses in a short presentation time. While widely applied to measure sensory responses with stimulation frequencies higher than 8 Hz, they are also successful to investigate high-order processes and/or early development characterized by slower time scales, requiring very low stimulation frequencies around 1 Hz. However, applications of these low frequency paradigms on developmental or clinical populations, typically relying on very short data recordings, pose a methodological challenge for SSEP estimation. Here we tackled this challenge by investigating the method of analysis that most efficiently compute SSEP at low stimulation frequencies in the limit of short data, and by estimating the minimum data length necessary to obtain a reliable response. We compared the performance of the three most commonly used measures of SSEP (power spectrum (PS), evoked power spectrum (EPS) and inter-trial coherence (ITC)) at progressively shorter data segments both on simulated data and on EEG responses to on-off checkerboard stimulation at two low frequencies (4 Hz and 0.8 Hz). Results, consistent between simulated and real data, show that while for long data length EPS and ITC outperform PS, for short data length the three measures are equivalent, and the crucial parameter is the length of the sliding window over which each measure is computed: the longer the better for PS and EPS, whereas the opposite occurs for ITC. For the analysed dataset, the shortest data length required to estimate a reliable SSEP is as short as 8 cycles of stimulation, independently from the stimulation frequency. This study provides practical indications for reliable and efficient application of low-frequency SSEP designs on short data recordings.

">Circadian clock neurons use activity-regulated gene expression for structural plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Drosophila s-LNv circadian pacemaker neurons show dramatic structural plasticity, with their projections expanded at dawn and then retracted by dusk. This predictable plasticity makes s-LNvs ideal to study molecular mechanisms of plasticity. Although s-LNv plasticity is controlled by their molecular clock, changing s-LNv excitability also regulates plasticity. Here, we tested the idea that s-LNvs use activity-regulated genes to control plasticity. We found that inducing expression of either of the activity-regulated transcription factors Hr38 or Sr (orthologs of mammalian Nr4a1 and Egr1) is sufficient to rapidly expand s-LNv projections. Conversely, transiently knocking down expression of either Hr38 or sr blocks expansion of s-LNv projections at dawn. We show that Hr38 rapidly induces transcription of sif, which encodes a Rac1 GEF required for s-LNv plasticity rhythms. We conclude that the s-LNv molecular clock controls s-LNv excitability, which couples to an activity-regulated gene expression program to control s-LNv plasticity.

">The UFMylation pathway is impaired in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles made of hyperphosphorylated tau and senile plaques composed of beta-amyloid. These pathognomonic deposits have been implicated in the pathogenesis, although the molecular mechanisms and consequences remain undetermined. UFM1 is an important, but understudied ubiquitin-like protein that is covalently attached to substrates. This UFMylation has recently been identified as major modifier of tau aggregation upon seeding in experimental models. However, potential alterations of the UFM1 pathway in human AD brain have not been investigated yet. Methods: Here we used frontal and temporal cortex samples from individuals with or without AD to measure the protein levels of the UFMylation pathway in human brain. We used multivariable regression analyses followed by Bonferroni correction for multiple testing to analyze associations of the UFMylation pathway with neuropathological characteristics, primary biochemical measurements of tau and additional biochemical markers from the same cases. We further studied associations of the UFMylation cascade with cellular stress pathways using Spearman correlations with bulk RNAseq expression data and functionally validated these interactions using gene-edited neurons that were generated by CRISPR-Cas9. Results: Compared to controls, human AD brain had increased protein levels of UFM1. Our data further indicates that this increase mainly reflects conjugated UFM1 indicating hyperUFMylation in AD. UFMylation was strongly correlated with pathological tau in both AD-affected brain regions. In addition, we found that the levels of conjugated UFM1 were negatively correlated with soluble levels of the deUFMylation enzyme UFSP2. Functional analysis of UFM1 and/or UFSP2 knockout neurons revealed that the DNA damage response as well as the unfolded protein response are perturbed by changes in neuronal UFM1 signaling. Conclusions: There are marked changes in the UFMylation pathway in human AD brain. These changes are significantly associated with pathological tau, supporting the idea that the UFMylation cascade might indeed act as a modifier of tau pathology in human brain. Our study further nominates UFSP2 as an attractive target to reduce the hyperUFMylation observed in AD brain but also underscores the critical need to identify risks and benefits of manipulating the UFMylation pathway as potential therapeutic avenue for AD.

">Patterned Electrical Brain Stimulation by a Wireless Network of Implantable Microdevices</a></h4>

              
                Transmitting meaningful information into brain circuits by electronic means is a challenge facing brain-computer interfaces. A key goal is to find an approach to inject spatially structured local current stimuli across swaths of sensory areas of the cortex. Here, we introduce a fully wireless approach to multipoint patterned electrical microstimulation by a spatially distributed epicortically implanted network of silicon microchips to target specific areas of the cortex. Each sub-millimeter-sized microchip harvests energy from an external radio-frequency source and converts this into biphasic current injected focally into tissue by a pair of integrated microwires. The amplitude, period, and repetition rate of injected current from each chip are controlled across the implant network by implementing a pre-scheduled, collision-free bitmap wireless communication protocol featuring sub-millisecond latency. As an in vivo demonstration, a network of 30 wireless stimulators was chronically implanted into motor and sensory areas of the cortex in a freely moving rat for three months. We explored the effects of patterned intracortical electrical stimulation on trained animal behavior at average RF powers well below safety limits.

">Muscle-derived miR-200a-3p through light-intensity exercise may contribute to improve memory dysfunction in type 2 diabetic mice</a></h4>

              
                Background: Memory dysfunction associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) poses a considerable threat to overall well-being. Engaging in light-intensity exercise has been shown to exert favorable effects on hippocampal function and molecular profiles, including Mct2 mRNA and miR-200a-3p. Nonetheless, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying the positive impact of light-intensity exercise remains elusive. Here, we assessed the influence of exosomal miR-200a-3p secretion from gastrocnemius muscles in T2DM mice undergoing light-intensity exercise intervention, focusing on its potential to ameliorate memory dysfunction. Basic procedures: We initially assessed the effects of light-intensity exercise (7.0 m/min for healthy mice, 5.0 m/min for ob/ob mice, 30 min/day, five days/week, over a four-week period) on memory function, hippocampal mRNA associated with memory function, and the secretion of exosomal miR-200a-3p from their gastrocnemius muscle. Subsequently, the impact of a daily intraperitoneal injection of the miR-200a-3p mimic over a four-week duration was investigated, focusing on its influence on hippocampal dysregulation in ob/ob mice. Main findings: The light-intensity exercise intervention increased gastrocnemius muscle-derived and plasma exosomal miR-200a-3p levels in ob/ob mice, concomitant with improved memory dysfunction. Intriguingly, the daily intraperitoneal injection of mmu-miR-200a-3p mimic also demonstrated an ameliorative effect on memory function in ob/ob mice. Notably, both the exercise intervention and miR-200a-3p mimic treatment induced downregulation in hippocampal Keap1 mRNA and upregulation in mRNA of Hsp90aa1 and Mct2 in ob/ob mice. Principal conclusions: The current results imply that the augmentation of exosomal miR-200a-3p derived from the gastrocnemius muscle contributes to the amelioration of memory dysfunction in T2DM undergoing light-intensity exercise. Additionally, it is proposed that miR-200a-3p emulates the effects of light-intensity exercise, suggesting a potential therapeutic pathway for addressing hippocampal complications in the context of T2DM.

                Engineering small autonomous agents capable of operating in the microscale environment remains a key challenge, with current systems still evolving. Our study explores the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, a classic model system in biology and a species adept at microscale interaction, as a biological platform for micro-robotics. Initially, we focus on remotely directing the walking paths of fruit flies in an experimental arena. We accomplish this through two distinct approaches: harnessing the fruit flies' opto-motor response and optogenetic modulation of its olfactory system. These techniques facilitate reliable and repeated guidance of flies between arbitrary spatial locations. We guide flies along predetermined trajectories, enabling them to scribe patterns resembling textual characters through their locomotion. We enhance olfactory-guided navigation through additional optogenetic activation of positive valence mushroom body output neurons. We extend this control to collective behaviors in shared spaces and navigation through constrained maze-like environments. We further use our guidance technique to enable flies to carry a load across designated points in space, establishing the upper bound on their weight carrying capabilities. Additionally, we demonstrate that visual guidance can facilitate novel interactions between flies and objects, showing that flies can consistently relocate a small spherical object over significant distances. Beyond expanding tools available for micro-robotics, these novel behavioral contexts can provide insights into the neurological basis of behavior in fruit flies.

">Senescent-like microglia limit remyelination through the senescence associated secretory phenotype</a></h4>

              
                The capacity to regenerate myelin in the central nervous system (CNS) diminishes with age. This decline is particularly evident in multiple sclerosis (MS), which has been suggested to exhibit features of accelerated biological aging. Whether cellular senescence, a hallmark of aging, contributes to remyelination impairment remains unknown. Here, we show that senescent cells (SCs) accumulate within demyelinated lesions after injury, and their elimination enhances remyelination in young mice but not in aged mice. In young mice, we observed the upregulation of senescence-associated transcripts primarily in microglia after demyelination, followed by their reduction during remyelination. However, in aged mice, senescence-associated factors persisted within lesions, correlating with inefficient remyelination. Pharmacological reduction of SCs enhanced remyelination in young mice but was ineffective in aged mice. Proteomic analysis of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) revealed elevated levels of CCL11/Eotaxin-1 in lesions, which was found to inhibit efficient oligodendrocyte maturation. These results suggest therapeutic targeting of SASP components, such as CCL11, may improve remyelination in aging and MS.

">Tonotopy is not preserved in a descending stage of auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies based on layer specificity suggest that ascending signals from the thalamus to sensory neocortex preserve spatially organized information, but it remains unknown whether sensory information descending from sensory neocortex to thalamus also maintains such spatial organization pattern. By focusing on projection specificity, we mapped tone response properties of two groups of cortical neurons in the primary auditory cortex (A1), based on the relationship between their specific connections to other regions and their function in ascending (thalamocortical recipient, TR neurons) or descending (corticothalamic, CT neurons) auditory information. A clear tonotopic gradient was observed among TR, but not CT neurons. Additionally, CT neurons exhibited markedly higher heterogeneity in their frequency tuning and had broader bandwidth than TR neurons. These results reveal that the information flow descending from A1 to thalamus via CT neurons does not arrange tonotopically, suggesting that the descending information flow possibly contributes to higher-order feedback processing of diverse auditory inputs.

">Testing the application of plasma glucocorticoids and their ratios as biomarkers of acute and chronic stress in rescued wild koala patients: a pilot study</a></h4>

              
                Koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) are one of the most iconic marsupial species endemic to Australia. However, their population is declining due to threats including habitat loss, disease, dog attacks, and vehicle collisions. These threats also serve as acute or chronic stressors that impact koala welfare and conservation. Cortisol is widely used as a biomarker to study stress in koalas. However, plasma cortisol concentration is less studied due to its limited ability to assess chronic stress and welfare concerns. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) are biomarkers that could potentially detect chronic stress due to their antagonising and inhibitory effects on cortisol. In this study, we used plasma cortisol and the ratio of DHEAS and DHT to cortisol to assess stress in rescued koalas (n = 10) admitted to RSPCA Queensland. Although no significant differences were found between koalas across all biomarkers and the ratios failed to detect chronic stressors, similar trends were found consistently, suggesting the potential use of the biomarkers to assess stress. Across all biomarkers, the highest medians were found in koalas with Chlamydia-related reproductive disease and oxalate nephrosis and the lowest medians were found in koalas with Chlamydia-related conjunctivitis. Higher medians were also found consistently in females (n = 3) and adult koalas. In addition, insignificant negative correlations were found across all biomarkers between age, weight, and body conditioning scores, except for the positive correlation between weight and cortisol and cortisol:DHT. Overall, the consistency of trends and the insignificant differences found across biomarkers in our study suggested that using a single biomarker to assess chronic stress is insufficient, especially for hospital-based studies limited by sample population. Thus, this pilot study provides first step towards developing a koala-specific allostatic load index based on multiple stress biomarkers to understand chronic stress in rescued koalas.

">Diffusion model-based image generation from rat brain activity</a></h4>

              
                Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology has gained recognition in various fields, including clinical applications, assistive technology, and human-computer interaction research. BCI enables communication, control, and monitoring of the affective/cognitive states of users. Recently, BCI has also found applications in the artistic field, enabling real-time art composition using brain activity signals, and engaging performers, spectators, or an entire audience with brain activity-based artistic environments. Existing techniques use specific features of brain activity, such as the P300 wave and SSVEPs, to control drawing tools, rather than directly reflecting brain activity in the output image. In this study, we present a novel approach that uses a latent diffusion model, a type of deep neural network, to generate images directly from continuous brain activity. We demonstrate this technology using local field potentials from the neocortex of freely moving rats. This system continuously converted the recorded brain activity into images. Our end-to-end method for generating images from brain activity opens up new possibilities for creative expression and experimentation.

">CRASH2p: Closed-loop Two Photon Imaging in Freely Moving Animals</a></h4>

              
                Direct measurement of neural activity in freely moving animals is essential for understanding how the brain controls and represents behaviors. Genetically encoded calcium indicators report neural activity as changes in fluorescence intensity, but brain motion confounds quantitative measurement of fluorescence. Translation, rotation, and deformation of the brain and the movements of intervening scattering or auto-fluorescent tissue all alter the amount of fluorescent light captured by a microscope. Compared to single-photon approaches, two photon microscopy is less sensitive to scattering and off-target fluorescence, but more sensitive to motion, and two photon imaging has always required anchoring the microscope to the brain. We developed a closed-loop resonant axial-scanning high-speed two photon (CRASH2p) microscope for real-time 3D motion correction in unrestrained animals, without implantation of reference markers. We complemented CRASH2p with a novel scanning strategy and a multi-stage registration pipeline. We performed volumetric ratiometrically corrected functional imaging in the CNS of freely moving Drosophila larvae and discovered previously unknown neural correlates of behavior.

">Different state-dependence of population codes across cortex</a></h4>

              
                During perceptual decision-making, behavioral performance varies with changes in internal states such as arousal, motivation, and strategy. Yet it is unknown how these internal states affect information coding across cortical regions involved in differing aspects of sensory perception and decision-making. We recorded neural activity from the primary auditory cortex (AC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) in mice performing a navigation-based sound localization task. We then modeled transitions in the behavioral strategies mice used during task performance. Mice transitioned between three latent performance states with differing decision-making strategies: an optimal state and two sub-optimal states characterized by choice bias and frequent errors. Performance states strongly influenced population activity patterns in association but not sensory cortex. Surprisingly, activity of individual PPC neurons was better explained by external inputs and behavioral variables during suboptimal behavioral performance than in the optimal performance state. Furthermore, shared variability across neurons (coupling) in PPC was strongest in the optimal state. In AC, shared variability was similarly weak across all performance states. Together, these findings indicate that neural activity in association cortex is more strongly linked to internal state than in sensory cortex.

">Partial observation can induce mechanistic mismatches in data-constrained models of neural dynamics</a></h4>

              
                One of the central goals of neuroscience is to gain a mechanistic understanding of how the dynamics of neural circuits give rise to their observed function. A popular approach towards this end is to train recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to reproduce experimental recordings of neural activity. These trained RNNs are then treated as surrogate models of biological neural circuits, whose properties can be dissected via dynamical systems analysis. How reliable are the mechanistic insights derived from this procedure? While recent advances in population-level recording technologies have allowed simultaneous recording of up to tens of thousands of neurons, this represents only a tiny fraction of most cortical circuits. Here we show that observing only a subset of neurons in a circuit can create mechanistic mismatches between a simulated teacher network and a data-constrained student, even when the two networks have matching single-unit dynamics. In particular, partial observation of models of low-dimensional cortical dynamics based on functionally feedforward or low-rank connectivity can lead to surrogate models with spurious attractor structure. Our results illustrate the challenges inherent in accurately uncovering neural mechanisms from single-trial data, and suggest the need for new methods of validating data-constrained models for neural dynamics.

">Blast Traumatic Brain Injury Induces Long-Term Alterations in Inflammatory Gene Expression in Chinchilla Brains</a></h4>

              
                Blast traumatic brain injury (bTBI) due to high-intensity impulsive noise exposure from explosions and munitions exposure is highly prevalent among military personnel, which leads to diffuse brain injury resulting in a spectrum of brain dysfunction and cognitive deficits. The resultant prolonged neuroinflammation and consequent failure of inflammation resolution is a key contributor to long-term complications, including post-traumatic stress disorder and early-onset of neurodegenerative disease; however, there is little evidence for the duration and extent of long term neuroinflammation in distinct brain regions. To investigate this, due to human-like audiogram, we use chinchillas as an in-vivo bTBI model to analyze the relative gene expression of inflammatory markers (TNF, TGF{beta}2, Gal1, HSP90, S100B, NRGN, MAPK14, IL8, NFL, and BDNF) in the hippocampus, striatum, and higher centers of the auditory pathway 90 days following varying intensities of blast exposures (144 dB, 155 dB, and 172 dB sound pressure level). Our study revealed aberrant gene expression across all analyzed brain regions and all injury conditions; however, no specific pattern emerged. Many of the inflammatory markers were downregulated, suggesting a possible attempt by the brain to overcome prior inflammation. Conversely, the hippocampus, striatum, inferior colliculus, and medial geniculate body all exhibited upregulation of inflammatory markers, including the TBI prognostic marker, S100B. Thus, chinchilla brains exhibit evidence of prolonged neuroinflammation 90 days following injury, even during mild blast exposure. Ultimately, the observed alterations in the gene expression of inflammatory markers may contribute to the long-term neurological dysfunction and neurodegenerative disease experienced by veterans and other bTBI patients.

">A cortical locus for modulation of arousal states</a></h4>

              
                Fluctuations in global arousal are key determinants of spontaneous cortical activity and function. Several subcortical structures, including neuromodulatory nuclei like the locus coeruleus (LC), are involved in the regulation of arousal. However, much less is known about the role of cortical circuits that provide top-down inputs to arousal-related subcortical structures. Here, we investigated the role of a major subdivision of the prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), in arousal modulation. Pupil size, facial movements, heart rate, and locomotion were used as non-invasive measures of arousal and behavioral state. We designed a closed loop optogenetic system based on machine vision and found that real time inhibition of ACC activity during pupil dilations suppresses ongoing arousal events. In contrast, inhibiting activity in a control cortical region had no effect on arousal. Fiber photometry recordings showed that ACC activity scales with the magnitude of spontaneously occurring pupil dilations/face movements independently of locomotion. Moreover, optogenetic ACC activation increases arousal independently of locomotion. In addition to modulating global arousal, ACC responses to salient sensory stimuli scaled with the size of evoked pupil dilations. Consistent with a role in sustaining saliency-linked arousal events, pupil responses to sensory stimuli were suppressed with ACC inactivation. Finally, our results comparing arousal-related ACC and norepinephrinergic LC neuron activity support a role for the LC in initiation of arousal events which are modulated in real time by the ACC. Collectively, our experiments identify the ACC as a key cortical site for sustaining momentary increases in arousal and provide the foundation for understanding cortical-subcortical dynamics underlying the modulation of arousal states.

">Lumped parameter simulations of cervical lymphatic vessels reveal dynamics of cerebrospinal fluid efflux from the skull</a></h4>

              
                Background: Growing evidence suggests that for rodents, a substantial fraction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drains by crossing the cribriform plate into the nasopharyngeal lymphatics, eventually reaching the cervical lymphatic vessels (CLVs). Disruption of this drainage pathway is associated with various neurological disorders. Methods: We employ a lumped parameter method to numerically model CSF drainage across the cribriform plate to CLVs. Our model uses intracranial pressure as an inlet pressure and central venous blood pressure as an outlet pressure. The model incorporates initial lymphatic vessels (modeling those in the nasal region) that absorb the CSF and collecting lymphatic vessels (modeling CLVs) to transport the CSF against an adverse pressure gradient. To determine unknown parameters such as wall stiffness and valve properties, we utilize a Monte Carlo approach and validate our simulation against recent in vivo experimental measurements. Results: Our parameter analysis reveals the physical characteristics of CLVs. Our results suggest that the stiffness of the vessel wall and the closing state of the valve are crucial for maintaining the vessel size and volume flow rate observed in vivo. Furthermore, we find that a decreased contraction amplitude and frequency leads to a reduction in volume flow rate. Additionally, we provide evidence that branching of initial lymphatic vessels may deviate from Murray's law to reduce sensitivity to elevated intracranial pressure. Conclusions: This is the first numerical study of CSF drainage through CLVs. Our comprehensive parameter analysis offers guidance for future numerical modeling of CLVs. This study also provides a foundation for understanding physiology of CSF drainage, helping guide future experimental studies aimed at identifying causal mechanisms of reduction in CLV transport and potential therapeutic approaches to enhance flow.

">Deep Learning Detection of Subtle Torsional Eye Movements: Preliminary Results</a></h4>

              
                The control of torsional eye position is a key component of ocular motor function. Ocular torsion can be affected by pathologies that involve ocular motor pathways, spanning from the vestibular labyrinth of the inner ears to various regions of the brainstem and cerebellum. Timely and accurate diagnosis enables efficient interventions and management of each case which are crucial for patients with dizziness, vertical double vision, or imbalance. Such detailed evaluation of eye movements may not be possible in all frontline clinical settings, particularly for detecting torsional abnormalities. These abnormalities are often more challenging to identify at the bedside compared to horizontal or vertical eye movements. To address these challenges, we used a dataset of induced torsional eye movements recorded with video-oculography (VOG) to develop video-based deep learning models for detecting ocular torsion. Our models achieve 0.9308 AUROC and 86.79% accuracy, using ocular features and neurophysiology-supported phenomena.

                Activity dependent changes in neuronal connections are fundamental to learning and long-term memory storage. However, the precise contribution of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) to these modifications remains unclear. In this study, we assessed the role of the lncRNA ADEPTR, a cAMP modulated lncRNA localized in dendrites, which is crucial for synapse morphology. By generating two different mouse models, one with a deletion of ADEPTR (LADEPTR) and one with a deletion of its protein interaction region (SADEPTR) we investigated the sex specific impacts of ADEPTR loss of function on learning, memory, dendritic arborization, and synapse morphology. Our behavioral analyses revealed a reduction in anxiety in adult male mice, while learning and memory remained unaffected in both models. Systematic evaluations of neuronal morphology across various developmental stages (~3 day old postnatal neuronal cultures and postnatal 14 and 42 day old male and female mice) uncovered substantial deficits in neuronal architecture in both S and L ADEPTR male and female neuronal cultures. At postnatal day 42, in contrast to their male counterparts, L ADEPTR female mice exhibited a significant deficiency in thin spines. Additionally, we found that the expression of plasticity related gene BDNF, and immediate early gene cFOS were enhanced in both the cortex and hippocampus of adult male and female S and L ADEPTR mice, suggesting the activation of a compensatory mechanism protecting against learning and memory deficits. Collectively, these observations underscore the sex specific role of lncRNA ADEPTR in shaping neuronal morphology and anxiety behavior.

                The ability to accurately perceive one's own bodily signals, such as the heartbeat, plays a vital role in physical and mental health. However, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying this ability, termed interoception, are not fully understood. Converging evidence suggests that cardiac rhythms are linked to frontal brain activity, particularly oscillations in the delta (0.5 - 4 Hz) band, but their causal relationship remained elusive. Using amplitude-modulated transcranial alternating current stimulation (AM-tACS), a method to enhance or suppress brain oscillations in a phase-specific manner, we investigated whether frontal delta oscillations are causally linked to heartbeat perception. We found that enhancement of delta phase synchrony suppressed heartbeat detection accuracy, while suppression of delta phase synchrony enhanced heartbeat detection accuracy. These findings suggest that frontal delta oscillations play a critical role in heartbeat perception, paving the way for causal investigations of interoception and potential clinical applications.

                Introduction: There is a lack of research in the existing literature when it comes to analyzing the dynamics of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to understand the underlying mechanisms of isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD). This study aims to contribute to our understanding of abnormalities in brain network dynamics in iRBD and their association with alpha-synucleinopathy. Additionally, I employed graph theoretical metrics to obtain a topological insight into the brain network of iRBD. Methods: Resting-state fMRI data from 55 iRBD patients and 97 healthy controls (HCs) were utilized. A sliding window approach, functional connectivity analysis, and graph theory analysis were applied to the data. I calculated the mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis of the time series for both dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) and four graph metrics (clustering coefficient, global efficiency, assortativity coefficients, and eigenvector centrality). Subsequently, I compared the those metrices between iRBDs and HCs. Relationships between clinical scales and abnormal dFC were assessed using a general linear model. Results: iRBD patients exhibited abnormal mean dFC, particularly in the default mode network, sensorimotor network, basal ganglia network, and cerebellum. Kurtosis of dFC revealed abnormalities between the middle temporal gyrus and cerebellum. Group differences were also observed in the mean eigenvector centrality of the precentral gyrus and thalamus. Conclusion: The mean of dFC identified impairments putatively in movement functions and various compensatory mechanisms. Moreover, mean eigenvector centrality revealed topological changes in motor-related network in iRBDs. The use of kurtosis as a potential index for extracting dynamic information may provide additional insights into pathophysiology in iRBDs.

">Deep learning and eye-tracking for accurate EOG rejection</a></h4>

              
                Electroencephalography (EEG) is a neuroimaging technique used to record the electrical activity generated by the brain. EEG recordings are often contaminated by various artifacts, notably those caused by eye movements and blinks (EOG artifacts). Independent component analysis (ICA) is commonly applied to isolate EOG artifacts and subtract the corresponding independent components from the EEG signals. However, ICA is an unsupervised technique that contains no knowl- edge of the eye movements during the task or the generative process by which these movements result in EOG artifacts. It is generally difficult to assess whether subtracting EOG components estimated through ICA removes some neurogenic activity. To address this limitation, we developed a deep learning model for EOG artifact removal that exploits information about eye movements available through eye-tracking. We leveraged the Large Grid task from the open-source EEGEyeNet dataset to develop and validate this approach. In this task, 30 participants looked at a series of dots appearing at 25 predetermined positions on the screen (810 trials/participant). EEG and eye-tracking were collected simultaneously. In this paper, we show that we can train a long short-term memory (LSTM) model to predict the component of EEG signals predictable from eye-tracking data. We further used this eye-tracking-informed evaluation of EOG artifacts to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of ICA, currently the dominant approach for EOG artifact correction. Our analysis indicates that although ICA is very sensitive to EOG, it has a comparatively low specificity.

">Complimentary vertebrate Wac models exhibit phenotypes relevant to DeSanto-Shinawi Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Monogenic syndromes are associated with neurodevelopmental changes that result in cognitive impairments, neurobehavioral phenotypes including autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and seizures. Limited studies and resources are available to make meaningful headway into the underlying molecular mechanisms that result in these symptoms. One such example is DeSanto-Shinawi Syndrome (DESSH), a rare disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the WAC gene. Individuals with DESSH syndrome exhibit a recognizable craniofacial gestalt, developmental delay/intellectual disability, neurobehavioral symptoms that include autism, ADHD, behavioral difficulties and seizures. However, no thorough studies from a vertebrate model exist to understand how these changes occur. To overcome this, we developed both murine and zebrafish Wac/wac deletion mutants and studied whether their phenotypes recapitulate those described in individuals with DESSH syndrome. We show that the two Wac models exhibit craniofacial and behavioral changes, reminiscent of abnormalities found in DESSH syndrome. In addition, each model revealed impacts to GABAergic neurons and further studies showed that the mouse mutants are susceptible to seizures, changes in brain volumes that are different between sexes and relevant behaviors. Finally, we uncovered transcriptional impacts of Wac loss of function that will pave the way for future molecular studies into DESSH. These studies begin to uncover some biological underpinnings of DESSH syndrome and elucidate the biology of Wac, with advantages in each model.

	<p>Depression is the most common mental disorder worldwide. Both antidepressants and psychotherapy are effective in treating depression, but the response to these treatments is often incomplete. Yoga-based interventions (YBIs) have been advocated by some researchers as a promising form of alternative treatment for depression. Recent research has attempted to identify the biological mechanisms associated with the antidepressant actions of YBIs. In this scoping review, conducted according to the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, the PubMed and Scopus databases were searched to retrieve research on biomarkers of response to YBIs in patients with depression. These studies were also critically reviewed to evaluate their methodological quality and any sources of bias. Nineteen studies were included in the review. Based on these studies, there is preliminary evidence that YBIs may be associated with increased serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and reduced serum cortisol and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in patients with depression. However, many of these changes were also observed in the control arms, and the overall quality of the research was low. At present, it cannot be concluded that there are reliable biomarkers of response to YBIs in depression, though there are some potential biological correlates. Further advances in this field will depend critically on improvements in study design, particularly the minimization of sources of bias and the selection of more specific and sensitive biomarkers based on existing evidence from other treatment modalities.</p>

	<p>Over the past twenty years, scientific research on body representations has grown significantly, with Body Memory (BM) emerging as a prominent area of interest in neurorehabilitation. Compared to other body representations, BM stands out as one of the most obscure due to the multifaceted nature of the concept of &amp;amp;ldquo;memory&amp;amp;rdquo; itself, which includes various aspects (such as implicit vs. explicit, conscious vs. unconscious). The concept of body memory originates from the field of phenomenology and has been developed by research groups studying embodied cognition. In this narrative review, we aim to present compelling evidence from recent studies that explore various definitions and explanatory models of BM. Additionally, we will provide a comprehensive overview of the empirical settings used to examine BM. The results can be categorized into two main areas: (i) how the body influences our memories, and (ii) how memories, in their broadest sense, could generate and/or influence metarepresentations&amp;amp;mdash;the ability to reflect on or make inferences about one&amp;amp;rsquo;s own cognitive representations or those of others. We present studies that emphasize the significance of BM in experimental settings involving patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders, ultimately analyzing these findings from an ontogenic perspective.</p>

                <p>Seizures are generally associated with epilepsy but may also be a symptom of many other neurological conditions. A hallmark of a seizure is the intensity of the local neuronal activation, which can drive large-scale gene transcription changes. Such changes in the transcriptional profile likely alter neuronal function, thereby contributing to the pathological process. Therefore, there is a strong clinical imperative to characterize how gene expression is changed by seizure activity. To this end, we developed a simplified ex vivo technique for studying seizure-induced transcriptional changes. We compared the RNA sequencing profile in mouse neocortical tissue with up to 3&nbsp;h of epileptiform activity induced by 4-aminopyridine (4AP) relative to control brain slices not exposed to the drug. We identified over 100 genes with significantly altered expression after 4AP treatment, including multiple genes involved in MAPK, TNF, and neuroinflammatory signaling pathways, all of which have been linked to epilepsy previously. Notably, the patterns in male and female brain slices were almost identical. Various immediate early genes were among those showing the largest upregulation. The set of down-regulated genes included ones that might be expected either to increase or to decrease neuronal excitability. In summary, we found the seizure-induced transcriptional profile complex, but the changes aligned well with an analysis of published epilepsy-associated genes. We discuss how simple models may provide new angles for investigating seizure-induced transcriptional changes.</p>

                <p>High-density linear probes, such as Neuropixels, provide an unprecedented opportunity to understand how neural populations within specific laminar compartments contribute to behavior. Marmoset monkeys, unlike macaque monkeys, have a lissencephalic (smooth) cortex that enables recording perpendicular to the cortical surface, thus making them an ideal animal model for studying laminar computations. Here we present a method for acute Neuropixels recordings in the common marmoset (<I>Callithrix jacchus</I>). The approach replaces the native dura with an artificial silicon-based dura that grants visual access to the cortical surface, which is helpful in avoiding blood vessels, ensures perpendicular penetrations, and could be used in conjunction with optical imaging or optogenetic techniques. The chamber housing the artificial dura is simple to maintain with minimal risk of infection and could be combined with semichronic microdrives and wireless recording hardware. This technique enables repeated acute penetrations over a period of several months. With occasional removal of tissue growth on the pial surface, recordings can be performed for a year or more. The approach is fully compatible with Neuropixels probes, enabling the recording of hundreds of single neurons distributed throughout the cortical column.</p>

                <p>by Samuel H. Church, Jasmine L. Mah, Casey W. Dunn</p>

Comparisons of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data across species can reveal links between cellular gene expression and the evolution of cell functions, features, and phenotypes. These comparisons evoke evolutionary histories, as depicted by phylogenetic trees, that define relationships between species, genes, and cells. This Essay considers each of these in turn, laying out challenges and solutions derived from a phylogenetic comparative approach and relating these solutions to previously proposed methods for the pairwise alignment of cellular dimensional maps. This Essay contends that species trees, gene trees, cell phylogenies, and cell lineages can all be reconciled as descriptions of the same concept—the tree of cellular life. By integrating phylogenetic approaches into scRNA-seq analyses, challenges for building informed comparisons across species can be overcome, and hypotheses about gene and cell evolution can be robustly tested.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002519">Male allocation to ejaculation and mating effort imposes different life history trade-offs</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Meng-Han Joseph Chung, Rebecca J. Fox, Michael D. Jennions</p>

When males compete, sexual selection favors reproductive traits that increase their mating or fertilization success (pre- and postcopulatory sexual selection). It is assumed that males face a trade-off between these 2 types of sexual traits because they both draw from the same pool of resources. Consequently, allocation into mate acquisition or ejaculation should create similar trade-offs with other key life history traits. Tests of these assumptions are exceedingly rare. Males only ejaculate after they mate, and the costs of ejaculation are therefore highly confounded with those of mating effort. Consequently, little is known about how each component of reproductive allocation affects a male’s future performance. Here, we ran an experiment using a novel technique to distinguish the life history costs of mating effort and ejaculation for mosquitofish (<i>Gambusia holbrooki</i>). We compared manipulated males (mate without ejaculation), control males (mate and ejaculate), and naïve males (neither mate nor ejaculate) continuously housed with a female and 2 rival males. We assessed their growth, somatic maintenance, mating and fighting behavior, and sperm traits after 8 and 16 weeks. Past mating effort significantly lowered a male’s future mating effort and growth, but not his sperm production, while past sperm release significantly lowered a male’s future ejaculate quantity, but not his mating effort. Immune response was the only trait impacted by both past mating effort and past ejaculation. These findings challenge the assumption that male reproductive allocation draws from a common pool of resources to generate similar life history costs later in life. Instead, we provide clear evidence that allocation into traits under pre- and postcopulatory sexual selection have different trait-specific effects on subsequent male reproductive performance.

                Background The application of disinfectants on dental instruments is one way to prevent cross-infection. Cross infection can occur due to microorganisms found in blood, saliva and dental plaque which can contaminate the instruments used by dental health workers. Thus, indirect contact transmission of pathogenic microorganisms occurs from instruments that have been contaminated by dental health workers. Ozone water and 4.8% chloroxylenol are disinfecting agents used to disinfect medical instruments. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of disinfection of ozone water and 4.8% chloroxylenol in reducing the number of bacterial colonies on dental extraction instruments at the USU Dental and Oral Hospital between October-December 2022. Methods The samples used were mandibular molar pliers that have been used in tooth extraction procedures. This study was experimental and used three sample groups, where each group consisted of 10 tooth extraction instruments. The treatment group used ozone water and 4.8% chloroxylenol and the negative control group was cleaned with distilled water. The test effectiveness in this study used bacteria colony counter using the scatter cup method. Data were analyzed using the Kruskal Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests. Results The results of the data analysis showed a p-value ≤0.001, which means that there was a significant difference in the disinfection using ozone water and 4.8% chloroxylenol on the number of bacterial colonies on dental extraction instruments. The results of this study show that the average number of bacterial colonies formed in the ozone water treatment group was 4.00 ± 4.32, 16.00 ± 6.65 in the 4.8% chloroxylenol treatment group, and 217.50 ± 39.24 in the negative control group (Aquadest). Conclusions From this study it can be said that ozone water is more effective in disinfecting dental extraction instruments than 4.8% chloroxylenol.

                Background: Home-based rehabilitation exercise following Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) shows similar outcomes compared to supervised outpatient rehabilitation exercise. Little is known about patients’ experiences with home-based rehabilitation, and this study aimed to investigate patient-perceived facilitators and barriers to home-based rehabilitation exercise and general physical activity after THA. Methods: Semi-structured interviews of qualitative design were conducted with 22 patients who had undergone THA and who had performed home-based rehabilitation exercise. The study took place in a regional hospital in Denmark between January 2018 and May 2019. Data was analyzed using an interpretive thematic analysis approach, with theoretical underpinning from the concept ‘conduct of everyday life’. The study is embedded within the Pragmatic Home-Based Exercise Therapy after Total Hip Arthroplasty-Silkeborg trial (PHETHAS-1), which aims to quantitatively investigate recovery outcomes after a home-based rehabilitation exercise program. Results: The main theme, ‘wishing to return to the well-known everyday life’, and the subtheme ‘general physical activity versus rehabilitation exercise’ were identified. Generally, participants found the home-based rehabilitation exercise boring but were motivated by the goal of returning to their habitual conduct of everyday life and performing their usual general physical activities. Participants enrolled in the PHETHAS-1 study used the enrollment as part of their motivation for doing the exercises.  Both pain and the absence of pain were identified as barriers for doing home-based rehabilitation exercise. Pain could cause insecurity about possible medical complications, while the absence of pain could lead to the rehabilitation exercise being perceived as pointless. Conclusions: The overall goal for the THA patients was to return to their habitual everyday life. This goal served as a facilitator for undertaking home-based rehabilitation exercise. Being able to perform usual activities paradoxically became a barrier for some participants, as they were more motivated to engage in general physical activity than the rehabilitation exercise.

                Background Periodontal regeneration therapies frequently involve autologous platelet concentrates (APCs). They can be used in sinus lift surgeries and socket preservation, among other clinical settings. Platelet rich fibrin (PRF) membrane has been used to treat gingival recession in individuals or groups of individuals using a coronally progressed or lateral pedicle flap. In the treatment of mixed periodontic endodontic lesion/furcation defect, PRF functions as a healing and interpositional biomaterial, filling a cystic cavity. PRF is known to help the bone regeneration process. In the last few years, efforts have been made to enhance the PRFs characteristics and quality. One of them is titanium platelet rich fibrin (T-PRF). Third-generation platelet concentrate no longer contains silica, and its preparation in glass vacuum containers, that no longer creates any known concerns. The effectiveness PRF’s has been evaluated in connective tissue and bone repair. The aim of this study is to compare T-PRF to other platelet concentrates and different treatment modalities for periodontal regenerative procedures. Methods A protocol of this systematic review have been registered in prospero (CRD42022293545). The online database searched were PUBMED, COCHRANE for published articles up to November 2022 without language restrictions. Studies in trial registers, handsearching, bibliographic references of relevant articles were also checked. Data collection and analysis was done by individual authors. Independent eligibility assessments were conducted by four review authors. Then, using the standard Cochrane methodology, four review authors extracted the data and evaluated the risk of bias for individual studies. We developed “Summary of findings” tables and used GRADE to evaluate the evidence. Results Three studies were included for meta-analysis. Results of meta-analysis supported that T-PRF is effective for correction of both hard and soft tissue defects. Conclusions The overall qualitative and quantitative analysis suggest that T-PRF has superior structural properties and thicker fibrin network for ensuring predictable success periodontal regenerative procedures.

                This meta-analysis is an investigation into anomalous perception (i.e., conscious identification of information without any conventional sensorial means). The technique used for eliciting an effect is the Ganzfeld condition (a form of sensory homogenization that eliminates distracting peripheral noise). The database consists of studies published between January 1974 and December 2020 inclusive. The overall effect size estimated both with a frequentist and a Bayesian random-effect model, were in close agreement yielding an effect size of approximately .08 (.04 -.12). This result passed four publication bias tests and seems not contaminated by questionable research practices. Trend analysis carried out with a cumulative meta-analysis and a meta-regression model with year of publication as a covariate, did not indicate sign of decline of this effect size. The moderators’ analyses show that the selected participants’ effect size was almost three-times that obtained by non-selected participants and that tasks that simulate telepathic communication show a two-fold effect size for tasks requiring the participants to guess a target.

                Background Neonatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome (NRDS) remains a significant challenge in neonatal care, often leading to respiratory compromise and neuromuscular dysfunction. While advances in medical management have improved outcomes, adjunctive therapies such as physical rehabilitation offer potential benefits yet require further investigation. This protocol outlines a randomized controlled trial aiming to evaluate the effect of Physical Rehabilitation using Oro Motor Stimulation, Manual Airway Clearance Technique, Positioning, Tactile, and Kinesthetic Stimulation (PROMPT) protocol on respiratory and neuromuscular function in neonates with NRDS. Methods The trial will include 38 neonates diagnosed with NRDS, randomly allocated into two groups: the intervention group receiving the PROMPT protocol alongside standard care, and the control group receiving standard care alone. The PROMPT protocol comprises a comprehensive approach targeting oromotor stimulation, manual airway clearance technique, optimal positioning, and tactile/kinesthetic stimulation. Outcome measures Primary outcomes will focus on respiratory parameters such as oxygenation index, ventilatory support requirements, and neuromuscular function assessed through muscle tone and reflexes. Secondary outcomes will encompass length of hospital stay, incidence of complications, and neurodevelopmental outcomes at follow-up. Results Data analysis will employ appropriate statistical methods to compare outcomes between the intervention and control groups, with adjustments for potential confounders. Ethical approval has been obtained, and informed consent will be obtained from parents or legal guardians before enrolment. Conclusion This trial protocol aims to provide valuable insights into the efficacy and safety of the PROMPT protocol as a rehabilitative intervention for NRDS. The findings may inform future clinical practice and contribute to optimizing care strategies for neonates with NRDS, ultimately improving their short- and long-term outcomes.

                Background Fatty liver, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease are just a few of the well-known cardiometabolic complications associated with childhood obesity. Microalbuminuria (MA) is a sign of early kidney impairment, as seen in adults, and recent research supports its presence in children with obesity as well as its potential relationship with cardiometabolic variables. Both adults and children share this well-established pathophysiological theory. Indicated a close connection with the main aspect of fatness, such as IR, through the renal hemodynamic effects of insulin. More scientific consideration must be given to the assessment of primary kidney injury in obese children, given the pathological and prognostic implications of this association in everyday practise (counting an elevated danger of developing long term renal disorder over time). Method case-control study is going to be conducted among the patients of AVBRH hospital. A total of thirty participants with fifteen obese and fifteen non obeses controls were included in this study. Result The expected result of the study can determine the correlation between obesity and microalbuminuria, The value of microalbuminuria is high in obese patients as compared to nonobese patients. Conclusion The risk of problems in obese patients can be predicted using microalbuminuria, which can help lower the overall morbidity and mortality associated with renal function.

                Background Over the past few decades, WHO has made massive efforts to promote the development of a vaccine against Lassa virus (LASV), one of the top ten priority pathogens for research and development under the WHO R&D Blueprint for Emerging Infections. To date, several vaccines are at different stages of development. In this scenario, a validated and standardised assay to measure LSV neutralising antibodies is urgently needed for vaccine development and comparison. Methods The neutralisation assay remains the gold standard for determining antibody efficacy. Here we have proposed a safe and validated pseudotyped neutralisation assay for LASV, taking advantage of the development of the first WHO International Standard and Reference Panel for Anti-Lassa Fever (NIBSC code 21/332). Results and Conclusions The proposed results demonstrate that the pseudotyped luciferase neutralisation assay is a specific serological test for the measurement of LASV neutralising antibodies without cross-reacting with standard sera specific for heterologous viral infections. In addition, the assay is accurate, precise, and linear according to criteria and statistical analyses defined and accepted by international guidelines.

                Background RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a widely used technique in many scientific studies. Given the plethora of models and software packages that have been developed for processing and analyzing RNA-seq datasets, choosing the most appropriate ones is a time-consuming process that requires an in-depth understanding of the data, as well as of the principles and parameters of each tool. In addition, packages designed for individual tasks are developed in different programming languages and have dependencies of various degrees of complexity, which renders their installation and execution challenging for users with limited computational expertise. Workflow languages and execution engines with support for virtualization and encapsulation options such as containers and Conda environments facilitate these tasks considerably. The resulting computational workflows can then be reliably shared with the scientific community, enhancing reusability and the reproducibility of results as individual analysis steps are becoming more transparent and portable. Methods Here we present ZARP, a general purpose RNA-seq analysis workflow that builds on state-of-the-art software in the field to facilitate the analysis of RNA-seq datasets. ZARP is developed in the Snakemake workflow language and can run locally or in a cluster environment, generating extensive reports not only of the data but also of the options utilized. It is built using modern technologies with the ultimate goal to reduce the hands-on time for bioinformaticians and non-expert users and serve as a template for future workflow development. To this end, we also provide ZARP-cli, a dedicated command-line interface that may make running ZARP on an RNA-seq library of interest as easy as executing a single two-word command. Conclusions ZARP is a powerful RNA-seq analysis workflow that is easy to use even for beginners, built using best software development practices, available under a permissive Open Source license and open to contributions by the scientific community.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23611?af=R">The translational inhibitor and amnestic agent emetine also suppresses ongoing hippocampal neural activity similarly to other blockers of protein synthesis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The consolidation of memory is thought to ultimately depend on the synthesis of new proteins, since translational inhibitors such as anisomycin and cycloheximide adversely affect the permanence of long-term memory. However, when applied directly in brain, these agents also profoundly suppress neural activity to an extent that is directly correlated to the degree of protein synthesis inhibition caused. Given that neural activity itself is likely to help mediate consolidation, this finding is a serious criticism of the strict de novo protein hypothesis of memory. Here, we test the neurophysiological effects of another translational inhibitor, emetine. Unilateral intra-hippocampal infusion of emetine suppressed ongoing local field and multiunit activity at ipsilateral sites as compared to the contralateral hippocampus in a fashion that was positively correlated to the degree of protein synthesis inhibition as confirmed by autoradiography. This suppression of activity was also specific to the circumscribed brain region in which protein synthesis inhibition took place. These experiments provide further evidence that ongoing protein synthesis is necessary and fundamental for neural function and suggest that the disruption of memory observed in behavioral experiments using translational inhibitors may be due, in large part, to neural suppression.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-532/v1?src=rss">Case Report: Surgical management of petrous face meningioma [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Petrous face meningioma presents a significant difficulty in neurosurgery because of its complex anatomical position near cranial nerves, brainstem, and important blood vessels. This case report describes the clinical course and successful surgical treatment of a 50-year-old female patient who had a two-month history of ataxia, along with a one-week episode of severe headache and vomiting. An MRI verified the existence of a petrous face meningioma after a thorough diagnostic assessment. Following that, the patient had a left retro-sigmoid craniotomy, which led to the complete excision of the tumour and relief of symptoms. A thorough one-month follow-up examination showed no recurring symptoms, suggesting a positive result and successful clearance of the meningioma. This case highlights the need of timely diagnosis and surgical treatment in dealing with petrous face meningioma, focusing on attaining complete tumour excision. This case demonstrates the success of complete removal of a tumour and the possibility of full return of neurological function in individuals with similar symptoms. This article enhances the current literature by offering insights into the management of petrous face meningioma and recommending a thorough surgical strategy to improve patient outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-531/v1?src=rss">Bibliometric Analysis of Islamic Crowdfunding: A Literature Review of Its Journey [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The potential of Islamic crowdfunding to encourage the development of Islamic fintech globally, even in countries with non-Muslim majority populations, needs to be examined in a literature study on this issue. More extensive research is needed regarding the factors that most reliably predict the success of Islamic crowdfunding, such as compliance with Islamic crowdfunding laws, sustainability, and the potential of Islamic finance. This article describes a comprehensive and systematic Literature Review (SLR) regarding papers published in the field of Islamic crowdfunding. This research aims to contribute to a better understanding of Islamic crowdfunding, provide useful information for practitioners, and stimulate further research in the field to increase the success of Islamic crowdfunding. Methods We conducted a review of selected papers to identify gaps and significant issues in Islamic crowdfunding, providing guidance for future researchers. This article review was based on 704 articles retrieved using the keyword “Islamic crowdfunding” from the Scopus database between 2013 and 2022. To minimize bias, we formulated 5 research questions to guide our analysis: RQ1: How do publication and citation rates vary annually? RQ2: How can we determine the most influential studies based on citation counts for each keyword? RQ3: What are the most common subject areas addressed in Islamic crowdfunding literature from 2013 to 2022? RQ4: What are the most frequently used keywords in Scopus documents? RQ5: How are Islamic values discussed in articles related to Islamic crowdfunding? Results The findings of this research demonstrate that Islamic crowdfunding, characterized by interdisciplinary scholarship, has emerged as an increasingly significant alternative for aiding society and the economy. It contributes to poverty alleviation and the development of specific sectors through channels such as crowdfunding for small and medium enterprises and social projects tailored to meet the diverse needs of Muslims. However, the challenge facing the future development of Sharia crowdfunding is that, despite its benefit of increasing community participation in projects aligned with religious values, it also carries the potential risk of investment losses and non-compliance with Sharia principles. Ways to address the current scarcity of Sharia fintech are also needed, ensuring its broader acceptance across all societal levels, and enhancing Muslims’ understanding of compliance with Islamic religious rules, particularly Fiqh law. Conclusion Urgently needed are specific fiqh regulatory guidelines to ensure that Sharia-compliant crowdfunding adheres to Islamic principles. Government support, particularly through legislation in countries where the majority of the population is Muslim, is crucial to enhance public participation and trust in Sharia crowdfunding.

                Background Malnourished pregnant women are at increased risk of micronutrient deficiency. We assessed the vitamin B12 status in both malnourished and normally nourished pregnant women and their neonates. Additionally, we studied the association between maternal B12 levels, cord B12 levels and neonatal anthropometry. Methods This cross-sectional study enrolled 63 malnourished and 63 normally nourished mothers and neonates. Maternal and cord blood samples were collected at the time of delivery for estimation of vitamin B12 levels. Maternal and cord vitamin B12 levels were compared using the Mann–Whitney U test. Neonatal anthropometry was correlated with maternal and cord B12 levels using Spearman’s correlation. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 25. Results Mean maternal age was 26.58 yrs. The median cord B12 levels were lower than the maternal B12 levels. Maternal B12 levels showed a strong positive correlation with cord B12 levels (rho = 0.879; p < 0.001). Maternal (p < 0.001) and cord (p < 0.001) vitamin B12 levels were significantly lower in the malnourished group than in the normally nourished group. In malnourished group, 66.8% mothers and 95.2% neonates were Vitamin B12 deficient, whereas 1.5% mothers and 4.7% neonates were vitamin B12 deficient in normally nourished group. In the malnourished group, maternal B12 levels were positively correlated with birth weight (rho 0.363, p = 0.003) and length (rho 0.330, p =0.008), whereas cord B12 levels were positively correlated with birth weight in the normally nourished group. (rho 0.277 p= 0.028) Conclusion High rates of vitamin B12 deficiency were observed in malnourished mothers and neonates. There was a positive correlation between birth weight, length, and maternal vitamin B12 levels in malnourished mothers. These findings emphasize the need to address maternal malnutrition and vitamin B12 deficiency to improve neonatal health.

                A majority of humans maintain normal function despite exposure to severe stress. Work in rodents reveals that such stress resilience is mediated largely by the induction of molecular, cellular, and circuit adaptations that actively drive resilience. Such discoveries are guiding the development of novel treatments for human stress disorders.

Dan et al. combine anatomy, physiology, perturbation, and behavior to show how genetically specified circuit architectures with localized plasticity couple multiple evolving internal representations to make this learning fast yet flexible.

Hormone-responsive neurons in the base of the fly brain enhance the gain of ascending input pathways that transduce punishing shock and bitter taste to dopaminergic neurons that write aversive memories.

                Bardan Sarmiento et al. demonstrate in C. elegans that heat shock protein HSP-90 levels are lowered by CUL-6 ubiquitin ligase function in the intestine, which promotes thermotolerance. These degradative effects are mediated by the lysosome, and heat shock exposure directs HSP-90 to lysosomes and lysosome-related organelles, in a CUL-6-dependent manner.

Inhibition of USP8 by a small-molecule inhibitor is a promising strategy for alleviating cGAS-mediated autoimmune diseases.

                During aging, neuromuscular synaptic connections between muscles and neurons degenerate and motor ability diminishes. Banerjee et al. show in Drosophila that Trio protein, which can regulate synaptic structures, declines during aging. Increasing Trio levels maintains motor synapse integrity and postpones the weakening of motor ability as animals age.

                Chini et al. show that the distribution shape of single-unit-related parameters is largely stable across the early development of cortical circuits. Using computational modeling, they predict that synaptic parameters have similar dynamics. Thus, they conclude that this aspect of cortical organization is preconfigured and experience independent.

	<p>Adults and infants form abstract categories of visual objects, but little is known about the development of global categorization. This study aims to characterize the development of very fast global categorization (living and non-living objects) and to determine whether and how low-level stimulus characteristics contribute to this response. Frequency tagging was used to characterize the development of global-level categorization in N = 69 infants (4, 7, 11 months), N = 22 children (5&amp;amp;ndash;6 years old), and N = 20 young adults. Images were presented in an oddball paradigm, with a category change at every fifth position (AAAABAAAABA&amp;amp;hellip;). Strong and significant high-level categorization was observed in all age groups, with reduced responses for phase-scrambled control sequences (R2 = 0.34&amp;amp;ndash;0.73). No differences between the categorization of living and non-living targets were observed. These data demonstrate high-level visual categorization as living and non-living from four months to adulthood, providing converging evidence that humans are highly sensitive to broad categorical information from infancy onward.</p>

	<p>Childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) represents a significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenge within the field of clinical neuropsychology, characterized by its nuanced presentation and multifactorial nature. The aim of this study was to distil and synthesize the broad spectrum of research into a coherent model for the assessment and diagnosis of CAS. Through a mixed-method design, the quantitative phase analyzed 290 studies, unveiling 10 clusters: developmental apraxia, tabby talk, intellectual disabilities, underlying speech processes, breakpoint localization, speech characteristics, functional characteristics, clinical practice, and treatment outcome. The qualitative phase conducted a thematic analysis on the most cited and recent literature, identifying 10 categories: neurobiological markers, speech motor control, perceptual speech features, auditory processing, prosody and stress patterns, parent- and self-report measures, intervention response, motor learning and generalization, comorbidity analysis, and cultural and linguistic considerations. Integrating these findings, a descriptive and prescriptive model was developed, encapsulating the complexities of CAS and providing a structured approach for clinicians. This model advances the understanding of CAS and supports the development of targeted interventions. This study concludes with a call for evidence-based personalized treatment plans that account for the diverse neurobiological and cultural backgrounds of children with CAS. Its implications for practice include the integration of cutting-edge assessment tools that embrace the heterogeneity of CAS presentations, ensuring that interventions are as unique as the children they aim to support.</p>

	<p>A growing body of literature suggests a link between bowel syndromes (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease), gut microbiome alterations, and psychiatric disorders. This narrative review aims to explore the potential role of the gut microbiome in the pathogenesis and clinical presentation of obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive disorder (OCD) and to explore whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant considering gastrointestinal symptoms and their implication for the gut microbiome during the assessment and treatment of OCD. For this purpose, a PubMed search of studies focusing on OCD, gut microbiota, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease was conducted by two independent reviewers. While the current literature on gut microbiome and gastrointestinal issues in OCD remains limited, emerging evidence suggests gut microbiome alterations and high rates of bowel syndromes in this population. These findings emphasize the importance of incorporating comprehensive gastrointestinal assessments into the &amp;amp;ldquo;global assessment of OCD&amp;amp;rdquo;. Such assessment should encompass various factors, including gastrointestinal physical comorbidities and symptoms, nutritional habits, bowel habits, fluid intake, exercise patterns, and potential microbiome dysfunctions and inflammation. Considering the treatment implications, interventions targeting gut health, such as probiotics and dietary modifications, may hold promise in improving symptoms in OCD patients with comorbid gastrointestinal problems. Further research in this area is warranted to better understand the interplay between gut health and OCD and to explore the effectiveness of targeted interventions in improving clinical outcomes.</p>

	<p>In this study, to discuss the influence of concussion risk from the long-term use of American football helmets on collegiate teams, accident cases during the game are replicated based on game videos by simulations using whole-body numerical models and helmeted finite element human head models. The concussion risks caused by collisions were estimated using the mechanical parameters inside the skull obtained from finite element analyses. In the analyses, the different material properties of helmets identified by free-fall experiments using headform impactor-embedded helmets were used to represent brand-new and long-term-use helmets. After analyzing the five cases, it was observed that wearing a new helmet instead of a long-term-use one resulted in a reduction in the risk of concussion by 1 to 44%. More energy is attenuated by the deformation of the liners of the brand-new helmet, so the energy transferred to the head is smaller than that when wearing the long-term-use helmet. Thus, the long-term use of the helmet reduces its ability to protect the head.</p>

	<p>In the present study, we aimed to investigate the neural dynamics of interference control using event-related potentials (ERPs) to reveal time course of interference control from the beginning to the end of young adulthood. Three groups of participants aged 19&amp;amp;ndash;21, 23&amp;amp;ndash;27 and 28&amp;amp;ndash;44 performed a Stroop task. The results revealed age differences in both accuracy and ERP amplitudes during all aspects of interreference control processing that reflect selective attention (P2), conflict monitoring (N2), conflict evaluation (P3) and interference control (N450). Both younger groups made more errors on incongruent trials compared to participants in their early 30s. The presence of higher P2 and N2 amplitudes, diminished P3 and again higher N450 amplitudes in participants in their early 20s points to a shortage of available resources for top-down control at this age. These results are in accordance with structural and functional studies that show that development of the frontoparietal network, which underlies interference control, continues after adolescence. While brain mechanisms are still developing, the use of accompanying cognitive abilities is still not optimal. The findings that change in neural dynamics and related performance continues into early adulthood challenge current models of cognitive development and call for new directions in developmental theorizing.</p>

	<p>Background: People with Down syndrome (DS) are deficient in verbal memory but relatively preserved in visuospatial perception. Verbal memories are related to semantic knowledge. Receptive ability is better than expressive ability in people with DS but still seriously lags behind their age-matched controls. This lag may result in the weak semantic integration of people with DS. Aims: This study aimed to examine the ability of semantic integration of people with DS by using false-memory tasks. Possible differences in the number of false memories induced by nouns and verbs were of focus. Methods and Procedures: Two phases were involved in the false-memory task. In the study phase, ten-word lists with semantically related associates were presented. In the recognition phase, judgments were to be made about whether the words presented had been heard before. Three types of words were tested: previously presented associates, semantically related lures, and semantically unrelated new words. Outcomes and Results: People with DS overall showed the lowest accuracy among groups in response to tested word types. In the processing of lures, people with DS were worse in recognition than MA controls. In processing unrelated words, people with DS responded least accurately to all types of words compared to control groups. In the processing of associates, people with DS showed similar recognition rates as the MA controls but were less accurate than the CA controls. No difference was observed between nouns and verbs in recognizing word types among groups, though faster responses to nouns than to verbs emerged in college students. Further analyses on topic-wised comparisons of errors across syntactic categories revealed differences in specific concepts among groups, suggesting people with DS were atypical in semantic organization. Conclusions and Implications: People with DS showed mixed patterns in semantic integration by false-memory tasks with delay to associates and deviance to lures together with unrelated words. People with DS showed distinct patterns in processing nouns and verbs while conducting topic-wise comparisons, suggesting that they formed false memories differently based on distinct syntactic categories. We concluded that people with DS develop a deviant semantic structure, hence showing problems in language and social cognition. Category-based rehabilitation is suggested to be implemented for people with DS to improve their semantic knowledge through lexical connections.</p>

	<p>Dreaming, a widely researched aspect of sleep, often mirrors waking-life experiences. Despite the prevalence of sensory perception during wakefulness, sensory experiences in dreams remain relatively unexplored. Free recall dream reports, where individuals describe their dreams freely, may not fully capture sensory dream experiences. In this study, we developed a dream diary with direct questions about sensory dream experiences. Participants reported sensory experiences in their dreams upon awakening, over multiple days, in a home-based setting (n = 3476 diaries). Our findings show that vision was the most common sensory dream experience, followed by audition and touch. Olfaction and gustation were reported at equally low rates. Multisensory dreams were far more prevalent than unisensory dreams. Additionally, the prevalence of sensory dream experiences varied across emotionally positive and negative dreams. A positive relationship was found between on the one hand sensory richness and, on the other emotional intensity of dreams and clarity of dream recall, for both positive and negative dreams. These results underscore the variety of dream experiences and suggest a link between sensory richness, emotional content and dream recall clarity. Systematic registration of sensory dream experiences offers valuable insights into dream manifestation, aiding the understanding of sleep-related memory consolidation and other aspects of sleep-related information processing.</p>

	<p>Auditory spatial cues contribute to two distinct functions, of which one leads to explicit localization of sound sources and the other provides a location-linked representation of sound objects. Behavioral and imaging studies demonstrated right-hemispheric dominance for explicit sound localization. An early clinical case study documented the dissociation between the explicit sound localizations, which was heavily impaired, and fully preserved use of spatial cues for sound object segregation. The latter involves location-linked encoding of sound objects. We review here evidence pertaining to brain regions involved in location-linked representation of sound objects. Auditory evoked potential (AEP) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies investigated this aspect by comparing encoding of individual sound objects, which changed their locations or remained stationary. Systematic search identified 1 AEP and 12 fMRI studies. Together with studies of anatomical correlates of impaired of spatial-cue-based sound object segregation after focal brain lesions, the present evidence indicates that the location-linked representation of sound objects involves strongly the left hemisphere and to a lesser degree the right hemisphere. Location-linked encoding of sound objects is present in several early-stage auditory areas and in the specialized temporal voice area. In these regions, emotional valence benefits from location-linked encoding as well.</p>

	<p>The global issue of substance abuse demands ongoing initiatives aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. With drug use remaining prevalent worldwide, interventions are critical to addressing the associated health challenges and societal implications. Exercise and physical activities have emerged as integral components of substance use disorder (SUD) treatment, offering promising avenues for prevention, intervention, and recovery. Recent research underscores the efficacy of exercise in reducing substance cravings, promoting abstinence, and improving overall well-being. However, integrating exercise into SUD recovery programs presents challenges such as dropout rates and cultural considerations. This paper synthesizes existing literature on exercise integration into SUD recovery, highlighting strategies for enhancing treatment outcomes and addressing barriers to exercise adherence. Drawing on cognitive&amp;amp;ndash;behavioral therapy, experiential learning, motivational interviewing, and goal-setting techniques, the holistic approach outlined in this paper aims to empower individuals both mentally and physically, fostering resilience and supporting long-term recovery. In conclusion, new initiatives need to be taken by advocating for inclusive policies, promoting community engagement, and fostering collaborations across sectors. By doing so, stakeholders can optimize the effectiveness of exercise programs and contribute to sustainable rehabilitation efforts for individuals with SUD.</p>

	<p>Accelerated brain aging is a possible mechanism of pathology in schizophrenia. Advances in MRI-based brain development algorithms allow for the calculation of predicted brain age (PBA) for individuals. Here, we assessed PBA in 70 first-episode schizophrenia-spectrum individuals (FESz) and 76 matched healthy neurotypical comparison individuals (HC) to determine if FESz showed advanced aging proximal to psychosis onset and whether PBA was associated with neurocognitive, social functioning, or symptom severity measures. PBA was calculated with BrainAgeR (v2.1) from T1-weighted MR scans. There were no differences in the PBAs between groups. After controlling for actual age, a &amp;amp;ldquo;younger&amp;amp;rdquo; PBA was associated with higher vocabulary scores among all individuals, while an &amp;amp;ldquo;older&amp;amp;rdquo; PBA was associated with more severe negative symptom &amp;amp;ldquo;Inexpressivity&amp;amp;rdquo; component scores among FESz. Female participants in both groups had an elevated PBA relative to male participants. These results suggest that a relatively younger brain age is associated with a better semantic memory performance. There is no evidence for accelerated aging in FESz with a late adolescent/early adult onset. Despite a normative PBA, FESz with a greater residual PBA showed impairments in a cluster of negative symptoms, which may indicate some underlying age-related pathology proximal to psychosis onset. Although a period of accelerated aging cannot be ruled out with disease course, it does not occur at the time of the first episode.</p>

                <p>Glutamatergic mossy cells (MCs) mediate associational and commissural connectivity, exhibiting significant heterogeneity along the septotemporal axis of the mouse dentate gyrus (DG). However, it remains unclear whether the neuronal features of MCs are conserved across mammals. This study compares the neuroanatomy of MCs in the DG of mice and monkeys. The MC marker, calretinin, distinguishes two subpopulations: septal and temporal. Dual-colored fluorescence labeling is utilized to compare the axonal projection patterns of these subpopulations. In both mice and monkeys, septal and temporal MCs project axons across the longitudinal axis of the ipsilateral DG, indicating conserved associational projections. However, unlike in mice, no MC subpopulations in monkeys make commissural projections to the contralateral DG. In monkeys, temporal MCs send associational fibers exclusively to the inner molecular layer, while septal MCs give rise to wide axonal projections spanning multiple molecular layers, akin to equivalent MC subpopulations in mice. Despite conserved septotemporal heterogeneity, interspecies differences are observed in the topological organization of septal MCs, particularly in the relative axonal density in each molecular layer along the septotemporal axis of the DG. In summary, this comparative analysis sheds light on both conserved and divergent features of MCs in the DG of mice and monkeys. These findings have implications for understanding functional differentiation along the septotemporal axis of the DG and contribute to our knowledge of the anatomical evolution of the DG circuit in mammals.</p>

                Background Researchers are focusing their emphasis on quick and real-time healthcare and monitoring systems because of the contemporary modern world’s rapid technological improvements. One of the best options is smart healthcare, which uses a variety of on-body and off-body sensors and gadgets to monitor patients’ health and exchange data with hospitals and healthcare professionals in real time. Utilizing the primary user (PU) spectrum, cognitive radio (CR) can be highly useful for efficient and intelligent healthcare systems to send and receive patient health data. Methods In this work, we propose a method that combines energy detection (ED) and cyclostationary (CS) spectrum sensing (SS) algorithms. This method was used to test spectrum sensing in CR-based smart healthcare systems. The proposed ED-CS in cognitive radio systems improves the precision of the spectrum sensing. Owing to its straightforward implementation, ED is initially used to identify the idle spectrum. If the ED cannot find the idle spectrum, the signals are found using CS-SS, which uses the cyclic statistical properties of the signals to separate the main users from the interference. Results In the simulation analysis, the probability of detection (Pd), probability of a false alarm (Pfa), power spectral density (PSD), and bit error rate (BER) of the proposed ED-CS is compared to those of the traditional Matched Filter (MF), ED, and CS. Conclusions The results indicate that the suggested strategy improves the performance of the framework, making it more appropriate for smart healthcare applications.

                <p>by Giacomo Janson, Michael Feig</p>

Intrinsically disordered proteins have dynamic structures through which they play key biological roles. The elucidation of their conformational ensembles is a challenging problem requiring an integrated use of computational and experimental methods. Molecular simulations are a valuable computational strategy for constructing structural ensembles of disordered proteins but are highly resource-intensive. Recently, machine learning approaches based on deep generative models that learn from simulation data have emerged as an efficient alternative for generating structural ensembles. However, such methods currently suffer from limited transferability when modeling sequences and conformations absent in the training data. Here, we develop a novel generative model that achieves high levels of transferability for intrinsically disordered protein ensembles. The approach, named idpSAM, is a latent diffusion model based on transformer neural networks. It combines an autoencoder to learn a representation of protein geometry and a diffusion model to sample novel conformations in the encoded space. IdpSAM was trained on a large dataset of simulations of disordered protein regions performed with the ABSINTH implicit solvent model. Thanks to the expressiveness of its neural networks and its training stability, idpSAM faithfully captures 3D structural ensembles of test sequences with no similarity in the training set. Our study also demonstrates the potential for generating full conformational ensembles from datasets with limited sampling and underscores the importance of training set size for generalization. We believe that idpSAM represents a significant progress in transferable protein ensemble modeling through machine learning.

                <p>by Tianqi Wei, Qinghai Guo, Barbara Webb</p>

Animals can learn in real-life scenarios where rewards are often only available when a goal is achieved. This ‘distal’ or ‘sparse’ reward problem remains a challenge for conventional reinforcement learning algorithms. Here we investigate an algorithm for learning in such scenarios, inspired by the possibility that axo-axonal gap junction connections, observed in neural circuits with parallel fibres such as the insect mushroom body, could form a resistive network. In such a network, an active node represents the task state, connections between nodes represent state transitions and their connection to actions, and current flow to a target state can guide decision making. Building on evidence that gap junction weights are adaptive, we propose that experience of a task can modulate the connections to form a graph encoding the task structure. We demonstrate that the approach can be used for efficient reinforcement learning under sparse rewards, and discuss whether it is plausible as an account of the insect mushroom body.

                <p>by Santiago A. Cadena, Konstantin F. Willeke, Kelli Restivo, George Denfield, Fabian H. Sinz, Matthias Bethge, Andreas S. Tolias, Alexander S. Ecker</p>

Responses to natural stimuli in area V4—a mid-level area of the visual ventral stream—are well predicted by features from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on image classification. This result has been taken as evidence for the functional role of V4 in object classification. However, we currently do not know if and to what extent V4 plays a role in solving <i>other</i> computational objectives. Here, we investigated normative accounts of V4 (and V1 for comparison) by predicting macaque single-neuron responses to natural images from the representations extracted by 23 CNNs trained on different computer vision tasks including semantic, geometric, 2D, and 3D types of tasks. We found that V4 was best predicted by semantic classification features and exhibited high task selectivity, while the choice of task was less consequential to V1 performance. Consistent with traditional characterizations of V4 function that show its high-dimensional tuning to various 2D and 3D stimulus directions, we found that diverse non-semantic tasks explained aspects of V4 function that are not captured by individual semantic tasks. Nevertheless, jointly considering the features of a pair of semantic classification tasks was sufficient to yield one of our top V4 models, solidifying V4’s main functional role in semantic processing and suggesting that V4’s selectivity to 2D or 3D stimulus properties found by electrophysiologists can result from semantic functional goals.

                <p>by David Pastor-Alonso, Maxime Berg, Franck Boyer, Natalie Fomin-Thunemann, Michel Quintard, Yohan Davit, Sylvie Lorthois</p>

Recent progresses in intravital imaging have enabled highly-resolved measurements of periarteriolar oxygen gradients (POGs) within the brain parenchyma. POGs are increasingly used as proxies to estimate the local baseline oxygen consumption, which is a hallmark of cell activity. However, the oxygen profile around a given arteriole arises from an interplay between oxygen consumption and delivery, not only by this arteriole but also by distant capillaries. Integrating such interactions across scales while accounting for the complex architecture of the microvascular network remains a challenge from a modelling perspective. This limits our ability to interpret the experimental oxygen maps and constitutes a key bottleneck toward the inverse determination of metabolic rates of oxygen.
We revisit the problem of parenchymal oxygen transport and metabolism and introduce a simple, conservative, accurate and scalable direct numerical method going beyond canonical Krogh-type models and their associated geometrical simplifications. We focus on a two-dimensional formulation, and introduce the concepts needed to combine an operator-splitting and a Green’s function approach. Oxygen concentration is decomposed into a slowly-varying contribution, discretized by Finite Volumes over a coarse cartesian grid, and a rapidly-varying contribution, approximated analytically in grid-cells surrounding each vessel.
Starting with simple test cases, we thoroughly analyze the resulting errors by comparison with highly-resolved simulations of the original transport problem, showing considerable improvement of the computational-cost/accuracy balance compared to previous work. We then demonstrate the model ability to flexibly generate synthetic data reproducing the spatial dynamics of oxygen in the brain parenchyma, with sub-grid resolution. Based on these synthetic data, we show that capillaries distant from the arteriole cannot be overlooked when interpreting POGs, thus reconciling recent measurements of POGs across cortical layers with the fundamental idea that variations of vascular density within the depth of the cortex may reveal underlying differences in neuronal organization and metabolic load.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002612">Assessing the evolution of research topics in a biological field using plant science as an example</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shin-Han Shiu, Melissa D. Lehti-Shiu</p>

Scientific advances due to conceptual or technological innovations can be revealed by examining how research topics have evolved. But such topical evolution is difficult to uncover and quantify because of the large body of literature and the need for expert knowledge in a wide range of areas in a field. Using plant biology as an example, we used machine learning and language models to classify plant science citations into topics representing interconnected, evolving subfields. The changes in prevalence of topical records over the last 50 years reflect shifts in major research trends and recent radiation of new topics, as well as turnover of model species and vastly different plant science research trajectories among countries. Our approaches readily summarize the topical diversity and evolution of a scientific field with hundreds of thousands of relevant papers, and they can be applied broadly to other fields.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26951?af=R">Grey Matter Atrophy and its Relationship with White Matter Lesions in Patients with Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein Antibody‐associated Disease, Aquaporin‐4 Antibody‐Positive Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder, and Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To evaluate: (1) the distribution of gray matter (GM) atrophy in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD), aquaporin-4 antibody-positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (AQP4+NMOSD), and relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS); and (2) the relationship between GM volumes and white matter lesions in various brain regions within each disease.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A retrospective, multicenter analysis of magnetic resonance imaging data included patients with MOGAD/AQP4+NMOSD/RRMS in non-acute disease stage. Voxel-wise analyses and general linear models were used to evaluate the relevance of regional GM atrophy. For significant results (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), volumes of atrophic areas are reported.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We studied 135 MOGAD patients, 135 AQP4+NMOSD, 175 RRMS, and 144 healthy controls (HC). Compared with HC, MOGAD showed lower GM volumes in the temporal lobes, deep GM, insula, and cingulate cortex (75.79 cm<sup>3</sup>); AQP4+NMOSD in the occipital cortex (32.83 cm<sup>3</sup>); and RRMS diffusely in the GM (260.61 cm<sup>3</sup>). MOGAD showed more pronounced temporal cortex atrophy than RRMS (6.71 cm<sup>3</sup>), whereas AQP4+NMOSD displayed greater occipital cortex atrophy than RRMS (19.82 cm<sup>3</sup>). RRMS demonstrated more pronounced deep GM atrophy in comparison with MOGAD (27.90 cm<sup>3</sup>) and AQP4+NMOSD (47.04 cm<sup>3</sup>). In MOGAD, higher periventricular and cortical/juxtacortical lesions were linked to reduced temporal cortex, deep GM, and insula volumes. In RRMS, the diffuse GM atrophy was associated with lesions in all locations. AQP4+NMOSD showed no lesion/GM volume correlation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>GM atrophy is more widespread in RRMS compared with the other two conditions. MOGAD primarily affects the temporal cortex, whereas AQP4+NMOSD mainly involves the occipital cortex. In MOGAD and RRMS, lesion-related tract degeneration is associated with atrophy, but this link is absent in AQP4+NMOSD. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Irisin, released by muscles during exercise, was recently identified as a neuroprotective factor in mouse models of Alzheimer disease (AD). In a cohort of AD patients, we studied cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma irisin levels, sex interactions, and correlations with disease biomarkers.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Correlations between CSF and plasma irisin levels and AD biomarkers (amyloid β 1-42, hyperphosphorylated tau, and total tau [t-tau]) and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) were analyzed in a cohort of patients with Alzheimer dementia (n = 82), mild cognitive impairment (n = 44), and subjective memory complaint (n = 20) biologically characterized according to the recent amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration classification.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>CSF irisin was reduced in Alzheimer dementia patients (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), with lower levels in female patients. Moreover, CSF irisin correlated positively with Aβ42 in both female (<i>r</i> = 0.379, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and male (<i>r</i> = 0.262, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) patients, and negatively with CDR-SOB (<i>r</i> = −0.234, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) only in female patients. A negative trend was also observed between CSF irisin and t-tau levels in all patients (<i>r</i> = −0.144, <i>p</i> = 0.082) and in the female subgroup (<i>r</i> = −0.189, <i>p</i> = 0.084).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The results highlight the relationship between irisin and biomarkers of AD pathology, especially in females. Our findings also offer perspectives toward the use of irisin as a marker of the AD continuum. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Although the phenomenon of memory formation and recall associated with the use of psychotropic drugs has been extensively studied, mechanisms underlying memories for natural reward have not been clarified. Herein, we test the hypothesis that glutamatergic receptors in the dentate gyrus play a role in memories associated with sucrose. We used pellet self-administration protocol to generate memories in two-port nose-poke discrimination task using male Wistar rats. During non-rewarded probe trial, the conditioned animals readily discriminated the active port versus inactive port and showed massive increase in mRNA expression of AMPA receptor subunit genes (gria2, gria3) as well as c-Fos protein in the DG. Access to sweet pellet further enhanced c-Fos expression in the DG. However, animals pre-treated with AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX (intra-DG), on exposure to operant chamber (no pellet), showed decreased discrimination as well as c-Fos expression. We suggest that AMPA receptors in DG mediate recall and consolidation of memories associated with sucrose consumption. CNQX pre-treated animals, if presented with sweet pellet on nose poke, exhibited high discrimination index coupled with increased c-Fos expression. In these CNQX treated rats, the DI was again decreased following administration of NMDA receptor antagonist AP5. We suggest that, although AMPA receptors are blocked, the access to sweet pellet may induce surge of glutamate in the DG, which in turn may reinstate memories via activation of erstwhile silent synapses in NMDA dependant manner.</p>

                Giez et al. demonstrate that satiety in the ancestral metazoan Hydra is controlled by two distinct neuronal subpopulations and affects behavioral patterns. Both subpopulations show either pre-enteric- or central nervous system-like functions. The study contributes to our understanding of the evolution of the nervous system.

                Ye et al. demonstrate that both the bivalent and tetravalent MPXV mRNA vaccines encoding at least one of EEV and IMV antigens induce robust antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. Furthermore, the two tetravalent vaccines LBAAM and LBA&LAM provide superior protective efficacy against VACV challenge.

                Hormonal and neuronal inputs to the brain control how much animals eat. The origins of this behavior were unclear, but in this issue of Cell Reports, Giez et al. describe specific neurons inhibiting feeding in evolutionary ancient animals without brain.

	<p>Reproducing instructed movements is crucial for practice in motor learning. In this study, we compared the short-term reproduction of active pelvis movements with visual feedback and passive movement with the therapist&amp;amp;rsquo;s hands in an upright stance. Sixteen healthy males (M age = 34.1; SD = 10.2 years) participated in this study. In one condition, healthy males maintained an upright stance while a physical therapist moved the participant&amp;amp;rsquo;s pelvis (passive movement instruction), and in a second condition, the participant actively moved their pelvis with visual feedback of the target and the online trajectory of the center of pressure (active movement instruction). Reproduction errors (displacement of the center of pressure in the medial&amp;amp;ndash;lateral axis) 10 s after the passive movement instruction were significantly greater than after the active movement instruction (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), but this difference disappeared 30 s after the instruction (p = 0.118). Error of movement reproduction in the anterior&amp;amp;ndash;posterior axis after the passive movement instruction was significantly greater than after the active movement instruction, no matter how long the retention interval was between the instruction and reproduction phases (p = 0.025). Taken together, active pelvis movements with visual feedback, rather than passive movement with the therapist&amp;amp;rsquo;s hand, is better to be used for instructing pelvis movements.</p>

	<p>Background: Conservative therapy is currently the elective treatment for peripheric facial palsy according to scientific literature. The success of conservative therapy is due to physiotherapy and the application of its methods. The aim of this systematic review was to assess mirror therapy, a physiotherapeutic method. Objectives: The aim of the following systematic review is to evaluate the effectiveness of using mirror therapy in patients with peripheral paralysis of the seventh cranial nerve. Methods: This systematic review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The screening of literature was carried out on Cochrane, PEDro, PubMed/Medline, Scopus and Web of Science databases up until August 2022. All studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 5 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study. The risk of bias was evaluated with PEDro and Jadad scales. Discussion: In the present study, we reviewed 5 RCTs that compared mirror therapy with other physiotherapy treatments or placebo to reduce pain, depression and improve range of motion in patients with peripheric facial nerve palsy. Conclusions: Further studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of this type of treatment, but nevertheless the data obtained are very encouraging.</p>

                <p>From deciding which meal to prepare for our guests to trading off the proenvironmental effects of climate protection measures against their economic costs, we often must consider the consequences of our actions for the well-being of others (welfare). Vexingly, the tastes and views of others can vary widely. To maximize welfare according to the utilitarian philosophical tradition, decision-makers facing conflicting preferences of others should choose the option that maximizes the sum of the subjective value (utility) of the entire group. This notion requires comparing the intensities of preferences across individuals. However, it remains unclear whether such comparisons are possible at all and (if they are possible) how they might be implemented in the brain. Here, we show that female and male participants can both learn the preferences of others by observing their choices and represent these preferences on a common scale to make utilitarian welfare decisions. On the neural level, multivariate support vector regressions revealed that a distributed activity pattern in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), a brain region previously associated with reward processing, represented the preference strength of others. Strikingly, also the utilitarian welfare of others was represented in the VMPFC and relied on the same neural code as the estimated preferences of others. Together, our findings reveal that humans can behave as if they maximized utilitarian welfare using a specific utility representation and that the brain enables such choices by repurposing neural machinery processing the reward others receive.</p>

                <p>Information seeking, such as standing on tiptoes to look around in humans, is observed across animals and helps survival. Its rodent analog&mdash;unsupported rearing on hind legs&mdash;was a classic model in deciphering neural signals of cognition and is of intense renewed interest in preclinical modeling of neuropsychiatric states. Neural signals and circuits controlling this dedicated decision to seek information remain largely unknown. While studying subsecond timing of spontaneous behavioral acts and activity of melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons (MNs) in behaving male and female mice, we observed large MN activity spikes that aligned to unsupported rears. Complementary causal, loss and gain of function, analyses revealed specific control of rear frequency and duration by MNs and MCHR1 receptors. Activity in a key stress center of the brain&mdash;the locus ceruleus noradrenaline cells&mdash;rapidly inhibited MNs and required functional MCH receptors for its endogenous modulation of rearing. By defining a neural module that both tracks and controls rearing, these findings may facilitate further insights into biology of information seeking.</p>

                <p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) arises from the loss of fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP) needed for normal neuronal excitability and circuit functions. Recent work revealed that FMRP contributes to mossy fiber long-term potentiation by adjusting the Kv4 A-type current availability through interactions with a Cav3-Kv4 ion channel complex, yet the mechanism has not yet been defined. In this study using wild-type and <I>Fmr1</I> knock-out (KO) tsA-201 cells and cerebellar sections from male <I>Fmr1</I> KO mice, we show that FMRP associates with all subunits of the Cav3.1-Kv4.3-KChIP3 complex and is critical to enabling calcium-dependent shifts in Kv4.3 inactivation to modulate the A-type current. Specifically, upon depolarization Cav3 calcium influx activates dual-specific phosphatase 1/6 (DUSP1/6) to deactivate ERK1/2 (ERK) and lower phosphorylation of Kv4.3, a signaling pathway that does not function in <I>Fmr1</I> KO cells. In <I>Fmr1</I> KO mouse tissue slices, cerebellar granule cells exhibit a hyperexcitable response to membrane depolarizations. Either incubating <I>Fmr1</I> KO cells or in vivo administration of a tat-conjugated FMRP N-terminus fragment (FMRP-N-tat) rescued Cav3-Kv4 function and granule cell excitability, with a decrease in the level of DUSP6. Together these data reveal a Cav3-activated DUSP signaling pathway critical to the function of a FMRP-Cav3-Kv4 complex that is misregulated in <I>Fmr1</I> KO conditions. Moreover, FMRP-N-tat restores function of this complex to rescue calcium-dependent control of neuronal excitability as a potential therapeutic approach to alleviating the symptoms of FXS.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/21/e0846232024?rss=1">Intrinsic Neural Excitability Biases Allocation and Overlap of Memory Engrams</a></h4>

              
                <p>Memories are thought to be stored in neural ensembles known as engrams that are specifically reactivated during memory recall. Recent studies have found that memory engrams of two events that happened close in time tend to overlap in the hippocampus and the amygdala, and these overlaps have been shown to support memory linking. It has been hypothesized that engram overlaps arise from the mechanisms that regulate memory allocation itself, involving neural excitability, but the exact process remains unclear. Indeed, most theoretical studies focus on synaptic plasticity and little is known about the role of intrinsic plasticity, which could be mediated by neural excitability and serve as a complementary mechanism for forming memory engrams. Here, we developed a rate-based recurrent neural network that includes both synaptic plasticity and neural excitability. We obtained structural and functional overlap of memory engrams for contexts that are presented close in time, consistent with experimental and computational studies. We then investigated the role of excitability in memory allocation at the network level and unveiled competitive mechanisms driven by inhibition. This work suggests mechanisms underlying the role of intrinsic excitability in memory allocation and linking, and yields predictions regarding the formation and the overlap of memory engrams.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/21/e1161232024?rss=1">Differential Modulation of Local Field Potentials in the Primary and Premotor Cortices during Ipsilateral and Contralateral Reach to Grasp in Macaque Monkeys</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hand movements are associated with modulations of neuronal activity across several interconnected cortical areas, including the primary motor cortex (M1) and the dorsal and ventral premotor cortices (PMd and PMv). Local field potentials (LFPs) provide a link between neuronal discharges and synaptic inputs. Our current understanding of how LFPs vary in M1, PMd, and PMv during contralateral and ipsilateral movements is incomplete. To help reveal unique features in the pattern of modulations, we simultaneously recorded LFPs in these areas in two macaque monkeys performing reach and grasp movements with either the right or left hand. The greatest effector-dependent differences were seen in M1, at low (&le;13&nbsp;Hz) and  frequencies. In premotor areas, differences related to hand use were only present in low frequencies. PMv exhibited the greatest increase in low frequencies during instruction cues and the smallest effector-dependent modulation during movement execution. In PMd,  oscillations were greater during contralateral reach and grasp, and &beta; activity increased during contralateral grasp. In contrast, &beta; oscillations decreased in M1 and PMv. These results suggest that while M1 primarily exhibits effector-specific LFP activity, premotor areas compute more effector-independent aspects of the task requirements, particularly during movement preparation for PMv and production for PMd. The generation of precise hand movements likely relies on the combination of complementary information contained in the unique pattern of neural modulations contained in each cortical area. Accordingly, integrating LFPs from premotor areas and M1 could enhance the performance and robustness of brain-machine interfaces.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/21/e1311232024?rss=1">Severity-Dependent Interhemispheric White Matter Connectivity Predicts Poststroke Neglect Recovery</a></h4>

              
                <p>Left-sided spatial neglect is a very common and challenging issue after right-hemispheric stroke, which strongly and negatively affects daily living behavior and recovery of stroke survivors. The mechanisms underlying recovery of spatial neglect remain controversial, particularly regarding the involvement of the intact, contralesional hemisphere, with potential contributions ranging from maladaptive to compensatory. In the present prospective, observational study, we assessed neglect severity in 54 right-hemispheric stroke patients (32 male; 22 female) at admission to and discharge from inpatient neurorehabilitation. We demonstrate that the interaction of initial neglect severity and spared white matter (dis)connectivity resulting from individual lesions (as assessed by diffusion tensor imaging, DTI) explains a significant portion of the variability of poststroke neglect recovery. In mildly impaired patients, spared structural connectivity within the lesioned hemisphere is sufficient to attain good recovery. Conversely, in patients with severe impairment, successful recovery critically depends on structural connectivity within the intact hemisphere and between hemispheres. These distinct patterns, mediated by their respective white matter connections, may help to reconcile the dichotomous perspectives regarding the role of the contralesional hemisphere as exclusively compensatory or not. Instead, they suggest a unified viewpoint wherein the contralesional hemisphere can &ndash; but must not necessarily &ndash; assume a compensatory role. This would depend on initial impairment severity and on the available, spared structural connectivity. In the future, our findings could serve as a prognostic biomarker for neglect recovery and guide patient-tailored therapeutic approaches.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/21/e1337232024?rss=1">Risk-Taking Is Associated with Decreased Subjective Value Signals and Increased Prediction Error Signals in the Hot Columbia Card Task</a></h4>

              
                <p>It remains a pressing concern to understand how neural computations relate to risky decisions. However, most observations of brain&ndash;behavior relationships in the risk-taking domain lack a rigorous computational basis or fail to emulate of the dynamic, sequential nature of real-life risky decision-making. Recent advances emphasize the role of neural prediction error (PE) signals. We modeled, according to prospect theory, the choices of <I>n</I> = 43 human participants (33 females, 10 males) performing an EEG version of the hot Columbia Card Task, featuring rounds of sequential decisions between stopping (safe option) and continuing with increasing odds of a high loss (risky option). Single-trial regression EEG analyses yielded a subjective value signal at centroparietal (300&ndash;700&nbsp;ms) and frontocentral (&gt;800&nbsp;ms) electrodes and in the delta band, as well as PE signals tied to the feedback-related negativity, P3a, and P3b, and in the theta band. Higher risk preference (total number of risky choices) was linked to attenuated subjective value signals but increased PE signals. Higher P3-like activity associated with the most positive PE in each round predicted stopping in the present round but not risk-taking in the subsequent round. Our findings indicate that decreased representation of decision values and increased sensitivity to winning despite low odds (positive PE) facilitate risky choices at the subject level. Strong neural responses when gains are least expected (the most positive PE on each round) adaptively contribute to safer choices at the trial-by-trial level but do not affect risky choice at the round-by-round level.</p>
