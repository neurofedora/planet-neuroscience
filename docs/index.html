<p>The velocity of the action potential transduction along myelinated axons in
the peripheral nervous system or in the white matter of brain and spinal cord
reaches hundreds of meters per second to assure proper functioning of the body,
which exceeds the ability of diffusive ion conduction. We propose the new model
of the saltatory conduction based on a plasmon-polariton kinetics in myelinated
axons, which excludes, however, the white matter form the information storage
and its identification in the brain via e-m response. We propose a nonlocal
topological approach to information processing in the cortex of brain in
consistence with the ion electricity of the gray matter and a supplementary
only communication role of the white matter.

<p>This paper proposes a novel topological learning framework that can integrate
networks of different sizes and topology through persistent homology. This is
possible through the introduction of a new topological loss function that
enables such challenging task. The use of the proposed loss function bypasses
the intrinsic computational bottleneck associated with matching networks. We
validate the method in extensive statistical simulations with ground truth to
assess the effectiveness of the topological loss in discriminating networks
with different topology. The method is further applied to a twin brain imaging
study in determining if the brain network is genetically heritable. The
challenge is in overlaying the topologically different functional brain
networks obtained from the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) onto the template structural brain network obtained through the
diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).

<p>The neural correlates of face individuation - the acquisition of memory
representations for novel faces - have been studied only in coarse detail and
disregarding individual differences between learners. In their seminal study,
(Tanaka, Curran, Porterfield, &amp; Collins, 2006) required the identification of a
particular novel face across 70 trials and found that the N250 component in the
ERP became more negative from the first to the second half of the experiment,
where it reached a similar amplitude as a well-known face. We were unable to
directly replicate this finding in our study when we used the original split of
trials. However, when we applied a different split of trials we observed very
similar changes in N250 amplitude. Then, we developed and applied a new
two-step explorative-confirmative non-parametric method based on permutation
testing to determine the time course of face individuation in individual
participants based on single-trial N250 amplitudes. We show that the assumption
of a steep initial increase of N250 amplitude across multiple presentations of
the target face, followed by a plateau, yields plausible results in fitting
linear trends for most participants. The transition point from initial
acquisition to the plateau phase differed strongly between participants and
tended to be earlier when performance in target face recognition was better.
Hence, face individuation may be accounted for by a biphasic process of early,
fast acquisition, followed by a slower, asymptotic consolidation or maintenance
phase. The current approach might be fruitfully applied to further
investigations into face individuation and their neural correlates

<p>With the increasing demand to efficiently deploy DNNs on mobile edge devices,
it becomes much more important to reduce unnecessary computation and increase
the execution speed. Prior methods towards this goal, including model
compression and network architecture search (NAS), are largely performed
independently and do not fully consider compiler-level optimizations which is a
must-do for mobile acceleration. In this work, we first propose (i) a general
category of fine-grained structured pruning applicable to various DNN layers,
and (ii) a comprehensive, compiler automatic code generation framework
supporting different DNNs and different pruning schemes, which bridge the gap
of model compression and NAS. We further propose NPAS, a compiler-aware unified
network pruning, and architecture search. To deal with large search space, we
propose a meta-modeling procedure based on reinforcement learning with fast
evaluation and Bayesian optimization, ensuring the total number of training
epochs comparable with representative NAS frameworks. Our framework achieves
6.7ms, 5.9ms, 3.9ms ImageNet inference times with 78.2%, 75% (MobileNet-V3
level), and 71% (MobileNet-V2 level) Top-1 accuracy respectively on an
off-the-shelf mobile phone, consistently outperforming prior work.

<p>In recent years the empirical success of transfer learning with neural
networks has stimulated an increasing interest in obtaining a theoretical
understanding of its core properties. Knowledge distillation where a smaller
neural network is trained using the outputs of a larger neural network is a
particularly interesting case of transfer learning. In the present work, we
introduce a statistical physics framework that allows an analytic
characterization of the properties of knowledge distillation (KD) in shallow
neural networks. Focusing the analysis on a solvable model that exhibits a
non-trivial generalization gap, we investigate the effectiveness of KD. We are
able to show that, through KD, the regularization properties of the larger
teacher model can be inherited by the smaller student and that the yielded
generalization performance is closely linked to and limited by the optimality
of the teacher. Finally, we analyze the double descent phenomenology that can
arise in the considered KD setting.

<p>This work presents a comparative evaluation of four population-based
optimization algorithms for workflow scheduling in cloud-fog environments.
These algorithms are as follows: Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic
Algorithm (GA), Differential Evolution (DE) and GA-PSO. This work also provides
the motivational groundwork for the weighted sum objective function for the
workflow scheduling problem and develops this function based on three
objectives: makespan, cost and energy. The recently proposed FogWorkflowSim is
used as the simulation environment with the aforementioned objectives serving
performance metrics. Results show that hybrid combination of the GA-PSO
algorithm exhibits slightly better than the standard algorithms. Future work
will include expansion of the workflows used by increasing the number of tasks
as well as adding some more workflows. The addition of some more objectives to
the weighted objective function will also be pursued

<p>Deep learning's successes are often attributed to its ability to
automatically discover new representations of the data, rather than relying on
handcrafted features like other learning methods. We show, however, that deep
networks learned by the standard gradient descent algorithm are in fact
mathematically approximately equivalent to kernel machines, a learning method
that simply memorizes the data and uses it directly for prediction via a
similarity function (the kernel). This greatly enhances the interpretability of
deep network weights, by elucidating that they are effectively a superposition
of the training examples. The network architecture incorporates knowledge of
the target function into the kernel. This improved understanding should lead to
better learning algorithms.

<p>The neural mechanism of memory has a very close relation with the problem of
representation in artificial intelligence. In this paper a computational model
was proposed to simulate the network of neurons in brain and how they process
information. The model refers to morphological and electrophysiological
characteristics of neural information processing, and is based on the
assumption that neurons encode their firing sequence. The network structure,
functions for neural encoding at different stages, the representation of
stimuli in memory, and an algorithm to form a memory were presented. It also
analyzed the stability and recall rate for learning and the capacity of memory.
Because neural dynamic processes, one succeeding another, achieve a
neuron-level and coherent form by which information is represented and
processed, it may facilitate examination of various branches of Artificial
Intelligence, such as inference, problem solving, pattern recognition, natural
language processing and learning. The processes of cognitive manipulation
occurring in intelligent behavior have a consistent representation while all
being modeled from the perspective of computational neuroscience. Thus, the
dynamics of neurons make it possible to explain the inner mechanisms of
different intelligent behaviors by a unified model of cognitive architecture at
a micro-level.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00101">Natural Evolutionary Strategies for Variational Quantum Computation. (arXiv:2012.00101v1 [quant-ph])</a></h4>

<p>Natural evolutionary strategies (NES) are a family of gradient-free black-box
optimization algorithms. This study illustrates their use for the optimization
of randomly-initialized parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs) in the region of
vanishing gradients. We show that using the NES gradient estimator the
exponential decrease in variance can be alleviated. We implement two specific
approaches, the exponential and separable natural evolutionary strategies, for
parameter optimization of PQCs and compare them against standard gradient
descent. We apply them to two different problems of ground state energy
estimation using variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and state preparation
with circuits of varying depth and length. We also introduce batch optimization
for circuits with larger depth to extend the use of evolutionary strategies to
a larger number of parameters. We achieve accuracy comparable to
state-of-the-art optimization techniques in all the above cases with a lower
number of circuit evaluations. Our empirical results indicate that one can use
NES as a hybrid tool in tandem with other gradient-based methods for
optimization of deep quantum circuits in regions with vanishing gradients.

<p>The most researched brain region in epilepsy research is the temporal lobe, and more specifically, the hippocampus. However, numerous other brain regions play a pivotal role in seizure circuitry and secondary generalization of epileptic activity: The substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and its direct input structure, the subthalamic nucleus (STN), are considered seizure gating nuclei. There is ample evidence that direct inhibition of the SNr is capable of suppressing various seizure types in experimental models. Similarly, inhibition via its monosynaptic glutamatergic input, the STN, can decrease seizure susceptibility as well. This review will focus on therapeutic interventions such as electrical stimulation and targeted drug delivery to SNr and STN in human patients and experimental animal models of epilepsy, highlighting the opportunities for overcoming pharmacoresistance in epilepsy by investigating these promising target structures.</p>

<p>Human brain lesions in the perinatal period result in life-long neuro-disabilities impairing sensory-motor, cognitive, and behavior functions for years. Topographical aspects of brain lesions depend on gestational age at the time of insult in preterm or term infants and impaired subsequent steps of brain development and maturation. In mice, the Rice-Vannucci procedure of neonate hypoxia-ischemia (HI) was used at 5 days (P5) or P10, mimicking the development of 30 week-gestation fetus/preterm newborn, or full-term infant, respectively. Transcription response to HI was assessed at 3, 6, 12, and 24 h after insult, using micro-array technology. Statistical Pathway and Gene Ontology terms enrichments were investigated using DAVID<sup>®</sup>, Revigo<sup>®</sup> and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA<sup>®</sup>) to identify a core of transcription response to HI, age-specific regulations, and interactions with spontaneous development. Investigations were based on direction, amplitude, and duration of responses, basal expression, and annotation. Five major points deserve attention; (i) inductions exceeded repressions (60/40%) at both ages, (ii) only 20.3% (393/1938 records) were common to P5 and P10 mice, (iii) at P5, HI effects occurred early and decreased 24 h after insult whereas they were delayed at P10 and increased 24 h after insult, (iv) common responses at P5 and P10 involved inflammation, immunity, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. (v) age-specific effects occurred with higher statistical significance at P5 than at P10. Transient repression of 12 genes encoding cholesterol biosynthesis enzymes was transiently observed 12 h after HI at P5. Synaptogenesis appeared inhibited at P5 while induced at P10, showing reciprocal effects on glutamate receptors. Specific involvement of Il-1 (interleukin-1) implicated in the firing of inflammation was observed at P10. This study pointed out age-differences in HI responses kinetics, e.g., a long-lasting inflammatory response at P10 compared to P5. Whether the specific strong depression of cholesterol biosynthesis genes that could account for white matter-specific vulnerability at P5 or prevent delayed inflammation needs further investigation. Determination of putative involvement of Il-1 and the identification of upstream regulators involved in the delayed inflammation firing at P10 appears promising routes of research in the understandings of age-dependent vulnerabilities in the neonatal brain.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.569395">The Q336H MAPT Mutation Linked to Pick’s Disease Leads to Increased Binding of Tau to the Microtubule Network via Altered Conformational and Phosphorylation Effects</a></h4>

<p>Tauopathies are neurodegenerative disorders characterized by Tau aggregation. Genetic studies on familial cases allowed for the discovery of mutations in the MAPT gene that increase Tau propensity to detach from microtubules and to form insoluble cytoplasmic Tau aggregates. Recently, the rare mutation Q336H has been identified to be associated with Pick’s disease (PiD) and biochemical analyses demonstrated its ability to increase the microtubules (MTs) polymerization, thus revealing an opposite character compared to other Tau mutations studied so far. Here we investigated the biophysical and molecular properties of Tau<sup>Q336H</sup> in living cells by the employment of the conformational Tau biosensor CST. We found that this mutation alters Tau conformation on microtubules, stabilizes its binding to tubulin, and is associated with a paradoxical lower level of Tau phosphorylation. Moreover, we found that this mutation impacts the cytoskeletal complexity by increasing the tubulin filament length and the number of branches. However, despite these apparently non-pathological traits, we observed the formation of intracellular inclusions confirming that Q336H leads to aggregation. Our results suggest that the Tau aggregation process might be triggered by molecular mechanisms other than Tau destabilization or post-translational modifications which are likely to be detrimental to neuronal function in vivo.</p>

<p>Fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the potential to advance our understanding of human brain development by providing quantitative information of cortical plate (CP) development in vivo. However, for a reliable quantitative analysis of cortical volume and sulcal folding, accurate and automated segmentation of the CP is crucial. In this study, we propose a fully convolutional neural network for the automatic segmentation of the CP. We developed a novel hybrid loss function to improve the segmentation accuracy and adopted multi-view (axial, coronal, and sagittal) aggregation with a test-time augmentation method to reduce errors using three-dimensional (3D) information and multiple predictions. We evaluated our proposed method using the ten-fold cross-validation of 52 fetal brain MR images (22.9–31.4 weeks of gestation). The proposed method obtained Dice coefficients of 0.907 ± 0.027 and 0.906 ± 0.031 as well as a mean surface distance error of 0.182 ± 0.058 mm and 0.185 ± 0.069 mm for the left and right, respectively. In addition, the left and right CP volumes, surface area, and global mean curvature generated by automatic segmentation showed a high correlation with the values generated by manual segmentation (R<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.941). We also demonstrated that the proposed hybrid loss function and the combination of multi-view aggregation and test-time augmentation significantly improved the CP segmentation accuracy. Our proposed segmentation method will be useful for the automatic and reliable quantification of the cortical structure in the fetal brain.</p>

<p>α-Synuclein is a 140-amino acid protein that readily misfolds and is associated with the Lewy body pathology found in sporadic and genetic forms of Parkinson's disease. We and others have shown that wild-type α-synuclein is a damage-associated molecular pattern that directly elicits a proinflammatory response in microglia through toll-like receptor activation. Here we investigated the direct effect of oligomeric mutant α-synuclein (A53T) on microglia morphology and activation. We found that misfolded A53T increased quantitative measures of amoeboid cell morphology, NFκB nuclear translocation and the expression of prototypical proinflammatory molecules. We also demonstrated that A53T increased expression of MMP13, a matrix metalloproteinase that remodels the extracellular matrix. To better understand the role of MMP13 in synucleinopathies, we further characterized the role of MMP13 in microglial signaling. We showed exposure of microglia to MMP13 induced a change in morphology and promoted the release of TNFα and MMP9. Notably, IL1β was not released indicating that the pathway involved in MMP13 activation of microglia may be different than the A53T pathway. Lastly, MMP13 increased the expression of CD68 suggesting that the lysosomal pathway might be altered by this MMP. Taken together this study shows that mutant α-synuclein directly induces a proinflammatory phenotype in microglia, which includes the expression of MMP13. In turn, MMP13 directly alters microglia supporting the need for multi-target therapies to treat Parkinson's disease patients.</p>

<p>Objective: Patients with hypochondriasis hold unexplainable beliefs and a fear of having a lethal disease, with poor compliances and treatment response to psychotropic drugs. Although several studies have demonstrated that patients with hypochondriasis demonstrate abnormalities in brain structure and function, gray matter volume (GMV) and functional connectivity (FC) in hypochondriasis still remain unclear.</p><p>Methods: The present study collected T1-weighted and resting-state functional magnetic resonance images from 21 hypochondriasis patients and 22 well-matched healthy controls (HCs). We first analyzed the difference in the GMV between the two groups. We then used the regions showing a difference in GMV between two groups as seeds to perform functional connectivity (FC) analysis. Finally, a support vector machine (SVM) was applied to the imaging data to distinguish hypochondriasis patients from HCs.</p><p>Results: Compared with the HCs, the hypochondriasis group showed decreased GMV in the left precuneus, and increased GMV in the left medial frontal gyrus. FC analyses revealed decreased FC between the left medial frontal gyrus and cuneus, and between the left precuneus and cuneus. A combination of both GMV and FC in the left precuneus, medial frontal gyrus, and cuneus was able to discriminate the hypochondriasis patients from HCs with a sensitivity of 0.98, specificity of 0.93, and accuracy of 0.95.</p><p>Conclusion: Our study suggests that smaller left precuneus volumes and decreased FC between the left precuneus and cuneus seem to play an important role of hypochondriasis.

<p>Background: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been widely used to assess neural activity changes in gray matter (GM) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS); however, brain function alterations in white matter (WM) relatively remain under-explored.</p><p>Purpose: This work aims to identify the functional connectivity in both the WM and the GM of patients with MS using fMRI and the correlations between these functional changes and cumulative disability as well as the lesion ratio.</p><p>Materials and Methods: For this retrospective study, 37 patients with clinically definite MS and 43 age-matched healthy controls were included between 2010 and 2014. Resting-state fMRI was performed. The WFU Pick and JHU Eve atlases were used to define 82 GM and 48 WM regions in common spaces, respectively. The time courses of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals were averaged over each GM or WM region. The averaged time courses for each pair of GM and WM regions were correlated. All 82 × 48 correlations for each subject formed a functional correlation matrix.</p><p>Results: Compared with the healthy controls, the MS patients had a decreased temporal correlation between the WM and the GM regions. Five WM bundles and four GM regions had significantly decreased mean correlation coefficients (CCs). More specifically, the WM functional alterations were negatively correlated with the lesion volume in the bilateral fornix, and the mean GM-averaged CCs of the WM bundles were inversely correlated with the lesion ratio (r = −0.36, P = 0.012). No significant correlation was found between WM functional alterations and the paced auditory serial addition test score, Expanded Disease Severity Scale score, and Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score (MSSS) in MS.</p><p>Conclusions: These findings highlight current gaps in our knowledge of the WM functional alterations in patients with MS and may link WM function with pathological mechanisms.</p>

<p>Evoked potentials in the amplitude-time spectrum of the electroencephalogram are commonly used to assess the extent of brain responses to stimulation with noxious contact heat. The magnitude of the N- and P-waves are used as a semi-objective measure of the response to the painful stimulus: the higher the magnitude, the more painful the stimulus has been perceived. The strength of the N-P-wave response is also largely dependent on the chosen reference electrode site. The goal of this study was to examine which reference technique excels both in practical and theoretical terms when analyzing noxious contact heat evoked potentials (CHEPS) in the amplitude-time spectrum. We recruited 21 subjects (10 male, 11 female, mean age of 55.79 years). We applied seven noxious contact heat stimuli using two temperatures, 51°C, and 54°C, to each subject. During EEG analysis, we aimed to identify the referencing technique which produces the highest N-wave and P-wave amplitudes with as little artifactual influence as possible. For this purpose, we applied the following six referencing techniques: mathematically linked A1/A2 (earlobes), average reference, REST, AFz, Pz, and mathematically linked PO7/PO8. We evaluated how these techniques impact the N-P amplitudes of CHEPS based on our data from healthy subjects. Considering all factors, we found that mathematically linked earlobes to be the ideal referencing site to use when displaying and evaluating CHEPS in the amplitude-time spectrum.</p>

<p>Described as the “proteasome of the membrane” or the “scissors in the membrane,” γ-secretase has notoriously complicated biology, and even after decades of research, the full extent of its regulatory mechanism remains unclear. γ-Secretase is an intramembrane aspartyl protease complex composed of four obligatory subunits: Nicastrin (NCT), Presenilin (PS), Presenilin Enhancer-2 (Pen-2), and Anterior pharynx-defective-1 (Aph-1). γ-Secretase cleaves numerous type 1 transmembrane substrates, with no apparent homology, and plays major roles in broad biological pathways such as development, neurogenesis, and cancer. Notch and the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and are undoubtedly the best-studied γ-secretase substrates because of their role in cancer and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and therefore became the focus of increasing studies as an attractive therapeutic target. The regulation of γ-secretase is intricate and involves the function of multiple cellular entities. Recently, γ-secretase modulatory proteins (GSMPs), which are non-essential subunits and yet modulate γ-secretase activity and specificity, have emerged as an important component in guiding γ-secretase. GSMPs are responsive to cellular and environmental changes and therefore, provide another layer of regulation of γ-secretase. This type of enzymatic regulation allows for a rapid and fine-tuning of γ-secretase activity when appropriate signals appear enabling a temporal level of regulation. In this review article, we discuss the latest developments on GSMPs and implications on the development of effective therapeutics for γ-secretase-associated diseases such as AD and cancer.</p>

<p>Damage to the fornix leads to significant memory impairment and executive dysfunction and is associated with dementia risk. We sought to identify if fornix integrity and fiber length are disrupted in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and how they associate with cognition. Data from 14 healthy older adult controls (HCs) and 17 subjects with non-amnestic MCI (n-aMCI) were analyzed. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) at 1.5 Tesla MRI was performed to enable manual tracing of the fornix and calculation of DTI parameters. Higher fractional anisotropy of body and column of the fornix was associated with better executive functioning and memory, more strongly in the HC than in the n-aMCI group. Fornix fiber tract length (FTL) was associated with better executive function, more strongly in the n-aMCI than in the HC group, and with better memory, more strongly in the HC than in the n-aMCI group. These results highlight a decline in the contributions of the fornix to cognition in n-aMCI and suggest that maintenance of fornix FTL is essential for sustaining executive functioning in people with n-aMCI.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63266">Dissecting the DNA binding landscape and gene regulatory network of p63 and p53</a></h4>

The transcription factor p53 is the best-known tumor suppressor, but its sibling p63 is a master regulator of epidermis development and a key oncogenic driver in squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). Despite multiple gene expression studies becoming available, the limited overlap of reported p63-dependent genes has made it difficult to decipher the p63 gene regulatory network. Particularly, analyses of p63 response elements differed substantially among the studies. To address this intricate data situation, we provide an integrated resource that enables assessing the p63-dependent regulation of any human gene of interest. We use a novel iterative <i>de novo</i> motif search approach in conjunction with extensive ChIP-seq data to achieve a precise global distinction between p53 and p63 binding sites, recognition motifs, and potential co-factors. We integrate these data with enhancer:gene associations to predict p63 target genes and identify those that are commonly de-regulated in SCC representing candidates for prognosis and therapeutic interventions.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61271">Fitness variation across subtle environmental perturbations reveals local modularity and global pleiotropy of adaptation</a></h4>

Building a genotype-phenotype-fitness map of adaptation is a central goal in evolutionary biology. It is difficult even when adaptive mutations are known because it is hard to enumerate which phenotypes make these mutations adaptive. We address this problem by first quantifying how the fitness of hundreds of adaptive yeast mutants responds to subtle environmental shifts. We then model the number of phenotypes these mutations collectively influence by decomposing these patterns of fitness variation. We find that a small number of inferred phenotypes can predict fitness of the adaptive mutations near their original glucose-limited evolution condition. Importantly, inferred phenotypes that matter little to fitness at or near the evolution condition can matter strongly in distant environments. This suggests that adaptive mutations are locally modular—affecting a small number of phenotypes that matter to fitness in the environment where they evolved—yet globally pleiotropic—affecting additional phenotypes that may reduce or improve fitness in new environments.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60628">Amplitude modulations of cortical sensory responses in pulsatile evidence accumulation</a></h4>

How does the brain internally represent a sequence of sensory information that jointly drives a decision-making behavior? Studies of perceptual decision-making have often assumed that sensory cortices provide noisy but otherwise veridical sensory inputs to downstream processes that accumulate and drive decisions. However, sensory processing in even the earliest sensory cortices can be systematically modified by various external and internal contexts. We recorded from neuronal populations across posterior cortex as mice performed a navigational decision-making task based on accumulating randomly timed pulses of visual evidence. Even in V1, only a small fraction of active neurons had sensory-like responses time-locked to each pulse. Here we focus on how these 'cue-locked' neurons exhibited a variety of amplitude modulations from sensory to cognitive, notably by choice and accumulated evidence. These task-related modulations affected a large fraction of cue-locked neurons across posterior cortex, suggesting that future models of behavior should account for such influences.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60299">Central processing of leg proprioception in <i>Drosophila</i></a></h4>

Proprioception, the sense of self-movement and position, is mediated by mechanosensory neurons that detect diverse features of body kinematics. Although proprioceptive feedback is crucial for accurate motor control, little is known about how downstream circuits transform limb sensory information to guide motor output. Here, we investigate neural circuits in <i>Drosophila </i>that process proprioceptive information from the fly leg. We identify three cell-types from distinct developmental lineages that are positioned to receive input from proprioceptor subtypes encoding tibia position, movement, and vibration. 13Bα neurons encode femur-tibia joint angle and mediate postural changes in tibia position. 9Aα neurons also drive changes in leg posture, but encode a combination of directional movement, high frequency vibration, and joint angle. Activating 10Bα neurons, which encode tibia vibration at specific joint angles, elicits pausing in walking flies. Altogether, our results reveal that central circuits integrate information across proprioceptor subtypes to construct complex sensorimotor representations that mediate diverse behaviors, including reflexive control of limb posture and detection of leg vibration.

Sciatic nerve crush injury triggers sterile inflammation within the distal nerve and axotomized dorsal root ganglia (DRGs). Granulocytes and pro-inflammatory Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes infiltrate the nerve first, and rapidly give way to Ly6C<sup>negative</sup> inflammation-resolving macrophages. In axotomized DRGs, few hematogenous leukocytes are detected and resident macrophages acquire a ramified morphology. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of injured sciatic nerve identifies five macrophage subpopulations, repair Schwann cells, and mesenchymal precursor cells. Macrophages at the nerve crush site are molecularly distinct from macrophages associated with Wallerian degeneration. In the injured nerve, macrophages 'eat' apoptotic leukocytes, a process called efferocytosis, and thereby promote an anti-inflammatory milieu. Myeloid cells in the injured nerve, but not axotomized DRGs, strongly express receptors for the cytokine GM-CSF. In GM-CSF deficient (<i>Csf2</i><i><sup>-/-</sup></i>) mice, inflammation resolution is delayed and conditioning-lesion induced regeneration of DRG neuron central axons is abolished. Thus, carefully orchestrated inflammation resolution in the nerve is required for conditioning-lesion induced neurorepair.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59404">Massively multiplex single-molecule oligonucleosome footprinting</a></h4>

Our understanding of the beads-on-a-string arrangement of nucleosomes has been built largely on high-resolution sequence-agnostic imaging methods and sequence-resolved bulk biochemical techniques. To bridge the divide between these approaches, we present the single-molecule adenine methylated oligonucleosome sequencing assay (SAMOSA). SAMOSA is a high-throughput single-molecule sequencing method that combines adenine methyltransferase footprinting and single-molecule real-time DNA sequencing to natively and nondestructively measure nucleosome positions on individual chromatin fibres. SAMOSA data allows unbiased classification of single-molecular 'states' of nucleosome occupancy on individual chromatin fibres. We leverage this to estimate nucleosome regularity and spacing on single chromatin fibres genome-wide, at predicted transcription factor binding motifs, and across both active and silent human epigenomic domains. Our analyses suggest that chromatin is comprised of a diverse array of both regular and irregular single-molecular oligonucleosome patterns that differ subtly in their relative abundance across epigenomic domains. This irregularity is particularly striking in constitutive heterochromatin, which has typically been viewed as a conformationally static entity. Our proof-of-concept study provides a powerful new methodology for studying nucleosome organization at a previously intractable resolution, and offers up new avenues for modeling and visualizing higher-order chromatin structure.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58662">Functional partitioning of a liquid-like organelle during assembly of axonemal dyneins</a></h4>

Ciliary motility is driven by axonemal dyneins that are assembled in the cytoplasm before deployment to cilia. Motile ciliopathy can result from defects in the dyneins themselves or from defects in factors required for their cytoplasmic pre-assembly. Recent work demonstrates that axonemal dyneins, their specific assembly factors, and broadly acting chaperones are concentrated in liquid-like organelles in the cytoplasm called DynAPs (Dynein Axonemal Particles). Here, we use <i>in vivo</i> imaging in <i>Xenopus</i> to show that inner dynein arm (IDA) and outer dynein arm (ODA) subunits are partitioned into non-overlapping sub-regions within DynAPs. Using affinity purification mass-spectrometry of <i>in vivo</i> interaction partners, we also identify novel partners for inner and outer dynein arms. Among these, we identify C16orf71/Daap1 as a novel axonemal dynein regulator. Daap1 interacts with ODA subunits, localizes specifically to the cytoplasm, is enriched in DynAPs, and is required for the deployment of ODAs to axonemes. Our work reveals a new complexity in the structure and function of a cell-type specific liquid-like organelle that is directly relevant to human genetic disease.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/48957">Layer 6 ensembles can selectively regulate the behavioral impact and layer-specific representation of sensory deviants</a></h4>

Predictive models can enhance the salience of unanticipated input. Here, we tested a key potential node in neocortical model formation in this process, layer (L) 6, using behavioral, electrophysiological and imaging methods in mouse primary somatosensory neocortex. We found that deviant stimuli enhanced tactile detection and were encoded in L2/3 neural tuning. To test the contribution of L6, we applied weak optogenetic drive that changed which L6 neurons were sensory responsive, without affecting overall firing rates in L6 or L2/3. This stimulation selectively suppressed behavioral sensitivity to deviant stimuli, without impacting baseline performance. This stimulation also eliminated deviance encoding in L2/3 but did not impair basic stimulus responses across layers. In contrast, stronger L6 drive inhibited firing and suppressed overall sensory function. These findings indicate that, despite their sparse activity, specific ensembles of stimulus driven L6 neurons are required to form neocortical predictions, and to realize their behavioral benefit.

We present a novel method to map the functional organization of the human auditory cortex noninvasively using magnetoencephalography (MEG). More specifically, this method estimates via reverse correlation the spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRF) in response to a dense pure tone stimulus, from which important spectrotemporal characteristics of neuronal processing can be extracted and mapped back onto the cortex surface. We show that several neuronal populations can be found examining the spectrotemporal characteristics of their STRFs, and demonstrate how these can be used to generate tonotopic gradient maps. In doing so, we show that the spatial resolution of MEG is sufficient to reliably extract important information about the spatial organization of the auditory cortex, while enabling the analysis of complex temporal dynamics of auditory processing such as best temporal modulation rate and response latency given its excellent temporal resolution. Furthermore, because spectrotemporally dense auditory stimuli can be used with MEG, the time required to acquire the necessary data to generate tonotopic maps is significantly less for MEG than for other neuroimaging tools that acquire BOLD-like signals.

The hippocampus is critically important for a diverse range of cognitive processes, such as episodic memory, prospective memory, affective processing, and spatial navigation. The human hippocampus has been thought of as being solely functionally connected to a set of neocortical regions known as the default mode network (DMN), which supports self-referential cognition. Using individual-specific precision functional mapping of resting state fMRI data, we found the anterior hippocampus (head and body) to be preferentially connected to the DMN as expected. The hippocampal tail, however, was strongly preferentially connected to the parietal memory network (PMN), which supports goal-oriented cognition and stimulus recognition. This resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) anterior-posterior dichotomy was well-matched by differences in task deactivations and anatomical segmentations of the hippocampus. Task deactivations were localized to the head and body of the hippocampus (DMN), relatively sparing the tail (PMN). Anterior and posterior hippocampal connectivity was network-specific even though the DMN and PMN are interdigitated in medial parietal cortex. The functional dichotomization of the hippocampus into anterior DMN-connected and posterior PMN-connected parcels suggests parallel, but distinct circuits between the hippocampus and medial parietal cortex for self vs. goal-oriented processing.

As cumulating evidence points to a wider range of functional tasks and neurological conditions that involve the cerebellum than previously known, the interest for examining the cerebellum with non-invasive neuroimaging techniques is growing. However, the standard methods of computational neuroanatomy for segmenting and reconstructing the cerebral cortex work poorly for the cerebellar cortex at the resolutions attainable with contemporary MRI technology because of its extremely intricate folding, making detailed and topologically correct reconstructions of the geometry of the cerebellar cortical surface unfeasible. Recently, a detailed surface reconstruction of the human cerebellar cortex was achieved from an ex-vivo specimen. These novel anatomical data enable a new reconstruction technique where this detailed surface reconstruction is morphed to subject space based on standard in-vivo MRI data. The result is an approximate reconstruction of the cerebellar cortex that requires only standard-resolution MRI data and can be used e.g., in functional neuroimaging, for integrating topographic population data or for visualizing topographic data on flattened surface patches.

Biologically-informed neural networks (BINNs), an extension of physics-informed neural networks [1], are introduced and used to discover the underlying dynamics of biological systems from sparse experimental data. In the present work, BINNs are trained in a supervised learning framework to approximate <i>in vitro</i> cell biology assay experiments while respecting a generalized form of the governing reaction-diffusion partial differential equation (PDE). By allowing the diffusion and reaction terms to be multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), the nonlinear forms of these terms can be learned while simultaneously converging to the solution of the governing PDE. Further, the trained MLPs are used to guide the selection of biologically interpretable mechanistic forms of the PDE terms which provides new insights into the biological and physical mechanisms that govern the dynamics of the observed system. The method is evaluated on sparse real-world data from wound healing assays with varying initial cell densities [2].<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZSkf13jhNqo" width="1" />

The propagation of epileptic seizure activity in the brain is a widespread pathophysiology that, in principle, should yield to intervention techniques guided by mathematical models of neuronal ensemble dynamics. During a seizure, neural activity will deviate from its current dynamical regime to one in which there are significant signal fluctuations. <i>In silico</i> treatments of neural activity are an important tool for the understanding of how the healthy brain can maintain stability, as well as of how pathology can lead to seizures. The hope is that, contained within the mathematical foundations of such treatments, there lie potential strategies for mitigating instabilities, e.g. via external stimulation. Here, we demonstrate that the dynamic causal modelling neuronal state equation generalises to a Fokker-Planck formalism if one extends the framework to model the ways in which activity propagates along the structural connections of neural systems. Using the Jacobian of this generalised state equation, we show that an initially unstable system can be rendered stable via a reduction in diffusivity–i.e., by lowering the rate at which neuronal fluctuations disperse to neighbouring regions. We show, for neural systems prone to epileptic seizures, that such a reduction in diffusivity can be achieved via external stimulation. Specifically, we show that this stimulation should be applied in such a way as to temporarily mirror the activity profile of a pathological region in its functionally connected areas. This counter-intuitive method is intended to be used pre-emptively–i.e., in order to mitigate the effects of the seizure, or ideally even prevent it from occurring in the first place. We offer proof of principle using simulations based on functional neuroimaging data collected from patients with idiopathic generalised epilepsy, in which we successfully suppress pathological activity in a distinct sub-network prior to seizure onset. Our hope is that this technique can form the basis for future real-time monitoring and intervention devices that are capable of treating epilepsy in a non-invasive manner.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aiaevvSfjSY" width="1" />

Pathogens such as <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> advantageously modify animal host physiology, for example, by inhibiting host protein synthesis. Translational inhibition of insects and mammalian hosts by <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> utilizes the well-known exotoxin A effector. However, for the infection of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> by <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i>, the precise pathways and mechanism(s) of translational inhibition are not well understood. We found that upon exposure to <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> PA14, <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> undergoes a rapid loss of intact ribosomes accompanied by the accumulation of ribosomes cleaved at helix 69 (H69) of the 26S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), a key part of ribosome decoding center. H69 cleavage is elicited by certain virulent <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> isolates in a quorum sensing (QS)–dependent manner and independently of exotoxin A–mediated translational repression. H69 cleavage is antagonized by the 3 major host defense pathways defined by the <i>pmk-1</i>, <i>fshr-1</i>, and <i>zip-2</i> genes. The level of H69 cleavage increases with the bacterial exposure time, and it is predominantly localized in the worm’s intestinal tissue. Genetic and genomic analysis suggests that H69 cleavage leads to the activation of the worm’s <i>zip-2</i>-mediated defense response pathway, consistent with translational inhibition. Taken together, our observations suggest that <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> deploys a virulence mechanism to induce ribosome degradation and H69 cleavage of host ribosomes. In this manner, <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> would impair host translation and block antibacterial responses.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/EOwlxU_Y4R4" width="1" />

<p>The backpropagation algorithm is an invaluable tool for training artificial
neural networks; however, because of a weight sharing requirement, it does not
provide a plausible model of brain function. Here, in the context of a
two-layer network, we derive an algorithm for training a neural network which
avoids this problem by not requiring explicit error computation and
backpropagation. Furthermore, our algorithm maps onto a neural network that
bears a remarkable resemblance to the connectivity structure and learning rules
of the cortex. We find that our algorithm empirically performs comparably to
backprop on a number of datasets.

<p>A connectome is a map of the structural and/or functional connections in the
brain. This information-rich representation has the potential to transform our
understanding of the relationship between patterns in brain connectivity and
neurological processes, disorders, and diseases. However, existing
computational techniques used to analyze connectomes are often insufficient for
interrogating multi-subject connectomics datasets. Several methods are either
solely designed to analyze single connectomes, or leverage heuristic graph
invariants that ignore the complete topology of connections between brain
regions. To enable more rigorous comparative connectomics analysis, we
introduce robust and interpretable statistical methods motivated by recent
theoretical advances in random graph models. These methods enable simultaneous
analysis of multiple connectomes across different scales of network topology,
facilitating the discovery of hierarchical brain structures that vary in
relation with phenotypic profiles. We validated these methods through extensive
simulation studies, as well as synthetic and real-data experiments. Using a set
of high-resolution connectomes obtained from genetically distinct mouse strains
(including the BTBR mouse -- a standard model of autism -- and three behavioral
wild-types), we show that these methods uncover valuable latent information in
multi-subject connectomics data and yield novel insights into the connective
correlates of neurological phenotypes.

<p>During slow-wave sleep, the brain is in a self-organized regime in which slow
oscillations (SOs) between up- and down-states propagate across the cortex.
Here we address how SOs emerge locally and can recruit large parts of the
brain. A whole-brain model that produces bistable states and adaptation-induced
SOs is fit to fMRI and EEG data using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm.
Optimal fits are found at critical values of the adaptation strength where the
model produces a wide range of local and global SOs with realistic statistics.
Local oscillations are more frequent, last shorter, and have a lower amplitude.
Global oscillations spread as waves of silence across the brain. The well-known
directionality of propagation from anterior to posterior regions is explained
by heterogeneities of the connectome. Our results demonstrate the applicability
of whole-brain models beyond the resting-state and their potential for
elucidating the spatiotemporal patterns of brain oscillations in general.

<p>Over a century ago, Ivan P. Pavlov, in a classic experiment, demonstrated how
dogs can learn to associate a ringing bell with food, thereby causing a ring to
result in salivation. Today, however, it is rare to find the use of Pavlovian
type associative learning for artificial intelligence (AI) applications.
Instead, other biologically-inspired learning concepts, in particular
artificial neural networks (ANNs) have flourished, yielding extensive impact on
a wide range of fields including finance, healthcare and transportation.
However, learning in such "conventional" ANNs, in particular in the form of
modern deep neural networks (DNNs) are usually carried out using the
backpropagation method, is computationally and energy intensive. Here we report
the experimental demonstration of backpropagation-free learning, achieved using
a single (or monadic) associative hardware element. This is realized on an
integrated photonic platform using phase change materials combined with on-chip
cascaded directional couplers. We link associative learning with supervised
learning, based on their common goal of associating certain inputs with
"correct" outputs. We then expand the concept to develop larger-scale
supervised learning networks using our monadic Pavlovian photonic hardware,
developing a distinct machine-learning framework based on single-element
associations and, importantly, using backpropagation-free single-layer weight
architectures to approach general learning tasks. Our approach not only
significantly reduces the computational burden imposed by learning in
conventional neural network approaches, thereby increasing speed and decreasing
energy use during learning, but also offers higher bandwidth inherent to a
photonic implementation, paving the way for future deployment of fast photonic
artificially intelligent machines.

<p>As its width tends to infinity, a deep neural network's behavior under
gradient descent can become simplified and predictable (e.g. given by the
Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)), if it is parametrized appropriately (e.g. the NTK
parametrization). However, we show that the standard and NTK parametrizations
of a neural network do not admit infinite-width limits that can learn features,
which is crucial for pretraining and transfer learning such as with BERT. We
propose simple modifications to the standard parametrization to allow for
feature learning in the limit. Using the *Tensor Programs* technique, we derive
explicit formulas for such limits. On Word2Vec and few-shot learning on
Omniglot via MAML, two canonical tasks that rely crucially on feature learning,
we compute these limits exactly. We find that they outperform both NTK
baselines and finite-width networks, with the latter approaching the
infinite-width feature learning performance as width increases.
</p>
<p>More generally, we classify a natural space of neural network
parametrizations that generalizes standard, NTK, and Mean Field
parametrizations. We show 1) any parametrization in this space either admits
feature learning or has an infinite-width training dynamics given by kernel
gradient descent, but not both; 2) any such infinite-width limit can be
computed using the Tensor Programs technique.

<p>Though deep learning models have taken on commercial and political relevance,
many aspects of their training and operation remain poorly understood. This has
sparked interest in "science of deep learning" projects, many of which are run
at scale and require enormous amounts of time, money, and electricity. But how
much of this research really needs to occur at scale? In this paper, we
introduce MNIST-1D: a minimalist, low-memory, and low-compute alternative to
classic deep learning benchmarks. The training examples are 20 times smaller
than MNIST examples yet they differentiate more clearly between linear,
nonlinear, and convolutional models which attain 32, 68, and 94% accuracy
respectively (these models obtain 94, 99+, and 99+% on MNIST). Then we present
example use cases which include measuring the spatial inductive biases of
lottery tickets, observing deep double descent, and metalearning an activation
function.

<p>Simultaneously visualizing the decision and objective space of continuous
multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) recently provided key
contributions in understanding the structure of their landscapes. For the sake
of advancing these recent findings, we compiled all state-of-the-art
visualization methods in a single R-package (moPLOT). Moreover, we extended
these techniques to handle three-dimensional decision spaces and propose two
solutions for visualizing the resulting volume of data points. This enables -
for the first time - to illustrate the landscape structures of
three-dimensional MOPs.
</p>
<p>However, creating these visualizations using the aforementioned framework
still lays behind a high barrier of entry for many people as it requires basic
skills in R. To enable any user to create and explore MOP landscapes using
moPLOT, we additionally provide a dashboard that allows to compute the
state-of-the-art visualizations for a wide variety of common benchmark
functions through an interactive (web-based) user interface.

<p>Electricity load forecasting enables the grid operators to optimally
implement the smart grid's most essential features such as demand response and
energy efficiency. Electricity demand profiles can vary drastically from one
region to another on diurnal, seasonal and yearly scale. Hence to devise a load
forecasting technique that can yield the best estimates on diverse datasets,
specially when the training data is limited, is a big challenge. This paper
presents a deep learning architecture for short-term load forecasting based on
bidirectional sequential models in conjunction with feature engineering that
extracts the hand-crafted derived features in order to aid the model for better
learning and predictions. In the proposed architecture, named as Deep Derived
Feature Fusion (DeepDeFF), the raw input and hand-crafted features are trained
at separate levels and then their respective outputs are combined to make the
final prediction. The efficacy of the proposed methodology is evaluated on
datasets from five countries with completely different patterns. The results
demonstrate that the proposed technique is superior to the existing state of
the art.

<p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are efficient computation models to perform
spatio-temporal pattern recognition on {resource}- and {power}-constrained
platforms. SNNs executed on neuromorphic hardware can further reduce energy
consumption of these platforms. With increasing model size and complexity,
mapping SNN-based applications to tile-based neuromorphic hardware is becoming
increasingly challenging. This is attributed to the limitations of
neuro-synaptic cores, viz. a crossbar, to accommodate only a fixed number of
pre-synaptic connections per post-synaptic neuron. For complex SNN-based models
that have many neurons and pre-synaptic connections per neuron, (1) connections
may need to be pruned after training to fit onto the crossbar resources,
leading to a loss in model quality, e.g., accuracy, and (2) the neurons and
synapses need to be partitioned and placed on the neuro-sypatic cores of the
hardware, which could lead to increased latency and energy consumption. In this
work, we propose (1) a novel unrolling technique that decomposes a neuron
function with many pre-synaptic connections into a sequence of homogeneous
neural units to significantly improve the crossbar utilization and retain all
pre-synaptic connections, and (2) SpiNeMap, a novel methodology to map SNNs on
neuromorphic hardware with an aim to minimize energy consumption and spike
latency.

<p>Currently, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) are used to solve all
kinds of problems in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence
due to their learning and adaptation capabilities. However, most successful
DCNN models have a high computational complexity making them difficult to
deploy on mobile or embedded platforms. This problem has prompted many
researchers to develop algorithms and approaches to help reduce the
computational complexity of such models. One of them is called filter pruning,
where convolution filters are eliminated to reduce the number of parameters
and, consequently, the computational complexity of the given model. In the
present work, we propose a novel algorithm to perform filter pruning by using
Multi-Objective Evolution Strategy (ES) algorithm, called DeepPruningES. Our
approach avoids the need for using any knowledge during the pruning procedure
and helps decision-makers by returning three pruned CNN models with different
trade-offs between performance and computational complexity. We show that
DeepPruningES can significantly reduce a model's computational complexity by
testing it on three DCNN architectures: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),
Residual Neural Networks (ResNets), and Densely Connected Neural Networks
(DenseNets).

<p>When globally optimal solutions of complicated optimization problems cannot
be located by evolutionary algorithms (EAs) in polynomial expected running
time, the hitting time/running time analysis is not flexible enough to
accommodate the requirement of theoretical study, because sometimes we have no
idea on what approximation ratio is available in polynomial expected running
time. Thus, it is necessary to propose an alternative routine for the
theoretical analysis of EAs. To bridge the gap between theoretical analysis and
algorithm implementation, in this paper we perform an error analysis where
expected approximation error is estimated to evaluate performances of
randomized search heuristics (RSHs). Based on the Markov chain model of RSHs,
the multi-step transition matrix can be computed by diagonalizing the one-step
transition matrix, and a general framework for estimation of expected
approximation errors is proposed. Case studies indicate that the error analysis
works well for both uni- and multi-modal benchmark problems. It leads to
precise estimations of approximation error instead of asymptotic results on
fitness values, which demonstrates its competitiveness to fixed budget
analysis.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03532">Biologically-inspired Salience Affected Artificial Neural Network (SANN). (arXiv:1908.03532v5 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</a></h4>

<p>In this paper we introduce a novel Salience Affected Artificial Neural
Network (SANN) that models the way neuromodulators such as dopamine and
noradrenaline affect neural dynamics in the human brain by being distributed
diffusely through neocortical regions, allowing both salience signals to
modulate cognition immediately, and one time learning to take place through
strengthening entire patterns of activation at one go. We present a model that
is capable of one-time salience tagging in a neural network trained to classify
objects, and returns a salience response during classification (inference). We
explore the effects of salience on learning via its effect on the activation
functions of each node, as well as on the strength of weights between nodes in
the network. We demonstrate that salience tagging can improve classification
confidence for both the individual image as well as the class of images it
belongs to. We also show that the computation impact of producing a salience
response is minimal. This research serves as a proof of concept, and could be
the first step towards introducing salience tagging into Deep Learning Networks
and robotics.

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2: SARS-CoV-2), which originated from Wuhan, China, has spread to the other countries in a short period of time. We report a 47-year-old male who was admitted to our hospital due to suffering from progressive vertigo and ataxia for 7 days prior to the admission. Neurological examination revealed cerebellar dysfunction, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) depicted edema of the cerebellar hemisphere associated with leptomeningeal enhancement. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed mild lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and lactate dehydrogenase. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal and CSF specimens. As a result, treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir was initiated, and patient symptoms and signs improved significantly during the course of hospitalization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of acute cerebellitis associated with COVID-19 disease which is reported in the literature so far.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD) can be associated with impaired cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) and poor clinical outcome, but whether this holds true for patients with diffuse glioma is unknown. With blood oxygenation level–dependent (BOLD)-CVR imaging, we determined the presence of CCD in patients with diffuse glioma and investigated its relationship with cerebrovascular reactivity and clinical outcome. For eighteen enrolled subjects (nineteen datasets) with diffuse glioma, CCD was deferred from BOLD-CVR using a predetermined cerebellar asymmetry index (CAI) cutoff value of 6.0%. A FET-PET study was done as a verification of the CCD diagnosis. BOLD-CVR values as well as clinical performance scores (i.e., Karnofsky performance score (KPS), disability rating scale (DRS), and modified Rankin scale (mRS)) by BOLD-CVR scan at 3-month clinical follow-up were assessed and compared for the CCD-positive and CCD-negative group. CCD was present in 26.3% of subjects and strongly associated with impaired BOLD-CVR of the affected (i.e., the hemisphere harboring the glioma) and unaffected supratentorial hemisphere (CCD(+) vs. CCD(−): 0.08 ± 0.11 vs. 0.18 ± 0.04; <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.007 and 0.08 ± 0.12 vs. 0.19 ± 0.04; <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.007, respectively). This finding was independent of tumor volume (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.48). Furthermore, poorer initial (by scan) clinical performance scores at follow-up were found for the CCD(+) group. The presence of crossed cerebellar diaschisis in patients with diffuse glioma is associated with impaired supratentorial cerebrovascular reactivity and worse clinical outcome.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is primarily characterized by migraine, stroke, mood disturbances, and cognitive decline. Ataxia has seldom been reported as a presenting symptom. Here, we review reports of CADASIL presenting as ataxia and compare these to the first pathologically confirmed case of CADASIL presenting with progressive ataxia. A 50-year-old woman presented with progressive truncal ataxia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed white matter hyperintensities in the bilateral anterior temporal lobes, external capsules, and periventricular areas, but not the cerebellum. Electron microscopy of skin biopsy material revealed multiple granular osmiophilic materials. Genetic testing confirmed a c.4552C &gt; A mutation in exon 25 of the <em class="a-plus-plus">NOTCH3</em> gene. CADASIL is a rare cause of progressive ataxia, and only four cases of CADASIL presenting with ataxia have been reported in the literature. We also discuss the possible pathophysiology of cerebellar ataxia associated with CADASIL.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Balance control is essential to maintain a stable body position and to prevent falls. The aim of this study was to determine whether balance control could be improved by using cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and visual feedback in a combined approach. A total of 90 healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to six groups defined by the delivery of tDCS (cathodal or anodal or sham) and the provision or not of visual feedback on balance during the acquisition phase. tDCS was delivered over the cerebellar hemisphere ipsilateral to the dominant leg for 20 min at 2 mA during a unipedal stance task. Body sway (i.e., ankle angle and hip position) was measured as an overall maximal unit in anteroposterior and mediolateral direction, together with participant rating of perception of stability, before (baseline), during (acquisition), and after (final) the intervention. We found a reduction in body sway during the acquisition session when visual feedback alone was provided. When the visual feedback was removed (final session), however, body sway increased above baseline. Differently, the reduction in overall maximal body sway was maintained during the final session when the delivery of cathodal tDCS and visual feedback was combined. These findings suggest that cathodal tDCS may support the short-term maintenance of the positive effects of visual feedback on balance and provide the basis for a new approach to optimize balance control, with potential translational implications for the elderly and patients with impaired posture control.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Predictive coding accounts of action perception sustain that kinematics information is compared with contextual top-down predictions (i.e., priors) to understand actions in conditions of perceptual ambiguity. It has been previously shown that the cerebellum contributes to motor simulation of observed actions. Here, we tested the hypothesis that a specific contribution of the cerebellum to action perception is to provide contextual priors that guide the sampling of perceptual kinematic information. To this aim, we compared the performance of 42 patients with childhood brain tumor affecting infratentorial (ITT) or supratentorial (STT) areas with that of peers with typical development in an action prediction task. First, participants were exposed to videos depicting a child performing different reaching-to-grasp actions, which were associated with contextual cues in a probabilistic fashion. Then, they were presented with shortened versions of the same videos and asked to infer the action outcome; since kinematics was ambiguous, we expected their responses would be biased toward the previously learned contextual priors. We found that patients with brain tumor were impaired in predicting actions when compared to healthy controls. However, STT patients presented a reliable probabilistic effect, while ITT patients, who had cerebellar damage, did not rely on contextual priors in predicting actions. Furthermore, we found an association between the use of contextual priors and the ability to infer others’ mental states as assessed by a standardized test. These results suggest that the cerebellum provides contextual priors to understand others’ actions and this predictive function might underlie complex social cognition abilities.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Difficulties in gait and balance disorders are among the most common mobility limitations in multiple sclerosis (MS), mainly due to a damage of cerebellar circuits. Moreover, the cerebellum plays a critical role in promoting new motor tasks, which is an essential function for neurorehabilitation. In this study, we investigated the effects of cerebellar intermittent theta burst stimulation (c-iTBS), a high-frequency rTMS protocol able to increase cerebellar activity, on gait and balance in a sample of 20 hospitalized participants with MS, undergoing vestibular rehabilitation (VR), an exercise-based program primarily designed to reduce vertigo and dizziness, gaze instability, and/or imbalance and falls in MS. Patients were assigned to receive either c-iTBS or sham iTBS before being treated with VR during 2 weeks. VR consisted of two types of training: gaze stability and postural stability exercises. The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline in the Tinetti Balance and Gait scale (TBG). The secondary outcome measures were changes from baseline in Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Two Minute Walking Test (2MWT), and Timed 25-ft walk test (T25FW) scales. MS patients treated with c-iTBS-VR showed a significant improvement in the TBG as compared to patients treated with sham iTBS-VR. Moreover, MS patients in the c-iTBS groups showed better performances in the vestibular-ocular reflex exercises. Combined c-iTBS and VR improves gait and balance abilities more than standard VR treatment in MS patients with a high level of disability.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Response inhibition as an executive function refers to the ability to suppress inappropriate but prepotent responses. Several brain regions have been implicated in the process underlying inhibitory control, including the cerebellum. The aim of the present study was to explore the role of the cerebellum in executive functioning, particularly in response inhibition. For this purpose, we transitorily inhibited cerebellar activity by means of cathodal tDCS and studied the effects of this inhibition on ERP components elicited during a Go/NoGo task in healthy subjects. Sixteen healthy subjects underwent a Go/NoGo task prior to and after cathodal and sham cerebellar tDCS in separate sessions. A reduction in N2-NoGo amplitude and a prolongation in N2-NoGo latency emerged after cathodal tDCS whereas no differences were detected after sham stimulation. Moreover, commission errors in NoGo trials were significantly higher after cathodal tDCS than at the basal evaluation. No differences emerged between performances in Go trials and those after sham stimulation. These data indicate that cerebellar inhibition following cathodal stimulation alters the ability to allocate attentional resources to stimuli containing conflict information and the inhibitory control. The cerebellum may regulate the attentional mechanisms of stimulus orientation and inhibitory control both directly, by making predictions of errors or behaviors related to errors, and indirectly, by controlling the functioning of the cerebral cortical areas involved in the perception of conflict signals and of the basal ganglia involved in the inhibitory control of movement.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Two recent studies have demonstrated that the dendritic Ca<sup class="a-plus-plus">2+</sup> signal associated with a climbing fibre (CF) input to the cerebellar Purkinje neuron (PN) depends on the membrane potential (<em class="a-plus-plus">V</em><sub class="a-plus-plus">m</sub>). Specifically, when the cell is hyperpolarised, this signal is mediated by T-type voltage-gated Ca<sup class="a-plus-plus">2+</sup> channels; in contrast, when the cell is firing, the CF-PN signal is mediated by P/Q-type voltage-gated Ca<sup class="a-plus-plus">2+</sup> channels.

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The objective of this study was to investigate lobule-specific cerebellar structural alterations relevant to clinical behavioral characteristics of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). We performed a case-control study of 21 Japanese individuals with PWS (age; median 21.0, range 13–50 years, 14 males, 7 females) and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy controls with typical development. Participants underwent 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging. Three-dimensional T<sub class="a-plus-plus">1</sub>-weighted images were assessed for cerebellar lobular volume and adjusted for total intracerebellar volume (TIV) using a spatially unbiased atlas template to give a relative volume ratio. A region of interest analysis included the deep cerebellar nuclei. A correlation analysis was performed between the volumetric data and the clinical behavioral scores derived from the standard questionnaires (hyperphagia, autism, obsession, and maladaptive index) for global intelligence assessment in paired subgroups. In individuals with PWS, TIV was significantly reduced compared with that of controls (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.05, family-wise error corrected; mean [standard deviation], 1014.1 [93.0] mm<sup class="a-plus-plus">3</sup>). Decreased relative lobular volume ratios were observed in posterior inferior lobules with age, sex, and TIV as covariates (Crus I, Crus II, lobules VIIb, VIIIa, VIIIb, and IX). However, increased ratios were found in the dentate nuclei bilaterally in individuals with PWS (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.01); the mean (standard deviation) × 10<sup class="a-plus-plus">−3</sup> was as follows: left, 1.58 (0.26); right, 1.67 (0.30). The altered lobular volume ratios showed negative correlations with hyperphagic and autistic characteristics and positive correlations with obsessive and intellectual characteristics. This study provides the first objective evidence of topographic patterns of volume differences in cerebellar structures consistent with clinical behavioral characteristics in individuals with PWS and strongly suggests a cerebellar contribution to altered functional brain connectivity in PWS.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Reading in children has been associated with microstructural properties of the cerebellar peduncles, the white matter pathways connecting the cerebellum to the cerebrum. In this study, we used two independent neuroimaging modalities to assess which features of the cerebellar peduncles would be associated with reading. Twenty-three 8-year-old children were evaluated on word reading efficiency and imaged using diffusion MRI (dMRI) and quantitative T1 relaxometry (qT1). We segmented the superior (SCP), middle, and inferior cerebellar peduncles and extracted two metrics: fractional anisotropy (FA) from dMRI and R1 from qT1. Tract-FA was significantly correlated with tract-R1 in left and right SCPs (left: <em class="a-plus-plus">r</em><sub class="a-plus-plus"><em class="a-plus-plus">P</em></sub>(21) = .63, right: <em class="a-plus-plus">r</em><sub class="a-plus-plus"><em class="a-plus-plus">P</em></sub>(21) = .76, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> ≤ .001) suggesting that FA of these peduncles, at least in part, indexed myelin content. Tract-FA and tract R1 were not correlated in the other cerebellar peduncles. Reading efficiency negatively correlated with tract-FA of the left (<em class="a-plus-plus">r</em><sub class="a-plus-plus"><em class="a-plus-plus">P</em></sub>(21) = − .43, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = .040) and right SCP (<em class="a-plus-plus">r</em><sub class="a-plus-plus"><em class="a-plus-plus">P</em></sub>(21) = − .37, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = .079). Reading efficiency did not correlate with tract-R1 in the SCPs. The negative association of reading efficiency with tract-FA and the lack of association of reading efficiency with tract-R1 implicate properties other than myelin content as relevant to the information flow between the cerebellum and the cerebrum for individual differences in reading skills in children.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Essential tremor (ET) has recently been reconceptualized by many as a degenerative disease of the cerebellum. Until now, though, there has been no attempt to frame it within the context of these diseases. Here, we compare the clinical and postmortem features of ET with other cerebellar degenerations, thereby placing it within the broader context of these diseases. Action tremor is the hallmark feature of ET. Although often underreported in the spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), action tremors occur, and it is noteworthy that in SCA12 and 15, they are highly prevalent, often severe, and can be the earliest disease manifestation, resulting in an initial diagnosis of ET in many cases. Intention tremor, sometimes referred to as “cerebellar tremor,” is a common feature of ET and many SCAs. Other features of cerebellar dysfunction, gait ataxia and eye motion abnormalities, are seen to a mild degree in ET and more markedly in SCAs. Several SCAs (e.g., SCA5, 6, 14, and 15), like ET, follow a milder and more protracted disease course. In ET, numerous postmortem changes have been localized to the cerebellum and are largely confined to the cerebellar cortex, preserving the cerebellar nuclei. Purkinje cell loss is modest. Similarly, in SCA3, 12, and 15, Purkinje cell loss is limited, and in SCA12 and 15, there is preservation of cerebellar nuclei and relative sparing of other central nervous system regions. Both clinically and pathologically, there are numerous similarities and intersection points between ET and other disorders of cerebellar degeneration.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels contribute to the resting membrane potential of many neurons and play an important role in controlling neuronal excitability. Although previous studies have revealed a high expression of GIRK subunits in the cerebellum, their functional role has never been clearly described. Using patch-clamp recordings in mice cerebellar slices, we examined the properties of the GIRK currents in Purkinje cells (PCs) and investigated the effects of a selective agonist of GIRK1-containing channels, ML297 (ML), on PC firing and synaptic plasticity. We demonstrated that GIRK channel activation decreases the PC excitability by inhibiting both sodium and calcium spikes and, in addition, modulates the complex spike response evoked by climbing fiber stimulation. Our results indicate that GIRK channels have also a marked effect on synaptic plasticity of the parallel fiber-PC synapse, as the application of ML297 increased the expression of LTP while preventing LTD. We, therefore, propose that the recruitment of GIRK channels represents a crucial mechanism by which neuromodulators can control synaptic strength and membrane conductance for proper refinement of the neural network involved in memory storage and higher cognitive functions.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Cerebellar involvement in major depressive disorder (MDD) has been demonstrated by a growing number of studies, but it is unknown whether cognitive functioning in depressed individuals is related to cerebellar gray matter volume (GMV) abnormalities. Impaired attention and executive dysfunction are characteristic cognitive deficits in MDD, and critically, they often persist despite remission of mood symptoms. In this study, we investigated cerebellar GMV in patients with remitted MDD (rMDD) that showed persistent cognitive impairment. We applied cerebellum-optimized voxel-based morphometry in 37 patients with rMDD and with cognitive deficits, in 12 patients with rMDD and without cognitive deficits, and in 36 healthy controls (HC). Compared with HC, rMDD patients with cognitive deficits had lower GMV in left area VIIA, crus II, and in vermal area VIIB. In patients with rMDD, regression analyses demonstrated significant associations between GMV reductions in both regions and impaired attention and executive dysfunction. Compared with HC, patients without cognitive deficits showed increased GMV in bilateral area VIIIB. This study supports cerebellar contributions to the cognitive dimension of MDD. The data also point towards cerebellar area VII as a potential target for non-invasive brain stimulation to treat cognitive deficits related to MDD.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The traditional view on the cerebellum is that it controls motor behavior. Although recent work has revealed that the cerebellum supports also nonmotor functions such as cognition and affect, only during the last 5 years it has become evident that the cerebellum also plays an important social role. This role is evident in social cognition based on interpreting goal-directed actions through the movements of individuals (social “mirroring”) which is very close to its original role in motor learning, as well as in social understanding of other individuals’ mental state, such as their intentions, beliefs, past behaviors, future aspirations, and personality traits (social “mentalizing”). Most of this mentalizing role is supported by the posterior cerebellum (e.g., Crus I and II). The most dominant hypothesis is that the cerebellum assists in learning and understanding social action sequences, and so facilitates social cognition by supporting optimal predictions about imminent or future social interaction and cooperation. This consensus paper brings together experts from different fields to discuss recent efforts in understanding the role of the cerebellum in social cognition, and the understanding of social behaviors and mental states by others, its effect on clinical impairments such as cerebellar ataxia and autism spectrum disorder, and how the cerebellum can become a potential target for noninvasive brain stimulation as a therapeutic intervention. We report on the most recent empirical findings and techniques for understanding and manipulating cerebellar circuits in humans. Cerebellar circuitry appears now as a key structure to elucidate social interactions.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a multifactorial disorder caused by environmental and genetic factors. Studies have shown that various single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the binding sites of microRNAs contribute to the risk of developing SCZ. We aimed to investigate whether the variants located in the 3′-UTR region of <em class="a-plus-plus">LIF</em> (rs929271T&gt;G) and <em class="a-plus-plus">ATF6B</em> (rs8283G&gt;A) were associated with increased susceptibility to SCZ in a population from the south-east of Iran. In this case-control study, a total of 396 subjects were recruited. SNPs were genotyped via polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Genotyping results showed that the G allele of rs929271 significantly increased the risk of SCZ (OR = 1.58 95%CI = 1.19–2.10, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.001). As for rs929271, the GG genotype of co-dominant (OR = 2.54 95%CI = 1.39–4.64, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.002) and recessive (OR = 2.91 95%CI = 1.77–4.80, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.001) models were strongly linked to SCZ. No significant differences were observed between rs8283 polymorphism and predisposition to SCZ. In silico analyses predicted that rs929271 might alter the binding sites of microRNAs, which was believed to have an unclear role in the development of SCZ. Moreover, rs929271 polymorphism changed the <em class="a-plus-plus">LIF</em>-mRNA folding structure. These findings provide fine pieces of evidence regarding the possible effects of <em class="a-plus-plus">LIF</em> polymorphism in the development of SCZ and regulation of the <em class="a-plus-plus">LIF</em> gene targeted by microRNAs.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus"><em class="a-plus-plus">TBL1XR1</em> is a member of the WD40 repeat-containing gene family. Mutations of <em class="a-plus-plus">TBL1XR1</em> have been reported in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Although the phenotypes of some patients have been described in single studies, few studies have reviewed the genotype and phenotype relationships using a relatively large cohort of patients with <em class="a-plus-plus">TBL1XR1</em> mutations. Herein, we report a new de novo frameshift mutation in <em class="a-plus-plus">TBL1XR1</em> (NM_024665.4, c.388_389delAC, p.T130Sfs*14) in a patient with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To explore the correlations between genotypes and phenotypes for <em class="a-plus-plus">TBL1XR1</em> in NDDs, we manually curated and analyzed 38 variants and the associated phenotypes from 50 individuals with NDDs. <em class="a-plus-plus">TBL1XR1</em> mutations lead to a wide range of phenotypic defects. We conclude that the most common phenotypes associated with <em class="a-plus-plus">TBL1XR1</em> mutations were language and motor developmental delay, intellectual disabilities, facial deformity, hypotonia, and microcephaly. Our study provides a comprehensive spectrum of neurodevelopmental phenotypes caused by <em class="a-plus-plus">TBL1XR1</em> mutations, which is important for genetic diagnosis and precision clinical management.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-linked recessive disease that causes acute or chronic hemolytic anemia and potentially leads to severe jaundice in response to oxidative agents. Capicua transcriptional repressor (CIC) is an important gene associated with mental retardation, autosomal dominant 45. Affiliated tissues including skin, brain, bone, and related phenotypes are intellectual disability and seizures. Clinical, biochemical, and whole exome analysis are carried out in a Turkish family. Mutation analysis of G6PD and CIC genes by Sanger sequencing in the whole family was carried out to reveal the effect of these mutations on the patient’s clinical outcome. Here, we present the case of epilepsy in an 8-year-old child with a hemizygous variation in G6PD gene and heterozygous mutation in CIC gene, resulting in focal epileptiform activity and hypsarrhythmia in electroencephalography (EEG), seizures, psychomotor retardation, speech impairment, intellectual disability, developmental regression, and learning difficulties. Whole exome sequencing confirmed the diagnosis of X-linked increased susceptibility for hemolytic anemia due to G6PD deficiency and mental retardation type 45 due to CIC variant, which explained the development of epileptic seizures. Considering CIC variant and relevant relation with the severity and course of the disease, G6PD mutations sustained through the family are defined as hereditary. Our findings could represent the importance of variants found in G6PD as well as CIC genes linked to the severity of epilepsy, which was presumed based on the significant changes in protein configuration.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Ketamine is a recreational drug that causes emotional and cognitive impairments, but its specific mechanisms of action are still unclear. Recent evidence suggests that Tau protein phosphorylation and targeted delivery to the postsynaptic area are closely related to its neurotoxicity, and our recent studies have shown that long-term ketamine administration causes excessive Tau protein phosphorylation. However, the regulatory mechanism of Tau protein phosphorylation induced by ketamine has not been clarified. In the present study, we administered a single ketamine injection and long-term (6 months) ketamine injections in C57BL/6 mice, to investigate the effects of different doses of ketamine on the expression levels of Tau protein and its phosphorylation, the expression levels and activities of the related protein phosphokinases GSK-3β and CDK5, and the expression levels and activities of the related protein phosphatases PP2A and PP2B in the mouse hippocampus. Our results showed that both single-dose and long-term ketamine administration induced excessive phosphorylation of the Tau protein at ser202/thr205 and ser396. A single ketamine administration caused an increase in the activity of GSK-3β (at high doses) and a decrease in the activity of PP2A. On the other hand, long-term ketamine administration resulted in an increase in the activities of GSK-3β (at high doses) and CDK5, and a decrease in the activity of PP2A. Our results indicate that GSK-3β, CDK5, and PP2A may be involved in ketamine-induced Tau protein phosphorylation.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">To understand the effect of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-SIRT1 (silent information regulator 1)-PPARγ coactivator-1α (PGC1α) signaling pathway on the cognitive function of sevoflurane-anesthetized aged rats. Aged rats were divided into Normal group, Sevo group (Sevoflurane anesthesia), Sevo + AICAR (the AMPK activator) group, Sevo + EX527 group (the AMPK inhibitor), and Sevo + AICAR + EX527 group. The cognitive function of rats was determined by the Morris water maze. Hippocampal neuronal apoptosis was evaluated by TUNEL and Fluoro-Jade C (FJC) staining, and the expression of cleaved caspase-3 was detected by immunohistochemistry. ROS, SOD, and MDA levels and the fluorescence intensity of GFAP in the hippocampus were assayed. The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), mitochondrial mass, ATP level, and the expression of AMPK-SIRT1-PGC1α were determined by the corresponding methods. Rats in the Sevo group manifested significant extension in the escape latency, with fewer platform crossings; and meanwhile, the apoptotic rate, the number of FJC-positive cells, and the fluorescence intensity of GFAP of neurons were elevated, with up-regulation of cleaved caspase-3. Moreover, the level of MDA and ROS was increased evidently, with significant down-regulation of SOD activity, ATP, mitochondrial mass and MMP levels, and AMPK, SIRT1 and PGC-1α protein expressions. However, sevoflurane-induced changes above were improved after the administration of AICAR, and EX527 could reverse AICAR-induced improvements in Sevo-anesthetized aged rats. Activating AMPK-SIRT1-PGC1α pathway can improve the cognitive function and mitigate the neuronal injury in Sevo-anesthetized aged rats by antagonizing the oxidative stress and maintaining the mitochondrial function.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Sepsis can induce acute and chronic changes in the central nervous system termed sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE). Not only cognitive deficits but also anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder are common in severe sepsis survivors. In this study, we demonstrated that amitriptyline, a classic tricyclic antidepressant, reduced sepsis-induced brain damage through the tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) signaling pathway. Amitriptyline ameliorated neuronal loss assessed by Nissl staining in a mouse cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)–induced sepsis model. Furthermore, amitriptyline reduced early gliosis assessed by immunofluorescence and late cognitive deficits assessed by the Morris water maze (MWM) test. Moreover, amitriptyline treatment attenuated oxidative stress indicated by less superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity consumption and malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation. Interestingly, those protective effects of amitriptyline could be abolished by GW441756, a TrkA signaling pathway inhibitor. Immunoblot directly showed that TrkA signaling pathway–associated proteins, such as Akt and GSK3β, were involved in the neuroprotective effects of amitriptyline. Thus, amitriptyline appears to be an encouraging candidate to treat cognitive deficits and depression after severe sepsis.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Endothelial dysfunction greatly contributes to microcirculation disorder. The role of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) in cerebral microcirculation was explored in vitro. LPS (0.5 or 1 μg/ml) was added to induce injury in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HCMEC/D3). CCK-8 was applied to check viabilities of HCMEC/D3 before and after LPS treatment. Western blot witnessed the changes in protein expressions of inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-α. Caspase-3/7 activity was analyzed and so were the protein expressions of pro-apoptotic gene BAX and anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2. mRNA expressions of eNOS and GTPCH1 were evaluated by RT-qPCR. After overexpressing eNOS or GTPCH1 in LPS-induced HCMEC/D3 cells, viabilities, inflammatory cytokines, caspase-3/7 activity, and apoptosis-related genes were detected. The modulation of PGE1 in eNOS and GTPCH1 production, viability, inflammation, and apoptosis was investigated. The inhibitor of eNOS or GTPCH1 was introduced to examine impacts of eNOS or GTPCH1 could have on the PGE1 function. LPS decreased cell viabilities, eNOS and GTPCH1 expression, and promoted inflammation and apoptosis in HCMEC/D3 cells. Overexpressed eNOS or GTPCH1 promoted cell viabilities and suppressed inflammation and apoptosis. PGE1 enhanced viability and decreased inflammation and apoptosis in cells treated by LPS. PGE1 activated eNOS and GTPCH1 and inhibition of eNOS or GTPCH1 led to the attenuation of the protective functions of PGE1 in LPS-induced cells. PGE1 protected HCMEC/D3 cells from injuries induced by LPS by activation of eNOS and GTPCH1, suggesting that PGE1 might be used to help maintain cerebral microcirculation in future.</p>

<p>Amyloid proteins are involved in many neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease [Tau, Amyloid β (Aβ)], Parkinson’s disease [alpha-synuclein (αSyn)], and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (TDP-43). Driven by the early observation of the presence of ordered structure within amyloid fibrils and the potential to develop inhibitors of their formation, a major goal of the amyloid field has been to elucidate the structure of the amyloid fold at atomic resolution. This has now been achieved for a wide variety of sequences using solid-state NMR, microcrystallography, X-ray fiber diffraction and cryo-electron microscopy. These studies, together with in silico methods able to predict aggregation-prone regions (APRs) in protein sequences, have provided a wealth of information about the ordered fibril cores that comprise the amyloid fold. Structural and kinetic analyses have also shown that amyloidogenic proteins often contain less well-ordered sequences outside of the amyloid core (termed here as flanking regions) that modulate function, toxicity and/or aggregation rates. These flanking regions, which often form a dynamically disordered “fuzzy coat” around the fibril core, have been shown to play key parts in the physiological roles of functional amyloids, including the binding of RNA and in phase separation. They are also the mediators of chaperone binding and membrane binding/disruption in toxic amyloid assemblies. Here, we review the role of flanking regions in different proteins spanning both functional amyloid and amyloid in disease, in the context of their role in aggregation, toxicity and cellular (dys)function. Understanding the properties of these regions could provide new opportunities to target disease-related aggregation without disturbing critical biological functions.</p>

<p>An outstanding chess player needs to accumulate massive visual and spatial information for chess configurations. Visual motion area (MT) is considered as a brain region specialized for visual motion perception and visuospatial attention processing. However, how long-term chess training shapes the functional connectivity patterns of MT, especially its functional subregions, has rarely been investigated. In our study, using resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) and Granger causality analysis (GCA), we studied the changed functional couplings of MT subregions between 28 chess master players and 27 gender- and age-matched healthy novices to reveal the neural basis of long-term professional chess training. RSFC analysis identified decreased functional connections between right dorsal-anterior subregion (CI1.R) and left angular gyrus, and increased functional connections between right ventral-anterior MT subregion (CI2.R) and right superior temporal gyrus in chess experts. Moreover, GCA analyses further found increased mutual interactions of left angular gyrus and CI1.R in chess experts compared to novice players. These findings demonstrate that long-term professional chess training could enhance spatial perception and reconfiguration and semantic processing efficiency for superior performance.</p>

<p>Signaling from the synapse to nucleus is mediated by the integration and propagation of both membrane potential changes (postsynaptic potentials) and intracellular second messenger cascades. The electrical propagation of postsynaptic potentials allows for rapid neural information processing, while propagating second messenger pathways link synaptic activity to the transcription of genes required for neuronal survival and adaptive changes (plasticity) underlying circuit formation and learning. The propagation of activity-induced calcium signals to the cell nucleus is a major synapse-to-nucleus communication pathway. Neuronal PAS domain protein 4 (Npas4) is a recently discovered calcium-dependent transcription factor that regulates the activation of genes involved in the homeostatic regulation of excitatory–inhibitory balance, which is critical for neural circuit formation, function, and ongoing plasticity, as well as for defense against diseases such as epilepsy. Here, we summarize recent findings on the neuroprotective functions of Npas4 and the potential of Npas4 as a therapeutic target for the treatment of acute and chronic diseases of the central nervous system.</p>

<p>Regaining communication abilities in patients who are unable to speak or move is one of the main goals in decoding brain waves for brain-computer interface (BCI) control. Many BCI approaches designed for communication rely on attention to visual stimuli, commonly applying an oddball paradigm, and require both eye movements and adequate visual acuity. These abilities may, however, be absent in patients who depend on BCI communication. We have therefore developed a response-based communication BCI, which is independent of gaze shifts but utilizes covert shifts of attention to the left or right visual field. We recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) from 29 channels and coregistered the vertical and horizontal electrooculogram. Data-driven decoding of small attention-based differences between the hemispheres, also known as N2pc, was performed using 14 posterior channels, which are expected to reflect correlates of visual spatial attention. Eighteen healthy participants responded to 120 statements by covertly directing attention to one of two colored symbols (green and red crosses for “yes” and “no,” respectively), presented in the user’s left and right visual field, respectively, while maintaining central gaze fixation. On average across participants, 88.5% (std: 7.8%) of responses were correctly decoded online. In order to investigate the potential influence of stimulus features on accuracy, we presented the symbols with different visual angles, by altering symbol size and eccentricity. The offline analysis revealed that stimulus features have a minimal impact on the controllability of the BCI. Hence, we show with our novel approach that spatial attention to a colored symbol is a robust method with which to control a BCI, which has the potential to support severely paralyzed people with impaired eye movements and low visual acuity in communicating with their environment.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.579984">Neuronal–Glial Interaction in a Triple-Transgenic Mouse Model of Alzheimer’s Disease: Gene Ontology and Lithium Pathways</a></h4>

<p>Neuronal-glial interactions are critical for brain homeostasis, and disruption of this process may lead to excessive glial activation and inadequate pro-inflammatory responses. Abnormalities in neuronal-glial interactions have been reported in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), where lithium has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects, including the up-regulation of cytoprotective proteins. In the present study, we characterize by Gene Ontology (GO) the signaling pathways related to neuronal-glial interactions in response to lithium in a triple-transgenic mouse model of AD (3×-TgAD). Mice were treated for 8 months with lithium carbonate (Li) supplemented to chow, using two dose ranges to yield subtherapeutic working concentrations (Li1, 1.0 g/kg; and Li2, 2.0 g/kg of chow), or with standard chow (Li0). The hippocampi were removed and analyzed by proteomics. A neuronal-glial interaction network was created by a systematic literature search, and the selected genes were submitted to STRING, a functional network to analyze protein interactions. Proteomics data and neuronal-glial interactomes were compared by GO using ClueGo (Cytoscape plugin) with p ≤ 0.05. The proportional effects of neuron-glia interactions were determined on three GO domains: (i) biological process; (ii) cellular component; and (iii) molecular function. The gene ontology of this enriched network of genes was further stratified according to lithium treatments, with statistically significant effects observed in the Li2 group (as compared to controls) for the GO domains biological process and cellular component. In the former, there was an even distribution of the interactions occurring at the following functions: “positive regulation of protein localization to membrane,” “regulation of protein localization to cell periphery,” “oligodendrocyte differentiation,” and “regulation of protein localization to plasma membrane.” In cellular component, interactions were also balanced for “myelin sheath” and “rough endoplasmic reticulum.” We conclude that neuronal-glial interactions are implicated in the neuroprotective response mediated by lithium in the hippocampus of AD-transgenic mice. The effect of lithium on homeostatic pathways mediated by the interaction between neurons and glial cells are implicated in membrane permeability, protein synthesis and DNA repair, which may be relevant for the survival of nerve cells amidst AD pathology.</p>

<p>Assessment of mental workload is crucial for applications that require sustained attention and where conditions such as mental fatigue and drowsiness must be avoided. Previous work that attempted to devise objective methods to model mental workload were mainly based on neurological or physiological data collected when the participants performed tasks that did not involve physical activity. While such models may be useful for scenarios that involve static operators, they may not apply in real-world situations where operators are performing tasks under varying levels of physical activity, such as those faced by first responders, firefighters, and police officers. Here, we describe WAUC, a multimodal database of mental Workload Assessment Under physical aCtivity. The study involved 48 participants who performed the NASA Revised Multi-Attribute Task Battery II under three different activity level conditions. Physical activity was manipulated by changing the speed of a stationary bike or a treadmill. During data collection, six neural and physiological modalities were recorded, namely: electroencephalography, electrocardiography, breathing rate, skin temperature, galvanic skin response, and blood volume pulse, in addition to 3-axis accelerometry. Moreover, participants were asked to answer the NASA Task Load Index questionnaire after each experimental section, as well as rate their physical fatigue level on the Borg fatigue scale. In order to bring our experimental setup closer to real-world situations, all signals were monitored using wearable, off-the-shelf devices. In this paper, we describe the adopted experimental protocol, as well as validate the subjective, neural, and physiological data collected. The WAUC database, including the raw data and features, subjective ratings, and scripts to reproduce the experiments reported herein will be made available at: http://musaelab.ca/resources/.</p>

<p>This study investigated the characteristics of neural oscillation and functional connectivity (FC) in college students engaging in binge drinking (BD) using resting-state electroencephalography (EEG). Also, the associations of visual memory, evaluated by the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (RCFT), and neural oscillation with FC during the resting state were investigated. The BD (n = 35) and non-BD (n = 35) groups were selected based on scores of the Korean version of the Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) Identification Test and the Alcohol Use Questionnaire. EEG was performed for 6 min while the participants rested with eyes closed. The theta, lower-alpha, and upper alpha powers did not differ between the BD and non-BD groups. Concerning FC, the BD group exhibited stronger theta coherence than that of the non-BD group, and in the lower and upper alpha bands, the BD group showed stronger coherence in some areas but weaker coherence in others compared with the non-BD group. However, these significant results were not observed after Bonferroni correction. The BD group showed significantly lower delayed recall scores on the RCFT than did the non-BD group. A positive correlation between the left prefrontal-parietal-occipital midline connection and performance on the delayed recall of the RCFT was observed in the BD group. The present results could suggest that binge drinkers have alterations in brain FC, which may be related to their visual memory deficits.</p>

<p>Feedback inhibition by horizontal cells regulates rod and cone photoreceptor calcium channels that control their release of the neurotransmitter glutamate. This inhibition contributes to synaptic gain control and the formation of the center-surround antagonistic receptive fields passed on to all downstream neurons, which is important for contrast sensitivity and color opponency in vision. In contrast to the plasmalemmal GABA transporter found in non-mammalian horizontal cells, there is evidence that the mechanism by which mammalian horizontal cells inhibit photoreceptors involves the vesicular release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Historically, inconsistent findings of GABA and its biosynthetic enzyme, L-glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) in horizontal cells, and the apparent lack of surround response block by GABAergic agents diminished support for GABA's role in feedback inhibition. However, the immunolocalization of the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) in the dendritic and axonal endings of horizontal cells that innervate photoreceptor terminals suggested GABA was released via vesicular exocytosis. To test the idea that GABA is released from vesicles, we localized GABA and GAD, multiple SNARE complex proteins, synaptic vesicle proteins, and Ca<sub>v</sub> channels that mediate exocytosis to horizontal cell dendritic tips and axonal terminals. To address the perceived relative paucity of synaptic vesicles in horizontal cell endings, we used conical electron tomography on mouse and guinea pig retinas that revealed small, clear-core vesicles, along with a few clathrin-coated vesicles and endosomes in horizontal cell processes within photoreceptor terminals. Some small-diameter vesicles were adjacent to the plasma membrane and plasma membrane specializations. To assess vesicular release, a functional assay involving incubation of retinal slices in luminal VGAT-C antibodies demonstrated vesicles fused with the membrane in a depolarization- and calcium-dependent manner, and these labeled vesicles can fuse multiple times. Finally, targeted elimination of VGAT in horizontal cells resulted in a loss of tonic, autaptic GABA currents, and of inhibitory feedback modulation of the cone photoreceptor Ca<sub>i</sub>, consistent with the elimination of GABA release from horizontal cell endings. These results in mammalian retina identify the central role of vesicular release of GABA from horizontal cells in the feedback inhibition of photoreceptors.</p>

Objective<p>To assess the suitability of deep medullary vein visibility in susceptibility weighted imaging—magnetic resonance imaging studies as a method for the diagnosis and evaluation of cerebral small vessel disease progression.</p>Methods<p>A total of 92 patients with CSVD were enrolled and baseline clinical and imaging data were reviewed retrospectively. Neuroimaging biomarkers of CSVD including high-grade white matter hyperintensity (HWMH), cerebral microbleed (CMB), enlarged perivascular space (PVS), and lacunar infarct (LI) were identified and CSVD burden was calculated. Cases were grouped accordingly as mild, moderate, or severe. The DMV was divided into six segments according to the regional anatomy. The total DMV score (0–18) was calculated as the sum of the six individual segmental scores, which ranged from 0 to 3, for a semi-quantitative assessment of the DMV based on segmental continuity and visibility.</p>Results<p>The DMV score was independently associated with the presence of HWMH, PVS, and LI (P &lt; 0.05), but not with presence and absence of CMB (P &gt; 0.05). Correlation between the DMV score and the CSVD burden was significant (P &lt; 0.05) [OR 95% C.I., 1.227 (1.096–1.388)].</p>Conclusion<p>The DMV score was associated with the presence and severity of CSVD.</p>

<p>Interoceptive accuracy refers to the ability to consciously perceive the physical condition of the inner body, including one’s heartbeat. In younger adults, interoceptive accuracy is correlated with insular and orbitofrontal cortical connectivity within the salience network (SN). As interoceptive accuracy and insular cortex volume are known to decrease with aging, we aimed to evaluate the correlation between SN connectivity and interoceptive accuracy in older adults. 27 older adults (mean age, 77.29 years, SD = 6.24; 19 female) underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, followed by a heartbeat counting task and neuropsychological test. We evaluated the correlation between interoceptive accuracy and SN connectivity with age, sex, cognitive function, and total gray matter volume as covariates. Region of interest-to-region of interest analyses showed that interoceptive accuracy was positively correlated with the functional connectivity (FC) of the left rostral prefrontal cortex with the right insular, right orbitofrontal, and anterior cingulate cortices [F(6,16) = 4.52, false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected p &lt; 0.05]. Moreover, interoceptive accuracy was negatively correlated to the FC of the left anterior insular cortex with right intra-calcarine and visual medial cortices (F(6,16) = 2.04, FDR-corrected p &lt; 0.10). These findings suggest that coordination between systems, with a positive correlation between left rostral prefrontal cortex and the SN and a negative correlation between left insular cortex and vision-related exteroceptive brain regions, is important for maintaining interoceptive accuracy in older adults.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62998">Time-to-event modeling of hypertension reveals the nonexistence of true controls</a></h4>

Given a lifetime risk of ~90% by the ninth decade of life, it is unknown if there are true controls for hypertension in epidemiological and genetic studies. Here, we compared Bayesian logistic and time-to-event approaches to modeling hypertension. The median age at hypertension was approximately a decade earlier in African Americans than in European Americans or Mexican Americans. The probability of being free of hypertension at 85 years of age in African Americans was less than half that in European Americans or Mexican Americans. In all groups, baseline hazard rates increased until nearly 60 years of age and then decreased but did not reach zero. Taken together, modeling of the baseline hazard function of hypertension suggests that there are no true controls and that controls in logistic regression are cases with a late age of onset.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62883">Productivity loss associated with functional disability in a contemporary small-scale subsistence population</a></h4>

In comparative cross-species perspective, humans experience unique physical impairments with potentially large consequences. Quantifying the burden of impairment in subsistence populations is critical for understanding selection pressures underlying strategies that minimize risk of production deficits. We examine among forager-horticulturalists whether compromised bone strength (indicated by fracture and lower bone mineral density, BMD) is associated with subsistence task cessation; we estimate the magnitude of productivity losses associated with compromised bone strength. Fracture is associated with cessation of hunting, tree chopping and walking long distances, but not tool manufacture. Age-specific productivity losses from hunting cessation associated with fracture and lower BMD are substantial: ~397 lost kcals/day, with expected future losses of up to 1.9 million kcals (22% of expected production). Productivity loss is thus substantial for high strength and endurance tasks. Determining the extent to which impairment obstructs productivity in contemporary subsistence populations improves our ability to infer past consequences of impairment.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62048">Small molecule cognitive enhancer reverses age-related memory decline in mice</a></h4>

With increased life expectancy age-associated cognitive decline becomes a growing concern, even in the absence of recognizable neurodegenerative disease. The integrated stress response (ISR) is activated during aging and contributes to age-related brain phenotypes. We demonstrate that treatment with the drug-like small-molecule ISR inhibitor ISRIB reverses ISR activation in the brain, as indicated by decreased levels of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and phosphorylated eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2. Furthermore, ISRIB treatment reverses spatial memory deficits and ameliorates working memory in old mice. At the cellular level in the hippocampus, ISR inhibition i) rescues intrinsic neuronal electrophysiological properties, ii) restores spine density and iii) reduces immune profiles, specifically interferon and T cell-mediated responses. Thus, pharmacological interference with the ISR emerges as a promising intervention strategy for combating age-related cognitive decline in otherwise healthy individuals.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61919">Absent phasing of respiratory and locomotor rhythms in running mice</a></h4>

Examining whether and how the rhythms of limb and breathing movements interact is highly informative about the mechanistic origin of hyperpnoea during running exercise. However, studies have failed to reveal regularities. In particular, whether breathing frequency is inherently proportional to limb velocity and imposed by a synchronization of breaths to strides is still unclear. Here, we examined respiratory changes during running in the resourceful mouse model. We show that, for a wide range of trotting speeds on a treadmill, respiratory rate increases to a fixed and stable value irrespective of trotting velocities. Respiratory rate was yet further increased during escape-like running and most particularly at gallop. However, we found no temporal coordination of breaths to strides at any speed, intensity, or gait. Our work thus highlights that exercise hyperpnoea can operate, at least in mice and in the presently examined running regimes, without phasic constraints from limb movements.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61672">Cerebellar and vestibular nuclear synapses in the inferior olive have distinct release kinetics and neurotransmitters</a></h4>

The inferior olive (IO) is composed of electrically-coupled neurons that make climbing fiber synapses onto Purkinje cells. Neurons in different IO subnuclei are inhibited by synapses with wide ranging release kinetics. Inhibition can be exclusively synchronous, asynchronous, or a mixture of both. Whether the same boutons, neurons or sources provide these kinetically distinct types of inhibition was not known. We find that in mice the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) and vestibular nuclei (VN) are two major sources of inhibition to the IO that are specialized to provide inhibitory input with distinct kinetics. DCN to IO synapses lack fast synaptotagmin isoforms, release neurotransmitter asynchronously, and are exclusively GABAergic. VN to IO synapses contain fast synaptotagmin isoforms, release neurotransmitter synchronously, and are mediated by combined GABAergic and glycinergic transmission. These findings indicate that VN and DCN inhibitory inputs to the IO are suited to control different aspects of IO activity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61451">ClpAP proteolysis does not require rotation of the ClpA unfoldase relative to ClpP</a></h4>

AAA+ proteases perform regulated protein degradation in all kingdoms of life and consist of a hexameric AAA+ unfoldase/translocase in complex with a self-compartmentalized peptidase. Based on asymmetric features of cryo-EM structures and a sequential hand-over-hand model of substrate translocation, recent publications have proposed that the AAA+ unfoldases ClpA and ClpX rotate with respect to their partner peptidase ClpP to allow function. Here, we test this model by covalently crosslinking ClpA to ClpP to prevent rotation. We find that crosslinked ClpAP complexes unfold, translocate, and degrade protein substrates <i>in vitro</i>, albeit modestly slower than uncrosslinked enzyme controls. Rotation of ClpA with respect to ClpP is therefore not required for ClpAP protease activity, although some flexibility in how the AAA+ ring docks with ClpP may be necessary for optimal function.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61235"><i>TINF2</i> is a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor that limits telomere length</a></h4>

Telomere shortening is a presumed tumor suppressor pathway that imposes a proliferative barrier (the Hayflick limit) during tumorigenesis. This model predicts that excessively long somatic telomeres predispose to cancer. Here, we describe cancer-prone families with two unique <i>TINF2</i> mutations that truncate TIN2, a shelterin subunit that controls telomere length. Patient lymphocyte telomeres were unusually long. We show that the truncated TIN2 proteins do not localize to telomeres, suggesting that the mutations create loss-of-function alleles. Heterozygous knock-in of the mutations or deletion of one copy of <i>TINF2</i> resulted in excessive telomere elongation in clonal lines, indicating that <i>TINF2</i> is haploinsufficient for telomere length control. In contrast, telomere protection and genome stability were maintained in all heterozygous clones. The data establish that the <i>TINF2</i> truncations predispose to a tumor syndrome. We conclude that <i>TINF2</i> acts as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor that limits telomere length to ensure a timely Hayflick limit.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60226">Glutamine metabolism modulates azole susceptibility in <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i> amastigotes</a></h4>

The mechanisms underlying resistance of the Chagas disease parasite, <i>Trypanosoma cruzi,</i> to current therapies are not well understood, including the role of metabolic heterogeneity. We found that limiting exogenous glutamine protects actively dividing amastigotes from ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors (azoles), independent of parasite growth rate. The antiparasitic properties of azoles are derived from inhibition of lanosterol 14α-demethylase (CYP51) in the endogenous sterol synthesis pathway. We find that carbons from <sup>13</sup>C-glutamine feed into amastigote sterols and into metabolic intermediates that accumulate upon CYP51 inhibition. Incorporation of <sup>13</sup>C-glutamine into endogenously synthesized sterols is increased with BPTES treatment, an inhibitor of host glutamine metabolism that sensitizes amastigotes to azoles. Similarly, amastigotes are re-sensitized to azoles following addition of metabolites upstream of CYP51, raising the possibility that flux through the sterol synthesis pathway is a determinant of sensitivity to azoles and highlighting the potential role for metabolic heterogeneity in recalcitrant <i>T. cruzi</i> infection.

The infective ability of the opportunistic pathogen <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, recognized as the most frequent cause of biofilm-associated infections, is associated with biofilm mediated resistance to host immune response. Phenol-soluble modulins (PSM) comprise the structural scaffold of <i>S. aureus</i> biofilms through self-assembly into functional amyloids, but the role of individual PSMs during biofilm formation remains poorly understood and the molecular pathways of PSM self-assembly have yet to be identified. Here, we demonstrate high degree of cooperation between individual PSMs during functional amyloid formation. PSMα3 initiates the aggregation, forming unstable aggregates capable of seeding other PSMs resulting in stable amyloid structures. Using chemical kinetics we dissect the molecular mechanism of aggregation of individual PSMs showing that PSMα1, PSMα3 and PSMβ1 display secondary nucleation whereas PSMβ2 aggregates through primary nucleation and elongation. Our findings suggest that the various PSMs have solved to ensure fast and efficient biofilm formation through cooperation between individual peptides.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58765">REV-ERBα mediates complement expression and diurnal regulation of microglial synaptic phagocytosis</a></h4>

The circadian clock regulates various aspects of brain health including microglial and astrocyte activation. Here we report that deletion of the master clock protein BMAL1 in mice robustly increases expression of complement genes, including <i>C4b</i> and <i>C3</i>, in the hippocampus. BMAL1 regulates expression of the transcriptional repressor REV-ERBa, and deletion of REV-ERBa causes increased expression of <i>C4b </i>transcript in neurons and astrocytes as well as C3 protein primarily in astrocytes. REV-ERBa deletion increased microglial phagocytosis of synapses and synapse loss in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. Finally, we observed diurnal variation in the degree of microglial synaptic phagocytosis which was antiphase to REV-ERBα expression. This daily variation in microglial synaptic phagocytosis was abrogated by global REV-ERBα deletion, which caused persistently elevated synaptic phagocytosis. This work uncovers the BMAL1-REV-ERBa axis as a regulator of complement expression and synaptic phagocytosis in the brain, linking circadian proteins to synaptic regulation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58301">Early life stress causes sex-specific changes in adult fronto-limbic connectivity that differentially drive learning</a></h4>

It is currently unclear whether early life stress (ELS) affects males and females differently. However, a growing body of work has shown that sex moderates responses to stress and injury, with important insights into sex-specific mechanisms provided by work in rodents. Unfortunately, most of the ELS studies in rodents were conducted only in males, a bias that is particularly notable in translational work that has used human imaging. Here we examine the effects of unpredictable postnatal stress (UPS), a mouse model of complex ELS, using high resolution diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. We show that UPS induces several neuroanatomical alterations that were seen in both sexes and resemble those reported in humans. In contrast, exposure to UPS induced fronto-limbic hyper-connectivity in males, but either no change or hypoconnectivity in females. Moderated-mediation analysis found that these sex-specific changes are likely to alter contextual freezing behavior in males but not in females.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58147">An adjunctive therapy administered with an antibiotic prevents enrichment of antibiotic-resistant clones of a colonizing opportunistic pathogen</a></h4>

A key challenge in antibiotic stewardship is figuring out how to use antibiotics therapeutically without promoting the evolution of antibiotic resistance. Here, we demonstrate proof of concept for an adjunctive therapy that allows intravenous antibiotic treatment without driving the evolution and onward transmission of resistance. We repurposed the FDA-approved bile acid sequestrant cholestyramine, which we show binds the antibiotic daptomycin, as an ‘anti-antibiotic’ to disable systemically-administered daptomycin reaching the gut. We hypothesized that adjunctive cholestyramine could enable therapeutic daptomycin treatment in the bloodstream, while preventing transmissible resistance emergence in opportunistic pathogens colonizing the gastrointestinal tract. We tested this idea in a mouse model of <i>Enterococcus faecium</i> gastrointestinal tract colonization. In mice treated with daptomycin, adjunctive cholestyramine therapy reduced the fecal shedding of daptomycin-resistant <i>E. faecium</i> by up to 80-fold. These results provide proof of concept for an approach that could reduce the spread of antibiotic resistance for important hospital pathogens.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55872">Reinforcement regulates timing variability in thalamus</a></h4>

Learning reduces variability but variability can facilitate learning. This paradoxical relationship has made it challenging to tease apart sources of variability that degrade performance from those that improve it. We tackled this question in a context-dependent timing task requiring humans and monkeys to flexibly produce different time intervals with different effectors. We identified two opposing factors contributing to timing variability: slow memory fluctuation that degrades performance and reward-dependent exploratory behavior that improves performance. Signatures of these opposing factors were evident across populations of neurons in the dorsomedial frontal cortex (DMFC), DMFC-projecting neurons in the ventrolateral thalamus, and putative target of DMFC in the caudate. However, only in the thalamus were the performance-optimizing regulation of variability aligned to the slow performance-degrading memory fluctuations. These findings reveal how variability caused by exploratory behavior might help to mitigate other undesirable sources of variability and highlight a potential role for thalamocortical projections in this process.

Background: Gabapentin (GBP) is an FDA approved drug for the treatment of partial and secondary generalized seizures, apart from also being used for diabetic neuropathy. GBP displays highly intricate mechanism of action and its inhibitory response in elevated antagonism of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor) receptor and has potential in controlling neuropathic pain of cancer origin . Objective: Therefore, in the present study, we have selected BCATc (Pyridoxal 5-phosphate dependent branched-chain aminotransferase cytosolic) enzyme that is highly expressed in neuropathic stress conditions and have analysed the GBP as its competitive inhibitor by modeling, docking and checking its pharmacokinetic suitability through ADMET. Though in this study the results exhibited higher efficacy of GBP in controlling neuropathic pain, the drug shows certain potential therapeutic limitations like shorter half-life, repetitive dosing, high inter subjective variability. Methods: Therefore, a suitable and equally efficacious drug delivery method was also designed and developed by loading GBP transdermal patches (GBP-TDP) by solvent evaporation method using PVP and HPMC in ratio of 2:1 as a polymer base for reservoir type of TDP. Also, PEG 400 was used as a plasticizer and PVA (4%) was taken for backing membrane preparation and then the optimized GBP-TDP was subjected for physical characterization, optimization and  ex vivo  release kinetics. Results and conclusion: The results showed desired specifications with uneven and flaky surface appearance giving avenue for controlled release of the drugs with 75.58% of drug release in 12 hrs., further suggesting that GBP-TDP can be used as an effective tool against diabetic neuropathy pain.

Lexical retrieval requires selecting and retrieving the most appropriate word from the lexicon to express a desired concept. Prior studies investigating the neuroanatomic underpinnings of lexical retrieval used lesion models that rely on stereotyped vascular distributions, functional neuroimaging methods that lack causal certainty, or awake brain mapping that is typically limited to narrow cortical exposures. Further, few studies have probed lexical retrieval with tasks other than picture naming and when non-picture naming lexical retrieval tasks have been applied, both convergent and divergent models emerged. Because of this existing controversy, we set out to test the hypothesis that cortical and subcortical brain regions specifically involved in lexical retrieval in response to visual and auditory stimuli represent overlapping neural systems. Fifty-three patients with dysnomic aphasia due to dominant-hemisphere brain tumors performed four language tasks: picture naming, auditory naming, text reading, and describing line drawings with correct syntax. A subset of participants also underwent the Quick Aphasia Battery which provides a validated measure of lexical retrieval via the word finding subtest. Generalized linear modeling and principal components analysis revealed multicollinearity between picture naming, auditory naming, and word finding, implying redundancies between the linguistic measures. Support vector regression lesion-symptom mapping across participants was used to model accuracies on each of the four language tasks. Picture naming and auditory naming survived cluster-level corrections. Specifically, lesions within overlapping clusters of 8,333 voxels and 21,512 voxels in the left lateral PFC were predictive of impaired picture naming and auditory naming, respectively. These data indicate a convergence of heteromodal lexical retrieval within the PFC.

Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the most important susceptibility gene for late onset of Alzheimer's disease, with the presence of APOE-4/4 associated with increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Here, we reprogrammed human fibroblasts from individuals with different APOE-4/4; genotypes into induced pluripotent stem cells, and generated isogenic lines with different APOE profiles. We then differentiated these into cerebral organoids for six months and assessed the suitability of this in vitro system to measure APOE, beta-amyloid, and Tau phosphorylation levels. We identified intra- and inter- variabilities in the organoids' cell composition. Using the CRISPR-edited APOE isogenic lines, we observed more homogenous cerebral organoids, and similar levels of APOE, beta-amyloid, and Tau between the isogenic lines, with the exception of one site of Tau phosphorylation which was higher in the APOE-4/4 organoids. These data describe that pathological hallmarks of AD are observed in cerebral organoids, and that their variation is mainly independent of the APOE status of the cells, but associated with the high variability of cerebral organoid differentiation. It demonstrates that the batch-to-batch and cell-line-to-cell-line variabilities need to be considered when using cerebral organoids.

Mouse models have been instrumental in understanding genetic determinants of aging and its crucial role in neurodegenerative diseases. However, few studies have analyzed the evolution of the mouse brain over time at baseline. Furthermore, mouse brain studies are commonly conducted on the C57BL/6 strain, limiting the analysis to a specific genetic background. In Parkinson's disease, the gradual demise of nigral dopaminergic neurons mainly contributes to the motor symptoms. Interestingly, a decline of the dopaminergic neuron function and integrity is also a characteristic of physiological aging in some species. Age-related nigro-striatal features have never been studied in mice of different genetic backgrounds. In this study, we analyze the morphological features in the striatum of three common mouse strains, C57BL/6J, A/J, and DBA/2J at 3-, 9- and 15 months of age. By measuring dopaminergic markers, we uncover age-related changes that differ between strains and evolve dynamically over time. Overall, our results highlight the importance of considering background strain and age when studying the murine nigro-striatal circuit in health and disease.

Inflammation and ageing-related DNA methylation patterns in the blood have been linked to a variety of morbidities, including cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disease. However, it is unclear how these blood-based patterns relate to patterns within the brain, and how each associates with central cellular profiles. In this study, we profiled DNA methylation in both the blood and in five post-mortem brain regions (BA17, BA20/21, BA24, BA46 and hippocampus) in 14 individuals from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936. Microglial burdens were additionally quantified in the same brain regions. DNA methylation signatures of five epigenetic ageing biomarkers ('epigenetic clocks'), and two inflammatory biomarkers (DNA methylation proxies for C-reactive protein and interleukin-6) were compared across tissues and regions. Divergent correlations between the inflammation and ageing signatures in the blood and brain were identified, depending on region assessed. Four out of the five assessed epigenetic age acceleration measures were found to be highest in the hippocampus ({beta} range=0.83-1.14, p[≤]0.02). The inflammation-related DNA methylation signatures showed no clear variation across brain regions. Reactive microglial burdens were found to be highest in the hippocampus ({beta}=1.32, p=5x10-4); however, the only association identified between the blood- and brain-based methylation signatures and microglia was a significant positive association with acceleration of one epigenetic clock (termed DNAm PhenoAge) averaged over all five brain regions ({beta}=0.40, p=0.002). This work highlights a potential vulnerability of the hippocampus to epigenetic ageing and provides preliminary evidence of a relationship between DNA methylation signatures in the brain and differences in microglial burdens.

In each sensory system of the brain, mechanisms exist to extract distinct features from stimuli to generate a variety of behavioural repertoires. These often correspond to different cell types at some stage in sensory processing. In the mammalian olfactory system, complex information processing starts in the olfactory bulb, whose output is conveyed by mitral and tufted cells (MCs and TCs). Despite many differences between them, and despite the crucial position they occupy in the information hierarchy, little is known how these two types of projection neurons differ at the mRNA level. Here, we sought to identify genes that are differentially expressed between MCs and TCs, with an ultimate goal to generate a cell-type specific Cre-driver line, starting from a transcriptome analysis using a large and publicly available single-cell RNA-seq dataset (Zeisel et al., 2018). Despite many genes showing differential expressions, we identified only a few that were abundantly and consistently expressed only in MCs. After further validating these putative markers using in-situ hybridization, two genes, namely Pkib and Lbdh2, remained as promising candidates. Using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing, we generated Cre-driver lines and analysed the resulting recombination patterns. This analysis indicated that our new inducible Cre-driver line, Lbhd2-CreERT2, can be used to genetically label MCs in a tamoxifen dose-dependent manner, as assessed by soma locations, projection patterns and sensory-evoked responses. Hence this line is a promising tool for future investigations of cell-type specific contributions to olfactory processing and demonstrates the power of publicly accessible data in accelerating science.

Animals depend on fast and reliable detection of novel stimuli in their environment. Indeed, neurons in multiple sensory areas respond more strongly to novel in comparison to familiar stimuli. Yet, it remains unclear which circuit, cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlie those responses. Here, we show that inhibitory synaptic plasticity readily generates novelty responses in a recurrent spiking network model. Inhibitory plasticity increases the inhibition onto excitatory neurons tuned to familiar stimuli, while inhibition for novel stimuli remains low, leading to a network novelty response. Generated novelty responses do not depend on the exact temporal structure but rather on the distribution of presented stimuli. By including tuning of inhibitory neurons, the network further captures stimulus-specific adaptation. Finally, we suggest that disinhibition can control the amplification of novelty responses. Therefore, inhibitory plasticity provides a flexible, biologically-plausible mechanism to detect the novelty of bottom-up stimuli, enabling us to make numerous experimentally testable predictions.

Background: The concept of sugar addiction is gaining increasing attention in both the lay media and scientific literature. However, the concept of sugar addiction is controversial and only a few studies have attempted to determine the addictive properties of sugar using rigorous scientific criteria. Objective: Here we set out to systematically test the addictive properties of sugar in male and female mice using established paradigms and models from the drug addiction field. Methods: Male and female C57BL/6N (8-10 weeks old) were evaluated in 4 experimental procedures to study the addictive properties of sugar: (i) a drinking in the dark (DID) procedure to model sugar binging; (ii) a long-term free choice home cage drinking procedure measuring the sugar deprivation effect (SDE) following an abstinence phase; (iii) a long-term operant sugar self-administration with persistence, motivation and compulsivity measures and (iv) intracranial self-administration (ICSS). Results: Female mice were more vulnerable to the addictive properties of sugar than male mice, showing higher binge and long-term, excessive drinking, a more pronounced relapse-like drinking following deprivation, and higher persistence and motivation for sugar. No sex differences were seen in a compulsivity test or reward sensitivity measured using ICSS following extended sugar consumption. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the occurrence of an addictive-like phenotype for sugar in male and female mice, similar to drugs of abuse, and suggests sex-dependent differences in the development of sugar addiction.

The augmentation of landmarks in auditory navigation instructions had been shown to improve incidental spatial knowledge acquisition during assisted navigation. Here, two driving simulator experiments are reported that replicated this effect even when adding a three-week delay between navigation and spatial tasks and varying the degree of detail in the provided landmark information. Performance in free- and cued-recall of landmarks and driving the route again without assistance demonstrated increased landmark and route knowledge when navigating with landmark-based compared to standard instructions. The results emphasize that small changes to existing navigation systems can foster spatial knowledge acquisition during every-day navigation.

An increasing body of studies have highlighted the importance of listener-speaker neural coupling in successful speech communication. How this mechanism may change with normal aging and the association of this change with age-related decline in speech understanding remain unexplored. In this study, we scanned with fMRI a young and an older speaker telling real-life stories, and then played the audio recordings to groups of young (N = 28, aged 19-27y) and older adults (N = 27, aged 58-75y) during scanning, respectively. The older listeners understood the story worse than the young, and the advancing age of the older listeners was associated with poorer speech understanding. Compared to the young listener-speaker dyads, the older dyads exhibited weaker neural couplings in both linguistic and extra-linguistic areas. Moreover, within the older group, the listener's age was negatively correlated with the overall strength of interbrain coupling, which in turn was associated with poorer speech understanding. These results reveal the deficits of older adults in achieving neural alignment with other brains, which may underlie the age-related decline in speech understanding.

Viewing behavior provides a window into many central aspects of human cognition and health, and it is an important variable of interest or confound in many fMRI studies. To make eye tracking freely and widely available for MRI research, we developed DeepMReye: a convolutional neural network that decodes gaze position from the MR-signal of the eyeballs. It performs camera-less eye tracking at sub-imaging temporal resolution in held-out participants with little training data and across a broad range of scanning protocols. Critically, it works even in existing datasets and when the eyes are closed. Decoded eye movements explain network-wide brain activity also in regions not associated with oculomotor function. This work emphasizes the importance of eye tracking for the interpretation of fMRI results and provides an open-source software solution that is widely applicable in research and clinical settings.

Insect neuroscience generates vast amounts of highly diverse data, of which only a small fraction are findable, accessible and reusable, despite open data mandates by funding bodies. We have therefore developed the InsectBrainDatabase (IBdb), an open platform for depositing, sharing and managing a wide range of insect neuroanatomical and functional data. It facilities biological insight by enabling effective cross-species comparisons, by intimately linking data on structure and function, and by serving as hub for information on insect neuroethology. The IBdb provides novel visualization and search tools, which are also available in a unique private mode of the database, before data is made public. This allows users to manage and visualize unpublished data, creating a strong incentive for data contribution and eliminating additional effort when publicly depositing the data at a later stage. These design principles could also serve as a blueprint for similar databases in other fields.

The size and structure of the dendritic arbor play important roles in determining how synaptic inputs of neurons are converted to action potential output. The regulatory mechanisms governing the development of dendrites, however, are insufficiently understood. The evolutionary conserved Ste20/Hippo kinase pathway has been proposed to play an important role in regulating the formation and maintenance of dendritic architecture. A key element of this pathway, Ste20-like kinase (SLK), regulates cytoskeletal dynamics in non-neuronal cells and is strongly expressed throughout neuronal development. However, its function in neurons is unknown. We show that during development of mouse cortical neurons, SLK has a surprisingly specific role for proper elaboration of higher order dendrites. Moreover, we demonstrate that SLK is required to maintain excitation-inhibition balance. Specifically, SLK knockdown caused a selective loss of inhibitory synapses and functional inhibition after postnatal day 15, while excitatory neurotransmission was unaffected. Finally, we show that this mechanism may be relevant for human disease, as dysmorphic neurons within human cortical malformations revealed significant loss of SLK expression. Overall, the present data identify SLK as a key regulator of both dendritic complexity during development and of inhibitory synapse maintenance.

The stomatogastric ganglion (STG) is a group of about 30 neurons that resides on the stomach in decapod crustaceans. Its two central pattern generators (CPGs) control the chewing action of the gastric mill and the peristaltic movement of food through the pylorus to the gut. The STG has been studied extensively because it has properties that are common to all nervous systems and because of the small number of neurons and other features that make it convenient to study. So many details are known that the STG is considered a classic test case in neuroscience for the reductionist strategy of explaining the emergence of macro-level phenomena from micro-level data. In spite of the intense scrutiny the STG has received, how it generates its rhythmic patterns of bursts remains unknown. The novel neural networks presented here model the pyloric CPG of the American lobster (Homarus americanus). Each model's connectivity is explicit, and its operation depends only on minimal neuron capabilities of excitation and inhibition. One type of model CPGs, flip-flop ring oscillators, is apparently new to engineering, making it an example of neuroscience and logic circuit design informing each other. Several testable predictions are given here, and STG phenomena are shown to support several predictions of neural flip-flops that were given in a previous paper on short-term memory. The model CPGs are not the same as the more complex pyloric CPG. But they show how neurons can be connected to produce oscillations, and there are enough similarities in significant features that they may be considered first approximations, or perhaps simplified versions, of STG architecture. The similarities include 1) mostly inhibitory synapses; 2) pairs of cells with reciprocal, inhibitory inputs, complementary outputs that are approximately 180 degrees out of phase, and state changes occurring with the high output changing first; 3) cells that have reciprocal, inhibitory inputs with more than one other cell; and 4) six cells that produce coordinated oscillations with the same period, four phases distributed approximately uniformly over the period, and half of the burst durations approximately 1/4 of the period and the other half 3/8. These variables cannot be controlled independently in the design, suggesting a similar architecture in the models and the STG. Some of the neural network designs can be derived from electronic logic circuit designs simply by moving each negation symbol from one end of a connection to the other. This does not change the logic of the network, but it changes each logic gate to one that can be implemented with a single neuron.

<p>by Kris V. Parag, Christl A. Donnelly, Rahul Jha, Robin N. Thompson</p>

We derive and validate a novel and analytic method for estimating the probability that an epidemic has been eliminated (i.e. that no future local cases will emerge) in real time. When this probability crosses 0.95 an outbreak can be declared over with 95% confidence. Our method is easy to compute, only requires knowledge of the incidence curve and the serial interval distribution, and evaluates the statistical lifetime of the outbreak of interest. Using this approach, we rigorously show how the time-varying under-reporting of infected cases will artificially inflate the inferred probability of elimination, leading to premature (false-positive) end-of-epidemic declarations. Contrastingly, we prove that incorrectly identifying imported cases as local will deceptively decrease this probability, resulting in delayed (false-negative) declarations. Failing to sustain intensive surveillance during the later phases of an epidemic can therefore substantially mislead policymakers on when it is safe to remove travel bans or relax quarantine and social distancing advisories. World Health Organisation guidelines recommend fixed (though disease-specific) waiting times for end-of-epidemic declarations that cannot accommodate these variations. Consequently, there is an unequivocal need for more active and specialised metrics for reliably identifying the conclusion of an epidemic.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UQTLQxspjDI" width="1" />

<p>by Viachaslau Tsyvina, Alex Zelikovsky, Sagi Snir, Pavel Skums</p>

One of the hallmarks of cancer is the extremely high mutability and genetic instability of tumor cells. Inherent heterogeneity of intra-tumor populations manifests itself in high variability of clone instability rates. Analogously to fitness landscapes, the instability rates of clonal populations form their mutability landscapes. Here, we present MULAN (MUtability LANdscape inference), a maximum-likelihood computational framework for inference of mutation rates of individual cancer subclones using single-cell sequencing data. It utilizes the partial information about the orders of mutation events provided by cancer mutation trees and extends it by inferring full evolutionary history and mutability landscape of a tumor. Evaluation of mutation rates on the level of subclones rather than individual genes allows to capture the effects of genomic interactions and epistasis. We estimate the accuracy of our approach and demonstrate that it can be used to study the evolution of genetic instability and infer tumor evolutionary history from experimental data.

<p>by Yufang Qin, Weiwei Zhang, Xiaoqiang Sun, Siwei Nan, Nana Wei, Hua-Jun Wu, Xiaoqi Zheng</p>

Deconvolution of heterogeneous bulk tumor samples into distinct cellular populations is an important yet challenging problem, particularly when only partial references are available. A common approach to dealing with this problem is to deconvolve the mixed signals using available references and leverage the remaining signal as a new cell component. However, as indicated in our simulation, such an approach tends to over-estimate the proportions of known cell types and fails to detect novel cell types. Here, we propose PREDE, a partial reference-based deconvolution method using an iterative non-negative matrix factorization algorithm. Our method is verified to be effective in estimating cell proportions and expression profiles of unknown cell types based on simulated datasets at a variety of parameter settings. Applying our method to TCGA tumor samples, we found that proportions of pure cancer cells better indicate different subtypes of tumor samples. We also detected several cell types for each cancer type whose proportions successfully predicted patient survival. Our method makes a significant contribution to deconvolution of heterogeneous tumor samples and could be widely applied to varieties of high throughput bulk data.

Inter-hospital patient transfers (direct transfers) between healthcare facilities have been shown to contribute to the spread of pathogens in a healthcare network. However, the impact of indirect transfers (patients re-admitted from the community to the same or different hospital) is not well studied. This work aims to study the contribution of indirect transfers to the spread of pathogens in a healthcare network. To address this aim, a hybrid network–deterministic model to simulate the spread of multiresistant pathogens in a healthcare system was developed for the region of Lower Saxony (Germany). The model accounts for both, direct and indirect transfers of patients. Intra-hospital pathogen transmission is governed by a SIS model expressed by a system of ordinary differential equations. Our results show that the proposed model reproduces the basic properties of healthcare-associated pathogen spread. They also show the importance of indirect transfers: restricting the pathogen spread to direct transfers only leads to 4.2% system wide prevalence. However, adding indirect transfers leads to an increase in the overall prevalence by a factor of 4 (18%). In addition, we demonstrated that the final prevalence in the individual healthcare facilities depends on average length of stay in a way described by a non-linear concave function. Moreover, we demonstrate that the network parameters of the model may be derived from administrative admission/discharge records. In particular, they are sufficient to obtain inter-hospital transfer probabilities, and to express the patients’ transfers as a Markov process. Using the proposed model, we show that indirect transfers of patients are equally or even more important as direct transfers for the spread of pathogens in a healthcare network.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KMtj1CB6eSY" width="1" />

We give an approximate solution to the difficult inverse problem of inferring the topology of an unknown network from given time-dependent signals at the nodes. For example, we measure signals from individual neurons in the brain, and infer how they are inter-connected. We use Maximum Caliber as an inference principle. The combinatorial challenge of high-dimensional data is handled using two different approximations to the pairwise couplings. We show two proofs of principle: in a nonlinear genetic toggle switch circuit, and in a toy neural network.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JnBMVek5KWA" width="1" />

<p>by Ananya Saha, Narendra M. Dixit</p>

Passive immunization with broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) of HIV-1 appears a promising strategy for eliciting long-term HIV-1 remission. When administered concomitantly with the cessation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) to patients with established viremic control, bNAb therapy is expected to prolong remission. Surprisingly, in clinical trials on chronic HIV-1 patients, the bNAb VRC01 failed to prolong remission substantially. Identifying the cause of this failure is important for improving VRC01-based therapies and unraveling potential vulnerabilities of other bNAbs. In the trials, viremia resurged rapidly in most patients despite suppressive VRC01 concentrations in circulation, suggesting that VRC01 resistance was the likely cause of failure. ART swiftly halts viral replication, precluding the development of resistance during ART. If resistance were to emerge post ART, virological breakthrough would have taken longer than without VRC01 therapy. We hypothesized therefore that VRC01-resistant strains must have been formed before ART initiation, survived ART in latently infected cells, and been activated during VRC01 therapy, causing treatment failure. Current assays preclude testing this hypothesis experimentally. We developed a mathematical model based on the hypothesis and challenged it with available clinical data. The model integrated within-host HIV-1 evolution, stochastic latency reactivation, and viral dynamics with multiple-dose VRC01 pharmacokinetics. The model predicted that single but not higher VRC01-resistant mutants would pre-exist in the latent reservoir. We constructed a virtual patient population that parsimoniously recapitulated inter-patient variations. Model predictions with this population quantitatively captured data of VRC01 failure from clinical trials, presenting strong evidence supporting the hypothesis. We attributed VRC01 failure to single-mutant VRC01-resistant proviruses in the latent reservoir triggering viral recrudescence, particularly when VRC01 was at trough levels. Pre-existing resistant proviruses in the latent reservoir may similarly compromise other bNAbs. Our study provides a framework for designing bNAb-based therapeutic protocols that would avert such failure and maximize HIV-1 remission.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LwmqI6H4VKk" width="1" />

<p>by Magdalena San Roman, Andreas Wagner</p>

The evolution of cross-feeding among individuals of the same species can help generate genetic and phenotypic diversity even in completely homogeneous environments. Cross-feeding <i>Escherichia coli</i> strains, where one strain feeds on a carbon source excreted by another strain, rapidly emerge during experimental evolution in a chemically minimal environment containing glucose as the sole carbon source. Genome-scale metabolic modeling predicts that cross-feeding of 58 carbon sources can emerge in the same environment, but only cross-feeding of acetate and glycerol has been experimentally observed. Here we use metabolic modeling to ask whether acetate and glycerol cross-feeding are especially likely to evolve, perhaps because they require less metabolic change, and thus perhaps also less genetic change than other cross-feeding interactions. However, this is not the case. The minimally required metabolic changes required for acetate and glycerol cross feeding affect dozens of chemical reactions, multiple biochemical pathways, as well as multiple operons or regulons. The complexity of these changes is consistent with experimental observations, where cross-feeding strains harbor multiple mutations. The required metabolic changes are also no less complex than those observed for multiple other of the 56 cross feeding interactions we study. We discuss possible reasons why only two cross-feeding interactions have been discovered during experimental evolution and argue that multiple new cross-feeding interactions may await discovery.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gAp21_teytw" width="1" />

Aging is a complex process with poorly understood genetic mechanisms. Recent studies have sought to classify genes as pro-longevity or anti-longevity using a variety of machine learning algorithms. However, it is not clear which types of features are best for optimizing classification performance and which algorithms are best suited to this task. Further, performance assessments based on held-out test data are lacking. We systematically compare five popular classification algorithms using gene ontology and gene expression datasets as features to predict the pro-longevity versus anti-longevity status of genes for two model organisms (<i>C. elegans</i> and <i>S. cerevisiae</i>) using the GenAge database as ground truth. We find that elastic net penalized logistic regression performs particularly well at this task. Using elastic net, we make novel predictions of pro- and anti-longevity genes that are not currently in the GenAge database.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/x_ruq4ze56U" width="1" />

<p>by András Szilágyi, Péter Szabó, Mauro Santos, Eörs Szathmáry</p>

There is increased awareness of the possibility of developmental memories resulting from evolutionary learning. Genetic regulatory and neural networks can be modelled by analogous formalism raising the important question of productive analogies in principles, processes and performance. We investigate the formation and persistence of various developmental memories of past phenotypes asking how the number of remembered past phenotypes scales with network size, to what extent memories stored form by Hebbian-like rules, and how robust these developmental “devo-engrams” are against networks perturbations (graceful degradation). The analogy between neural and genetic regulatory networks is not superficial in that it allows knowledge transfer between fields that used to be developed separately from each other. Known examples of spectacular phenotypic radiations could partly be accounted for in such terms.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ignc7q60gK0" width="1" />

The huge amount of data acquired by high-throughput sequencing requires data reduction for effective analysis. Here we give a clustering algorithm for genome-wide open chromatin data using a new data reduction method. This method regards the genome as a string of 1s and 0s based on a set of peaks and calculates the Hamming distances between the strings. This algorithm with the systematically optimized set of peaks enables us to quantitatively evaluate differences between samples of hematopoietic cells and classify cell types, potentially leading to a better understanding of leukemia pathogenesis.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aus4lqvXfBU" width="1" />

<p>by Kathleen Wiencke, Annette Horstmann, David Mathar, Arno Villringer, Jane Neumann</p>

Computational modeling of dopamine transmission is challenged by complex underlying mechanisms. Here we present a new computational model that (I) simultaneously regards release, diffusion and uptake of dopamine, (II) considers multiple terminal release events and (III) comprises both synaptic and volume transmission by incorporating the geometry of the synaptic cleft. We were able to validate our model in that it simulates concentration values comparable to physiological values observed in empirical studies. Further, although synaptic dopamine diffuses into extra-synaptic space, our model reflects a very localized signal occurring on the synaptic level, i.e. synaptic dopamine release is negligibly recognized by neighboring synapses. Moreover, increasing evidence suggests that cognitive performance can be predicted by signal variability of neuroimaging data (e.g. BOLD). Signal variability in target areas of dopaminergic neurons (striatum, cortex) may arise from dopamine concentration variability. On that account we compared spatio-temporal variability in a simulation mimicking normal dopamine transmission in striatum to scenarios of enhanced dopamine release and dopamine uptake inhibition. We found different variability characteristics between the three settings, which may in part account for differences in empirical observations. From a clinical perspective, differences in striatal dopaminergic signaling contribute to differential learning and reward processing, with relevant implications for addictive- and compulsive-like behavior. Specifically, dopaminergic tone is assumed to impact on phasic dopamine and hence on the integration of reward-related signals. However, in humans DA tone is classically assessed using PET, which is an indirect measure of endogenous DA availability and suffers from temporal and spatial resolution issues. We discuss how this can lead to discrepancies with observations from other methods such as microdialysis and show how computational modeling can help to refine our understanding of DA transmission.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EO__rbAAHyg" width="1" />

<p>by Christoph Stelzer, Yaakov Benenson</p>

The mapping of molecular inputs to their molecular outputs (input/output, I/O mapping) is an important characteristic of gene circuits, both natural and synthetic. Experimental determination of such mappings for synthetic circuits is best performed using stably integrated genetic constructs. In mammalian cells, stable integration of complex circuits is a time-consuming process that hampers rapid characterization of multiple circuit variants. On the other hand, transient transfection is quick. However, it is an extremely noisy process and it is unclear whether the obtained data have any relevance to the input/output mapping of a circuit obtained in the case of a stable integration. Here we describe a data processing workflow, Peakfinder algorithm for flow cytometry data (PFAFF), that allows extracting precise input/output mapping from single-cell protein expression data gathered by flow cytometry after a transient transfection. The workflow builds on the numerically-proven observation that the multivariate modes of input and output expression of multi-channel flow cytometry datasets, pre-binned by the expression level of an independent transfection reporter gene, harbor cells with circuit gene copy numbers distributions that depend deterministically on the properties of a bin. We validate our method by simulating flow cytometry data for seven multi-node circuit architectures, including a complex bi-modal circuit, under stable integration and transient transfection scenarios. The workflow applied to the simulated transient transfection data results in similar conclusions to those reached with simulated stable integration data. This indicates that the input/output mapping derived from transient transfection data using our method is an excellent approximation of the ground truth. Thus, the method allows to determine input/output mapping of complex gene network using noisy transient transfection data.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zZ68BOK1RNw" width="1" />

Experimental studies in neuroscience are producing data at a rapidly increasing rate, providing exciting opportunities and formidable challenges to existing theoretical and modeling approaches. To turn massive datasets into predictive quantitative frameworks, the field needs software solutions for systematic integration of data into realistic, multiscale models. Here we describe the Brain Modeling ToolKit (BMTK), a software suite for building models and performing simulations at multiple levels of resolution, from biophysically detailed multi-compartmental, to point-neuron, to population-statistical approaches. Leveraging the SONATA file format and existing software such as NEURON, NEST, and others, BMTK offers a consistent user experience across multiple levels of resolution. It permits highly sophisticated simulations to be set up with little coding required, thus lowering entry barriers to new users. We illustrate successful applications of BMTK to large-scale simulations of a cortical area. BMTK is an open-source package provided as a resource supporting modeling-based discovery in the community.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_4TI_soQgpA" width="1" />

<p>by Marcus A. Triplett, Zac Pujic, Biao Sun, Lilach Avitan, Geoffrey J. Goodhill</p>

The pattern of neural activity evoked by a stimulus can be substantially affected by ongoing spontaneous activity. Separating these two types of activity is particularly important for calcium imaging data given the slow temporal dynamics of calcium indicators. Here we present a statistical model that decouples stimulus-driven activity from low dimensional spontaneous activity in this case. The model identifies hidden factors giving rise to spontaneous activity while jointly estimating stimulus tuning properties that account for the confounding effects that these factors introduce. By applying our model to data from zebrafish optic tectum and mouse visual cortex, we obtain quantitative measurements of the extent that neurons in each case are driven by evoked activity, spontaneous activity, and their interaction. By not averaging away potentially important information encoded in spontaneous activity, this broadly applicable model brings new insight into population-level neural activity within single trials.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4XSAP6O9Szw" width="1" />

<p>by Bian Li, Yucheng T. Yang, John A. Capra, Mark B. Gerstein</p>

Predicting mutation-induced changes in protein thermodynamic stability (ΔΔG) is of great interest in protein engineering, variant interpretation, and protein biophysics. We introduce ThermoNet, a deep, 3D-convolutional neural network designed for structure-based prediction of ΔΔGs upon point mutation. To leverage the image-processing power inherent in convolutional neural networks, we treat protein structures as if they were multi-channel 3D images. In particular, the inputs to ThermoNet are uniformly constructed as multi-channel voxel grids based on biophysical properties derived from raw atom coordinates. We train and evaluate ThermoNet with a curated data set that accounts for protein homology and is balanced with direct and reverse mutations; this provides a framework for addressing biases that have likely influenced many previous ΔΔG prediction methods. ThermoNet demonstrates performance comparable to the best available methods on the widely used S<sup>sym</sup> test set. In addition, ThermoNet accurately predicts the effects of both stabilizing and destabilizing mutations, while most other methods exhibit a strong bias towards predicting destabilization. We further show that homology between S<sup>sym</sup> and widely used training sets like S2648 and VariBench has likely led to overestimated performance in previous studies. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of ThermoNet in predicting the ΔΔGs for two clinically relevant proteins, p53 and myoglobin, and for pathogenic and benign missense variants from ClinVar. Overall, our results suggest that 3D convolutional neural networks can model the complex, non-linear interactions perturbed by mutations, directly from biophysical properties of atoms.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/niegIFFxK5E" width="1" />

<p>by Grey W. Wilburn, Sean R. Eddy</p>

Most methods for biological sequence homology search and alignment work with primary sequence alone, neglecting higher-order correlations. Recently, statistical physics models called Potts models have been used to infer all-by-all pairwise correlations between sites in deep multiple sequence alignments, and these pairwise couplings have improved 3D structure predictions. Here we extend the use of Potts models from structure prediction to sequence alignment and homology search by developing what we call a hidden Potts model (HPM) that merges a Potts emission process to a generative probability model of insertion and deletion. Because an HPM is incompatible with efficient dynamic programming alignment algorithms, we develop an approximate algorithm based on importance sampling, using simpler probabilistic models as proposal distributions. We test an HPM implementation on RNA structure homology search benchmarks, where we can compare directly to exact alignment methods that capture nested RNA base-pairing correlations (stochastic context-free grammars). HPMs perform promisingly in these proof of principle experiments.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8F__D7aV-YE" width="1" />

<p>by Torsten Johann Paul, Philip Kollmannsberger</p>

Spatial biological networks are abundant on all scales of life, from single cells to ecosystems, and perform various important functions including signal transmission and nutrient transport. These biological functions depend on the architecture of the network, which emerges as the result of a dynamic, feedback-driven developmental process. While cell behavior during growth can be genetically encoded, the resulting network structure depends on spatial constraints and tissue architecture. Since network growth is often difficult to observe experimentally, computer simulations can help to understand how local cell behavior determines the resulting network architecture. We present here a computational framework based on directional statistics to model network formation in space and time under arbitrary spatial constraints. Growth is described as a biased correlated random walk where direction and branching depend on the local environmental conditions and constraints, which are presented as 3D multilayer grid. To demonstrate the application of our tool, we perform growth simulations of a dense network between cells and compare the results to experimental data from osteocyte networks in bone. Our generic framework might help to better understand how network patterns depend on spatial constraints, or to identify the biological cause of deviations from healthy network function.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Uhgpxh7NJkk" width="1" />

<p>by Yanli Zhou, Luigi Acerbi, Wei Ji Ma</p>

Perceptual organization is the process of grouping scene elements into whole entities. A classic example is contour integration, in which separate line segments are perceived as continuous contours. Uncertainty in such grouping arises from scene ambiguity and sensory noise. Some classic Gestalt principles of contour integration, and more broadly, of perceptual organization, have been re-framed in terms of Bayesian inference, whereby the observer computes the probability that the whole entity is present. Previous studies that proposed a Bayesian interpretation of perceptual organization, however, have ignored sensory uncertainty, despite the fact that accounting for the current level of perceptual uncertainty is one the main signatures of Bayesian decision making. Crucially, trial-by-trial manipulation of sensory uncertainty is a key test to whether humans perform near-optimal Bayesian inference in contour integration, as opposed to using some manifestly non-Bayesian heuristic. We distinguish between these hypotheses in a simplified form of contour integration, namely judging whether two line segments separated by an occluder are collinear. We manipulate sensory uncertainty by varying retinal eccentricity. A Bayes-optimal observer would take the level of sensory uncertainty into account—in a very specific way—in deciding whether a measured offset between the line segments is due to non-collinearity or to sensory noise. We find that people deviate slightly but systematically from Bayesian optimality, while still performing “probabilistic computation” in the sense that they take into account sensory uncertainty via a heuristic rule. Our work contributes to an understanding of the role of sensory uncertainty in higher-order perception.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0qLlR5BBni8" width="1" />

<p>by Simon Kasif, Richard J. Roberts</p>

How do we scale biological science to the demand of next generation biology and medicine to keep track of the facts, predictions, and hypotheses? These days, enormous amounts of DNA sequence and other omics data are generated. Since these data contain the blueprint for life, it is imperative that we interpret it accurately. The abundance of DNA is only one part of the challenge. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and network methods routinely build on large screens, single cell technologies, proteomics, and other modalities to infer or predict biological functions and phenotypes associated with proteins, pathways, and organisms. As a first step, how do we systematically trace the provenance of knowledge from experimental ground truth to gene function predictions and annotations? Here, we review the main challenges in tracking the evolution of biological knowledge and propose several specific solutions to provenance and computational tracing of evidence in functional linkage networks.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/BCbdCBNCE2M" width="1" />

The metabolite acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) serves as an essential element for a wide range of cellular functions including adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, lipid synthesis, and protein acetylation. Intracellular acetyl-CoA concentrations are associated with nutrient availability, but the mechanisms by which a cell responds to fluctuations in acetyl-CoA levels remain elusive. Here, we generate a cell system to selectively manipulate the nucleo-cytoplasmic levels of acetyl-CoA using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-mediated gene editing and acetate supplementation of the culture media. Using this system and quantitative omics analyses, we demonstrate that acetyl-CoA depletion alters the integrity of the nucleolus, impairing ribosomal RNA synthesis and evoking the ribosomal protein-dependent activation of p53. This nucleolar remodeling appears to be mediated through the class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs). Our findings highlight acetylation-mediated control of the nucleolus as an important hub linking acetyl-CoA fluctuations to cellular stress responses.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/znn2cQyechA" width="1" />

The vast net of fibres within and underneath the cortex is optimised to support the convergence of different levels of brain organisation. Here, we propose a novel coordinate system of the human cortex based on an advanced model of its connectivity. Our approach is inspired by seminal, but so far largely neglected models of cortico–cortical wiring established by postmortem anatomical studies and capitalises on cutting-edge in vivo neuroimaging and machine learning. The new model expands the currently prevailing diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tractography approach by incorporation of additional features of cortical microstructure and cortico–cortical proximity. Studying several datasets and different parcellation schemes, we could show that our coordinate system robustly recapitulates established sensory-limbic and anterior–posterior dimensions of brain organisation. A series of validation experiments showed that the new wiring space reflects cortical microcircuit features (including pyramidal neuron depth and glial expression) and allowed for competitive simulations of functional connectivity and dynamics based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and human intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) coherence. Our results advance our understanding of how cell-specific neurobiological gradients produce a hierarchical cortical wiring scheme that is concordant with increasing functional sophistication of human brain organisation. Our evaluations demonstrate the cortical wiring space bridges across scales of neural organisation and can be easily translated to single individuals.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/FxmeQ05KO8s" width="1" />

<p>by Ruth E. Mitchell, Kirsty Bates, Robyn E. Wootton, Adil Harroud, J. Brent Richards, George Davey Smith, Marcus R. Munafò</p>

The causes of multiple sclerosis (MS) remain unknown. Smoking has been associated with MS in observational studies and is often thought of as an environmental risk factor. We used two-sample mendelian randomization (MR) to examine whether this association is causal using genetic variants identified in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) as associated with smoking. We assessed both smoking initiation and lifetime smoking behaviour (which captures smoking duration, heaviness, and cessation). There was very limited evidence for a meaningful effect of smoking on MS susceptibility as measured using summary statistics from the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium (IMSGC) meta-analysis, including 14,802 cases and 26,703 controls. There was no clear evidence for an effect of smoking on the risk of developing MS (smoking initiation: odds ratio [OR] 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92–1.61; lifetime smoking: OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.87–1.40). These findings suggest that smoking does not have a detrimental consequence on MS susceptibility. Further work is needed to determine the causal effect of smoking on MS progression.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ktkisd6ZNQw" width="1" />

<p>by R. Becket Ebitz, Jiaxin Cindy Tu, Benjamin Y. Hayden</p>

We have the capacity to follow arbitrary stimulus–response rules, meaning simple policies that guide our behavior. Rule identity is broadly encoded across decision-making circuits, but there are less data on how rules shape the computations that lead to choices. One idea is that rules could simplify these computations. When we follow a rule, there is no need to encode or compute information that is irrelevant to the current rule, which could reduce the metabolic or energetic demands of decision-making. However, it is not clear if the brain can actually take advantage of this computational simplicity. To test this idea, we recorded from neurons in 3 regions linked to decision-making, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), ventral striatum (VS), and dorsal striatum (DS), while macaques performed a rule-based decision-making task. Rule-based decisions were identified via modeling rules as the latent causes of decisions. This left us with a set of physically identical choices that maximized reward and information, but could not be explained by simple stimulus–response rules. Contrasting rule-based choices with these residual choices revealed that following rules (1) decreased the energetic cost of decision-making; and (2) expanded rule-relevant coding dimensions and compressed rule-irrelevant ones. Together, these results suggest that we use rules, in part, because they reduce the costs of decision-making through a distributed representational warping in decision-making circuits.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/absqV5PG9wk" width="1" />

Inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS) induces endothelial blood–brain barrier (BBB) opening as well as the formation of a tight junction barrier between reactive astrocytes at the Glia Limitans. We hypothesized that the CNS parenchyma may acquire protection from the reactive astrocytic Glia Limitans not only during neuroinflammation but also when BBB integrity is compromised in the resting state. Previous studies found that astrocyte-derived Sonic hedgehog (SHH) stabilizes the BBB during CNS inflammatory disease, while endothelial-derived desert hedgehog (DHH) is expressed at the BBB under resting conditions. Here, we investigated the effects of endothelial Dhh on the integrity of the BBB and Glia Limitans. We first characterized DHH expression within endothelial cells at the BBB, then demonstrated that DHH is down-regulated during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Using a mouse model in which endothelial Dhh is inducibly deleted, we found that endothelial Dhh both opens the BBB via the modulation of forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) transcriptional activity and induces a tight junctional barrier at the Glia Limitans. We confirmed the relevance of this glial barrier system in human multiple sclerosis active lesions. These results provide evidence for the novel concept of “chronic neuroinflammatory tolerance” in which BBB opening in the resting state is sufficient to stimulate a protective barrier at the Glia Limitans that limits the severity of subsequent neuroinflammatory disease. In summary, genetic disruption of the BBB generates endothelial signals that drive the formation under resting conditions of a secondary barrier at the Glia Limitans with protective effects against subsequent CNS inflammation. The concept of a reciprocally regulated CNS double barrier system has implications for treatment strategies in both the acute and chronic phases of multiple sclerosis pathophysiology.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Qws0Zjy1BM4" width="1" />

It is unknown how growth in one tissue impacts morphogenesis in a neighboring tissue. To address this, we used the <i>Drosophila</i> ovarian follicle, in which a cluster of 15 nurse cells and a posteriorly located oocyte are surrounded by a layer of epithelial cells. It is known that as the nurse cells grow, the overlying epithelial cells flatten in a wave that begins in the anterior. Here, we demonstrate that an anterior to posterior gradient of decreasing cytoplasmic pressure is present across the nurse cells and that this gradient acts through TGFβ to control both the triggering and the progression of the wave of epithelial cell flattening. Our data indicate that intrinsic nurse cell growth is important to control proper nurse cell pressure. Finally, we reveal that nurse cell pressure and subsequent TGFβ activity in the stretched cells combine to increase follicle elongation in the anterior, which is crucial for allowing nurse cell growth and pressure control. More generally, our results reveal that during development, inner cytoplasmic pressure in individual cells has an important role in shaping their neighbors.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/MwvegINJHvM" width="1" />

Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated (Cas) 9 has been widely used far beyond genome editing. Fusions of deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) to transcription effectors enable interrogation of the epigenome and controlling of gene expression. However, the large transgene size of dCas9-fusion hinders its applications especially in somatic tissues. Here, we develop a robust CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system by transgenic expression of doxycycline (Dox) inducible dCas9-KRAB in mouse embryonic stem cells (iKRAB ESC). After introduction of specific single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs), the induced dCas9-KRAB efficiently maintains gene inactivation, although it modestly down-regulates the expression of active genes. The proper timing of Dox addition during cell differentiation or reprogramming allows us to study or screen spatiotemporally activated promoters or enhancers and thereby the gene functions. Furthermore, taking the ESC for blastocyst injection, we generate an iKRAB knock-in (KI) mouse model that enables the shutdown of gene expression and loss-of-function (LOF) studies ex vivo and in vivo by a simple transduction of gRNAs. Thus, our inducible CRISPRi ESC line and KI mouse provide versatile and convenient platforms for functional interrogation and high-throughput screens of specific genes and potential regulatory elements in the setting of development or diseases.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/5BnG8yMzdTU" width="1" />

<p>by Manon Gervais, Gwenaël Labouèbe, Alexandre Picard, Bernard Thorens, Sophie Croizier</p>

Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons are major regulators of energy balance and glucose homeostasis. In addition to being regulated by hormones and nutrients, POMC neurons are controlled by glutamatergic input originating from multiple brain regions. However, the factors involved in the formation of glutamatergic inputs and how they contribute to bodily functions remain largely unknown. Here, we show that during the development of glutamatergic inputs, POMC neurons exhibit enriched expression of the <i>Efnb1</i> (EphrinB1) and <i>Efnb2</i> (EphrinB2) genes, which are known to control excitatory synapse formation. In vivo loss of <i>Efnb1</i> in POMC-expressing progenitors decreases the amount of glutamatergic inputs, associated with a reduced number of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits and excitability of these cells. We found that mice lacking <i>Efnb1</i> in POMC-expressing progenitors display impaired glucose tolerance due to blunted vagus nerve activity and decreased insulin secretion. However, despite reduced excitatory inputs, mice lacking <i>Efnb2</i> in POMC-expressing progenitors showed no deregulation of insulin secretion and only mild alterations in feeding behavior and gluconeogenesis. Collectively, our data demonstrate the role of ephrins in controlling excitatory input amount into POMC-expressing progenitors and show an isotype-specific role of ephrins on the regulation of glucose homeostasis and feeding.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/WwQShOMh3o8" width="1" />

<p>Johnston’s organ is a highly sensitive mechanoreceptive organ in insect antennae. For the first time, we examined the 3D‐structure of the Johnston’s organ in <i>Cataglyphis</i> desert ants together with its neuronal projections in the ant brain. The multisensory nature of the organ together with its targets in multimodal brain regions make the Johnston’s organ an important component of the navigational toolkit in <i>Cataglyphis</i> ants.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The Johnston’s organ (JO) in the insect antenna is a multisensory organ involved in several navigational tasks including wind‐compass orientation, flight control, graviception, and, possibly, magnetoreception. Here we investigate the three dimensional anatomy of the JO and its neuronal projections into the brain of the desert ant <i>Cataglyphis</i>, a marvelous long‐distance navigator. The JO of <i>C. nodus</i> workers consists of 40 scolopidia comprising three sensory neurons each. The numbers of scolopidia slightly vary between different sexes (female/male) and castes (worker/queen). Individual scolopidia attach to the intersegmental membrane between pedicel and flagellum of the antenna and line up in a ring‐like organization. Three JO nerves project along the two antennal nerve branches into the brain. Anterograde double staining of the antennal afferents revealed that JO receptor neurons project to several distinct neuropils in the central brain. The T5 tract projects into the antennal mechanosensory and motor center (AMMC), while the T6 tract bypasses the AMMC via the saddle and forms collaterals terminating in the posterior slope (PS) (T6I), the ventral complex (T6II), and the ventrolateral protocerebrum (T6III). Double labeling of JO and ocellar afferents revealed that input from the JO and visual information from the ocelli converge in tight apposition in the PS. The general JO anatomy and its central projection patterns resemble situations in honeybees and <i>Drosophila</i>. The multisensory nature of the JO together with its projections to multisensory neuropils in the ant brain likely serves synchronization and calibration of different sensory modalities during the ontogeny of navigation in <i>Cataglyphis</i>.</p>

<p>Anti‐myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein immunoglobulin G (MOG‐IgG) antibodies are associated clinically with either a monophasic or relapsing disease course. We investigated the frequency and clinical importance of acquired asymptomatic brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions in a prospective incident cohort of 74 MOG‐IgG positive children with serial MRI scans over a median of 5 years from presentation. Silent new lesions were detected in 14% of MOG‐IgG positive participants, most commonly within the first months post‐onset, with a positive predictive value for clinically relapsing disease of only 20%.

<p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) depends on precise delivery of electrical current to target tissues. However, the specific brain structures responsible for best outcome are still debated. We applied probabilistic stimulation mapping to a retrospective, multi‐disorder DBS dataset assembled over 15 years at our institution (n<sub>total</sub>=482 patients; n<sub>Parkinson’s disease</sub>=303; n<sub>dystonia</sub>=64; n<sub>tremor</sub>=39; n<sub>treatment‐resistant depression/anorexia nervosa</sub>=76) to identify the neuroanatomical substrates of optimal clinical response. Using high‐resolution structural MR imaging and activation volume modelling, probabilistic stimulation maps (PSMs) that delineated areas of above‐mean and below‐mean response for each patient cohort were generated and defined in terms of their relationships with surrounding anatomical structures. Our results show that overlap between PSMs and individual patients’ activation volumes can serve as a guide to predict clinical outcomes but that this is not the sole determinant of response. In the future, individualized models that incorporate advancements in mapping techniques with patient‐specific clinical variables will likely contribute to the optimization of DBS target selection and improved outcomes for patients.</p>

<p>A long-standing proposition is that by emulating the operation of the brain's
neocortex, a spiking neural network (SNN) can achieve similar desirable
features: flexible learning, speed, and efficiency. Temporal neural networks
(TNNs) are SNNs that communicate and process information encoded as relative
spike times (in contrast to spike rates). A TNN architecture is proposed, and,
as a proof-of-concept, TNN operation is demonstrated within the larger context
of online supervised classification. First, through unsupervised learning, a
TNN partitions input patterns into clusters based on similarity. The TNN then
passes a cluster identifier to a simple online supervised decoder which
finishes the classification task. The TNN learning process adjusts synaptic
weights by using only signals local to each synapse, and clustering behavior
emerges globally. The system architecture is described at an abstraction level
analogous to the gate and register transfer levels in conventional digital
design. Besides features of the overall architecture, several TNN components
are new to this work. Although not addressed directly, the overall research
objective is a direct hardware implementation of TNNs. Consequently, all the
architecture elements are simple, and processing is done at very low precision.
Importantly, low precision leads to very fast learning times. Simulation
results using the time-honored MNIST dataset demonstrate learning times at
least an order of magnitude faster than other online approaches while providing
similar error rates.

<p>In $d &gt; 2$ dimensional, homogeneous threshold models discontinuous transition
occur, but the mean-field solution provides $1/t$ power-law activity decay and
other power-laws, thus it is called mixed-order or hybrid type. It has recently
been shown that the introduction of quenched disorder rounds the discontinuity
and second order phase transition and Griffiths phases appear. Here we provide
numerical evidence, that even in case of high graph dimensional hierarchical
modular networks the Griffiths phase of the $K=2$ threshold model is present
below the hybrid phase transition. This is due to the fragmentation of the
activity propagation by modules, which are connected via single links. This
provides a widespread mechanism in case of threshold type of heterogeneous
systems, modeling the brain or epidemics for the occurrence of dynamical
criticality in extended Griffiths phase parameter spaces. We investigate this
in synthetic modular networks with and without inhibitory links as well as in
the presence of refractory states.

<p>In the recent past, neural architecture search (NAS) has attracted increasing
attention from both academia and industries. Despite the steady stream of
impressive empirical results, most existing NAS algorithms are computationally
prohibitive to execute due to the costly iterations of stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) training. In this work, we propose an effective alternative,
dubbed Random-Weight Evaluation (RWE), to rapidly estimate the performance of
network architectures. By just training the last linear classification layer,
RWE reduces the computational cost of evaluating an architecture from hours to
seconds. When integrated within an evolutionary multi-objective algorithm, RWE
obtains a set of efficient architectures with state-of-the-art performance on
CIFAR-10 with less than two hours' searching on a single GPU card. Ablation
studies on rank-order correlations and transfer learning experiments to
ImageNet have further validated the effectiveness of RWE.

<p>Representation of 2D frame less visual space as neural manifold and its
modelling in the frame work of information geometry is presented. Origin of
hyperbolic nature of the visual space is investigated using evidences from
neuroscience. Based on the results we propose that the processing of spatial
information, particularly estimation of distance, perceiving geometrical curves
etc. in the human brain can be modeled in a parametric probability space
endowed with Fisher-Rao metric. Compactness, convexity and differentiability of
the space is analysed and found that they obey the axioms of G space, proposed
by Busemann. Further it is shown that it can be considered as a homogeneous
Riemannian space of constant negative curvature. It is therefore ensured that
the space yields geodesics into it. Computer simulation of geodesics
representing a number of visual phenomena and advocating the hyperbolic
structure of visual space is carried out. Comparison of the simulated results
with the published experimental data is presented.

<p>Some anesthetics bind and potentiate gamma-aminobutyric-acid-type receptors,
but no universal mechanism for general anesthesia is known. Furthermore, often
encountered complications such as anesthesia induced amnesia are not
understood. General anesthetics are hydrophobic molecules easily dissolving
into lipid bilayers. Recently, it was shown that general anesthetics perturb
phase separation in vesicles extracted from fixed cells. Unclear is whether
under physiological conditions general anesthetics induce perturbation of the
lipid bilayer, and whether this contributes to the transient loss of
consciousness or anesthesia side effects. Here we show that propofol perturbs
lipid nanodomains in the outer and inner leaflet of the plasma membrane in
intact cells, affecting membrane nanodomains in a concentration dependent
manner: 1 {\mu}M to 5 {\mu}M propofol destabilize nanodomains; however,
propofol concentrations higher than 5 {\mu}M stabilize nanodomains with time.
Stabilization occurs only at physiological temperature and in intact cells.
This process requires ARP2/3 mediated actin nucleation and Myosin II activity.
The rate of nanodomain stabilization is potentiated by GABA receptor activity.
Our results show that active nanodomain homeostasis counteracts the initial
disruption causing large changes in cortical actin.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13506">Small variation in dynamic functional connectivity in cerebellar networks. (arXiv:2011.13506v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Brain networks can be defined and explored through their connectivity. Here,
we analyzed the relationship between structural connectivity (SC) across 2,514
regions that cover the entire brain and brainstem, and their dynamic functional
connectivity (DFC). To do so, we focused on a combination of two metrics: the
first assesses the degree of SC-DFC similarity and the second is the intrinsic
variability of the DFC networks over time. Overall, we found that cerebellar
networks have a smaller DFC variability than other networks in the brain.
Moreover, the internal structure of the cerebellum could be clearly divided in
two distinct posterior and anterior parts, the latter also connected to the
brainstem. The mechanism to maintain small variability of the DFC in the
posterior part of the cerebellum is consistent with another of our findings,
namely, that this structure exhibits the highest SC-DFC similarity relative to
the other networks studied. By contrast, the anterior part of the cerebellum
also exhibits small DFC variability but it has the lowest SC-DFC similarity,
suggesting a different mechanism is at play. Because this structure connects to
the brainstem, which regulates sleep cycles, cardiac and respiratory
functioning, we suggest that such critical functionality drives the low
variability in the DFC. Overall, the low variability detected in DFC expands
our current knowledge of cerebellar networks, which are extremely rich and
complex, participating in a wide range of cognitive functions, from movement
control and coordination to executive function or emotional regulation.
Moreover, the association between such low variability and structure suggests
that differentiated computational principles can be applied in the cerebellum
as opposed to other structures, such as the cerebral cortex.

<p>Recent works exploring deep learning application to dynamical systems
modeling have demonstrated that embedding physical priors into neural networks
can yield more effective, physically-realistic, and data-efficient models.
However, in the absence of complete prior knowledge of a dynamical system's
physical characteristics, determining the optimal structure and optimization
strategy for these models can be difficult. In this work, we explore methods
for discovering neural state space dynamics models for system identification.
Starting with a design space of block-oriented state space models and
structured linear maps with strong physical priors, we encode these components
into a model genome alongside network structure, penalty constraints, and
optimization hyperparameters. Demonstrating the overall utility of the design
space, we employ an asynchronous genetic search algorithm that alternates
between model selection and optimization and obtains accurate physically
consistent models of three physical systems: an aerodynamics body, a continuous
stirred tank reactor, and a two tank interacting system.

<p>Our modern history of deep learning follows the arc of famous emergent
disciplines in engineering (e.g. aero- and fluid dynamics) when theory lagged
behind successful practical applications. Viewing neural networks from a
dynamical systems perspective, in this work, we propose a novel
characterization of deep neural networks as pointwise affine maps, making them
accessible to a broader range of analysis methods to help close the gap between
theory and practice. We begin by showing the equivalence of neural networks
with parameter-varying affine maps parameterized by the state (feature) vector.
As the paper's main results, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for
the global stability of generic deep feedforward neural networks. Further, we
identify links between the spectral properties of layer-wise weight
parametrizations, different activation functions, and their effect on the
overall network's eigenvalue spectra. We analyze a range of neural networks
with varying weight initializations, activation functions, bias terms, and
depths. Our view of neural networks as affine parameter varying maps allows us
to "crack open the black box" of global neural network dynamical behavior
through visualization of stationary points, regions of attraction, state-space
partitioning, eigenvalue spectra, and stability properties. Our analysis covers
neural networks both as an end-to-end function and component-wise without
simplifying assumptions or approximations. The methods we develop here provide
tools to establish relationships between global neural dynamical properties and
their constituent components which can aid in the principled design of neural
networks for dynamics modeling and optimal control.

<p>In continual learning, new categories may be introduced over time, and an
ideal learning system should perform well on both the original categories and
the new categories. While deep neural nets have achieved resounding success in
the classical supervised setting, they are known to forget about knowledge
acquired in prior episodes of learning if the examples encountered in the
current episode of learning are drastically different from those encountered in
prior episodes. In this paper, we propose a new method that can both leverage
the expressive power of deep neural nets and is resilient to forgetting when
new categories are introduced. We found the proposed method can reduce
forgetting by 2.3x to 6.9x on CIFAR-10 compared to existing methods and by 1.8x
to 2.7x on ImageNet compared to an oracle baseline.

<p>A great deal of research has been devoted on the investigation of neural dynamics in various network topologies. However, only a few studies have focused on the influence of autapses, synapses from a neuron onto itself via closed loops, on neural synchronization. Here, we build a random network with adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire neurons coupled with chemical synapses, equipped with autapses, to study the effect of the latter on synchronous behavior. We consider time delay in the conductance of the pre-synaptic neuron for excitatory and inhibitory connections. Interestingly, in neural networks consisting of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, we uncover that synchronous behavior depends on their synapse type. Our results provide evidence on the synchronous and desynchronous activities that emerge in random neural networks with chemical, inhibitory and excitatory synapses where neurons are equipped with autapses.</p>

<p>Most of the mammalian neocortex is comprised of a highly similar anatomical structure, consisting of a granular cell layer between superficial and deep layers. Even so, different cortical areas process different information. Taken together, this suggests that cortex features a canonical functional microcircuit that supports region-specific information processing. For example, the primate primary visual cortex (V1) combines the two eyes' signals, extracts stimulus orientation, and integrates contextual information such as visual stimulation history. These processes co-occur during the same laminar stimulation sequence that is triggered by the onset of visual stimuli. Yet, we still know little regarding the laminar processing differences that are specific to each of these types of stimulus information. Univariate analysis techniques have provided great insight by examining one electrode at a time or by studying average responses across multiple electrodes. Here we focus on multivariate statistics to examine response patterns across electrodes instead. Specifically, we applied multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to linear multielectrode array recordings of laminar spiking responses to decode information regarding the eye-of-origin, stimulus orientation, and stimulus repetition. MVPA differs from conventional univariate approaches in that it examines patterns of neural activity across simultaneously recorded electrode sites. We were curious whether this added dimensionality could reveal neural processes on the population level that are challenging to detect when measuring brain activity without the context of neighboring recording sites. We found that eye-of-origin information was decodable for the entire duration of stimulus presentation, but diminished in the deepest layers of V1. Conversely, orientation information was transient and equally pronounced along all layers. More importantly, using time-resolved MVPA, we were able to evaluate laminar response properties beyond those yielded by univariate analyses. Specifically, we performed a time generalization analysis by training a classifier at one point of the neural response and testing its performance throughout the remaining period of stimulation. Using this technique, we demonstrate repeating (reverberating) patterns of neural activity that have not previously been observed using standard univariate approaches.</p>

<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) may cause secondary debilitating problems, such as post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE), which occurs with unprovoked recurrent seizures, months or even years after TBI. Currently, the Epilepsy Bioinformatics Study for Antiepileptogenic Therapy (EpiBioS4Rx) has been enrolling moderate-severe TBI patients with the goal to identify biomarkers of epileptogenesis that may help to prevent seizure occurrence and better understand the mechanism underlying PTE. In this work, we used a novel complex network approach based on segmenting T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans in patches of the same dimension (network nodes) and measured pairwise patch similarities using Pearson's correlation (network connections). This network model allowed us to obtain a series of single and multiplex network metrics to comprehensively analyze the different interactions between brain components and capture structural MRI alterations related to seizure development. We used these complex network features to train a Random Forest (RF) classifier and predict, with an accuracy of 70 and a 95% confidence interval of [67, 73%], which subjects from EpiBioS4Rx have had at least one seizure after a TBI. This complex network approach also allowed the identification of the most informative scales and brain areas for the discrimination between the two clinical groups: seizure-free and seizure-affected subjects, demonstrating to be a promising pilot study which, in the future, may serve to identify and validate biomarkers of PTE.</p>

<p>Background: Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI using intravenous injection of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) is commonly used for imaging blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Water is an alternative endogenous tracer with limited exchange rate across the BBB. A direct comparison between BBB water exchange rate and BBB permeability to GBCA is missing. The purpose of this study was to directly compare BBB permeability to GBCA (Ktrans and k<sub>Gad</sub> = Ktrans/Vp) and water exchange rate (kw) in a cohort of elderly subjects at risk of cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD).</p><p>Methods: Ktrans/k<sub>Gad</sub> and kw were measured by DCE-MRI and diffusion prepared pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (DP-pCASL), respectively, at 3 Tesla in 16 elderly subjects (3 male, age = 67.9 ± 3.0 yrs) at risk of cSVD. The test-retest reproducibility of kw measurements was evaluated with repeated scans ~6 weeks apart. Mixed effects linear regression was performed in the whole brain, gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and 6 subcortical brain regions to investigate associations between Ktrans/k<sub>Gad</sub> and test-retest kw. In addition, kw and Ktrans/k<sub>Gad</sub> were compared in normal appearing white matter (NAWM), white matter hyperintensity (WMH) lesions and penumbra.</p><p>Results: Significant correlation was found between kw and Ktrans only in WM (β = 6.7 × 10<sup>4</sup>, P = 0.036), caudate (β = 8.6 × 10<sup>4</sup>, P = 0.029), and middle cerebral artery (MCA) perforator territory (β = 6.9 × 10<sup>4</sup>, P = 0.009), but not in the whole brain, GM or rest 5 brain regions. Significant correlation was found between kw and k<sub>Gad</sub> in MCA perforator territory (β = 1.5 × 10<sup>3</sup>, P = 0.049), medial-temporal lobe (β = 3.5 × 10<sup>3</sup>, P = 0.032), and hippocampus (β = 3.4 × 10<sup>3</sup>, P = 0.038), but not in the rest brain regions. Good reproducibility of kw measurements (ICC=0.75) was achieved. Ktrans was significantly lower inside WMH than WMH penumbra (16.2%, P = 0.026), and k<sub>Gad</sub> was significantly lower in NAWM than in the WMH penumbra (20.8%, P &lt; 0.001).</p><p>Conclusion: kw provides a measure of water exchange rate across the BBB with good test-retest reproducibility. The BBB mechanism underlying kw and Ktrans/k<sub>Gad</sub> is likely to be different, as manifested by correlations in only three brain regions for each pair of comparison between kw and Ktrans or k<sub>Gad</sub>.</p>

<p>Central pattern generator (CPG) networks coordinate the generation of rhythmic activity such as locomotion and respiration. Their development is driven by various transcription factors, one of which is the Wilms tumor protein (Wt1). It is present in dI6 neurons of the mouse spinal cord, and involved in the coordination of locomotion. Here we report about the presence of Wt1 in neurons of the caudoventral medulla oblongata and their impact on respiration. By employing immunohistofluorescence staining, we were able to characterize these Wt1 positive (+) cells as dB4 neurons. The temporal occurrence of Wt1 suggests a role for this transcription factor in the differentiation of dB4 neurons during embryonic and postnatal development. Conditional knockout of Wt1 in these cells caused an altered population size of V0 neurons already in the developing hindbrain, leading to a decline in the respiration rate in the adults. Thereby, we confirmed and extended the previously proposed similarity between dB4 neurons in the hindbrain and dI6 neurons of the spinal cord, in terms of development and function. Ablation of Wt1+ dB4 neurons resulted in the death of neonates due to the inability to initiate respiration, suggesting a vital role for Wt1+ dB4 neurons in breathing. These results expand the role of Wt1 in the CNS and show that, in addition to its function in differentiation of dI6 neurons, it also contributes to the development of dB4 neurons in the hindbrain that are critically involved in the regulation of respiration.</p>

<p>Structural segmentation of T1-weighted (T1w) MRI has shown morphometric differences, both compared to controls and longitudinally, following a traumatic brain injury (TBI). While many patients with TBI present with abnormalities on structural MRI images, most neuroimaging software packages have not been systematically evaluated for accuracy in the presence of these pathology-related MRI abnormalities. The current study aimed to assess whether acute MRI lesions (MRI acquired 7–71 days post-injury) cause error in the estimates of brain volume produced by the semi-automated segmentation tool, Freesurfer. More specifically, to investigate whether this error was global, the presence of lesion-induced error in the contralesional hemisphere, where no abnormal signal was present, was measured. A dataset of 176 simulated lesion cases was generated using actual lesions from 16 pediatric TBI (pTBI) cases recruited from the emergency department and 11 typically-developing controls. Simulated lesion cases were compared to the “ground truth” of the non-lesion control-case T1w images. Using linear mixed-effects models, results showed that hemispheric measures of cortex volume were significantly lower in the contralesional-hemisphere compared to the ground truth. Interestingly, however, cortex volume (and cerebral white matter volume) were not significantly different in the lesioned hemisphere. However, percent volume difference (PVD) between the simulated lesion and ground truth showed that the magnitude of difference of cortex volume in the contralesional-hemisphere (mean PVD = 0.37%) was significantly smaller than that in the lesioned hemisphere (mean PVD = 0.47%), suggesting a small, but systematic lesion-induced error. Lesion characteristics that could explain variance in the PVD for each hemisphere were investigated. Taken together, these results suggest that the lesion-induced error caused by simulated lesions was not focal, but globally distributed. Previous post-processing approaches to adjust for lesions in structural analyses address the focal region where the lesion was located however, our results suggest that focal correction approaches are insufficient for the global error in morphometric measures of the injured brain.</p>

<p>Recently, machine learning methods have gained lots of attention from researchers seeking to analyze brain images such as Resting-State Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) to obtain a deeper understanding of the brain and such related diseases, for example, Alzheimer's disease. Finding the common patterns caused by a brain disorder through analysis of the functional connectivity (FC) network along with discriminating brain diseases from normal controls have long been the two principal goals in studying rs-fMRI data. The majority of FC extraction methods calculate the FC matrix for each subject and then use simple techniques to combine them and obtain a general FC matrix. In addition, the state-of-the-art classification techniques for finding subjects with brain disorders also rely on calculating an FC for each subject, vectorizing, and feeding them to the classifier. Considering these problems and based on multi-dimensional nature of the data, we have come up with a novel tensor framework in which a general FC matrix is obtained without the need to construct an FC matrix for each sample. This framework also allows us to reduce the dimensionality and create a novel discriminant function that rather than using FCs works directly with each sample, avoids vectorization in any step, and uses the test data in the training process without forcing any prior knowledge of its label into the classifier. Extensive experiments using the ADNI dataset demonstrate that our proposed framework effectively boosts the fMRI classification performance and reveals novel connectivity patterns in Alzheimer's disease at its early stages.</p>

<p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have attained human-level performance on dozens of challenging tasks via an end-to-end deep learning strategy. Deep learning allows data representations that have multiple levels of abstraction; however, it does not explicitly provide any insights into the internal operations of DNNs. Deep learning's success is appealing to neuroscientists not only as a method for applying DNNs to model biological neural systems but also as a means of adopting concepts and methods from cognitive neuroscience to understand the internal representations of DNNs. Although general deep learning frameworks, such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, could be used to allow such cross-disciplinary investigations, the use of these frameworks typically requires high-level programming expertise and comprehensive mathematical knowledge. A toolbox specifically designed as a mechanism for cognitive neuroscientists to map both DNNs and brains is urgently needed. Here, we present DNNBrain, a Python-based toolbox designed for exploring the internal representations of DNNs as well as brains. Through the integration of DNN software packages and well-established brain imaging tools, DNNBrain provides application programming and command line interfaces for a variety of research scenarios. These include extracting DNN activation, probing and visualizing DNN representations, and mapping DNN representations onto the brain. We expect that our toolbox will accelerate scientific research by both applying DNNs to model biological neural systems and utilizing paradigms of cognitive neuroscience to unveil the black box of DNNs.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.605878">Peripheral Inflammation and Cognitive Performance in Middle-Aged Adults With and Without Type 2 Diabetes: Results From the ENBIND Study</a></h4>

<p>Midlife Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is associated with a greater risk of dementia in later life. Peripheral inflammation and its impact on cognition is proposed as one of the pathological mechanisms mediating this link. However, studies have primarily focused on older individuals with established cognitive impairment and a long duration of T2DM. Importantly, knowledge of which individuals with midlife T2DM who are at greatest risk of later cognitive decline is lacking. We examined the cross-sectional relationship between serum levels of 8 pro-inflammatory markers (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-8, MCP-1, CXCL10, IL-12p70, CRP) and performance on a detailed neuropsychological assessment battery in middle-aged adults with uncomplicated T2DM (N = 89; 52 ± 8.1 years, 47% female) and matched healthy controls (N = 50; 52 ± 8.3 years, 59% female). Linear regression was used to analyze associations between serum markers and cognitive performance in the overall cohort, followed by a T2DM<sup>∗</sup>protein concentration interaction analysis to identify any T2DM-specific effects. We observed a significant T2DM-specific association between serum TNF-α levels and scores on the Paired Associates Learning (PAL) task (β: −3.16, SE: 1.32, p = 0.01, Std. Beta: −0.94), a task with significant working memory demands previously implicated in T2DM-related cognitive dysfunction. However, this did not persist on controlling for multiple testing. We provide exploratory evidence for a significant T2DM-specific relationship between serum TNF-α and memory performance. These findings require further replication and longitudinal analysis with the aim of selecting-out individuals with midlife T2DM at risk of future cognitive decline for potential preventative interventions.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63737">Presynaptic NMDARs cooperate with local spikes toward GABA release from the reciprocal olfactory bulb granule cell spine</a></h4>

In the rodent olfactory bulb the smooth dendrites of the principal glutamatergic mitral cells (MCs) form reciprocal dendrodendritic synapses with large spines on GABAergic granule cells (GC), where unitary release of glutamate can trigger postsynaptic local activation of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup>-channels (Na<sub>v</sub>s), that is a spine spike. Can such single MC input evoke reciprocal release? We find that unitary-like activation via two-photon uncaging of glutamate causes GC spines to release GABA both synchronously and asynchronously onto MC dendrites. This release indeed requires activation of Na<sub>v</sub>s and high-voltage-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels (HVACCs), but also of NMDA receptors (NMDAR). Simulations show temporally overlapping HVACC- and NMDAR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-currents during the spine spike, and ultrastructural data prove NMDAR presence within the GABAergic presynapse. This cooperative action of presynaptic NMDARs allows to implement synapse-specific, activity-dependent lateral inhibition, and thus could provide an efficient solution to combinatorial percept synthesis in a sensory system with many receptor channels.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62772">Cryo-EM structure of the calcium release-activated calcium channel Orai in an open conformation</a></h4>

The calcium release-activated calcium channel Orai regulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into non-excitable cells and is required for proper immune function. While the channel typically opens following Ca<sup>2+ </sup>release from the endoplasmic reticulum, certain pathologic mutations render the channel constitutively open. Previously, using one such mutation (H206A), we obtained low (6.7 Å) resolution X-ray structural information on <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> Orai in an open conformation (Hou, Burstein, &amp; Long, 2018). Here, we present a structure of this open conformation at 3.3 Å resolution using fiducial-assisted cryo-EM. The improved structure reveals the conformations of amino acids in the open pore, which dilates by outward movements of subunits. A ring of phenylalanine residues repositions to expose previously shielded glycine residues to the pore without significant rotational movement of the associated helices. Together with other hydrophobic amino acids, the phenylalanines act as the channel's gate. Structured M1-M2 turrets, not evident previously, form the channel's extracellular entrance.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62594">The integration of Gaussian noise by long-range amygdala inputs in frontal circuit promotes fear learning in mice</a></h4>

Survival depends on the ability of animals to select the appropriate behavior in response to threat and safety sensory cues. However, the synaptic and circuit mechanisms by which the brain learns to encode accurate predictors of threat and safety remain largely unexplored. Here, we show that frontal association cortex (FrA) pyramidal neurons of mice integrate auditory cues and basolateral amygdala (BLA) inputs non-linearly in a NMDAR-dependent manner. We found that the response of FrA pyramidal neurons was more pronounced to Gaussian noise than to pure frequency tones, and that the activation of BLA-to-FrA axons was the strongest in between conditioning pairings. Blocking BLA-to-FrA signaling specifically at the time of presentation of Gaussian noise (but not 8 kHz tone) between conditioning trials impaired the formation of auditory fear memories. Taken together, our data reveal a circuit mechanism that facilitates the formation of fear traces in the FrA, thus providing a new framework for probing discriminative learning and related disorders.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61481">The mechanism of kinesin inhibition by kinesin binding protein</a></h4>

Subcellular compartmentalisation is necessary for eukaryotic cell function. Spatial and temporal regulation of kinesin activity is essential for building these local environments via control of intracellular cargo distribution. Kinesin binding protein (KBP) interacts with a subset of kinesins via their motor domains, inhibits their microtubule (MT) attachment and blocks their cellular function. However, its mechanisms of inhibition and selectivity have been unclear. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to reveal the structure of KBP and of a KBP-kinesin motor domain complex. KBP is a TPR-containing, right-handed α-solenoid that sequesters the kinesin motor domain’s tubulin-binding surface, structurally distorting the motor domain and sterically blocking its MT attachment. KBP uses its α-solenoid concave face and edge loops to bind the kinesin motor domain, and selected structure-guided mutations disrupt KBP inhibition of kinesin transport in cells. The KBP-interacting motor domain surface contains motifs exclusively conserved in KBP-interacting kinesins, suggesting a basis for kinesin selectivity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61012">Hydrodynamics of sponge pumps and evolution of the sponge body plan</a></h4>

Sponges are suspension feeders that filter vast amounts of water. Pumping is carried out by flagellated chambers that are connected to an inhalant and exhalant canal system. In 'leucon' sponges with relatively high-pressure resistance due to a complex and narrow canal system, pumping and filtering are only possible owing to the presence of a gasket-like structure (forming a canopy above the collar filters). Here we combine numerical and experimental work, and demonstrate how sponges that lack such sealing elements are able to efficiently pump and force the flagella driven flow through their collar filter, thanks to the formation of a 'hydrodynamic gasket' above the collar. Our findings link the architecture of flagellated chambers to that of the canal system, and lend support to the current view that the sponge aquiferous system evolved from an open-type filtration system, and that the first metazoans were filter feeders.

Metabolism of host-targeted drugs by the microbiome can substantially impact host treatment success. However, since many host-targeted drugs inadvertently hamper microbiome growth, repeated drug administration can lead to microbiome evolutionary adaptation. We tested if evolved bacterial resistance against host-targeted drugs alters their drug metabolism and impacts host treatment success. We used a model system of <i>C. elegans</i>, its bacterial diet, and two fluoropyrimidine chemotherapies. Genetic screens revealed that most of loss-of-function resistance mutations in <i>Escherichia coli</i> also reduced drug toxicity in the host. We found that resistance rapidly emerged in <i>E. coli</i> under natural selection and converged to a handful of resistance mechanisms. Surprisingly, we discovered that nutrient availability during bacterial evolution dictated the dietary effect on the host – only bacteria evolving in nutrient-poor media reduced host drug toxicity. Our work suggests that bacteria can rapidly adapt to host-targeted drugs and by doing so may also impact the host.

Plasmodium sporozoites express circumsporozoite protein (CSP) on their surface, an essential protein that contains central repeating motifs. Antibodies targeting this region can neutralize infection, and the partial efficacy of RTS,S/AS01 – the leading malaria vaccine against <i>P. falciparum</i> (Pf) – has been associated with the humoral response against the repeats. Although structural details of antibody recognition of PfCSP have recently emerged, the molecular basis of antibody-mediated inhibition of other Plasmodium species via CSP binding remains unclear. Here, we analyze the structure and molecular interactions of potent monoclonal antibody (mAb) 3D11 binding to <i>P. berghei</i> CSP (PbCSP) using molecular dynamics simulations, X-ray crystallography, and cryoEM. We reveal that mAb 3D11 can accommodate all subtle variances of the PbCSP repeating motifs, and, upon binding, induces structural ordering of PbCSP through homotypic interactions. Together, our findings uncover common mechanisms of antibody evolution in mammals against the CSP repeats of Plasmodium sporozoites.

Stress exposure strongly contributes to the pathophysiology of psychiatric diseases such as depression, schizophrenia, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. It also affects both function and structure of hippocampal CA1, leading to episodic memory impairment. Here, we used deep-brain optical imaging to elucidate the effects of stress on CA1 pyramidal neuron structural connectivity and activity. We tracked dynamics of dendritic spines during repeated stress and found decrease in spinogenesis followed by decrease in spine stability. In contrast to repeated stress, acute stress led to stabilization of the spines born in temporal proximity to the stressful event. To investigate the link between structural plasticity and activity patterns upon repeated stress, we studied the activity of thousands of CA1 pyramidal neurons in freely-moving. We found an increase in activity and loss of temporal organization followed by a disruption in temporal and spatial coding. Our data suggest that stress-induced sustained increase in activity leads to loss of structural connectivity and subsequent temporal and spatial coding impairments.

Many ischaemic stroke patients who have a mechanical removal of their clot (thrombectomy) do not get reperfusion of tissue despite the thrombus being removed. One hypothesis for this  no-reperfusion phenomenon is micro-emboli fragmenting off the large clot during thrombectomy and occluding smaller blood vessels downstream of the clot location. This is impossible to observe in-vivo and so we here develop an in-silico model based on in-vitro experiments to model the effect of micro-emboli on brain tissue. Through in-vitro experiments we obtain, under a variety of clot consistencies and thrombectomy techniques, micro-emboli distributions post-thrombectomy. Blood flow through the microcirculation is modelled for statistically accurate voxels of brain microvasculature including penetrating arterioles and capillary beds. A novel micro-emboli algorithm, informed by the experimental data, is used to simulate the impact of micro-emboli successively entering the penetrating arterioles and the capillary bed. Scaled-up blood flow parameters - permeability and coupling coefficients - are calculated under various conditions. We find that capillary beds are more susceptible to occlusions than the penetrating arterioles with a 4x greater drop in permeability per volume of vessel occluded. Individual microvascular geometries determine robustness to micro-emboli. Hard clot fragmentation leads to larger micro-emboli and larger drops in blood flow for a given number of micro-emboli. Thrombectomy technique has a large impact on clot fragmentation and hence occlusions in the microvasculature. As such, in-silico modelling of mechanical thrombectomy predicts that clot specific factors, interventional technique, and microvascular geometry strongly influence reperfusion of the brain. Micro-emboli are likely contributory to the phenomenon of no-reperfusion following successful removal of a major clot.

During normal neuronal activity, ionic concentration gradients across a neuron's membrane are often assumed to be stable. Prolonged spiking activity, however, can reduce transmembrane gradients and affect voltage dynamics. Based on mathematical modeling, we here investigate the impact of neuronal activity on ionic concentrations and, consequently, the dynamics of action potential generation. We find that intense spiking activity on the order of a second suffices to induce changes in ionic reversal potentials and to consistently induce a switch from a regular to an intermittent firing mode. This transition is caused by a qualitative alteration in the system's voltage dynamics, mathematically corresponding to a co-dimension-two bifurcation from a saddle-node on invariant cycle (SNIC) to a homoclinic orbit bifurcation (HOM). Our electrophysiological recordings in mouse cortical pyramidal neurons confirm the changes in action potential dynamics predicted by the models: (i) activity-dependent increases in intracellular sodium concentration directly reduce action potential amplitudes, an effect that previously had been attributed soley to sodium channel inactivation; (ii) extracellular potassium accumulation switches action potential generation from tonic firing to intermittently interrupted output. Individual neurons thus may respond very differently to the same input stimuli, depending on their recent patterns of activity or the current brain-state.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.30.403766v1?rss=1">Plasticity impairment alters community structure but permits successful pattern separation in a hippocampal network model</a></h4>

Patients who suffer from traumatic brain injury (TBI) often complain of learning and memory problems. Their symptoms are principally mediated by the hippocampus and the ability to adapt to stimulus, also known as neural plasticity. Therefore, one plausible injury mechanism is plasticity impairment, which currently lacks comprehensive investigation across TBI research. For these studies, we used a computational network model of the hippocampus that includes the dentate gyrus, CA3, and CA1 with neuron-scale resolution. We simulated mild injury through weakened spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), which modulates synaptic weights according to causal spike timing. In preliminary work, we found functional deficits consisting of decreased firing rate and broadband power in areas CA3 and CA1 after STDP impairment. To address structural changes with these studies, we applied modularity analysis to evaluate how STDP impairment modifies community structure in the hippocampal network. We also studied the emergent function of network-based learning and found that impaired networks could acquire conditioned responses after training, but the magnitude of the response was significantly lower. Furthermore, we examined pattern separation, a prerequisite of learning, by entraining two overlapping patterns. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, impaired networks did not exhibit deficits in pattern separation with either population- or rate-based coding. Collectively, these results demonstrate how a mechanism of injury that operates at the synapse regulates circuit function.

Negative correlations in the sequential evolution of interspike intervals (ISIs) are a signature of memory in neuronal spike-trains. They provide coding benefits including firing-rate stabilization, improved detectability of weak sensory signals, and enhanced transmission of information by improving signal-to-noise ratio. Here we predict observed ISI serial correlations from primary electrosensory afferents of weakly electric fish using an adaptive threshold model with a noisy spike threshold. We derive a general relationship between serial correlation coefficients (SCCs) and the autocorrelation function of added noise. Observed afferent spike-trains fall into two categories based on the pattern of SCCs: non-bursting units have negative SCCs which remain negative but decay to zero with increasing lags (Type I SCCs), and bursting units have oscillatory (alternating sign) SCCs which damp to zero with increasing lags (Type II SCCs). Type I SCCs are generated by low-pass filtering white noise before adding it to the spike threshold, whereas Type II SCCs are generated by high-pass filtering white noise. Thus, a single parameter (the sign of the pole of the filter) generates both types of SCCs. The filter pole (equivalently time-constant) is estimated from the observed SCCs. The predicted SCCs are in geometric progression. The theory predicts that the limiting sum of SCCs is -0.5, and this is confirmed from the expressions for the two types of filters. Observed SCCs from afferents have a limiting sum that is slightly larger at 0.475 {+/-} 0.04 (mean {+/-} s.d.). The theoretical limit of the sum of SCCs leads to a perfect DC block in the power spectrum of the spike-train, thereby maximizing signal-to-noise ratio during signal encoding. The experimentally observed sum of SCCs is just short of this limit and allows some noise to bleed through at zero (DC) frequency. We conclude by discussing the results from the perspective of optimal coding.

Recent evidence suggests that altered responses to affective touch - a pleasant interoceptive stimulus associated with activation of the C-Tactile (CT) system, may contribute to the aetiology and maintenance of mental conditions characterised by body image disturbances (e.g., Anorexia Nervosa). Here, we investigated whether tactile pleasantness and intensity differ across body sites, and if individual differences in dysmorphic appearance concerns and body awareness might be associated to touch perceptions across body sites. To this end, we measured perceived pleasantness and intensity of gentle, dynamic stroking touches applied to the palm, forearm, face, abdomen and back of 30 female participants (mean age: 25.87{+/-}1.17yrs) using CT-optimal (3 cm/s) and non-CT optimal (0.3 and 30 cm/s) stroking touch. As expected, participants rated CT-targeted touch as more pleasant compared to the two non-CT optimal stroking touch at all body sites. Nevertheless, CT-targeted touch applied to the abdomen elicited the lowest pleasantness ratings compared to all other body sites and to the two non-CT optimal stroking touch. Individual differences in body awareness and dysmorphic concerns significantly predicted preference for CT-optimal over non-CT optimal stroking touch applied to the forearm and the back. These findings begin to elucidate the link between CT sensitivity, dysmorphic appearance concerns and body awareness, which may have implications for future research looking to inform early interventions. Addressing impaired processing of affective interoceptive stimuli, such as CT-targeted touch, may be the key to current treatment approaches available for those populations at risk of disorders characterised by body image disturbance.

BACKGROUND. To correlate structural integrity of visual pathway white matter tracts with prolactin levels in a patient who demonstrates downward herniation of the optic chiasm secondary to medical treatment of a prolactinoma. METHODS. A 36-year-old woman with a prolactinoma presented with progressive bilateral visual field defects nine years after initial diagnosis and medical treatment. She was diagnosed with empty-sella syndrome and instructed to stop cabergoline. Hormone testing was conducted in tandem with routine clinical evaluations over one year and the patient was followed with diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and automated perimetry at three time points. Five healthy controls underwent a complementary battery of clinical and neuroimaging tests at a single time point. RESULTS. Shortly after discontinuing cabergoline, diffusion metrics in the optic tracts were within the range of values observed in healthy controls. However, following a brief period where the patient resumed cabergoline (of her own volition), there was a decrease in serum prolactin with a corresponding decrease in visual ability and increase in radial diffusivity (p&lt;0.001). Those measures again returned to their baseline ranges after discontinuing cabergoline a second time. CONCLUSIONS.  These results demonstrate the sensitivity of dMRI to detect rapid and functionally significant microstructural changes in white matter tracts secondary to alterations in serum prolactin levels. The inverse relations between prolactin and measures of diffusion and visual function provide support for a neuroprotective role of prolactin in the injured nervous system.

During development, biological neural networks produce more synapses and neurons than needed. Many of these synapses and neurons are later removed in a process known as neural pruning. Why networks should initially be over-populated, and processes that determine which synapses and neurons are ultimately pruned, remains unclear. We study the mechanisms and significance of neural pruning in model neural network. In a deep Boltzmann machine model of sensory encoding, we find that (1) synaptic pruning is necessary to learn efficient network architectures that retain computationally-relevant connections, (2) pruning by synaptic weight alone does not optimize network size and (3) pruning based on a locally-available proxy for "sloppiness" based on Fisher Information allows the network to identify structurally important vs. unimportant connections and neurons. This locally-available measure of importance has a biological interpretation in terms of the correlations between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons, and implies an efficient activity-driven pruning rule. Overall, we show how local activity-dependent synaptic pruning can solve the global problem of optimizing a network architecture. We relate these findings to biology as follows: (I) Synaptic over-production is necessary for activity-dependent connectivity optimization. (II) In networks that have more neurons than needed, cells compete for activity, and only the most important and selective neurons are retained. (III) Cells may also be pruned due to a loss of synapses on their axons. This occurs when the information they convey is not relevant to the target population.

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is one of the most important hormones responsible for bone turnover and calcium homeostasis, however, the mechanism underlying central neural regulation of PTH in mammals remains largely unknown. In this study, we identified the subfornical organ (SFO) and the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) as two important brain nuclei responded to serum PTH and calcium changes. Using chemogenetics, we found that serum PTH was suppressed by stimulation of SFOGABA neurons followed by a decrease in trabecular bone mass. Conversely, stimulation of SFOVGlut neurons promoted serum PTH and bone mass. The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) is downstream of the SFO, and chemogenetic activation of PVNCaMKII and PVNVGlut neurons induced an increase in serum PTH. These findings reveal important central neural nodes and will advance our understanding of the central neural regulation of PTH at the molecular, cellular and circuit level.

The efficient knock-in of large DNA fragments to label endogenous proteins remains especially challenging in non-dividing cells such as neurons. We developed Targeted Knock-In with Two-guides (TKIT) as a novel CRISPR/Cas9 based approach for efficient, and precise, genomic knock-in. Through targeting non-coding regions TKIT is resistant to INDEL mutations. We demonstrate TKIT labelling of endogenous synaptic proteins with various tags, with efficiencies up to 42% in mouse primary cultured neurons. Utilizing in utero electroporation or viral injections in mice TKIT can label AMPAR subunits with Super Ecliptic pHluorin, enabling visualization of endogenous AMPARs in vivo using two-photon microscopy. We further use TKIT to assess the mobility of endogenous AMPARs using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Finally, we show that TKIT can be used to tag AMPARs in rat neurons, demonstrating precise genome editing in another model organism and highlighting the broad potential of TKIT as a method to visualize endogenous proteins.

Short abstractHabituation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to repeated homotypic stressors is crucial for the organisms well-being. Many physiological and psychological disorders are associated with HPA axis dysfunction. Here, we show that glucocorticoid receptors in CRF neurons of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus are essential for HPA habituation. By increasing inhibitory tone onto CRF neurons, glucocorticoid receptors led to essential cellular modulation and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation dampening, when re-exposed to the same stressor.

In order to behave appropriately in a rapidly changing world, individuals must be able to detect when changes occur in that environment. However, at any given moment, there are a multitude of potential changes of behavioral significance that could occur. Here we investigate how knowledge about the space of possible changes affects human change point detection. We used a stochastic auditory change point detection task that allowed model-free and model-based characterization of the decision process people employ. We found that subjects can simultaneously apply distinct timescales of evidence evaluation to the same stream of evidence when there are multiple types of changes possible. Informative cues that specified the nature of the change led to improved accuracy for change point detection through mechanisms involving both the timescales of evidence evaluation and adjustments of decision bounds. These results establish three important capacities of information processing for decision making that any proposed neural mechanism of evidence evaluation must be able to support: the ability to simultaneously employ multiple timescales of evidence evaluation, the ability to rapidly adjust those timescales, and the ability to modify the amount of information required to make a decision in the context of flexible timescales.

Association and prediction studies of the brain target the biological consequences of aging and their impact on brain function. Such studies are conducted using different smoothing levels and parcellations at the preprocessing stage, on which their results are dependent. However, the impact of these parameters on the relationship between association values and prediction accuracy is not established. In this study, we used cortical thickness and its relationship with age to investigate how different smoothing and parcellation levels affect the detection of age-related brain correlates as well as brain age prediction accuracy. Our main measures were resel numbers - resolution elements - and age-related variance explained. Using these common measures enabled us to directly compare parcellation and smoothing effects in both association and prediction studies. In our sample of N=608 participants with age range 18-88, we evaluated age-related cortical thickness changes as well as brain age prediction. We found a negative relationship between prediction performance and correlation values for both parameters. Our results also quantify the relationship between delta age estimates obtained based on different processing parameters. Furthermore, with the direct comparison of the two approaches, we highlight the importance of correct choice of smoothing and parcellation parameters in each task, and how they can affect the results of the analysis in opposite directions.

<p>Neurons derived from patient induced pluripotent stem cells harboring ACTL6B p.(Val421_Cys425del) variant display reduced expression and stability of ACTL6B protein and increased spontaneous neuronal activity <i>in vitro</i>.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>ACTL6B is a component of the neuronal BRG1/brm‐associated factor (nBAF) complex, which is required for chromatin remodeling in postmitotic neurons. We recently reported biallelic pathogenic variants in <i>ACTL6B</i> in patients diagnosed with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy, subtype 76 (EIEE‐76), presenting with severe, global developmental delay, epileptic encephalopathy, cerebral atrophy, and abnormal central nervous system myelination. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying their phenotype is unknown. Here, we investigate the molecular pathogenesis of ACTL6B p.(Val421_Cys425del) using <i>in silico</i> 3D protein modeling predictions and patient‐specific induced pluripotent stem cell‐derived neurons. We found neurons derived from EIEE‐76 patients showed impaired accumulation of ACTL6B compared to unaffected relatives, caused by reduced protein stability. Furthermore, EIEE‐76 patient‐derived neurons had dysregulated nBAF target gene expression, including genes important for neuronal development and disease. Multielectrode array system analysis unveiled elevated electrophysiological activity of EIEE‐76 patients‐derived neurons, consistent with the patient phenotype. Taken together, our findings validate a new model for EIEE‐76 and reveal how reduced ACTL6B expression affects neuronal function.</p>

<p>Ultrasonic neuromodulation of peripheral nerve cells.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Satisfactory treatment of peripheral nerve injury (PNI) faces difficulties owing to the intrinsic biological barriers in larger injuries and invasive surgical interventions. Injury gaps &gt;3 cm have low chances of full motor and sensory recovery, and the unmet need for PNI repair techniques which increase the likelihood of functional recovery while limiting invasiveness motivate this work. Building upon prior work in ultrasound stimulation (US) of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, the effects of US on DRG neuron and Schwann cell (SC) cocultures were investigated to uncover the role of SCs in mediating the neuronal response to US <i>in vitro</i>. Acoustic intensity‐dependent alteration in selected neuromorphometrics of DRG neurons in coculture with SCs was observed in total outgrowth, primary neurites, and length compared to previously reported DRG monoculture in a calcium‐independent manner. SC viability and proliferation were not impacted by US. Conditioned medium studies suggest secreted factors from SCs subjected to US impact DRG neuron morphology. These findings advance the current understanding of mechanisms by which these cell types respond to US, which may lead to new noninvasive US therapies for treating PNI.</p>

<p>Extracellular ascorbic acid induces Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, stimulating sodium‐dependent vitamin C transporter 2 (SVCT2) anterograde trafficking in wild‐type cells. No ascorbic acid‐induced cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase was observed in Huntington's disease (HD) cells. Thus, SVCT2 would fail to reach the cellular surface, affecting ascorbic acid uptake in HD cells.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a glutamine expansion at the first exon of the huntingtin gene. Huntingtin protein (Htt) is ubiquitously expressed and it is localized in several organelles, including endosomes. HD is associated with a failure in energy metabolism and oxidative damage. Ascorbic acid is a powerful antioxidant highly concentrated in the brain where it acts as a messenger, modulating neuronal metabolism. It is transported into neurons via the sodium‐dependent vitamin C transporter 2 (SVCT2). During synaptic activity, ascorbic acid is released from glial reservoirs to the extracellular space, inducing an increase in SVCT2 localization at the plasma membrane. Here, we studied SVCT2 trafficking and localization in HD. SVCT2 is decreased at synaptic terminals in YAC128 male mice. Using cellular models for HD (STHdhQ7 and STHdhQ111 cells), we determined that SVCT2 trafficking through secretory and endosomal pathways is altered in resting conditions. We observed Golgi fragmentation and SVCT2/Htt‐associated protein‐1 mis‐colocalization. Additionally, we observed altered ascorbic acid‐induced calcium signaling that explains the reduced SVCT2 translocation to the plasma membrane in the presence of extracellular ascorbic acid (active conditions) described in our previous results. Therefore, SVCT2 trafficking to the plasma membrane is altered in resting and active conditions in HD, explaining the redox imbalance observed during early stages of the disease.</p>

<p>Axonal growth is a relevant process for development and regeneration. After peripheral nervous system (PNS) injury, Reelin levels increase, and mice devoid of Reelin show an impairment in nerve regeneration. Here we show, for the first time, that Reelin increases the regenerative outcome of dorsal root ganglia axons after axotomy (a mock, b Reelin treated). (c) After binding to its receptor, Apolipoprotein E‐receptor 2, Reelin activates the Rho GTPases Cdc42 that regulates actin dynamics, and TC10, required for membrane addition by interacting with the exocyst complex. TC10 recruits to membrane vesicles that potentially could come from Golgi and/or recycling endosomes. TC10 vesicles also contain ApoER2 and the v‐SNARE protein VAMP7. Reelin increases the fusion of vesicles, containing VAMP7, at the growth cone. Therefore, Reelin signaling could have a therapeutic role in PNS lesions, improving axonal outgrowth.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Axonal outgrowth is a fundamental process during the development of central (CNS) and peripheral (PNS) nervous system as well as in nerve regeneration and requires accurate axonal navigation and extension to the correct target. These events need proper coordination between membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal rearrangements and are under the control of the small GTPases of the Rho family, among other molecules. Reelin, a relevant protein for CNS development and synaptic function in the adult, is also present in the PNS. Upon sciatic nerve damage, Reelin expression increases and, on the other hand, mice deficient in Reelin exhibit an impaired nerve regeneration. However, the mechanism(s) involved the Reelin‐dependent axonal growth is still poorly understood. In this work, we present evidence showing that Reelin stimulates dorsal root ganglia (DRG) regeneration after axotomy. Moreover, dissociated DRG neurons express the Reelin receptor Apolipoprotein E‐receptor 2 and also require the presence of TC10 to develop their axons. TC10 is a Rho GTPase that promotes neurite outgrowth through the exocytic fusion of vesicles at the growth cone. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that Reelin controls TC10 activation in DRG neurons. Besides, we confirmed that the known CNS Reelin target Cdc42 is also activated in DRG and controls TC10 activity. Finally, in the process of membrane addition, we found that Reelin stimulates the fusion of membrane carriers containing the v‐SNARE protein VAMP7 in vesicles that contain TC10. Altogether, our work shows a new role of Reelin in PNS, opening the option of therapeutic interventions to improve the regeneration process.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Dysregulation of the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis is often linked to the neurobiology of depression, though the presence and type of this dysregulation is not a consistent finding. Meanwhile, significant sex differences exist regarding depression and the HPA axis. Animal models of depression simulate certain aspects of the human disease and aim to advance our knowledge regarding its neurobiology and discover new antidepressant treatments. Most animal models of depression induce a depressive‐like phenotype taking advantage of stressful experimental conditions, that also increase corticosterone, the main stress hormone in rodents. In this review we present inconsistent results in male and female rodents regarding the interaction between the depressive‐like behavioral phenotype and corticosterone. In commonly used models, the female depressive‐like phenotype in rodents seems significantly less dependent on the stress hormone corticosterone, whereas the male behavioral response is more evident and associates with variations of corticosterone. Further research and clarification of this sex‐dependent interaction will have significant ramifications on the improvement of the validity of animal models of depression.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Lithium is widely used to treat bipolar disorder. However, the efficacy and vulnerability as to its side effects are known to differ. Although the specific biochemical mechanism of action is still elusive, lithium may influence mitochondrial function, and consequently, metabolism. Lithium exposure in this study was conducted on a unique set of mito‐nuclear introgression lines of <i>Drosophila subobscura</i> to disentangle the independent effects of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) against a common nuclear DNA background. The study addressed three issues: (a) whether lithium has a dose‐dependent effect on whole‐organism metabolic rate, (b) whether mtDNA haplotypes show divergent metabolic efficiency measured by metabolic rate to lithium exposure and (c) whether lithium influences the whole‐organism metabolic rate across sexes. The results confirm that lithium influenced the whole‐organism metabolic rate, showing a subtle balance between efficacy and adverse effects within a narrow dose range. In addition, lithium exposure was found to influence metabolism differently based on mtDNA haplotypes and sex. This preliminary research may have a range of biological implications for the role of mitochondrial variability in psychiatric disease and treatment by contributing to the understanding and predicting of the lithium treatment response and risk for toxic side effects.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a highly prevalent neurodegenerative condition. The disease involves the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons located in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Among late‐onset, familial forms of Parkinson are cases with mutations in the PARK17 locus encoding the vacuolar protein sorting 35 (Vps35), a subunit of the retromer complex. The retromer complex is composed of a heterotrimeric protein core (Vps26‐Vps35‐Vps29). The best‐known role of retromer is the retrieval of cargoes from endosomes to the Golgi complex or the plasma membrane. However, recent literature indicates that retromer performs roles associated with lysosomal and mitochondrial functions and degradative pathways such as autophagy. A common point mutation affecting the retromer subunit Vps35 is D620N, which has been linked to the alterations in the aforementioned cellular processes as well as with neurodegeneration. Here, we review the main aspects of the malfunction of the retromer complex and its implications for PD pathology. Besides, we highlight several controversies still awaiting clarification.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The dynamic of the temporal correlations between brain areas, called functional connectivity (FC), undergoes complex transformations through the life span. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of these changes in the nonpathological brain from fetal life to advanced age. After a brief description of the main methods, we propose that FC development can be divided into four main phases: first, before birth, a strong change in FC leads to the emergence of functional proto‐networks, involving mainly within network short‐range connections. Then, during the first years of life, there is a strong widespread organization of networks which starts with segregation processes followed by a continuous increase in integration. Thereafter, from adolescence to early adulthood, a refinement of existing networks in the brain occurs, characterized by an increase in integrative processes until about 40 years. Middle age constitutes a pivotal period associated with an inversion of the functional brain trajectories with a decrease in segregation process in conjunction to a large‐scale reorganization of between network connections. Studies suggest that these processes are in line with the development of cognitive and sensory functions throughout life as well as their deterioration. During aging, results support the notion of dedifferentiation processes, which refer to the decrease in functional selectivity of the brain regions, resulting in more diffuse and less specialized FC, associated with the disruption of cognitive functions with age. The inversion of developmental processes during aging is in accordance with the developmental models of neuroanatomy for which the latest matured regions are the first to deteriorate.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Voltage‐gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Ca<sub>V</sub>) channels are crucial for neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission upon depolarization. Their properties <i>in vivo</i> are modulated by their interaction with a variety of scaffolding proteins. Such interactions can influence the function and localization of Ca<sub>V</sub> channels, as well as their coupling to intracellular second messengers and regulatory pathways, thus amplifying their signaling potential. Among these scaffolding proteins, a subset of PDZ (postsynaptic density‐95, Drosophila discs‐large, and zona occludens)‐domain containing proteins play diverse roles in modulating Ca<sub>V</sub> channel properties. At the presynaptic terminal, PDZ proteins enrich Ca<sub>V</sub> channels in the active zone, enabling neurotransmitter release by maintaining a tight and vital link between channels and vesicles. In the postsynaptic density, these interactions are essential in regulating dendritic spine morphology and postsynaptic signaling cascades. In this review, we highlight the studies that demonstrate dynamic regulations of neuronal Ca<sub>V</sub> channels by PDZ proteins. We discuss the role of PDZ proteins in controlling channel activity, regulating channel cell surface density, and influencing channel‐mediated downstream signaling events. We highlight the importance of PDZ protein regulations of Ca<sub>V</sub> channels and evaluate the link between this regulatory effect and human disease.</p>

<p>Using both novel and traditional lesion methods in humans, the neural networks responsible for mind‐wandering were studied. Both lesion analyses demonstrated that reduced mind‐wandering was associated with damage to brain regions within the default mode network.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Functional neuroimaging research has consistently associated brain structures within the default mode network (DMN) and frontoparietal network (FPN) with mind‐wandering. Targeted lesion research has documented impairments in mind‐wandering after damage to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampal regions associated with the DMN. However, no lesion studies to date have applied lesion network mapping to identify common networks associated with deficits in mind‐wandering. In lesion network mapping, resting‐state functional connectivity data from healthy participants are used to infer which brain regions are functionally connected to each lesion location from a sample with brain injury. In the current study, we conducted a lesion network mapping analysis to test the hypothesis that lesions affecting the DMN and FPN would be associated with diminished mind‐wandering. We assessed mind‐wandering frequency on the Imaginal Processes Inventory (IPI) in participants with brain injury (<i>n</i> = 29) and healthy comparison participants without brain injury (<i>n</i> = 19). Lesion network mapping analyses showed the strongest association of reduced mind‐wandering with the left inferior parietal lobule within the DMN. In addition, traditional lesion symptom mapping results revealed that reduced mind‐wandering was associated with lesions of the dorsal, ventral, and anterior sectors of mPFC, parietal lobule, and inferior frontal gyrus in the DMN (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05 uncorrected). These findings provide novel lesion support for the role of the DMN in mind‐wandering and contribute to a burgeoning literature on the neural correlates of spontaneous cognition.</p>

<p>Early life stress (ELS) induces long‐lasting social behavior deficits.

<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Trauma during critical periods of development can induce long‐lasting adverse effects. To study neural aberrations resulting from early life stress (ELS), many studies utilize rodent maternal separation, whereby pups are intermittently deprived of maternal care necessary for proper development. This can produce adulthood behavioral deficits related to anxiety, reward, and social behavior. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) encodes aspects of anxiety‐like and social behaviors, and also undergoes developmental maturation during the early postnatal period, rendering it vulnerable to effects of ELS. Mice underwent maternal separation (separation 4 hr/day during postnatal day (PD)2–5 and 8 hr/day on PD6‐16) with early weaning on PD17, which induced behavioral deficits in adulthood performance on two‐part social interaction task designed to test social motivation (choice between a same‐sex novel conspecific or an empty cup) and social novelty preference (choice between the original‐novel conspecific vs. a new‐novel conspecific). We used chemogenetics to non‐selectively silence or activate neurons in the BNST to examine its role in social motivation and social novelty preference, in mice with or without the history of ELS. Manipulation of BNST produced differing social behavior effects in non‐stressed versus ELS mice; social motivation was decreased in non‐stressed mice following BNST activation, but unchanged following BNST silencing, while ELS mice showed no change in social behavior after BNST activation, but exhibited enhancement of social motivation—for which they were deficient prior—following BNST silencing. Findings emphasize the BNST as a potential therapeutic target for social anxiety disorders instigated by childhood trauma.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Recently there is widespread interest in women's underrepresentation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); however, progress toward gender equality in these fields is slow. More alarmingly, these gender disparities worsen when examining women's representation within STEM departments in academia. While the number of women receiving postgraduate degrees has increased in recent years, the number of women in STEM faculty positions remains largely unchanged. One explanation for this lack of progress toward gender parity is negative and pervasive gender stereotypes, which may facilitate hiring discrimination and reduce opportunities for women's career advancement. Women in STEM also have lower social capital (e.g., support networks), limiting women's opportunities to earn tenure and learn about grant funding mechanisms. Women faculty in STEM may also perceive their academic climate as unwelcoming and threatening, and report hostility and uncomfortable tensions in their work environments, such as sexual harassment and discrimination. Merely the presence of gender‐biased cues in physical spaces targeted toward men (e.g., “geeky” décor) can foster a sense of not belonging in STEM. We describe the following three factors that likely contribute to gender inequalities and women's departure from academic STEM fields: (a) numeric underrepresentation and stereotypes, (b) lack of supportive social networks, and (c) chilly academic climates. We discuss potential solutions for these problems, focusing on National Science Foundation‐funded ADVANCE organizational change interventions that target (a) recruiting diverse applicants (e.g., training search committees), (b) mentoring, networking, and professional development (e.g., promoting women faculty networks); and (c) improving academic climate (e.g., educating male faculty on gender bias).</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Over the last 10 years, rates of alcohol use disorder (AUD) have increased in women by 84% relative to a 35% increase in men. Rates of alcohol use and high‐risk drinking have also increased in women by 16% and 58% relative to a 7% and 16% increase in men, respectively, over the last decade. This robust increase in drinking among women highlights the critical need to identify the underlying neural mechanisms that may contribute to problematic alcohol consumption across sex/gender (SG), especially given that many neuroimaging studies are underpowered to detect main or interactive effects of SG on imaging outcomes. This narrative review aims to explore the recent neuroimaging literature on SG differences in brain function and structure as it pertains to alcohol across positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and functional magnetic resonance imaging modalities in humans. Additional work using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, diffusion tensor imaging, and event‐related potentials to examine SG differences in AUD will be covered. Overall, current research on the neuroimaging of AUD, alcohol consumption, or risk of AUD is limited, and findings are mixed regarding the effect of SG on neurochemical, structural, and functional mechanisms associated with AUD. We address SG disparities in the neuroimaging of AUD and propose a call to action to include women in brain imaging research. Future studies are crucial to our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of AUD across neural systems and the vulnerability for AUD among women and men.</p>

<p>A faulty radial glia scaffold and an abnormal cell layering were observed in the hippocampus of male, but not female, biogenesis of lysosome‐related organelles complex‐1‐deficient mice, early postnatally.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The function(s) of the Biogenesis of Lysosome‐related Organelles Complex‐1 (BLOC‐1) during brain development is to date largely unknown. Here, we investigated how its absence alters the trajectory of postnatal brain development using as model the pallid mouse. Most of the defects observed early postnatally in the mutant mice were more prominent in males than in females and in the hippocampus. Male mutant mice, but not females, had smaller brains as compared to sex‐matching wild types at postnatal day 1 (P1), this deficit was largely recovered by P14 and P45. An abnormal cytoarchitecture of the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus was observed in P1 pallid male, but not female, or juvenile mice (P45), along with severely decreased expression levels of the radial glial marker Glutamate‐Aspartate Transporter. Transcriptomic analyses showed that the overall response to the lack of functional BLOC‐1 was more pronounced in hippocampi at P1 than at P45 or in the cerebral cortex. These observations suggest that absence of BLOC‐1 renders males more susceptible to perinatal brain maldevelopment and although most abnormalities appear to have been resolved in juvenile animals, still permanent defects may be present, resulting in faulty neuronal circuits, and contribute to previously reported cognitive and behavioral phenotypes in adult BLOC‐1‐deficient mice.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The development of safe and effective treatments for age‐associated neurodegenerative disorders is an on‐going challenge faced by the scientific field. Key to the development of such therapies is the appropriate selection of modeling systems in which to investigate disease mechanisms and to test candidate interventions. There are unique challenges in the development of representative laboratory models of neurodegenerative diseases, including the complexity of the human brain, the cumulative and variable contributions of genetic and environmental factors over the course of a lifetime, inability to culture human primary neurons, and critical central nervous system differences between small animal models and humans. While traditional rodent models have advanced our understanding of neurodegenerative disease mechanisms, key divergences such as the species‐specific genetic background can limit the application of animal models in many cases. Here we review <i>in vitro</i> human neuronal systems that employ stem cell and reprogramming technology and their application to a range of neurodegenerative diseases. Specifically, we compare human‐induced pluripotent stem cell‐derived neurons to directly converted, or transdifferentiated, induced neurons, as both model systems can take advantage of patient‐derived human tissue to produce neurons in culture. We present recent technical developments using these two modeling systems, as well as current limitations to these systems, with the aim of advancing investigation of neuropathogenic mechanisms using these models.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The brain is both central in orchestrating the response to stress, and, a very sensitive target when such response is not controlled. In fact, stress has long been associated with the onset and/or exacerbation of several neuropsychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression, and drug addiction. The hippocampus is a key brain region involved in the response to stress, not only due to its anatomical connections with the hypothalamic‐pituitary‐adrenal axis but also as a major target of stress mediators. The hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG)‐CA3 circuit, composed of DG granule cells axons (mossy fibers) synapsing onto CA3 pyramidal cells, plays an essential role in memory encoding and retrieval, functions that are vulnerable to stress. Although naturally excitatory, this circuit is under the inhibitory control of GABAergic interneurons that maintain the excitation/inhibition balance. One subgroup of such interneurons produces neuropeptide Y (NPY), which has emerged as a promising endogenous stress “resilience molecule” due to its anxiolytic and anti‐epileptic properties. Here we examine existing evidence that reveals a potential role for hilar NPY+ interneurons in mediating stress‐induced changes in hippocampal function. We will focus specifically on rodent models of early life stress (ELS), defined as adverse conditions during the early postnatal period that can have profound consequences for neurodevelopment. Collectively, these findings suggest that the long‐lasting effects of ELS might stem from the loss of GABAergic NPY+ cells, which then can lead to reduced inhibition in the DG‐CA3 pathway. Such change might then lead to hyperexcitability and concomitant hippocampal‐dependent behavioral deficits.</p>

<p>Functional circadian rhythms are essential for fertility and successful reproduction. PER2::Luciferase circadian reporter mice determined relationships between circadian rhythms during the estrous cycle and pregnancy and how these rhythms could be regulated by progesterone, a steroid important in reproductive function.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Molecular and behavioral timekeeping is regulated by the circadian system which includes the brain's suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) that translates environmental light information into neuronal and endocrine signals aligning peripheral tissue rhythms to the time of day. Despite the critical role of circadian rhythms in fertility, it remains unexplored how circadian rhythms change within reproductive tissues during pregnancy. To determine how estrous cycle and pregnancy impact phase relationships of reproductive tissues, we used PER2::Luciferase (PER2::LUC) circadian reporter mice and determined the time of day of PER2::LUC peak (phase) in the SCN, pituitary, uterus, and ovary. The relationships between reproductive tissue PER2::LUC phases changed throughout the estrous cycle and late pregnancy and were accompanied by changes to PER2::LUC period in the SCN, uterus, and ovary. To determine if the phase relationship adaptations were driven by sex steroids, we asked if progesterone, a hormone involved in estrous cyclicity and pregnancy, could regulate Per2‐luciferase expression. Using an <i>in vitro</i> transfection assay, we found that progesterone increased Per2‐luciferase expression in immortalized SCN (SCN2.2) and arcuate nucleus (KTAR) cells. In addition, progesterone shortened PER2::LUC period in <i>ex vivo</i> uterine tissue recordings collected during pregnancy. As progesterone dramatically increases during pregnancy, we evaluated wheel‐running patterns in PER2::LUC mice. We confirmed that activity levels decrease during pregnancy and found that activity onset was delayed. Although SCN, but not arcuate nucleus, PER2::LUC period changed during late pregnancy, onset of locomotor activity did not correlate with SCN or arcuate nucleus PER2::LUC period.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In offspring, an adequate maternal diet is important for neurodevelopment. One mechanism by which maternal diet impacts neurodevelopment is through its dynamic role in the development of the gut microbiota. Communication between the gut, and its associated microbiota, and the brain is facilitated by the vagus nerve, in addition to other routes. Currently, the mechanisms through which maternal diet impacts offspring microbiota development are not well‐defined. Therefore, this review aims to investigate the relationship between maternal diet during pregnancy and offspring microbiota development and its impact on neurodevelopment. Both human and animal model studies were reviewed to understand the impact of maternal diet on offspring microbiota development and potential consequences on neurodevelopment. In the period after birth, as reported in both human and model system studies, maternal diet impacts offspring bacterial colonization (e.g., decreased presence of <i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i> as a result of a high‐fat maternal diet). It remains unknown whether these changes persist into adulthood and whether they impact vulnerability to disease. Therefore, further long‐term studies are required in both human and model systems to study these changes. Our survey of the literature indicates that maternal diet influences early postnatal microbiota development, which in turn, may serve as a mechanism through which maternal diet impacts neurodevelopment.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>All mammalian species depend on the placenta, a transient organ, for exchange of gases, nutrients, and waste between the mother and conceptus. Besides serving as a conduit for such exchanges, the placenta produces hormones and other factors that influence maternal physiology and fetal development. To meet all of these adaptations, the placenta has evolved to become the most structurally diverse organ within all mammalian taxa. However, commonalities exist as to how placental responses promote survival against <i>in utero</i> threats and can alter the trajectory of fetal development, in particular the brain. Increasing evidence suggests that reactions of the  placenta to various <i>in utero</i> stressors may lead to long‐standing health outcomes, otherwise considered developmental origin of health and disease effects. Besides transferring nutrients and gases, the placenta produces neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine/epinephrine, that may circulate and influence brain development. Neurobehavioral disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders, likely trace their origins back to placental disturbances. This intimate relationship between the placenta and brain has led to coinage of the term, the placenta‐brain‐axis. This axis will be the focus herein, including how conceptus sex might influence it, and technologies employed to parse out the effects of placental‐specific transcript expression changes on later neurobehavioral disorders. Ultimately, the placenta might provide a historical record of <i>in utero</i> threats the fetus confronted and a roadmap to understand how placenta responses to such encounters impacts the placental‐brain‐axis. Improved early diagnostic and preventative approaches may thereby be designed to mitigate such placental disruptions.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>White matter pathologies, as well as intellectual disability, microcephaly, and other central nervous system injuries, are clinical traits commonly ascribed to classic phenylketonuria (PKU). PKU is an inherited metabolic disease elicited by the deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase. Accumulation of <span class="smallCaps">l</span>‐phenylalanine (Phe) and its metabolites is found in tissues and body fluids in phenylketonuric patients. In order to mitigate the clinical findings, rigorous dietary Phe restriction constitutes the core of therapeutic management in PKU. Myelination is the process whereby the oligodendrocytes wrap myelin sheaths around the axons, supporting the conduction of action potentials. White matter injuries are implicated in the brain damage related to PKU, especially in untreated or poorly treated patients. The present review summarizes evidence toward putative mechanisms driving the white matter pathology in PKU patients.</p>

<p>Case‐series study involving 101 multiple sclerosis patients revealed a link between KCNA3 polymorphism rs2821557 and the rate of disease progression. Minor C allele carriers exhibited significantly higher incidence of the rapid disease course and higher counts of CXCR3+ T<sub>EM</sub> cells compared to TT genotype carriers.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The rate of symptom accumulation distinguishes between slowly and rapidly progressing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). Given that a patient's genetics can affect the rate of disease progression, identification of genetic variants associated with rapid disease progression should provide valuable information for timely prognosis and development of optimal treatment plans. We hypothesized that the polymorphism rs2821557 in the human <i>KCNA3</i> gene encoding a voltage‐gated potassium channel Kv1.3 might be one of these genetic variants, given the role of Kv1.3 in neuroinflammation, as well as the location and gain‐of‐function effect of this polymorphism. To test this hypothesis we performed an analytic study exploring the relationships between rs2821557 polymorphism and disease progression in a cohort of MS patients. The rs2821557 genotype and the rate of disease progression based on Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score (MSSS) were determined for 101 patients (68 females and 33 males). Peripheral blood CD4+ lymphocyte subpopulations (T<sub>naive</sub>, T<sub>CM</sub>, T<sub>EM</sub>) and the expression of chemokine receptors (CXCR5, CXCR3, CCR6, CCR4) were estimated by flow cytometry.  The comparisons between groups by genotype (TT, TC, CC) and allelic approach analysis (T vs. C) revealed a significantly higher incidence of the rapid disease course (MSSS ≥ 7.5) among minor C allele carriers (CC and TC) compared to patients with the TT genotype. Furthermore, C allele carriers had higher counts of CXCR3+ T<sub>EM</sub> cells than homozygous T allele carriers. In conclusion, accelerated MS progression in C allele carriers is likely linked to enhanced Kv1.3‐mediated accumulation of pathogenic CXCR3+ T<sub>EM</sub> cells and exacerbated neuroinflammation.</p>

<p>Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1)‐affected adults (blue) exhibit lower scores on measures of cognitive function than unaffected adults (pink). These differences are associated with enlarged hippocampal volume in DM1‐affected individuals for Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale‐IV index measures of perceptual reasoning (Panel a) and processing speed (Panel b).</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Studies have shown relationships between white matter abnormalities and cognitive dysfunction in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), but comprehensive analysis of potential structure–function relationships are lacking. Fifty adult‐onset DM1 individuals (33 female) and 68 unaffected adults (45 female) completed the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale‐IV (WAIS‐IV) to determine the levels and patterns of intellectual functioning. Neuroimages were acquired with a 3T scanner and were processed with BrainsTools. Regional brain volumes (regions of interest, ROIs) were adjusted for inter‐scanner variation and intracranial volume. Linear regression models were conducted to assess if group by ROI interaction terms significantly predicted WAIS‐IV composite scores. Models were adjusted for age and sex. The DM1 group had lower Perceptual Reasoning Index (PRI), Working Memory Index (WMI), and Processing Speed Index (PSI) scores than the unaffected group (PRI <i>t</i>
<sub>(113)</sub> = −3.28, <i>p</i> = 0.0014; WMI <i>t</i>
<sub>(114)</sub> = −3.49, <i>p</i> = 0.0007; PSI <i>t</i>
<sub>(114)</sub> = −2.98, <i>p</i> = 0.0035). The group by hippocampus interaction term was significant for both PRI and PSI (PRI (<i>t</i>
<sub>(111)</sub> = −2.82, <i>p</i> = 0.0057; PSI (<i>t</i>
<sub>(112)</sub> = −2.87, <i>p</i> = 0.0049)). There was an inverse association between hippocampal volume and both PRI and PSI in the DM1 group (the higher the volume, the lower the intelligence quotient scores), but no such association was observed in the unaffected group. Enlarged hippocampal volume may underlie some aspects of cognitive dysfunction in adult‐onset DM1, suggesting that increased volume of the hippocampus may be pathological.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common movement neurodegenerative disorder. Although our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of pathogenesis in PD has greatly expanded, this knowledge thus far has failed to translate into disease‐modifying therapies. Therefore, it is of the utmost urgency to interrogate further the multifactorial etiology of PD. DNA repair defects cause many neurodegenerative diseases. An exciting new PD research avenue is the role that DNA damage and repair may play in neuronal death. The goal of this mini‐review was to discuss the evidence for the types of DNA damage that accumulates in PD, which has provided clues for which DNA repair pathways, such as DNA double‐strand break repair, are dysfunctional. We further highlight compelling data for activation of the DNA damage response in familial and idiopathic PD. The significance of DNA damage and repair is emerging in the PD field and linking these insights to PD pathogenesis may provide new insights into PD pathophysiology and consequently lead to new therapies.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a heterogeneous inflammatory demyelinating disease. Iron distribution is altered in MS patients’ brains suggesting iron liberation within active lesions amplifies demyelination and neurodegeneration. Whether the amount and distribution of iron are similar or different among different MS immunopatterns is currently unknown.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used synchrotron X‐ray fluorescence imaging, histology and immunohistochemistry to compare the iron quantity and distribution between immunopattern II and III early active MS lesions. We analyzed archival autopsy and biopsy tissue from 21 MS patients.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Immunopattern II early active lesions contain 64% more iron (95%CI: 17%, 127%; p=0.004) than immunopattern III lesions, and 30% more iron than the surrounding periplaque white matter (95%CI: 3%, 64%; p=0.03). Iron in immunopattern III lesions is 28% lower than in the periplaque white matter (95%CI: ‐40%, ‐14%; p&lt;0.001). When normalizing the iron content of early active lesions to that of surrounding periplaque white matter, the ratio is significantly higher in immunopattern II (p&lt;0.001). Micro‐focused X‐ray fluorescence imaging shows that iron in immunopattern II lesions localizes to macrophages, while macrophages in immunopattern III lesions contain little iron.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Iron distribution and content are heterogeneous in early active MS lesions. Iron accumulates in macrophages in immunopattern II, but not immunopattern III lesions. This heterogeneity in the two most common MS immunopatterns may be explained by different macrophage polarization, origin or different demyelination mechanisms, and paves the way for developing new or using existing iron‐sensitive MRI techniques to differentiate among immunopatterns in the general non‐biopsied MS patient population.</p>

<p>The laminar distribution of corticothalamic (CT) neurons projecting to the pulvinar thalamic nucleus was assessed in two species: cats and mice. Following injections of the retrograde tracer fragment B of cholera toxin (CTb) in the pulvinar, the morphology, and distribution of labeled neurons in the infragranular layers of the visual cortex was compared between the two species. In cats, CT neurons were mostly distributed in Layer 6 in all extrastriate areas. The exception was Area 17 that labeled neurons where almost exclusively located in Layer 5. In mice, CT neurons were mostly located in Layer 6 across all areas, including V1. Our findings show a distinct pattern of CT projections in mice in comparison to the one in cats suggesting that the pulvinar nucleus plays distinct roles in the transthalamic transmission of visual information in these species.

</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The cortical processing of visual information is thought to follow a hierarchical framework. This framework of connections between visual areas is based on the laminar patterns of direct feedforward and feedback cortico‐cortical projections. However, this view ignores the cortico‐thalamo‐cortical projections to the pulvinar nucleus in the thalamus, which provides an alternative transthalamic information transfer between cortical areas. It was proposed that corticothalamic (CT) pathways follow a similar hierarchical pattern as cortico‐cortical connections. Two main types of CT projections have been recognized: drivers and modulators. Drivers originate mainly in Layer 5 whereas modulators are from Layer 6. Little is known about the laminar distribution of these projections to the pulvinar across visual cortical areas. Here, we analyzed the distribution of CT neurons projecting to the lateral posterior (LP) thalamus in two species: cats and mice. Injections of the retrograde tracer fragment B of cholera toxin (CTb) were performed in the LP. The morphology and cortical laminar distribution of CTb‐labeled neurons was assessed. In cats, neurons were mostly found in Layer 6 except in Area 17, where they were mostly in Layer 5. In contrast, CT neurons in mice were mostly located in Layer 6 across all areas. Thus, our results demonstrate that CT projections in mice do not follow the same organization as cats suggesting that the transthalamic pathways play distinct roles in these species.</p>

<p>The amygdaloid volume in <i>Macaca fascicularis</i> monkeys is of 174 mm<sup>3</sup> with a surface area of 151 mm<sup>2</sup>. The accessory basal nuclei are smaller than the lateral and basal nuclei, showing no brain interhemispheric differences. In opposite, the greater size of neuronal volume appears in the accessory basal nuclei.

</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The amygdaloid complex (AC) is involved in very relevant cognitive and emotional pathways, and exhibit changes in aging and in some neurological and psychiatric disorders. The quantitative estimators of AC could be useful to understand the impact of amygdaloid pathology in these processes, both globally and for each nucleus in particular, and their neurons. The present study analyzes morphometric and stereological estimators in the whole AC and its three main nuclei (lateral (La), basal (Ba) and accessory basal (AB) in six <i>Macaca fascicularis</i> monkeys. All the brains were fixed and sectioned in the coronal plane; Nissl stained sections were used for estimation of size and form parameters in both, the AC, and the La, Ba, and AB nuclei separately. The study includes stereological estimates of the volume and surface area of the AC; also, volume of the neurons in the amygdaloid nuclei was estimated using the point‐sampled intercepts method. Our results show that the AB nucleus is smaller than both the La and Ba nuclei in both morphometric and stereological estimators. Brain hemispheric side had not significant influence on any of quantitative estimates. The neuron volume was higher in the AB nucleus relative to LA and Ba of the nuclei. These data describe some quantitative parameters of the amygdaloid complex and their main nuclei that could help us to detect small changes in neurodegenerative and other pathological processes.</p>

<p>We identified a novel population of inhibitory prodynorphin neurons in the brainstem which we named LJA5. LJA5 neurons selectively target lamina I of the spinal cord, and other sensory nuclei including the lateral parabrachial and periaqueductal gray. Activation of LJA5 neurons reduces pain and itch.

</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sensory information is transmitted from peripheral nerves, through the spinal cord, and up to the brain (“bottom up” pathway). Some of this information may be modulated by “top‐down” projections from the brain to the spinal cord. Discovering endogenous mechanisms for reducing pain and itch holds enormous potential for developing new treatments. However, neurons mediating the top‐down inhibition of pain are not well understood, nor has any such pathway been identified for itch sensation. Here we identify a novel population of GABAergic neurons in the ventral brainstem, distinguished by prodynorphin expression, which we named LJA5. LJA5 neurons provide the only known inhibitory projection specifically to lamina I of the spinal cord, which contains sensory neurons that transmit pain and itch information up to the brain. Chemogenetically activating LJA5 neurons in male mice reduces capsaicin‐induced pain and histamine‐induced itch. Identifying this new pathway opens new treatment opportunities for chronic, refractory pain and pruritis.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Epilepsy develops in 70 to 90% of children with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and is often resistant to medication. Recently, the concept of preventive antiepileptic treatment to modify the natural history of epilepsy has been proposed. EPISTOP was a clinical trial designed to compare preventive versus conventional antiepileptic treatment in TSC infants.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this multicenter study, 94 infants with TSC without seizure history were followed with monthly video electroencephalography (EEG), and received vigabatrin either as conventional antiepileptic treatment, started after the first electrographic or clinical seizure, or preventively when epileptiform EEG activity before seizures was detected. At 6 sites, subjects were randomly allocated to treatment in a 1:1 ratio in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). At 4 sites, treatment allocation was fixed; this was denoted an open‐label trial (OLT). Subjects were followed until 2 years of age. The primary endpoint was the time to first clinical seizure.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In 54 subjects, epileptiform EEG abnormalities were identified before seizures. Twenty‐seven were included in the RCT and 27 in the OLT. The time to the first clinical seizure was significantly longer with preventive than conventional treatment [RCT: 364 days (95% confidence interval [CI] = 223–535) vs 124 days (95% CI = 33–149); OLT: 426 days (95% CI = 258–628) vs 106 days (95% CI = 11–149)]. At 24 months, our pooled analysis showed preventive treatment reduced the risk of clinical seizures (odds ratio [OR] = 0.21, <i>p</i> = 0.032), drug‐resistant epilepsy (OR = 0.23, <i>p</i> = 0.022), and infantile spasms (OR = 0, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). No adverse events related to preventive treatment were noted.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Preventive treatment with vigabatrin was safe and modified the natural history of seizures in TSC, reducing the risk and severity of epilepsy. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>Reports on phase separation and amyloid formation for multiple proteins and aggregation-prone peptides are recurrently used to explore the molecular mechanisms associated with several human diseases. The information conveyed by these reports can be used directly in translational investigation, e.g., for the design of better drug screening strategies, or be compiled in databases for benchmarking novel aggregation-predicting algorithms. Given that minute protocol variations determine different outcomes of protein aggregation assays, there is a strong urge for standardized descriptions of the different types of aggregates and the detailed methods used in their production. In an attempt to address this need, we assembled the Minimum Information Required for Reproducible Aggregation Experiments (MIRRAGGE) guidelines, considering first-principles and the established literature on protein self-assembly and aggregation. This consensus information aims to cover the major and subtle determinants of experimental reproducibility while avoiding excessive technical details that are of limited practical interest for non-specialized users. The MIRRAGGE table (template available in Supplementary Information) is useful as a guide for the design of new studies and as a checklist during submission of experimental reports for publication. Full disclosure of relevant information also enables other researchers to reproduce results correctly and facilitates systematic data deposition into curated databases.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.593867">Dynamic Causal Modeling for fMRI With Wilson-Cowan-Based Neuronal Equations</a></h4>

<p>Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) is an analysis technique that has been successfully used to infer about directed connectivity between brain regions based on imaging data such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Most variants of DCM for fMRI rely on a simple bilinear differential equation for neural activation, making it difficult to interpret the results in terms of local neural dynamics. In this work, we introduce a modification to DCM for fMRI by replacing the bilinear equation with a non-linear Wilson-Cowan based equation and use Bayesian Model Comparison (BMC) to show that this modification improves the model evidences. Improved model evidence of the non-linear model is shown for our empirical data (imitation of facial expressions) and validated by synthetic data as well as an empirical test dataset (attention to visual motion) used in previous foundational papers. For our empirical data, we conduct the analysis for a group of 42 healthy participants who performed an imitation task, activating regions putatively containing the human mirror neuron system (MNS). In this regard, we build 540 models as one family for comparing the standard bilinear with the modified Wilson-Cowan models on the family-level. Using this modification, we can interpret the sigmoid transfer function as an averaged f-I curve of many neurons in a single region with a sigmoidal format. In this way, we can make a direct inference from the macroscopic model to detailed microscopic models. The new DCM variant shows superior model evidence on all tested data sets.</p>

<p>This work presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a P300-based brain-machine interface (BMI) developed to control a robotic hand-orthosis. The purpose of this system is to assist patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) who cannot open and close their hands by themselves. The user of this interface can select one of six targets, which represent the flexion-extension of one finger independently or the movement of the five fingers simultaneously. We tested offline and online our BMI on eighteen healthy subjects (HS) and eight ALS patients. In the offline test, we used the calibration data of each participant recorded in the experimental sessions to estimate the accuracy of the BMI to classify correctly single epochs as target or non-target trials. On average, the system accuracy was 78.7% for target epochs and 85.7% for non-target trials. Additionally, we observed significant P300 responses in the calibration recordings of all the participants, including the ALS patients. For the BMI online test, each subject performed from 6 to 36 attempts of target selections using the interface. In this case, around 46% of the participants obtained 100% of accuracy, and the average online accuracy was 89.83%. The maximum information transfer rate (ITR) observed in the experiments was 52.83 bit/min, whereas that the average ITR was 18.13 bit/min. The contributions of this work are the following. First, we report the development and evaluation of a mind-controlled robotic hand-orthosis for patients with ALS. To our knowledge, this BMI is one of the first P300-based assistive robotic devices with multiple targets evaluated on people with ALS. Second, we provide a database with calibration data and online EEG recordings obtained in the evaluation of our BMI. This data is useful to develop and compare other BMI systems and test the processing pipelines of similar applications.</p>

<p>FMRI Montreal Imaging Stress Tasks (MIST) have been shown to activate endocrine and autonomic stress responses that are mediated by a prefrontal cortex (PFC)-hippocampus-amygdala circuit. However, the stability of the neurobehavioral responses over time and the ability to monitor response to clinical interventions has yet to be validated. The objective of this study was to compare the fMRI and physiologic responses to acute psychosocial stress in healthy volunteers during initial and follow-up visits approximately 13 weeks later, simulating a typical duration of clinical intervention. We hypothesized that responses to stress would remain highly conserved across the 2 visits in the absence of an intervention. 15 healthy volunteers completed a variant of control math task (CMT) and stress math task (SMT) conditions based on MIST. Neural responses were modeled using an event-related design with estimates for math performance and auditory feedback for each task condition. For each visit, measures of stress reactivity included differential fMRI and heart rate (SMT-CMT), as well as salivary alpha-amylase before and after scanning sessions. The results revealed that differential fMRI, as well as increased heart rate and salivary alpha-amylase from before and after scanning remained similar between visits. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values revealed areas of reliable task-dependent BOLD fMRI signal response across visits for peaks of clusters for the main effect of condition (SMT vs CMT) within dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insula, and hippocampus regions during math performance and within subgenual ACC, posterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral PFC regions during auditory feedback. Given that the neurobehavioral response to acute stress remained highly conserved across visits in the absence of an intervention, this study confirms the utility for MIST for assessing longitudinal changes in controlled trials that can identify underlying neurobiological mechanisms involved in mediating the efficacy of stress-reduction interventions.</p>

<p>Recently a role for the vagus nerve in conditioning food preferences was established in rodents. In a prospective controlled clinical trial in humans, invasive vagus nerve stimulation shifted food choice toward lower fat content. Here we explored whether hedonic aspects of an orally sampled food stimulus can be modulated by non-invasive transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) in humans. In healthy participants (n = 10, five women, 20–32 years old, no obesity) we tested liking and wanting ratings of food samples with varying fat or sugar content with or without tVNS in a sham-controlled within-participants design. To determine effects of tVNS on food intake, we also measured voluntary consumption of milkshake. Spontaneous eye blink rate was measured as a proxy for dopamine tone. Liking of low-fat, but not high-fat puddings, was higher for tVNS relative to sham stimulation. Other outcomes showed no differences. These findings support a role for the vagus nerve promoting post-ingestive reward signals. Our results suggest that tVNS may be used to increase liking of low-calorie foods, which may support healthier food choices.</p>

<p>Paired associative stimulation at the spinal cord (spinal PAS) has been shown to increase muscle force and dexterity by strengthening the corticomuscular connection, through spike timing dependent plasticity. Typically, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcutaneous peripheral nerve electrical stimulation (PNS) are often used in spinal PAS. PNS targets superficial nerve branches, by which the number of applicable muscles is limited. Alternatively, a muscle can be activated by positioning the stimulation electrode on the “motor point” (MPS), which is the most sensitive location of a muscle to electrical stimulation. Although this can increase the number of applicable muscles for spinal PAS, nobody has tested whether MPS can be used for the spinal PAS to date. Here we investigated the feasibility of using MPS instead of PNS for spinal PAS. Ten healthy male individuals (26.0 ± 3.5 yrs) received spinal PAS on two separate days with different stimulation timings expected to induce (1) facilitation of corticospinal excitability (REAL) or (2) no effect (CONTROL) on the soleus. The motor evoked potentials (MEP) response curve in the soleus was measured prior to the spinal PAS, immediately after (0 min) and at 10, 20, 30 min post-intervention as a measure of corticospinal excitability. The post-intervention MEP response curve areas were larger in the REAL condition than the CONTROL conditions. Further, the post-intervention MEP response curve areas were significantly larger than pre-intervention in the REAL condition but not in the CONTROL condition. We conclude that MPS can facilitate corticospinal excitability through spinal PAS.</p>

<p>Safe stair negotiation is an everyday task that children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) are commonly thought to struggle with. Yet, there is currently a paucity of research supporting these claims. We investigated the visuomotor control strategies underpinning stair negotiation in children with (N = 18, age = 10.50 ± 2.04 years) and without (N = 16, age = 10.94 ± 2.08 years) DCD by measuring kinematics, gaze behavior and state anxiety as they ascended and descended a staircase. A questionnaire was administered to determine parents' confidence in their child's ability to safely navigate stairs and their child's fall history (within the last year). Kinematics were measured using three-dimensional motion capture (Vicon), whilst gaze was measured using mobile eye-tracking equipment (Pupil labs). The parents of DCD children reported significantly lower confidence in their child's ability to maintain balance on the stairs and significantly more stair-related falls in the previous year compared to the parents of typically developing (TD) children. During both stair ascent and stair descent, the children with DCD took longer to ascend/descend the staircase and displayed greater handrail use, reflecting a more cautious stair negotiation strategy. No differences were observed between groups in their margin of stability, but the DCD children exhibited significantly greater variability in their foot-clearances over the step edge, which may increase the risk of a fall. For stair descent only, the DCD children reported significantly higher levels of state anxiety than the TD children and looked significantly further along the staircase during the initial entry phase, suggesting an anxiety-related response that may bias gaze toward the planning of future stepping actions over the accurate execution of an ongoing step. Taken together, our findings provide the first quantifiable evidence that (a) safe stair negotiation is a significant challenge for children with DCD, and that (b) this challenge is reflected by marked differences in their visuomotor control strategies and state anxiety levels. Whilst it is currently unclear whether these differences are contributing to the frequency of stair-related falls in children with DCD, our findings pave the way for future research to answer these important questions.</p>

<p>Smell perception plays an important role in eating behavior and might be involved in body weight gain. Since a body of literature implies that olfactory perception and function is hampered in obesity, we here investigate neuroanatomical correlates of this phenomenon. We assessed olfactory bulb (OB) volume with magnetic resonance imaging in 67 healthy participants with a body mass index (BMI) from 18.9 to 45.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (mean = 28.58 ± 6.64). Moreover, we obtained psychophysiological data on olfactory ability (Sniffin’ Sticks, Food associated odor test) and self-report measurements on eating behavior. Additionally, we collected parameters associated with metabolic health in obesity (waist-hip ratio, waist-height ratio, leptin levels, body fat percentage, fat mass index, insulin resistance) to investigate recently proposed mechanistic explanatory models of why olfaction may be altered in obesity. We showed that OB volume was significantly lower in participants with obesity when compared to those of normal weight. Moreover, we found weak to moderate negative correlations between OB volume and BMI and related measures of metabolic health, especially leptin, body fat percentage, waist-height ratio and insulin resistance. However, neither OB volume nor BMI were related to olfactory function in our young and healthy sample. Nevertheless, our results provide first indications that obesity is associated with brain anatomical changes in the OBs.</p>

<p>The medial temporal lobe supports both navigation and declarative memory. On this basis, a theory of phylogenetic continuity has been proposed according to which episodic and semantic memories have evolved from egocentric (e.g., path integration) and allocentric (e.g., map-based) navigation in the physical world, respectively. Here, we explored the behavioral significance of this neurophysiological model by investigating the relationship between the performance of healthy individuals on a path integration and an episodic memory task. We investigated the path integration performance through a proprioceptive Triangle Completion Task and assessed episodic memory through a picture recognition task. We evaluated the specificity of the association between performance in these two tasks by including in the study design a verbal semantic memory task. We also controlled for the effect of attention and working memory and tested the robustness of the results by including alternative versions of the path integration and semantic memory tasks. We found a significant positive correlation between the performance on the path integration the episodic, but not semantic, memory tasks. This pattern of correlation was not explained by general cognitive abilities and persisted also when considering a visual path integration task and a non-verbal semantic memory task. Importantly, a cross-validation analysis showed that participants' egocentric navigation abilities reliably predicted episodic memory performance. Altogether, our findings support the hypothesis of a phylogenetic continuity between egocentric navigation and episodic memory and pave the way for future research on the potential causal role of egocentric navigation on multiple forms of episodic memory.</p>

<p>The psychopathological profile of patients with medication overuse headache (MOH) appears to be particularly complex. To better define it, we evaluated their performance on a targeted psychological profile assessment. We designed a case-control study comparing MOH patients and matched healthy controls (HC). Headache frequency, drug consumption, HIT-6, and MIDAS scores were recorded. All participants filled in the following questionnaires: Beck Depression Inventory-II Edition (BDI-2), trait subtest of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y), Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20). The primary endpoint was to establish if MOH patients have an altered psychopathological profile. The secondary endpoint was to establish whether the worst profile correlates with the worsening of headache and disability measures. We enrolled 48 consecutive MOH patients and 48 HC. MOH patients showed greater difficulty in recognition/regulation of emotions (DERS, TAS-20), depression (BDI-2), anxiety (STAI-Y), and impulsiveness (BIS-11). We found a positive correlation among DERS, BDI-2, STAI-Y, and BIS scores and MIDAS and HIT-6 scores and among DERS and headache frequency and drug consumption. MOH patients showed a high rate of emotion regulation difficulties, depression, and anxiety, which may negatively affect their headaches. The ability to regulate/recognize emotions may play a central role in sustaining medication overuse.</p>

<p>Area prostriata plays important roles in fast detection and analysis of peripheral visual information. It remains unclear whether the prostriata directly receives and integrates information from other modalities. To gain insight into this issue, we investigated brain-wide afferent projections to mouse prostriata. We find convergent projections to layer 1 of the prostriata from primary and association visual and auditory cortices; retrosplenial, lateral entorhinal, and anterior cingulate cortices; subiculum; presubiculum; and anterior thalamic nuclei. Innervation of layers 2–3 of the prostriata mainly originates from the presubiculum (including postsubiculum) and anterior midline thalamic region. Layer 5 of the prostriata mainly receives its inputs from medial entorhinal, granular retrosplenial, and medial orbitofrontal cortices and anteromedial thalamic nucleus while layer 6 gets its major inputs from ectorhinal, postrhinal, and agranular retrosplenial cortices. The claustrum, locus coeruleus, and basal forebrain provide relatively diffuse innervation to the prostriata. Moreover, Cre-dependent tracing in cortical areas reveals that the cells of origin of the prostriata inputs are located in layers 2–4 and 5 of the neocortical areas, layers 2 and 5 of the medial entorhinal cortex, and layer 5 of the retrosplenial cortex. These results indicate that the prostriata is a unique region where primary and association visual and auditory inputs directly integrate with many limbic inputs.</p>

<p>A rare anatomic variant of a markedly enlarged anterior external arcuate fasciculus (AEAF) on the ventral medullary surface is reported and compared to two controls. The hypertrophic AEAF was nine times larger in diameter than normal, whereas the arcuate nucleus (AN) and inferior olivary nucleus (ION) appeared histologically normal in size and neuronal distribution, and morphometric analysis of the AN confirmed that it was within the normal range. Calbindin-2 (calretinin, CALB2) expression was identified in the AN and in the fibers of the normal AEAF. The hypertrophic AEAF did not contain calbindin-2–expressing fibers. CALB2 expression was also present in the ventrolateral portion of the ION, both in the index case and in one of the control cases. The origin of the additional fibers was not identified; however, the potential origin of these fibers and its implications for the development of the AEAF are discussed.</p>

<p>Adult neurogenesis, a striking form of neural plasticity, is involved in the modulation of social stimuli driving reproduction. Previous studies on adult neurogenesis have shown that this process is significantly modulated around puberty in female mice. Puberty is a critical developmental period triggered by increased secretion of the gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), which controls the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG). Secretion of HPG-axis factors at puberty participates to the refinement of neural circuits that govern reproduction. Here, by exploiting a transgenic GnRH deficient mouse model, that progressively loses GnRH expression during postnatal development (GnRH::Cre;Dicer<sup>loxP/loxP</sup>mice), we found that a postnatally-acquired dysfunction in the GnRH system affects adult neurogenesis selectively in the subventricular-zone neurogenic niche in a sexually dimorphic way. Moreover, by examining adult females ovariectomized before the onset of puberty, we provide important evidence that, among the HPG-axis secreting factors, the circulating levels of gonadal hormones during pre-/peri-pubertal life contribute to set-up the proper adult subventricular zone-olfactory bulb neurogenic system.</p>

<p>Background: Although cognitive decline (CD) is associated with increased post-operative morbidity and mortality, routinely screening patients remains difficult. The main objective of this prospective study is to use the EEG response to a Propofol-based general anesthesia (GA) to reveal CD.</p><p>Methods: 42 patients with collected EEG and Propofol target concentration infusion (TCI) during GA had a preoperative cognitive assessment using MoCA. We evaluated the performance of three variables to detect CD (MoCA &lt; 25 points): age, Propofol requirement to induce unconsciousness (TCI at SEF<sub>95</sub>: 8–13 Hz) and the frontal alpha band power (AP at SEF<sub>95</sub>: 8–13 Hz).</p><p>Results: The 17 patients (40%) with CD were significantly older (p &lt; 0.001), had lower TCI (p &lt; 0.001), and AP (p &lt; 0.001). We found using logistic models that TCI and AP were the best set of variables associated with CD (AUC: 0.89) and performed better than age (p &lt; 0.05). Propofol TCI had a greater impact on CD probability compared to AP, although both were complementary in detecting CD.</p><p>Conclusion: TCI and AP contribute additively to reveal patient with preoperative cognitive decline. Further research on post-operative cognitive trajectory are necessary to confirm the interest of intra operative variables in addition or as a substitute to cognitive evaluation.</p>

<p>Purpose: This study aimed to identify consistent gray matter volume (GMV) changes in the two subtypes of multiple system atrophy (MSA), including parkinsonism subtype (MSA-P), and cerebellar subtype (MSA-C), by conducting a voxel-wise meta-analysis of whole brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies.</p><p>Method: VBM studies comparing MSA-P or MSA-C and healthy controls (HCs) were systematically searched in the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science published from 1974 to 20 October 2020. A quantitative meta-analysis of VBM studies on MSA-P or MSA-C was performed using the effect size-based signed differential mapping (ES-SDM) method separately. A complementary analysis was conducted using the Seed-based d Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images (SDM-PSI) method, which allows a familywise error rate (FWE) correction for multiple comparisons of the results, for further validation of the results.</p><p>Results: Ten studies were included in the meta-analysis of MSA-P subtype, comprising 136 MSA-P patients and 211 HCs. Five studies were included in the meta-analysis of MSA-C subtype, comprising 89 MSA-C patients and 134 HCs. Cerebellum atrophy was detected in both MSA-P and MSA-C, whereas basal ganglia atrophy was only detected in MSA-P. Cerebral cortex atrophy was detected in both subtypes, with predominant impairment of the superior temporal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, temporal pole, insula, and amygdala in MSA-P and predominant impairment of the superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and lingual gyrus in MSA-C. Most of these results survived the FWE correction in the complementary analysis, except for the bilateral amygdala and the left caudate nucleus in MSA-P, and the right superior temporal gyrus and the right middle temporal gyrus in MSA-C. These findings remained robust in the jackknife sensitivity analysis, and no significant heterogeneity was detected.</p><p>Conclusion: A different pattern of brain atrophy between MSA-P and MSA-C detected in the current study was in line with clinical manifestations and provided the evidence of the pathophysiology of the two subtypes of MSA.</p>

<p>Background: Acupuncture may be an effective complementary treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of this study was to summarize the evidence provided by systematic reviews (SRs)/meta-analyses (MAs) on the effect of acupuncture on AD.</p><p>Methods: Eight electronic databases were searched from their inception until October 19, 2020. The methodological quality, reporting quality, and risk of bias of the included SRs were assessed by the Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR-2), the Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews (ROBIS) tool, and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Moreover, the evidence quality of the outcome measures was assessed by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE).</p><p>Results: Eleven SRs/MAs met all inclusion criteria. According to the results of the AMSTAR-2, all included reviews were rated critically as being of low quality. With PRISMA, the reporting checklist was relatively complete, but some reporting weaknesses remained in the topics of the protocol and registration, search strategy, risk of bias, additional analyses, and funding. Based on the ROBIS tool, only two SRs/MAs had a low risk of bias. With the GRADE system, no high-quality evidence was found, and only seven outcomes provided moderate-quality evidence. Among the downgraded factors, the risk of bias within the original trials was ranked first, followed by inconsistency, imprecision, and publication bias.</p><p>Conclusions: Acupuncture is a promising complementary treatment for AD. However, due to the low quality of the SRs/MAs supporting these results, high-quality studies with rigorous study designs and larger samples are needed before widespread recommendations can be made.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Past studies find that chronic stress alters inhibitory, GABAergic circuitry of neurons in distinct hippocampal subregions. Less clear is whether these effects persist weeks after chronic stress ends, and whether these effects involve changes in the total number of hippocampal GABAergic neurons or modulates the function of specific GABAergic subtypes. A transgenic mouse line (<i>VGAT:Cre Ai9</i>) containing an indelible marker for GABAergic neurons (tdTomato) throughout the brain was used to determine whether chronic stress alters total GABAergic neuronal number or the expression of two key GABAergic cell subtypes, calretinin expressing (CR+) and somatostatin expressing (SOM+) neurons, and whether these changes endure weeks later. Male and female mice were chronically stressed in wire mesh restrainers for 6h/d/21d (Str) or not (Con), and then allowed a 3 week rest period (Str‐Rest) and compared to those without a rest period (Str‐NoRest). Epifluorescent microscope images of immunohistochemistry‐processed brains were quantified to estimate the total number of fluorescently‐labeled hippocampal GABAergic neurons and the proportion that were CR+ or SOM+. Neither chronic stress nor sex altered the total number of GABAergic cells. In contrast, chronic stress reduced the expression of CR+ in the CA3 region of the hippocampus in both males and females, with robust reductions in the DG region of males, but not females, and these changes reversed following a rest period. Chronic stress also reduced the proportion of hippocampal SOM+ neurons and this reduction persisted even with a rest period. These results show chronic stress dynamically reduced CR expression without changing total inhibitory neuronal number and point to CR as a potential new lead to understand mechanisms by which chronic stress alters hippocampal function.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Adaptive memory requires the organism to form associations that bridge between events separated in time. Many studies show interactions between hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) during formation of such associations. We analyze neural recording from monkey HPC and PFC during a memory task that requires the monkey to associate stimuli separated by about a second in time. After the first stimulus was presented, large numbers of units in both HPC and PFC fired in sequence. Many units fired only when a particular stimulus was presented at a particular time in the past. These results indicate that both HPC and PFC maintain a temporal record of events that could be used to form associations across time. This temporal record of the past is a key component of the temporal coding hypothesis, a hypothesis in psychology that memory not only encodes what happened, but when it happened.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Hippocampal sharp‐wave ripples (SWRs) support the reactivation of memory representations, relaying information to neocortex during “offline” and sleep‐dependent memory consolidation. While blockade of NMDA receptors (NMDAR) is known to affect both learning and subsequent consolidation, the specific contributions of NMDAR activation to SWR‐associated activity remain unclear. Here, we combine biophysical modeling with in vivo local field potential (LFP) and unit recording to quantify changes in SWR dynamics following inactivation of NMDAR. In a biophysical model of CA3‐CA1 SWR activity, we find that NMDAR removal leads to reduced SWR density, but spares SWR properties such as duration, cell recruitment and ripple frequency. These predictions are confirmed by experiments in which NMDAR‐mediated transmission in rats was inhibited using three different NMDAR antagonists, while recording dorsal CA1 LFP. In the model, loss of NMDAR‐mediated conductances also induced a reduction in the proportion of cell pairs that co‐activate significantly above chance across multiple events. Again, this prediction is corroborated by dorsal CA1 single‐unit recordings, where the NMDAR blocker ketamine disrupted correlated spiking during SWR. Our results are consistent with a framework in which NMDA receptors both promote activation of SWR events and organize SWR‐associated spiking content. This suggests that, while SWR are short‐lived events emerging in fast excitatory‐inhibitory networks, slower network components including NMDAR‐mediated currents contribute to ripple density and promote consistency in the spiking content across ripples, underpinning mechanisms for fine‐tuning of memory consolidation processes.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Individuals can use diverse behavioral strategies to navigate their environment including hippocampal‐dependent place strategies reliant upon cognitive maps and striatal‐dependent response strategies reliant upon egocentric body turns. The existence of multiple memory systems appears to facilitate successful navigation across a wide range of environmental and physiological conditions. The mechanisms by which these systems interact to ultimately generate a unitary behavioral response, however, remain unclear. We trained 20 male, Sprague–Dawley rats on a dual‐solution T‐maze while simultaneously recording local field potentials that were targeted to the dorsolateral striatum and dorsal hippocampus. Eight rats spontaneously exhibited a place strategy while the remaining 12 rats exhibited a response strategy. Interindividual differences in behavioral strategy were associated with distinct patterns of LFP activity between the dorsolateral striatum and dorsal hippocampus. Specifically, striatal‐hippocampal theta activity was in‐phase in response rats and out‐of‐phase in place rats and response rats exhibited elevated striatal‐hippocampal coherence across a wide range of frequency bands. These contrasting striatal‐hippocampal activity regimes were (a) present during both maze‐learning and a 30 min premaze habituation period and (b) could be used to train support vector machines to reliably predict behavioral strategy. Distinct patterns of neuronal activity across multiple memory systems, therefore, appear to bias behavioral strategy selection and thereby contribute to interindividual differences in behavior.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Analysis of long‐term potentiation (LTP) provides a powerful window into cellular mechanisms of learning and memory. Prior work shows late LTP (L‐LTP), lasting &gt;3 hr, occurs abruptly at postnatal day 12 (P12) in the <i>stratum radiatum</i> of rat hippocampal area CA1. The goal here was to determine the developmental profile of synaptic plasticity leading to L‐LTP in the mouse hippocampus. Two mouse strains and two mutations known to affect synaptic plasticity were chosen: C57BL/6J and <i>Fmr1</i>
<sup>
   <i>−/y</i>
</sup> on the C57BL/6J background, and 129SVE and <i>Hevin</i>
<sup>−/−</sup> (<i>Sparcl1</i>
<sup>−/−</sup>) on the 129SVE background. Like rats, hippocampal slices from all of the mice showed test pulse‐induced depression early during development that was gradually resolved with maturation by 5 weeks. All the mouse strains showed a gradual progression between P10‐P35 in the expression of short‐term potentiation (STP), lasting ≤1 hr. In the 129SVE mice, L‐LTP onset (&gt;25% of slices) occurred by 3 weeks, reliable L‐LTP (&gt;50% slices) was achieved by 4 weeks, and <i>Hevin</i>
<sup>−/−</sup> advanced this profile by 1 week. In the C57BL/6J mice, L‐LTP onset occurred significantly later, over 3–4 weeks, and reliability was not achieved until 5 weeks. Although some of the <i>Fmr1</i>
<sup>
   <i>−/y</i>
</sup> mice showed L‐LTP before 3 weeks, reliable L‐LTP also was not achieved until 5 weeks. L‐LTP onset was not advanced in any of the mouse genotypes by multiple bouts of theta‐burst stimulation at 90 or 180 min intervals. These findings show important species differences in the onset of STP and L‐LTP, which occur at the same age in rats but are sequentially acquired in mice.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>High‐level cognitive abilities such as navigation and spatial memory are thought to rely on the activity of grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), which encode the animal's position in space with periodic triangular patterns. Yet the neural mechanisms that underlie grid‐cell activity are still unknown. Recent in vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that grid cells are embedded in highly structured recurrent networks. But how could recurrent connectivity become structured during development? And what is the functional role of these connections? With mathematical modeling and simulations, we show that recurrent circuits in the MEC could emerge under the supervision of weakly grid‐tuned feedforward inputs. We demonstrate that a learned excitatory connectivity could amplify grid patterns when the feedforward sensory inputs are available and sustain attractor states when the sensory cues are lost. Finally, we propose a Fourier‐based measure to quantify the spatial periodicity of grid patterns: the grid‐tuning index.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Although the function of the hippocampus and adjacent medial temporal lobe (MTL) areas in forming associations is generally recognized, how MTL contributes to form creative associations that could result in novel and appropriate functions or meanings remains unclear. In this study, we compared highly creative combinations (HCCs) of two objects (e.g., that of “lifejacket” and “distress signal device”) that resulted in genuine innovative designs comprising additionally unprecedented functions (the “1 + 1 &gt; 2” effects) with the lowly creative combinations (LCCs, e.g., the combination of “set‐top box” and “jewelry box”) that resulted in nothing more than simple “1 + 1 = 2” effects. The event‐related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study found that during the “early binding phase,” when the combinations of the two objects were initially encoded, the right parahippocampus was more intensively activated during the encoding of HCC relative to LCC trials. However, during the “late integration phase,” when participants finally formed a holistic mental representation of new products based on the two‐object combinations, both HCCs and LCCs were found to be associated with significantly increased hippocampal and parahippocampal activation relative to the baseline condition, but at a similar level. In this “late integration phase,” the functional areas appeared to be more intensively activated in HCCs relative to LCCs located in the posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG), the area known to mediate category‐related processing. Consistently, our supplementary behavioral study found that, relative to LCCs, HCCs had a higher possibility of resulting in some new conceptual expansions that differed from each of the original two objects that constituted the combinations. These findings indicate that the formation of creative combinations not only require MTL‐based novel association‐formation, but also pMTG‐based novel concept‐expansion.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The timing between synaptic inputs has been proposed to play a role in the induction of plastic changes that enable neural circuits to store information. In the case of spike timing‐dependent plasticity (STDP), this relates to the interval between a synaptic input and a postsynaptic spike, thus providing a conceptual link to the Hebb learning rule. Experiments have documented STDP in many synapses and brain regions, and computational models have tested its utility in many neural network functions. However, questions remain about whether timing plays a role in plasticity during natural activity, and whether it can function in information storage. The present study used imaging with voltage sensitive dye to investigate the effectiveness of input timing in the plasticity of responses in the CA3 region of hippocampal slices. Plasticity was induced by sequential dual‐site stimulation at 10 ms intervals of either synaptic inputs and cell bodies (synaptic–somatic induction) or of two sets of synaptic inputs (synaptic–synaptic induction). Both protocols potentiated responses, with greater potentiation of responses to the first stimulation of the sequence than the second. Neither of these protocols induced depression. Synaptic–somatic stimulation was much more effective than synaptic–synaptic stimulation in evoking somatic action potentials, but both protocols potentiated responses equally well. This suggests that sequential dual‐site stimulation can potentiate equally well with very different degrees of somatic action potential firing. With synaptic–somatic induction, potentiation was focused at the sites of stimulation. In contrast, with synaptic–synaptic induction, the distribution of potentiation varied greatly. Changes in the spatial distribution of responses indicated that sequential dual‐site stimulation functions poorly in the storage of activity patterns. These results suggest that in the hippocampal CA3 region, timed sequential activation of two inputs is less effective than theta bursts, both in the induction of LTP and in the storage of information.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus has long been observed to encode a representation of an animal's position in space. Recent evidence suggests that the nature of this representation is somewhat predictive and can be modeled by learning a successor representation (SR) between distinct positions in an environment. However, this discretization of space is subjective making it difficult to formulate predictions about how some environmental manipulations should impact the hippocampal representation. Here, we present a model of place and grid cell firing as a consequence of learning a SR from a basis set of known neurobiological features—boundary vector cells (BVCs). The model describes place cell firing as the successor features of the SR, with grid cells forming a low‐dimensional representation of these successor features. We show that the place and grid cells generated using the BVC‐SR model provide a good account of biological data for a variety of environmental manipulations, including dimensional stretches, barrier insertions, and the influence of environmental geometry on the hippocampal representation of space.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to gain insights into structural networks associated with stimulation‐induced dysarthria (SID) and to predict stimulation‐induced worsening of intelligibility in essential tremor patients with bilateral thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Monopolar reviews were conducted in 14 essential tremor patients. Testing included determination of SID thresholds, intelligibility ratings, and a fast syllable repetition task. Volumes of tissue activated (VTAs) were calculated to identify discriminative fibers for stimulation‐induced worsening of intelligibility in a structural connectome. The resulting fiber‐based atlas structure was then validated in a leave‐one‐out design.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Fibers determined as discriminative for stimulation‐induced worsening of intelligibility were mainly connected to the ipsilateral precentral gyrus as well as to both cerebellar hemispheres and the ipsilateral brain stem. In the thalamic area, they ran laterally to the thalamus and posteromedially to the subthalamic nucleus, in close proximity, mainly anterolaterally, to fibers beneficial for tremor control as published by Al‐Fatly et al in 2019. The overlap of the respective clinical stimulation setting's VTAs with these fibers explained 62.4% (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) of the variance of stimulation‐induced change in intelligibility in a leave‐one‐out analysis.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study demonstrates that SID in essential tremor patients is associated with both motor cortex and cerebellar connectivity. Furthermore, the identified fiber‐based atlas structure might contribute to future postoperative programming strategies to achieve optimal tremor control without speech impairment in essential tremor patients with thalamic DBS.

<p>Cortical neural circuits display highly irregular spiking in individual neurons but variably sized collective firing, oscillations and critical avalanches at the population level, all of which have functional importance for information processing. Theoretically, the balance of excitation and inhibition inputs is thought to account for spiking irregularity and critical avalanches may originate from an underlying phase transition. However, the theoretical reconciliation of these multilevel dynamic aspects in neural circuits remains an open question. Herein, we study excitation-inhibition (E-I) balanced neuronal network with biologically realistic synaptic kinetics. It can maintain irregular spiking dynamics with different levels of synchrony and critical avalanches emerge near the synchronous transition point. We propose a novel semi-analytical mean-field theory to derive the field equations governing the network macroscopic dynamics. It reveals that the E-I balanced state of the network manifesting irregular individual spiking is characterized by a macroscopic stable state, which can be either a fixed point or a periodic motion and the transition is predicted by a Hopf bifurcation in the macroscopic field. Furthermore, by analyzing public data, we find the coexistence of irregular spiking and critical avalanches in the spontaneous spiking activities of mouse cortical slice in vitro, indicating the universality of the observed phenomena. Our theory unveils the mechanism that permits complex neural activities in different spatiotemporal scales to coexist and elucidates a possible origin of the criticality of neural systems. It also provides a novel tool for analyzing the macroscopic dynamics of E-I balanced networks and its relationship to the microscopic counterparts, which can be useful for large-scale modeling and computation of cortical dynamics.</p>

<p>Sparse time series models have shown promise in estimating contemporaneous and ongoing brain connectivity. This paper was motivated by a neuroscience experiment using EEG signals as the outcome of our established interventional protocol, a new method in neurorehabilitation toward developing a treatment for visual verticality disorder in post-stroke patients. To analyze the [complex outcome measure (EEG)] that reflects neural-network functioning and processing in more specific ways regarding traditional analyses, we make a comparison among sparse time series models (classic VAR, GLASSO, TSCGM, and TSCGM-modified with non-linear and iterative optimizations) combined with a graphical approach, such as a Dynamic Chain Graph Model (DCGM). These dynamic graphical models were useful in assessing the role of estimating the brain network structure and describing its causal relationship. In addition, the class of DCGM was able to visualize and compare experimental conditions and brain frequency domains [using finite impulse response (FIR) filter]. Moreover, using multilayer networks, the results corroborate with the susceptibility of sparse dynamic models, bypassing the false positives problem in estimation algorithms. We conclude that applying sparse dynamic models to EEG data may be useful for describing intervention-relocated changes in brain connectivity.</p>

<p>Amyloid plaques are a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease. The major component of these plaques are highly ordered amyloid fibrils formed by amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides. However, whilst Aβ amyloid fibril assembly has been subjected to detailed and extensive analysis in vitro, these studies may not reproduce how Aβ fibrils assemble in the brain. This is because the brain represents a highly complex and dynamic environment, and in Alzheimer’s disease multiple cofactors may affect the assembly of Aβ fibrils. Moreover, in vivo amyloid plaque formation will reflect the balance between the assembly of Aβ fibrils and their degradation. This review explores the roles of microglia as cofactors in Aβ aggregation and in the clearance of amyloid deposits. In addition, we discuss how infection may be an additional cofactor in Aβ fibril assembly by virtue of the antimicrobial properties of Aβ peptides. Crucially, by understanding the roles of microglia and infection in Aβ amyloid fibril assembly it may be possible to identify new therapeutic targets for Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

<p>Effective control of hookworm infections in humans and animals relies on using a small group of anthelmintics. Many of these drugs target cholinergic ligand-gated ion channels, yet the direct activity of anthelmintics has only been studied in a subset of these receptors, primarily in the non-parasitic nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. Here we report the characterization of a homopentameric ionotropic acetylcholine receptor (AChR), ACR-16, from Necator americanus and Ancylostoma ceylanicum, the first known characterization of human hookworm ion channels. We used two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology in Xenopus laevis oocytes to determine the pharmacodynamics of cholinergics and anthelmintics on ACR-16 from both species of hookworm. The A. ceylanicum receptor (Ace-ACR-16) was more sensitive to acetylcholine (EC<sub>50</sub> = 20.64 ± 0.32 μM) and nicotine (EC<sub>50</sub> = 24.37 ± 2.89 μM) than the N. americanus receptor (Nam-ACR-16) (acetylcholine EC<sub>50</sub> = 170.1 ± 19.23 μM; nicotine EC<sub>50</sub> = 597.9 ± 59.12 μM), at which nicotine was a weak partial agonist (% maximal acetylcholine response = 30.4 ± 7.4%). Both receptors were inhibited by 500 μM levamisole (Ace-ACR-16 = 65.1 ± 14.3% inhibition, Nam-ACR-16 = 79.5 ± 7.7% inhibition), and responded to pyrantel, but only Ace-ACR-16 responded to oxantel. We used in silico homology modeling to investigate potential structural differences that account for the differences in agonist binding and identified a loop E isoleucine 130 of Nam-ACR-16 as possibly playing a role in oxantel insensitivity. These data indicate that key functional differences exist among ACR-16 receptors from closely related species and suggest mechanisms for differential drug sensitivity.</p>

<p>Fifty years ago, the seminal work by John Olney provided the first evidence of the neurotoxic properties of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. A process hereafter termed excitotoxicity. Since then, glutamate-driven neuronal death has been linked to several acute and chronic neurological conditions, like stroke, traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s diseases, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Mechanisms linked to the overactivation of glutamatergic receptors involve an aberrant cation influx, which produces the failure of the ionic neuronal milieu. In this context, zinc, the second most abundant metal ion in the brain, is a key but still somehow underappreciated player of the excitotoxic cascade. Zinc is an essential element for neuronal functioning, but when dysregulated acts as a potent neurotoxin. In this review, we discuss the ionic changes and downstream effects involved in the glutamate-driven neuronal loss, with a focus on the role exerted by zinc. Finally, we summarize our work on the fascinating distinct properties of NADPH-diaphorase neurons. This neuronal subpopulation is spared from excitotoxic insults and represents a powerful tool to understand mechanisms of resilience against excitotoxic processes.</p>

<p>A fundamental characteristic of neurons is the relationship between the architecture of the polarized neuron and synaptic transmission between neurons. Intracellular membrane trafficking is paramount to establish and maintain neuronal structure; perturbation in trafficking results in defects in neurodevelopment and neurological disorders. Given the physical distance from the cell body to the distal sites of the axon and dendrites, transport of newly synthesized membrane proteins from the central cell body to their functional destination at remote, distal sites represents a conundrum. With the identification of secretory organelles in dendrites, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi outposts (GOs), recent studies have proposed local protein synthesis and trafficking distinct from the conventional anterograde transport pathways of the cell body. A variety of different model organisms, including Drosophila, zebrafish, and rodents, have been used to probe the organization and function of the local neuronal secretory network. Here, we review the evidence for local secretory trafficking pathways in dendrites in a variety of cell-based neuronal systems and discuss both the similarities and differences in the organization and role of the local secretory organelles, especially the GOs. In addition, we identify the gaps in the current knowledge and the potential advances using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in defining local membrane protein trafficking in human neurons and in understanding the molecular basis of neurological diseases.</p>

<p>For more than 50 years, “Sensory Integration” has been a theoretical framework for diagnosing and treating disabilities in children under the umbrella of “sensory integration dysfunction” (SID). More recently, the approach has been reframed as “the dimensions of sensory processing” or SPD in place of SID, so the review herein describes this collective framework as sensory integration/sensory processing treatment (SI/SP-T) for ASD. This review is not focused on diagnosis of SI/SPD. Broadly, the SI/SPD intervention approach views a plethora of disabilities such as ADHD, ASD, and disruptive behavior as being exacerbated by difficulties in modulating and integrating sensory input with a primary focus on contributions from tactile, proprioceptive, and vestibular systems which are hypothesized to contribute to core symptoms of the conditions (e.g., ASD). SI/SP intervention procedures include sensory protocols designed to enhance tactile, proprioceptive, and vestibular experiences. SI/SP-T procedures utilize equipment (e.g., lycra swings, balance beams, climbing walls, and trampolines), specific devices (e.g., weighted vests, sensory brushes) and activities (e.g., placing hands in messy substances such as shaving cream, sequenced movements) hypothesized to enhance sensory integration and sensory processing. The approach is reviewed herein to provide a framework for testing SI/SP-T using widely accepted clinical trials and event coding methods used in applied behavior analysis (ABA) and other behavioral interventions. Also, a related but distinct neuroscientific paradigm, multisensory integration, is presented as an independent test of whether SI/SP-T differentially impacts sensory integration and/or multisensory integration. Finally, because SI/SP-T activities include many incidental behavioral events that are known as developmental facilitators (e.g., contingent verbal models/recasts during verbal interactions), there is a compelling need to control for confounds to study the unique impact of sensory-based interventions. Note that SI/SP-T includes very specific and identifiable procedures and materials, so it is reasonable to expect high treatment fidelity when testing the approach. A patient case is presented that illustrates this confound with a known facilitator (recast intervention) and a method for controlling potential confounds in order to conduct unbiased studies of the effects of SI/SP-T approaches that accurately represent SI/SP-T theories of change.</p>

<p>Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is one of the most performed bariatric surgeries in clinical practice. Growing neuroimaging evidence shows that LSG induces brain functional and structural alterations accompany with sustained weight-loss. Meanwhile, for clinical treatment of gastric cancer, stomach removal surgery is a similar procedure to LSG. It is unclear if the gastric cancer surgery (GCS) would induce the similar alterations in brain functions and structures as LSG, and it would help to clarify the specificity of the LSG. We recruited 24 obese patients who received LSG in the LSG group and 16 normal weight patients with gastric cancer who received GCS as the control group. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was employed to investigate the differences and similarity of surgery’s impact on resting-state brain activity and functional connectivity (RSFC) between LSG and GCS groups. Both LSG and GCS groups showed increased activities in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and supplementary motor area (SMA) as well as the decreased RSFC of PCC- dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and SMA- dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. There were decreased resting-state activity of hippocampus and putamen in LSG group and increases in GCS group. In LSG group, resting-state activities of hippocampus and putamen were correlated with craving for high-caloric food and body mass index after surgery, respectively. These findings suggest LSG induced alterations in resting-state activity and RSFC of hippocampus and putamen specifically regulate the obese state and overeating behaviors in obese patients.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.608453">Is So Called “Split Alpha” in EEG Spectral Analysis a Result of Methodological and Interpretation Errors?</a></h4>

<p>This paper attempts to explain some methodological issues regarding EEG signal analysis which might lead to misinterpretation and therefore to unsubstantiated conclusions. The so called “split-alpha,” a “new phenomenon” in EEG spectral analysis described lately in few papers is such a case. We have shown that spectrum feature presented as a “split alpha” can be the result of applying improper means of analysis of the spectrum of the EEG signal that did not take into account the significant properties of the applied Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method. Analysis of the shortcomings of the FFT method applied to EEG signal such as limited duration of analyzed signal, dependence of frequency resolution on time window duration, influence of window duration and shape, overlapping and spectral leakage was performed. Our analyses of EEG data as well as simulations indicate that double alpha spectra called as “split alpha” can appear, as spurious peaks, for short signal window when the EEG signal being studied shows multiple frequencies and frequency bands. These peaks have no relation to any frequencies of the signal and are an effect of spectrum leakage. Our paper is intended to explain the reasons underlying a spectrum pattern called as a “split alpha” and give some practical indications for using spectral analysis of EEG signal that might be useful for readers and allow to avoid EEG spectrum misinterpretation in further studies and publications as well as in clinical practice.</p>

<p>Background: The associations between olfactory identification (OI) ability and the Alzheimer's disease biomarkers were not clear.</p><p>Objective: This meta-analysis aimed to examine the associations between OI and Aβ and tau burden.</p><p>Methods: Electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar) were searched until June 2019 to identify studies that reported correlation coefficients or regression coefficients between OI and Aβ or tau levels measured by positron emission tomography (PET) or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Pooled Pearson correlation coefficients were computed for the PET imaging and CSF biomarkers, with subgroup analysis for subjects classified into different groups.</p><p>Results: Nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Of these, five studies (N = 494) involved Aβ PET, one involved tau PET (N = 26), and four involved CSF Aβ or tau (N = 345). OI was negatively associated with Aβ PET in the mixed (r = −0.25, P = 0.008) and cognitively normal groups (r = −0.15, P = 0.004) but not in the mild cognitive impairment group. A similar association with CSF total tau in the mixed group was also observed. No association was found between OI and CSF phosphorylated tau or Aβ<sub>42</sub> in the subgroup analysis of the CSF biomarkers. Due to a lack of data, no pooled r value could be computed for the association between the OI and tau PET.</p><p>Conclusion: The associations between OI ability and Aβ and CSF tau burden in older adults are negligible. While current evidence does not support the association, further studies using PET tau imaging are warranted.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease, the pathological features of which include the presence of Lewy bodies and the neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. However, until recently, research on the pathogenesis and treatment of PD have progressed slowly. Glutamate and dopamine are both important central neurotransmitters in mammals. A lack of enzymatic decomposition of extracellular glutamate results in glutamate accumulating at synapses, which is mainly absorbed by excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs). Glutamate exerts its physiological effects by binding to and activating ligand-gated ion channels [ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs)] and a class of G-protein-coupled receptors [metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs)]. Timely clearance of glutamate from the synaptic cleft is necessary because high levels of extracellular glutamate overactivate glutamate receptors, resulting in excitotoxic effects in the central nervous system. Additionally, increased concentrations of extracellular glutamate inhibit cystine uptake, leading to glutathione depletion and oxidative glutamate toxicity. Studies have shown that oxidative glutamate toxicity in neurons lacking functional N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors may represent a component of the cellular death pathway induced by excitotoxicity. The association between inflammation and excitotoxicity (i.e., immunoexcitotoxicity) has received increased attention in recent years. Glial activation induces neuroinflammation and can stimulate excessive release of glutamate, which can induce excitotoxicity and, additionally, further exacerbate neuroinflammation. Glutamate, as an important central neurotransmitter, is closely related to the occurrence and development of PD. In this review, we discuss recent progress on elucidating glutamate as a relevant neurotransmitter in PD. Additionally, we summarize the relationship and commonality among glutamate excitotoxicity, oxidative toxicity, and immunoexcitotoxicity in order to posit a holistic view and molecular mechanism of glutamate toxicity in PD.</p>

<p>Optic Atrophy 1 (OPA1) is a mitochondrially targeted GTPase that plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial health, with mutations causing severe mitochondrial dysfunction and typically associated with Dominant Optic Atrophy (DOA), a progressive blinding disease involving retinal ganglion cell loss and optic nerve damage. In the current study, we investigate the use of codon-optimized versions of OPA1 isoform 1 and 7 as potential therapeutic interventions in a range of in vitro and in vivo models of mitochondrial dysfunction. We demonstrate that both isoforms perform equally well in ameliorating mitochondrial dysfunction in OPA1 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblast cells but that OPA1 expression levels require tight regulation for optimal benefit. Of note, we demonstrate for the first time that both OPA1 isoform 1 and 7 can be used independently to protect spatial visual function in a murine model of retinal ganglion cell degeneration caused by mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as providing benefit to mitochondrial bioenergetics in DOA patient derived fibroblast cells. These results highlight the potential value of OPA1-based gene therapy interventions.</p>

Purpose<p>was to create an in vitro model of human retinal detachment (RD) to study the mechanisms of photoreceptor death.</p>Methods<p>Human retinas were obtained through eye globe donations for research purposes and cultivated as explants. Cell death was investigated in retinas with (control) and without retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells to mimic RD. Tissues were studied at different time points and immunohistological analyses for TUNEL, Cleaved caspase3, AIF, CDK4 and the epigenetic mark H3K27me3 were performed. Human and monkey eye globes with retinal detachment served as controls.</p>Results<p>The number of TUNEL-positive cells, compared between 1 and 7 days, increased with time in both retinas with RPE (from 1.2 ± 0.46 to 8 ± 0.89, n = 4) and without RPE (from 2.6 ± 0.73 to 16.3 ± 1.27, p &lt; 0.014). In the group without RPE, cell death peaked at day 3 (p = 0.014) and was high until day 7. Almost no Cleaved-Caspase3 signal was observed, whereas a transient augmentation at day 3 of AIF-positive cells was observed to be about 10-fold in comparison to the control group (n = 2). Few CDK4-positive cells were found in both groups, but significantly more in the RD group at day 7 (1.8 ± 0.24 vs. 4.7 ± 0.58, p = 0.014). The H3K27me3 mark increased by 7-fold after 5 days in the RD group (p = 0.014) and slightly decreased at day 7 and was also observed to be markedly increased in human and monkey detached retina samples.</p>Conclusion<p>AIF expression coincides with the first peak of cell death, whereas the H3K27me3 mark increases during the cell death plateau, suggesting that photoreceptor death is induced by different successive pathways after RD. This in vitro model should permit the identification of neuroprotective drugs with clinical relevance.</p>

<p>In the adult mouse brain, neurogenesis occurs mainly in the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) and the subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Neuroblasts generated in the V-SVZ migrate to the olfactory bulb via the rostral migratory stream (RMS) in response to guidance molecules, such as netrin-1. We previously showed that the related netrin-5 (NTN5) is expressed in Mash1-positive transit-amplifying cells and doublecortin-positive neuroblasts in the granule cell layer of the olfactory bulb, the RMS, and the subgranular zone of the adult mouse brain. However, the precise role of NTN5 in adult neurogenesis has not been investigated. In this study, we show that proliferation in the neurogenic niche is impaired in NTN5 knockout mice. The number of proliferating (EdU-labeled) cells in NTN5 KO mice was significantly lower in the V-SVZ, whereas the number of Ki67-positive proliferating cells was unchanged, suggesting a longer cell cycle and decreased cell division in NTN5 KO mice. The number of EdU-labeled cells in the RMS and olfactory bulb was unchanged. By contrast, the numbers of EdU-labeled cells in the cortex, basal ganglia/lateral septal nucleus, and corpus callosum/anterior commissure were increased, which largely represented oligodendrocyte lineage cells. Lastly, we found that chain migration in the RMS of NTN5 KO mice was disorganized. These findings suggest that NTN5 may play important roles in promoting proliferation in the V-SVZ niche, organizing proper chain migration in the RMS, and suppressing oligodendrogenesis in the brain.</p>

Aim<p>Attenuation correction using zero-echo time (ZTE) – magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (ZTE-MRAC) has become one of the standard methods for brain-positron emission tomography (PET) on commercial PET/MR scanners. Although the accuracy of the net tracer-uptake quantification based on ZTE-MRAC has been validated, that of the diagnosis for dementia has not yet been clarified, especially in terms of automated statistical analysis. The aim of this study was to clarify the impact of ZTE-MRAC on the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) by performing simulation study.</p>Methods<p>We recruited 27 subjects, who underwent both PET/computed tomography (CT) and PET/MR (GE SIGNA) examinations. Additionally, we extracted 107 subjects from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. From the PET raw data acquired on PET/MR, three FDG-PET series were generated, using two vendor-provided MRAC methods (ZTE and Atlas) and CT-based AC. Following spatial normalization to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, we calculated each patient’s specific error maps, which correspond to the difference between the PET image corrected using the CTAC method and the PET images corrected using the MRAC methods. To simulate PET maps as if ADNI data had been corrected using MRAC methods, we multiplied each of these 27 error maps with each of the 107 ADNI cases in MNI space. To evaluate the probability of AD in each resulting image, we calculated a cumulative t-value using a fully automated method which had been validated not only in the original ADNI dataset but several multi-center studies. In the method, PET score = 1 is the 95% prediction limit of AD. PET score and diagnostic accuracy for the discrimination of AD were evaluated in simulated images using the original ADNI dataset as reference.</p>Results<p>Positron emission tomography score was slightly underestimated both in ZTE and Atlas group compared with reference CTAC (−0.0796 ± 0.0938 vs. −0.0784 ± 0.1724). The absolute error of PET score was lower in ZTE than Atlas group (0.098 ± 0.075 vs. 0.145 ± 0.122, p &lt; 0.001). A higher correlation to the original PET score was observed in ZTE vs. Atlas group (R<sup>2</sup>: 0.982 vs. 0.961). The accuracy for the discrimination of AD patients from normal control was maintained in ZTE and Atlas compared to CTAC (ZTE vs. Atlas. vs. original; 82.5% vs. 82.1% vs. 83.2% (CI 81.8–84.5%), respectively).</p>Conclusion<p>For FDG-PET images on PET/MR, attenuation correction using ZTE-MRI had superior accuracy to an atlas-based method in classification for dementia. ZTE maintains the diagnostic accuracy for AD.</p>

<p>Research on undersampled magnetic resonance image (MRI) reconstruction can increase the speed of MRI imaging and reduce patient suffering. In this paper, an undersampled MRI reconstruction method based on Generative Adversarial Networks with the Self-Attention mechanism and the Relative Average discriminator (SARA-GAN) is proposed. In our SARA-GAN, the relative average discriminator theory is applied to make full use of the prior knowledge, in which half of the input data of the discriminator is true and half is fake. At the same time, a self-attention mechanism is incorporated into the high-layer of the generator to build long-range dependence of the image, which can overcome the problem of limited convolution kernel size. Besides, spectral normalization is employed to stabilize the training process. Compared with three widely used GAN-based MRI reconstruction methods, i.e., DAGAN, DAWGAN, and DAWGAN-GP, the proposed method can obtain a higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure(SSIM), and the details of the reconstructed image are more abundant and more realistic for further clinical scrutinization and diagnostic tasks.</p>

Metabolite levels were measured by single voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in the prefrontal white matter at the beginning (In-Season) and end (Off-Season) of season in contact (N = 54, rugby players) and non-contact (N = 23, swimmers and rowers) varsity athletes. Sedentary women (N = 23) were scanned once, at a time equivalent to the Off-Season time point. Metabolite levels in non-contact athletes did not change over a season of play, or differ from age matched sedentary women except that non-contact athletes had a slightly lower myo-inositol level. The contact athletes had lower levels of myo-inositol and glutamate, and higher levels of glutamine compared to both sedentary women and non-contact athletes. Lower levels of myo-inositol in non-contact athletes compared to sedentary women indicates long-term exercise may alter glial cell profiles in these athletes. The metabolite differences observed between contact and non-contact athletes suggest that non-contact athletes should not be used as controls in studies of concussion in high-impact sports because repetitive impacts from physical contact can alter white matter metabolite level profiles. It is imperative to use athletes engaged in the same contact sport as controls to ensure a matched metabolite profile at baseline.</p>

<p>The output from motor neuron pools is influenced by the integration of synaptic inputs originating from descending corticomotor and spinal reflex pathways. In this study, using paired non-invasive brain and peripheral nerve stimulation, we investigated how descending corticomotor pathways influence the physiologic recruitment order of the soleus Hoffmann (H-) reflex. Eleven neurologically unimpaired adults (9 females; mean age 25 ± 3 years) completed an assessment of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-conditioning of the soleus H-reflex over a range of peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) intensities. Unconditioned H-reflex recruitment curves were obtained by delivering PNS pulses to the posterior tibial nerve. Subsequently, TMS-conditioned H-reflex recruitment curves were obtained by pairing PNS with subthreshold TMS at short (−1.5 ms) and long (+10 ms) intervals. We evaluated unconditioned and TMS-conditioned H-reflex amplitudes along the ascending limb, peak, and descending limb of the H-reflex recruitment curve. Our results revealed that, for long-interval facilitation, TMS-conditioned H-reflex amplitudes were significantly larger than unconditioned H-reflex amplitudes along the ascending limb and peak of the H-reflex recruitment curve. Additionally, significantly lower PNS intensities were needed to elicit peak H-reflex amplitude (Hmax) for long-interval facilitation compared to unconditioned. These findings suggest that the influence of descending corticomotor pathways, particularly those mediating long-interval facilitation, contribute to changing the recruitment gain of the motor neuron pool, and can inform future methodological protocols for TMS-conditioning of H-reflexes. By characterizing and inducing short-term plasticity in circuitry mediating short- and long-interval TMS-conditioning of H-reflex amplitudes, future studies can investigate supraspinal and spinal circuit contributions to abnormal motor control, as well as develop novel therapeutic targets for neuromodulation.</p>

<p>It is often assumed that the reaction time of a saccade toward visual and/or auditory stimuli reflects the sensitivities of our oculomotor-orienting system to stimulus saliency. Endogenous factors, as well as stimulus-related factors, would also affect the saccadic reaction time (SRT). However, it was not clear how these factors interact and to what extent visual and auditory-targeting saccades are accounted for by common mechanisms. The present study examined the effect of, and the interaction between, stimulus saliency and audiovisual spatial congruency on the SRT for visual- and for auditory-target conditions. We also analyzed pre-target pupil size to examine the relationship between saccade preparation and pupil size. Pupil size is considered to reflect arousal states coupling with locus-coeruleus (LC) activity during a cognitive task. The main findings were that (1) the pattern of the examined effects on the SRT varied between visual- and auditory-auditory target conditions, (2) the effect of stimulus saliency was significant for the visual-target condition, but not significant for the auditory-target condition, (3) Pupil velocity, not absolute pupil size, was sensitive to task set (i.e., visual-targeting saccade vs. auditory-targeting saccade), and (4) there was a significant correlation between the pre-saccade absolute pupil size and the SRTs for the visual-target condition but not for the auditory-target condition. The discrepancy between target modalities for the effect of pupil velocity and between the absolute pupil size and pupil velocity for the correlation with SRT may imply that the pupil effect for the visual-target condition was caused by a modality-specific link between pupil size modulation and the SC rather than by the LC-NE (locus coeruleus-norepinephrine) system. These results support the idea that different threshold mechanisms in the SC may be involved in the initiation of saccades toward visual and auditory targets.</p>

<p>Aging is accompanied by a progressive decrease in learning and memory function. Synaptic loss, one of the hallmarks of normal aging, likely plays an important role in age-related cognitive decline. But little is known about the impact of advanced age on synaptic plasticity and neuronal function in vivo. In this study, we examined the structural dynamics of postsynaptic dendritic spines as well as calcium activity of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex of young and old mice. Using transcranial two-photon microscopy, we found that in both sensory and motor cortices, the elimination rates of dendritic spines were comparable between young (3–5 months) and mature adults (8–10 months), but seemed higher in old mice (&gt;20 months), contributing to a reduction of total spine number in the old brain. During the process of motor learning, old mice compared to young mice had fewer new spines formed in the primary motor cortex. Motor training-evoked somatic calcium activity in layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the motor cortex was also lower in old than young mice, which was associated with the decline of motor learning ability during aging. Together, these results demonstrate the effects of aging on learning-dependent synapse remodeling and neuronal activity in the living cortex and suggest that synaptic deficits may contribute to age-related learning impairment.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.609947">The Paradox of Astroglial Ca2 + Signals at the Interface of Excitation and Inhibition</a></h4>

<p>Astroglial networks constitute a non-neuronal communication system in the brain and are acknowledged modulators of synaptic plasticity. A sophisticated set of transmitter receptors in combination with distinct secretion mechanisms enables astrocytes to sense and modulate synaptic transmission. This integrative function evolved around intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, by and large considered as the main indicator of astrocyte activity. Regular brain physiology meticulously relies on the constant reciprocity of excitation and inhibition (E/I). Astrocytes are metabolically, physically, and functionally associated to the E/I convergence. Metabolically, astrocytes provide glutamine, the precursor of both major neurotransmitters governing E/I in the central nervous system (CNS): glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Perisynaptic astroglial processes are structurally and functionally associated with the respective circuits throughout the CNS. Astonishingly, in astrocytes, glutamatergic as well as GABAergic inputs elicit similar rises in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> that in turn can trigger the release of glutamate and GABA as well. Paradoxically, as gliotransmitters, these two molecules can thus strengthen, weaken or even reverse the input signal. Therefore, the net impact on neuronal network function is often convoluted and cannot be simply predicted by the nature of the stimulus itself. In this review, we highlight the ambiguity of astrocytes on discriminating and affecting synaptic activity in physiological and pathological state. Indeed, aberrant astroglial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is a key aspect of pathological conditions exhibiting compromised network excitability, such as epilepsy. Here, we gather recent evidence on the complexity of astroglial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in health and disease, challenging the traditional, neuro-centric concept of segregating E/I, in favor of a non-binary, mutually dependent perspective on glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.604163">Receptoral Mechanisms for Fast Cholinergic Transmission in Direction-Selective Retinal Circuitry</a></h4>

<p>Direction selectivity represents an elementary sensory computation that can be related to underlying synaptic mechanisms. In mammalian retina, direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs) respond strongly to visual motion in a “preferred” direction and weakly to motion in the opposite, “null” direction. The DS mechanism depends on starburst amacrine cells (SACs), which provide null direction-tuned GABAergic inhibition and untuned cholinergic excitation to DSGCs. GABAergic inhibition depends on conventional synaptic transmission, whereas cholinergic excitation apparently depends on paracrine (i.e., non-synaptic) transmission. Despite its paracrine mode of transmission, cholinergic excitation is more transient than GABAergic inhibition, yielding a temporal difference that contributes essentially to the DS computation. To isolate synaptic mechanisms that generate the distinct temporal properties of cholinergic and GABAergic transmission from SACs to DSGCs, we optogenetically stimulated SACs while recording postsynaptic currents (PSCs) from DSGCs in mouse retina. Direct recordings from channelrhodopsin-2-expressing (ChR2<sup>+</sup>) SACs during quasi-white noise (WN) (0-30 Hz) photostimulation demonstrated precise, graded optogenetic control of SAC membrane current and potential. Linear systems analysis of ChR2-evoked PSCs recorded in DSGCs revealed cholinergic transmission to be faster than GABAergic transmission. A deconvolution-based analysis showed that distinct postsynaptic receptor kinetics fully account for the temporal difference between cholinergic and GABAergic transmission. Furthermore, GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor blockade prolonged cholinergic transmission, identifying a new functional role for GABAergic inhibition of SACs. Thus, fast cholinergic transmission from SACs to DSGCs arises from at least two distinct mechanisms, yielding temporal properties consistent with conventional synapses despite its paracrine nature.</p>

<p>Store-operated calcium channels (SOCs) are widely expressed in excitatory and non-excitatory cells where they mediate significant store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), an important pathway for calcium signaling throughout the body. While the activity of SOCs has been well studied in non-excitable cells, attention has turned to their role in neurons and glia in recent years. In particular, the role of SOCs in the nervous system has been extensively investigated, with links to their dysregulation found in a wide variety of neurological diseases from Alzheimer’s disease (AD) to pain. In this review, we provide an overview of their molecular components, expression, and physiological role in the nervous system and describe how the dysregulation of those roles could potentially lead to various neurological disorders. Although further studies are still needed to understand how SOCs are activated under physiological conditions and how they are linked to pathological states, growing evidence indicates that SOCs are important players in neurological disorders and could be potential new targets for therapies. While the role of SOCE in the nervous system continues to be multifaceted and controversial, the study of SOCs provides a potentially fruitful avenue into better understanding the nervous system and its pathologies.</p>

<p>The mammalian hippocampus generates new neurons that incorporate into existing neuronal networks throughout the lifespan, which bestows a unique form of cellular plasticity to the memory system. Recently, we found that hippocampal adult-born neurons (ABNs) that were active during learning reactivate during subsequent rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and provided causal evidence that ABN activity during REM sleep is necessary for memory consolidation. Here, we describe the potential underlying mechanisms by highlighting distinct characteristics of ABNs including decoupled firing from local oscillations and ability to undergo profound synaptic remodeling in response to experience. We further discuss whether ABNs constitute the conventional definition of engram cells by focusing on their active and passive roles in the memory system. This synthesis of evidence helps advance our thinking on the unique mechanisms by which ABNs contribute to memory consolidation.</p>

<p>Subarachnoid hemorrhage is a specific, life-threatening form of hemorrhagic stroke linked to high morbidity and mortality. It has been found that the choroid plexus of the brain ventricles forming the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier plays an important role in subarachnoid hemorrhage pathophysiology. Heme oxygenase-1 and biliverdin reductase are two of the key enzymes of the hemoglobin degradation cascade. Therefore, the aim of present study was to investigate changes in protein levels of heme oxygenase-1 and biliverdin reductase in the rat choroid plexus after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage induced by injection of non-heparinized autologous blood to the cisterna magna. Artificial cerebrospinal fluid of the same volume as autologous blood was injected to mimic increased intracranial pressure in control rats. Immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses were used to monitor changes in the of heme oxygenase-1 and biliverdin reductase levels in the rat choroid plexus after induction of subarachnoid hemorrhage or artificial cerebrospinal fluid application for 1, 3, and 7 days. We found increased levels of heme oxygenase-1 and biliverdin reductase protein in the choroid plexus over the entire period following subarachnoid hemorrhage induction. The level of heme oxygenase-1 was the highest early (1 and 3 days) after subarachnoid hemorrhage indicating its importance in hemoglobin degradation. Increased levels of heme oxygenase-1 were also observed in the choroid plexus epithelial cells at all time points after application of artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Biliverdin reductase protein was detected mainly in the choroid plexus epithelial cells, with levels gradually increasing during subarachnoid hemorrhage. Our results suggest that heme oxygenase-1 and biliverdin reductase are involved not only in hemoglobin degradation but probably also in protecting choroid plexus epithelial cells and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier from the negative effects of subarachnoid hemorrhage.</p>

<p>Background: Exosomes, especially stem cell-derived exosomes, have been widely studied in pre-clinical research of ischemic stroke. However, their pooled effects remain inconclusive.</p><p>Methods: Relevant literature concerning the effects of exosomes on neurological performance in a rodent model of ischemic stroke was identified via searching electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. The primary outcomes included neurological function scores (NFS) and infarct volume (IV), and the secondary outcomes were several pro-inflammatory factors and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling-positive cells. Subgroup analyses regarding several factors potentially influencing the effects of exosomes on NFS and IV were also conducted.</p><p>Results: We identified 21 experiments from 18 studies in the meta-analysis. Pooled analyses showed the positive and significant effects of exosomes on NFS (standardized mean difference −2.79; 95% confidence interval −3.81 to −1.76) and IV (standardized mean difference −3.16; 95% confidence interval −4.18 to −2.15). Our data revealed that the effects of exosomes on neurological outcomes in rodent stroke models might be related to routes of administration and exosomes sources. In addition, there was significant attenuation in pro-inflammatory factors, including interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling-positive cells when undergoing exosomes treatment.</p><p>Conclusion: Cell-derived exosomes treatment demonstrated statistically significant improvements in structural and neurological function recovery in animal models of ischemic stroke. Our results also provide relatively robust evidence supporting cell-derived exosomes as a promising therapy to promote neurological recovery in stroke individuals.</p>

<p>Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is an important neuromodulator in central nervous system that modulates neuronal activity via its receptors during stress responses. In cerebellar cortex, CRF modulates the simple spike (SS) firing activity of Purkinje cells (PCs) has been previously demonstrated, whereas the effect of CRF on the molecular layer interneuron (MLI)–PC synaptic transmission is still unknown. In this study, we examined the effect of CRF on the facial stimulation–evoked cerebellar cortical MLI-PC synaptic transmission in urethane-anesthetized mice by in vivo cell-attached recording, neurobiotin juxtacellular labeling, immunohistochemistry techniques, and pharmacological method. Cell-attached recordings from cerebellar PCs showed that air-puff stimulation of ipsilateral whisker pad evoked a sequence of tiny parallel fiber volley (N1) followed by MLI-PC synaptic transmission (P1). Microapplication of CRF in cerebellar cortical molecular layer induced increases in amplitude of P1 and pause of SS firing. The CRF decreases in amplitude of P1 waveform were in a dose-dependent manner with the EC<sub>50</sub> of 241 nM. The effects of CRF on amplitude of P1 and pause of SS firing were abolished by either a non-selective CRF receptor antagonist, α-helical CRF-(9-14), or a selective CRF-R1 antagonist, BMS-763534 (BMS, 200 nM), but were not prevented by a selective CRF-R2 antagonist, antisauvagine-30 (200 nM). Notably, application CRF not only induced a significant increase in spontaneous spike firing rate, but also produced a significant increase in the number of the facial stimulation–evoked action potential in MLIs. The effect of CRF on the activity of MLIs was blocked by the selective CRF-R1 antagonist, and the MLIs expressed the CRF-R1 imunoreactivity. These results indicate that CRF increases excitability of MLIs via CRF-R1, resulting in an enhancement of the facial stimulation–evoked MLI-PC synaptic transmission in vivo in mice.</p>

<p>Axonopathy is a pathological feature observed in both Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients and animal models. However, identifying the temporal and regional progression of axonopathy during AD development remains elusive. Using the fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography system, we acquired whole-brain datasets in the early stage of 5xFAD/Thy1-GFP-M mice. We reported that among GFP labeled axons, GFP-positive axonopathy first formed in the lateral septal nucleus, subiculum, and medial mammillary nucleus. The axonopathy further increased in most brain regions during aging. However, most of the axonopathic varicosities disappeared significantly in the medial mammillary nucleus after 8 weeks old. Continuous three-dimensional datasets showed that axonopathy in the medial mammillary nucleus was mainly located on axons from hippocampal GFP-positive neurons. Using the rabies viral tracer in combination with immunohistochemistry, we found that axons in the medial mammillary nucleus from the subiculum were susceptible to lesions that prior to the occurrence of behavioral disorders. In conclusion, we created an early-stage spatiotemporal map of axonopathy in 5xFAD/Thy1-GFP-M mice and identified specific neural circuits which are vulnerable to axon lesions in an AD mouse model. These findings underline the importance of early interventions for AD, and may contribute to the understanding of its progression and its early symptom treatment.</p>

<p>The hypothalamus is a heterogeneous rostral forebrain region that regulates physiological processes essential for survival, energy metabolism, and reproduction, mainly mediated by the pituitary gland. In the updated prosomeric model, the hypothalamus represents the rostralmost forebrain, composed of two segmental regions (terminal and peduncular hypothalamus), which extend respectively into the non-evaginated preoptic telencephalon and the evaginated pallio-subpallial telencephalon. Complex genetic cascades of transcription factors and signaling molecules rule their development. Alterations of some of these molecular mechanisms acting during forebrain development are associated with more or less severe hypothalamic and pituitary dysfunctions, which may be associated with brain malformations such as holoprosencephaly or septo-optic dysplasia. Studies on transgenic mice with mutated genes encoding critical transcription factors implicated in hypothalamic-pituitary development are contributing to understanding the high clinical complexity of these pathologies. In this review article, we will analyze first the complex molecular genoarchitecture of the hypothalamus resulting from the activity of previous morphogenetic signaling centers and secondly some malformations related to alterations in genes implicated in the development of the hypothalamus.</p>

<p>Cognitive functions such as attention and working memory are modulated by noradrenaline receptors in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The frontal eye field (FEF) has been shown to play an important role in visual spatial attention. However, little is known about the underlying circuitry. The aim of this study was to characterize the expression of noradrenaline receptors on different pyramidal neuron and inhibitory interneuron subtypes in macaque FEF. Using immunofluorescence, we found broad expression of noradrenaline receptors across all layers of the FEF. Differences in the expression of different noradrenaline receptors were observed across different inhibitory interneuron subtypes. No significant differences were observed in the expression of noradrenaline receptors across different pyramidal neuron subtypes. However, we found that putative long-range projecting pyramidal neurons expressed all noradrenaline receptor subtypes at a much higher proportion than any of the other neuronal subtypes. Nearly all long-range projecting pyramidal neurons expressed all types of noradrenaline receptor, suggesting that there is no receptor-specific machinery acting on these long-range projecting pyramidal neurons. This pattern of expression among long-range projecting pyramidal neurons suggests a mechanism by which noradrenergic modulation of FEF activity influences attention and working memory.</p>

<p>There is currently a limited understanding of the morphological and functional organization of the olfactory system in cartilaginous fishes, particularly when compared to bony fishes and terrestrial vertebrates. In this fish group, there is a clear paucity of information on the characterization, density, and distribution of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) within the sensory olfactory epithelium lining the paired olfactory rosettes, and their functional implications with respect to the hydrodynamics of incurrent water flow into the nares. This imaging study examines the brownbanded bamboo shark Chiloscyllium punctatum (Elasmobranchii) and combines immunohistochemical labeling using antisera raised against five G-protein α-subunits (Gα<sub>s/olf</sub>, Gα<sub>q/</sub><sub>11</sub><sub>/</sub><sub>14</sub>, Gα<sub>i–</sub><sub>1</sub><sub>/</sub><sub>2</sub><sub>/</sub><sub>3</sub>, Gα<sub>i–</sub><sub>3</sub>, Gα<sub>o</sub>) with light and electron microscopy, to characterize the morphological ORN types present. Three main ORNs (“long”, “microvillous” and “crypt-like”) are confirmed and up to three additional microvilli-bearing types are also described; “Kappe-like” (potential or homologous “Kappe” as in teleosts), “pear-shaped” and “teardrop-shaped” cells. These morphotypes will need to be confirmed molecularly in the future. Using X-ray diffusible iodine-based contrast-enhanced computed tomography (diceCT), high-resolution scans of the olfactory rosettes, olfactory bulbs (OBs), peduncles, and telencephalon reveal a lateral segregation of primary olfactory inputs within the OBs, with distinct medial and lateral clusters of glomeruli, suggesting a potential somatotopic organization. However, most ORN morphotypes are found to be ubiquitously distributed within the medial and lateral regions of the olfactory rosette, with at least three microvilli-bearing ORNs labeled with anti-Gα<sub>o</sub> found in significantly higher densities in lateral lamellae [in lateral lamellae] and on the anterior portion of lamellae (facing the olfactory cavity). These microvilli-bearing ORN morphotypes (microvillous, “Kappe-like,” “pear-shaped,” and “teardrop-shaped”) are the most abundant across the olfactory rosette of this species, while ciliated ORNs are less common and crypt cells are rare. Spatial simulations of the fluid dynamics of the incurrent water flow into the nares and within the olfactory cavities indicate that the high densities of microvilli-bearing ORNs located within the lateral region of the rosette are important for sampling incoming odorants during swimming and may determine subsequent tracking behavior.</p>

<p>Heart rate variability (HRV) indices correlate with aging and are related to the autonomic nervous system. However, the trend of HRV with age has not been explored for the Asian population. Therefore, we proposed a linear regression model of HRV indices that decreased with aging in healthy Asian adults. HRV parameters [High frequency (HF), Low frequency (LF), Very low frequency (VLF), Total power (TP), HRV triangular index (HRV-index), Standard deviation of the normal-to-normal interval (SDNN), and Proportion of normal-to-normal intervals greater than 50 ms (pNN50)] were measured in a total of 300 healthy participants (150 men and 150 women) aged 19–69 years stratified into five age groups: 19–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, and 60–69 years comprising 60 people each in Seoul, South Korea. A simple regression analysis was performed to reveal the linear declining trend of HRV indices with age. Independent t-tests were conducted to investigate the gender differences in HRV values depending on each age group. The values of all HRV indices showed a decreasing trend with age in healthy Korean adults, as observed in the Western population (P &lt; 0.001 for all indices); HF (Y = −0.039x + 6.833, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.287), LF (Y = −0.047x + 7.197, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.414), VLF (Y = −0.025x + 6.861, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.177), TP (Y = −0.034x + 8.082, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.352), HRV-index (Y = −0.125x + 15.628, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.298), SDNN (Y = −0.502x + 53.907, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.343), and pNN50 (Y = −0.650x + 53.852, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.345) all decreased with age. There was no significant gender difference in any HRV parameter. A linear regression model of various HRV indices has been presented considering the age of healthy Asians, which may be useful to prevent diseases related to the autonomic nervous system by estimating or tracking autonomic functional degeneration in the Asian population.</p>

Objectives<p>Amantadine has been shown to attenuate postoperative learning and memory dysfunction in young adult rats. However, postoperative cognitive dysfunction often occurs in elderly patients. We aimed to determine whether amantadine attenuated postoperative learning and memory dysfunction and whether these effects were associated with improved dendritic arborization in old rodents.</p>Methods<p>Eighteen-month old male C57BL/6J mice or Fischer 344 rats were subjected to right carotid artery exposure (surgery) under isoflurane anesthesia. This age represents an early old stage in rodents. Carotid artery exposure was used to simulate commonly performed carotid endarterectomy in elderly patients. Amantadine was injected intraperitoneally at 25 μg/g once a day for 3 days with the first dose at 15 min before surgery. The animals were tested by Barnes maze and fear conditioning starting one week after the surgery. Hippocampus was harvested for Western blotting and Golgi staining.</p>Results<p>Surgery and anesthesia impaired the learning and memory in old mice and rats. Surgery reduced the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), dendritic arborization and spine density in the hippocampus of old rats. These effects were attenuated by amantadine. The effects of amantadine were blocked by intracerebroventricular injection of anti-BDNF antibody or anti-GDNF antibody.</p>Conclusion<p>Surgery and anesthesia impaired learning, memory and dendritic arborization in old rodents that are age relevant to postoperative cognitive dysfunction. These effects may be attenuated by amantadine via preserving the expression of neurotrophic factors.</p>

Background<p>Current research evidence challenges clinical decision-making when acupuncture is taken into consideration in the treatment of cognitive impairment (CI). Aiming to provide some viable recommendations for acupuncture practitioners in dealing with actual clinic issues, an expert consensus study was conducted.</p>Methods<p>A clinical question investigation among 47 acupuncturists yielded 24 initial items. Subsequently, systematic reviews on acupuncture for CI were searched within three online databases. A panel of 30 authoritative experts were requested to respond with agreement, neutrality, or disagreement for each item. Consensus establishment was defined as the percentage of agreement on a given item &gt;80%.</p>Results<p>Following a 2-round Delphi survey, there were 21 items reaching consensus and three items resulting in no consensus; of which 10 items reached 90∼100% agreement, and 80∼90% expert agreement was achieved for 11 items. These items could be roughly categorized into six domains: (1) therapeutic effects of acupuncture, (2) therapeutic principles, (3) acupoint selection and combination, (4) acupuncture parameters, (5) considerable combined therapies, and (6) possible adverse events.</p>Conclusion<p>Without ready-made guidelines, this expert consensus may be conducive to guide acupuncturists in implementing clinical acupuncture practice for CI. Moreover, given the lack of high-quality research evidence and plenty of unresolved clinical issues in this field, it is of necessity to carry out more studies to better clarify the treatment algorithm.</p>

As a robust age-related difference, in the older group a large anterior positivity and posterior negativity emerged to the distractors within the 100–200 ms post-stimulus range, and these components were larger for schematic faces than for threatening objects. sLORETA localized the age-specific effect to the ventral stream of the visual system and to anterior structures considered as parts of the executive system. The Nogo stimuli elicited a late positivity (Nogo P3) with longer latency in the older group. We interpreted the age-related differences as decreased but compensated resistance to task-irrelevant change of the target stimuli.</p>

Background<p>Frontotemporal Spectrum Disorder (FTSD) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) are neurodegenerative diseases often considered as a continuum from clinical, epidemiologic, and genetic perspectives. We used localized brain volume alterations to evaluate common and specific features of FTSD, FTSD-ALS, and ALS patients to further understand this clinical continuum.</p>Methods<p>We used voxel-based morphometry on structural magnetic resonance images to localize volume alterations in group comparisons: patients (20 FTSD, seven FTSD-ALS, and 18 ALS) versus healthy controls (39 CTR), and patient groups between themselves. We used mean whole-brain cortical thickness (CT¯) to assess whether its correlations with local brain volume could propose mechanistic explanations of the heterogeneous clinical presentations. We also assessed whether volume reduction can explain cognitive impairment, measured with frontal assessment battery, verbal fluency, and semantic fluency.</p>Results<p>Common (mainly frontal) and specific areas with reduced volume were detected between FTSD, FTSD-ALS, and ALS patients, confirming suggestions of a clinical continuum, while at the same time defining morphological specificities for each clinical group (e.g., a difference of cerebral and cerebellar involvement between FTSD and ALS). CT¯ values suggested extensive network disruption in the pathological process, with indications of a correlation between cerebral and cerebellar volumes and CT¯ in ALS. The analysis of the neuropsychological scores indeed pointed toward an important role for the cerebellum, along with fronto-temporal areas, in explaining impairment of executive, and linguistic functions.</p>Conclusion<p>We identified common elements that explain the FTSD-ALS clinical continuum, while also identifying specificities of each group, partially explained by different cerebral and cerebellar involvement.</p>

Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT<sub>1</sub>R) blockers (ARBs) are among the most prescribed drugs. However, ARB effectiveness varies widely, which may be due to non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) within the AT<sub>1</sub>R gene. The AT<sub>1</sub>R coding sequence contains over 100 nsSNPs; therefore, this study embarked on determining which nsSNPs may abrogate the binding of selective ARBs. The crystal structure of olmesartan-bound human AT<sub>1</sub>R (PDB:4ZUD) served as a template to create an inactive apo-AT<sub>1</sub>R via molecular dynamics simulation (n = 3). All simulations resulted in a water accessible ligand-binding pocket that lacked sodium ions. The model remained inactive displaying little movement in the receptor core; however, helix 8 showed considerable flexibility. A single frame representing the average stable AT<sub>1</sub>R was used as a template to dock Olmesartan via AutoDock 4.2, MOE, and AutoDock Vina to obtain predicted binding poses and mean Boltzmann weighted average affinity. The docking results did not match the known pose and affinity of Olmesartan. Thus, an optimization protocol was initiated using AutoDock 4.2 that provided more accurate poses and affinity for Olmesartan (n = 6). Atomic models of 103 of the known human AT<sub>1</sub>R polymorphisms were constructed using the molecular dynamics equilibrated apo-AT<sub>1</sub>R. Each of the eight ARBs was then docked, using ARB-optimized parameters, to each polymorphic AT<sub>1</sub>R (n = 6). Although each nsSNP has a negligible effect on the global AT<sub>1</sub>R structure, most nsSNPs drastically alter a sub-set of ARBs affinity to the AT<sub>1</sub>R. Alterations within N298 –L314 strongly effected predicted ARB affinity, which aligns with early mutagenesis studies. The current study demonstrates the potential of utilizing in silico approaches towards personalized ARB therapy. The results presented here will guide further biochemical studies and refinement of the model to increase the accuracy of the prediction of ARB resistance in order to increase overall ARB effectiveness.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2d9SUPLv_4o" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Over 40 distinct types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) generate parallel processing pathways in the visual system. In mice, two subdivisions of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), the core and the shell, organize distinct parallel channels to transmit visual information from the retina to the primary visual cortex (V1). To investigate how the dLGN core and shell differentially integrate visual information and other modalities, we mapped synaptic input sources to each dLGN subdivision at the cell‐type level with G‐deleted rabies viral vectors. The monosynaptic circuit tracing revealed that dLGN core neurons received inputs from alpha‐RGCs, layer 6 neurons of the V1, the superficial and intermediate layers of the superior colliculus (SC), the internal ventral LGN, the lower layer of the external ventral LGN (vLGNe), the intergeniculate leaf, the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), and the pretectal nucleus (PT). Conversely, shell neurons received inputs from alpha‐RGCs and direction‐selective ganglion cells of the retina, layer 6 neurons of the V1, the superficial layer of the SC, the superficial and lower layers of the vLGNe, the TRN, the PT, and the parabigeminal nucleus. The present study provides anatomical evidence of the cell type‐ and layer‐specific convergence in dLGN core and shell neurons. These findings suggest that dLGN core neurons integrate and process more multimodal information along with visual information than shell neurons and that LGN core and shell neurons integrate different types of information, send their own convergent information to discrete populations of the V1, and differentially contribute to visual perception and behavior.</p>

<p>In mammals, adult neurons fail to regenerate following any insult to adult central nervous system (CNS), which leads to a permanent and irreversible loss of motor and cognitive functions. For a long time, much effort has been deployed to uncover mechanisms of axon regeneration in the CNS. Even if some cases of functional recovery have been reported, there is still a discrepancy regarding the functionality of a neuronal circuit upon lesion. Today, there is a need not only to identify new molecules implicated in adult CNS axon regeneration, but also to decipher the fine molecular mechanisms associated with regeneration failure. Here, we propose to use cultures of adult retina explants to study all molecular and cellular mechanisms that occur during CNS regeneration. We show that adult retinal explant cultures have the advantages to (i) recapitulate all the features observed in vivo, including axon regeneration induced by intrinsic factors, and (ii) be an ex vivo set-up with high accessibility and many downstream applications. Thanks to several examples, we demonstrate that adult explants can be used to address many questions, such as axon guidance, growth cone formation and cytoskeleton dynamics. Using laser guided ablation of a single axon, axonal injury can be performed at a single axon level, which allows to record early and late molecular events that occur after the lesion. Our model is the ideal tool to study all molecular and cellular events that occur during CNS regeneration at a single-axon level, which is currently not doable in vivo. It is extremely valuable to address unanswered questions of neuroprotection and neuroregeneration in the context of CNS lesion and neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>Embryofetal development is a critical process that needs a strict epigenetic control, however, perturbations in this balance might lead to the occurrence of congenital anomalies. It is known that anticonvulsants potentially affect epigenetics-related genes, however, it is not comprehended whether this unbalance could explain the anticonvulsants-induced fetal syndromes. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the expression of epigenetics-related genes in valproic acid, carbamazepine, or phenytoin exposure. We selected these three anticonvulsants exposure assays, which used murine or human embryonic stem-cells and were publicly available in genomic databases. We performed a differential gene expression (DGE) and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), focusing on epigenetics-related genes. Few epigenetics genes were differentially expressed in the anticonvulsants’ exposure, however, the WGCNA strategy demonstrated a high enrichment of chromatin remodeling genes for the three drugs. We also identified an association of 46 genes related to Fetal Valproate Syndrome, containing SMARCA2 and SMARCA4, and nine genes to Fetal Hydantoin Syndrome, including PAX6, NEUROD1, and TSHZ1. The evaluation of stem-cells under drug exposure can bring many insights to understand the drug-induced damage to the embryofetal development. The candidate genes here presented are potential biomarkers that could help in future strategies for the prevention of congenital anomalies.</p>

<p>The successful development of novel therapies is closely linked with understanding the underlying pathomechanisms of a disease. To do so, model systems that reflect human diseases and allow for the evaluation of new therapeutic approaches are needed. Yet, preclinical animal studies often have limited success in predicting human physiology, pathology, and therapeutic responses. Moreover, animal testing is facing increasing ethical and bureaucratic hurdles, while human cell cultures are limited in their ability to represent in vivo situations due to the lack of the tissue microenvironment, which may alter cellular responses. To overcome these struggles, organ cultures, especially those of complex organs such as the retina, can be used to study physiological reactions to substances or stressors. Human and animal organ cultures are now well established and recognized. This mini-review discusses how retinal organ cultures can be used to preserve tissue architecture more realistically and therefore better represent disease-related changes. It also shows how molecular biological, biochemical, and histological techniques can be combined to investigate how anatomical localization may alter cellular responses. Examples for the use of retinal organ cultures, including models to study age-related macular degeneration (AMD), retinitis pigmentosa (RP), central artery occlusion (CRAO), and glaucoma are presented, and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. We conclude that organ cultures significantly improve our understanding of complex retinal diseases and may advance treatment testing without the need for animal testing.</p>

<p>Gaining insight to pathologically relevant processes in continuous volumes of unstained brain tissue is important for a better understanding of neurological diseases. Many pathological processes in neurodegenerative disorders affect myelinated axons, which are a critical part of the neuronal circuitry. Cryo ptychographic X-ray computed tomography in the multi-keV energy range is an emerging technology providing phase contrast at high sensitivity, allowing label-free and non-destructive three dimensional imaging of large continuous volumes of tissue, currently spanning up to 400,000 μm<sup>3</sup>. This aspect makes the technique especially attractive for imaging complex biological material, especially neuronal tissues, in combination with downstream optical or electron microscopy techniques. A further advantage is that dehydration, additional contrast staining, and destructive sectioning/milling are not required for imaging. We have developed a pipeline for cryo ptychographic X-ray tomography of relatively large, hydrated and unstained biological tissue volumes beyond what is typical for the X-ray imaging, using human brain tissue and combining the technique with complementary methods. We present four imaged volumes of a Parkinson’s diseased human brain and five volumes from a non-diseased control human brain using cryo ptychographic X-ray tomography. In both cases, we distinguish neuromelanin-containing neurons, lipid and melanic pigment, blood vessels and red blood cells, and nuclei of other brain cells. In the diseased sample, we observed several swellings containing dense granular material resembling clustered vesicles between the myelin sheaths arising from the cytoplasm of the parent oligodendrocyte, rather than the axoplasm. We further investigated the pathological relevance of such swollen axons in adjacent tissue sections by immunofluorescence microscopy for phosphorylated alpha-synuclein combined with multispectral imaging. Since cryo ptychographic X-ray tomography is non-destructive, the large dataset volumes were used to guide further investigation of such swollen axons by correlative electron microscopy and immunogold labeling post X-ray imaging, a possibility demonstrated for the first time. Interestingly, we find that protein antigenicity and ultrastructure of the tissue are preserved after the X-ray measurement. As many pathological processes in neurodegeneration affect myelinated axons, our work sets an unprecedented foundation for studies addressing axonal integrity and disease-related changes in unstained brain tissues.</p>

<p>Auditory sensory memory indexed by mismatch negativity has been broadly studied over the past century, but far less attention has been directed to tactile sensory memory. To investigate whether tactile sensory memory is affected by attention, we recorded somatosensory mismatch negativity (sMMN) from 24 healthy adults in two experiments to distinguish sustained attention from non-sustained attention. Using the roving somatosensory oddball paradigm, we analyzed the average dynamic changes in the amplitude and latency of sMMN amplitude and found a clear sMMN component at the central region at a 100–300 ms interval. The sMMN amplitude, which indexes the early detection of tactile stimuli with the sensory memory trace, was larger in the tactile attentional task. Additionally, the sMMN latency increased with the increasing visual attentional load, which indicates a decay of tactile sensory memory. Our results indicate that the more attention resources are allocated for a tactile sensation, the more favorable it is to the generation of tactile sensory memory.</p>

<p>The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a central role in executive functions and inhibitory control over many cognitive behaviors. Dynamic changes in local field potentials (LFPs), such as gamma oscillation, have been hypothesized to be important for attentive behaviors and modulated by local interneurons such as parvalbumin (PV) cells. However, the precise relationships between the firing patterns of PV interneurons and temporal dynamics of PFC activities remains elusive. In this study, by combining in vivo electrophysiological recordings with optogenetics, we investigated the activities of prefrontal PV interneurons and categorized them into three subtypes based on their distinct firing rates under different behavioral states. Interestingly, all the three subtypes of interneurons showed strong phase-locked firing to cortical high frequency oscillations (HFOs), but not to theta or gamma oscillations, despite of behavior states. Moreover, we showed that sustained optogenetic stimulation (over a period of 10 s) of PV interneurons can consequently modulate the activities of local pyramidal neurons. Interestingly, such optogenetic manipulations only showed moderate effects on LFPs in the PFC. We conclude that prefrontal PV interneurons are consist of several subclasses of cells with distinct state-dependent modulation of firing rates, selectively coupled to HFOs.</p>

<p>While in young adults (YAs) the underlying neural mechanisms of motor learning are well-studied, studies on the involvement of the somatosensory system during motor skill learning in older adults (OAs) remain sparse. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate motor learning-induced neuroplasticity in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) in YAs and OAs. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were used to quantify somatosensory activation prior and immediately after motor skill learning in 20 right-handed healthy YAs (age range: 19–35 years) and OAs (age range: 57–76 years). Participants underwent a single session of a 30-min co-contraction task of the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and deltoid muscle. To assess the effect of motor learning, muscle onset asynchrony (MOA) between the onsets of the contractions of both muscles was measured using electromyography monitoring. In both groups, MOA shortened significantly during motor learning, with YAs showing bigger reductions. No changes were found in SEP amplitudes after motor learning in both groups. However, a correlation analysis revealed an association between baseline SEP amplitudes of the N20/P25 and N30 SEP component and the motor learning slope in YAs such that higher amplitudes are related to higher learning. Hence, the present findings suggest that SEP amplitudes might serve as a predictor of individual motor learning success, at least in YAs. Additionally, our results suggest that OAs are still capable of learning complex motor tasks, showing the importance of motor training in higher age to remain an active part of our society as a prevention for care dependency.</p>

<p>Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive memory deficits, cognitive decline, and spatial disorientation. Non-pharmacological interventions to treat AD have been reported in many meta-analyses (MAs), but robust conclusions have not been made because of variations in the scope, quality, and findings of these reviews.</p><p>Objective: This work aimed to review existing MAs to provide an overview of existing evidence on the effects of five non-pharmacological interventions in AD patients on three outcomes: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), activities of daily living (ADL), and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive section (ADAS-cog).</p><p>Methods: The databases PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science were searched to collect MAs of non-pharmacological interventions for AD. Two reviewers independently conducted literature screening, data extraction, and quality assessment. We assessed the quality of MAs with the Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) 2 and assessed the evidence quality for significant outcomes using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system.</p><p>Results: We found 10 eligible MAs, which included between three (133 patients) and 15 randomized trials (1,217 patients), and five non-pharmacological interventions, namely, acupuncture therapy (40%), exercise intervention (30%), music therapy (10%), cognitive intervention (10%), and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) (10%). All the included MAs were critically low to low quality by AMSTAR 2. Acupuncture therapy and exercise intervention showed the preliminary potential to improve ADL and MMSE. rTMS and acupuncture therapy show benefits in decreasing ADAS-cog, and there were some evidence of improved MMSE with cognitive intervention. All these outcomes scored very low quality to moderate quality of evidence on the GRADE system.</p><p>Conclusions: Non-pharmacological therapy shows promise for the treatment of AD, but there is still a lack of high-quality evidence. In the future, the quality of the original research needs to be improved, and strictly designed MAs should be carried out following methodological requirements.</p>

The rapidly decreasing cost of gene sequencing has resulted in a deluge of genomic data from across the tree of life; however, outside a few model organism databases, genomic data are limited in their scientific impact because they are not accompanied by computable phenomic data. The majority of phenomic data are contained in countless small, heterogeneous phenotypic data sets that are very difficult or impossible to integrate at scale because of variable formats, lack of digitization, and linguistic problems. One powerful solution is to represent phenotypic data using data models with precise, computable semantics, but adoption of semantic standards for representing phenotypic data has been slow, especially in biodiversity and ecology. Some phenotypic and trait data are available in a semantic language from knowledge bases, but these are often not interoperable. In this review, we will compare and contrast existing ontology and data models, focusing on nonhuman phenotypes and traits. We discuss barriers to integration of phenotypic data and make recommendations for developing an operationally useful, semantically interoperable phenotypic data ecosystem.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Gfj3-8cuf80" width="1" />

Near-infrared (NIR) genetically encoded calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) indicators (GECIs) can provide advantages over visible wavelength fluorescent GECIs in terms of reduced phototoxicity, minimal spectral cross talk with visible light excitable optogenetic tools and fluorescent probes, and decreased scattering and absorption in mammalian tissues. Our previously reported NIR GECI, NIR-GECO1, has these advantages but also has several disadvantages including lower brightness and limited fluorescence response compared to state-of-the-art visible wavelength GECIs, when used for imaging of neuronal activity. Here, we report 2 improved NIR GECI variants, designated NIR-GECO2 and NIR-GECO2G, derived from NIR-GECO1. We characterized the performance of the new NIR GECIs in cultured cells, acute mouse brain slices, and <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> and <i>Xenopus laevis</i> in vivo. Our results demonstrate that NIR-GECO2 and NIR-GECO2G provide substantial improvements over NIR-GECO1 for imaging of neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/7LAFxNiHdD4" width="1" />

<p>by Jeremy J. Burdon, Jiasui Zhan</p>

Climate change is triggering similar effects on the incidence and severity of disease for crops in agriculture and wild plants in natural communities. The complexity of natural ecosystems, however, generates a complex array of interactions between wild plants and pathogens in marked contrast to those generated in the structural and species simplicity of most agricultural crops. Understanding the different impacts of climate change on agricultural and natural ecosystems requires accounting for the specific interactions between an individual pathogen and its host(s) and their subsequent effects on the interplay between the host and other species in the community. Ultimately, progress will require looking past short-term fluctuations to multiyear trends to understand the nature and extent of plant and pathogen evolutionary adaptation and determine the fate of plants under future climate change.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/8z7hbYFxsIc" width="1" />

<p>by Jason R. Rohr, Jeremy M. Cohen</p>

Climate change is expected to have complex effects on infectious diseases, causing some to increase, others to decrease, and many to shift their distributions. There have been several important advances in understanding the role of climate and climate change on wildlife and human infectious disease dynamics over the past several years. This essay examines 3 major areas of advancement, which include improvements to mechanistic disease models, investigations into the importance of climate variability to disease dynamics, and understanding the consequences of thermal mismatches between host and parasites. Applying the new information derived from these advances to climate–disease models and addressing the pressing knowledge gaps that we identify should improve the capacity to predict how climate change will affect disease risk for both wildlife and humans.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/e17AdPwXGsQ" width="1" />

Devil facial tumour 1 (DFT1) is a transmissible cancer clone endangering the Tasmanian devil. The expansion of DFT1 across Tasmania has been documented, but little is known of its evolutionary history. We analysed genomes of 648 DFT1 tumours collected throughout the disease range between 2003 and 2018. DFT1 diverged early into five clades, three spreading widely and two failing to persist. One clade has replaced others at several sites, and rates of DFT1 coinfection are high. DFT1 gradually accumulates copy number variants (CNVs), and its telomere lengths are short but constant. Recurrent CNVs reveal genes under positive selection, sites of genome instability, and repeated loss of a small derived chromosome. Cultured DFT1 cell lines have increased CNV frequency and undergo highly reproducible convergent evolution. Overall, DFT1 is a remarkably stable lineage whose genome illustrates how cancer cells adapt to diverse environments and persist in a parasitic niche.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/19LxocWARns" width="1" />

Small island developing states in the Caribbean are among the most vulnerable countries on the planet to climate variability and climate change. In the last 3 decades, the Caribbean region has undergone frequent and intense heat waves, storms, floods, and droughts. This has had a detrimental impact on population health and well-being, including an increase in infectious disease outbreaks. Recent advances in climate science have enhanced our ability to anticipate hydrometeorological hazards and associated public health challenges. Here, we discuss progress towards bridging the gap between climate science and public health decision-making in the Caribbean to build health system resilience to extreme climatic events. We focus on the development of climate services to help manage mosquito-transmitted disease epidemics. There are numerous areas of ongoing biological research aimed at better understanding the direct and indirect impacts of climate change on the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases. Here, we emphasise additional factors that affect our ability to operationalise this biological understanding. We highlight a lack of financial resources, technical expertise, data sharing, and formalised partnerships between climate and health communities as major limiting factors to developing sustainable climate services for health. Recommendations include investing in integrated climate, health and mosquito surveillance systems, building regional and local human resource capacities, and designing national and regional cross-sectoral policies and national action plans. This will contribute towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and maximising regional development partnerships and co-benefits for improved health and well-being in the Caribbean.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/xp98rMmZp1g" width="1" />

<p>by James E. Byers</p>

Information on parasites and disease in marine ecosystems lags behind terrestrial systems, increasing the challenge of predicting responses of marine host–parasite systems to climate change. However, here I examine several generalizable aspects and research priorities. First, I advocate that quantification and comparison of host and parasite thermal performance curves is a smart approach to improve predictions of temperature effects on disease. Marine invertebrate species are ectothermic and should be highly conducive to this approach given their generally short generation times. Second, in marine systems, shallow subtidal and intertidal areas will experience the biggest temperature swings and thus likely see the most changes to host–parasite dynamics. Third, for some responses like parasite intensity, as long as the lethal limit of the parasite is not crossed, on average, there may be a biological basis to expect temperature-dependent intensification of impacts on hosts. Fourth, because secondary mortality effects and indirect effects of parasites can be very important, we need to study temperature effects on host–parasite dynamics in a community context to truly know their bottom line effects. This includes examining climate-influenced effects of parasites on ecosystem engineers given their pivotal role in communities. Finally, other global change factors, especially hypoxia, salinity, and ocean acidity, covary with temperature change and need to be considered and evaluated when possible for their contributing effects on host–parasite systems. Climate change–disease interactions in nearshore marine environments are complex; however, generalities are possible and continued research, especially in the areas outlined here, will improve our understanding.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/76cM5pQV-cA" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to determine whether a low residual quantity of dystrophin protein is associated with delayed clinical milestones in patients with <i>DMD</i> mutations.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a retrospective multicentric cohort study by using molecular and clinical data from patients with <i>DMD</i> mutations registered in the Universal Mutation Database–DMD France database. Patients with intronic, splice site, or nonsense <i>DMD</i> mutations, with available muscle biopsy Western blot data, were included irrespective of whether they presented with severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) or milder Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). Patients were separated into 3 groups based on dystrophin protein levels. Clinical outcomes were ages at appearance of first symptoms; loss of ambulation; fall in vital capacity and left ventricular ejection fraction; interventions such as spinal fusion, tracheostomy, and noninvasive ventilation; and death.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 3,880 patients with <i>DMD</i> mutations, 90 with mutations of interest were included. Forty‐two patients expressed no dystrophin (group A), and 31 of 42 (74%) developed DMD. Thirty‐four patients had dystrophin quantities &lt; 5% (group B), and 21 of 34 (61%) developed BMD. Fourteen patients had dystrophin quantities ≥ 5% (group C), and all but 4 who lost ambulation beyond 24 years of age were ambulant. Dystrophin quantities of &lt;5%, as low as &lt;0.5%, were associated with milder phenotype for most of the evaluated clinical outcomes, including age at loss of ambulation (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Very low residual dystrophin protein quantity can cause a shift in disease phenotype from DMD toward BMD. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To identify a monogenic cause of early‐onset, generalized dystonia.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Genome‐wide linkage analysis, exome and Sanger sequencing, clinical neurological examination, brain MRI, and protein expression studies in skin fibroblasts from patients.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified a heterozygous variant, c.388G&gt;A, p.Gly130Arg in the <i>Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 2 Alpha Kinase 2</i> (<i>EIF2AK2</i>) gene, segregating with early‐onset isolated generalized dystonia in five patients of a Taiwanese family. <i>EIF2AK2</i> sequencing in 191 unrelated patients with unexplained dystonia yielded two unrelated Caucasian patients with an identical heterozygous c.388G&gt;A, p.Gly130Arg variant, occurring <i>de novo</i> in one case, another patient carrying a different heterozygous variant, c.413G&gt;C, p.Gly138Ala, and one last patient, born from consanguineous parents, carrying a third, homozygous variant c.95A&gt;C, p.Asn32Thr. These three missense variants are absent from gnomAD, and are located in functional domains of the encoded protein. In three patients, additional neurological manifestations were present, including intellectual disability and spasticity. <i>EIF2AK2</i> encodes a kinase (PKR) that phosphorylates the Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 2 Alpha (eIF2α), which orchestrates the cellular stress response. Our expression studies showed abnormally enhanced activation of the cellular stress response, monitored by PKR‐mediated phosphorylation of eIF2α, in fibroblasts from patients with <i>EIF2AK2</i> variants. Intriguingly, PKR can also be regulated by PRKRA, the product of another gene causing monogenic dystonia.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We identified <i>EIF2AK2</i> variants implicated in early‐onset generalized dystonia, which can be dominantly or recessively inherited, or occur <i>de novo</i>. Our findings provide direct evidence for a key role of a dysfunctional eIF2α pathway in the pathogenesis of dystonia.</p>

<p>Recent studies have shown the ability to record high-γ signals (80–160 Hz) in electroencephalogram (EEG) from traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients who have had hemicraniectomies. However, extraction of the movement-related high-γ remains challenging due to a confounding bandwidth overlap with surface electromyogram (EMG) artifacts related to facial and head movements. In our previous work, we described an augmented independent component analysis (ICA) approach for removal of EMG artifacts from EEG, and referred to as EMG Reduction by Adding Sources of EMG (ERASE). Here, we tested this algorithm on EEG recorded from six TBI patients with hemicraniectomies while they performed a thumb flexion task. ERASE removed a mean of 52 ± 12% (mean ± S.E.M) (maximum 73%) of EMG artifacts. In contrast, conventional ICA removed a mean of 27 ± 19% (mean ± S.E.M) of EMG artifacts from EEG. In particular, high-γ synchronization was significantly improved in the contralateral hand motor cortex area within the hemicraniectomy site after ERASE was applied. A more sophisticated measure of high-γ complexity is the fractal dimension (FD). Here, we computed the FD of EEG high-γ on each channel. Relative FD of high-γ was defined as that the FD in move state was subtracted by FD in idle state. We found relative FD of high-γ over hemicraniectomy after applying ERASE were strongly correlated to the amplitude of finger flexion force. Results showed that significant correlation coefficients across the electrodes related to thumb flexion averaged ~0.76, while the coefficients across the homologous electrodes in non-hemicraniectomy areas were nearly 0. After conventional ICA, a correlation between relative FD of high-γ and force remained high in both hemicraniectomy areas (up to 0.86) and non-hemicraniectomy areas (up to 0.81). Across all subjects, an average of 83% of electrodes significantly correlated with force was located in the hemicraniectomy areas after applying ERASE. After conventional ICA, only 19% of electrodes with significant correlations were located in the hemicraniectomy. These results indicated that the new approach isolated electrophysiological features during finger motor activation while selectively removing confounding EMG artifacts. This approach removed EMG artifacts that can contaminate high-gamma activity recorded over the hemicraniectomy.</p>

<p>Group cognitive behavioral therapy (GCBT) is a successful psychotherapy for asthma. However, response varies considerably among individuals, and identifying biomarkers of GCBT has been challenging. Thus, the aim of this study was to predict an individual’s potential response by using machine learning algorithms and functional connectivity (FC) and to improve the personalized treatment of GCBT. We use the lasso method to make the feature selection in the functional connections between brain regions, and we utilize t-test method to test the significant difference of these selected features. The feature selections are performed between controls (size = 20) and pre-GCBT patients (size = 20), pre-GCBT patients (size = 10) and post-GCBT patients (size = 10), and post-GCBT patients (size = 10) and controls (size = 10). Depending on these features, support vector classification was used to classify controls and pre- and post-GCBT patients. Pearson correlation analysis was employed to analyze the associations between clinical symptoms and the selected discriminated FCs in post-GCBT patients. At last, linear support vector regression was applied to predict the therapeutic effect of GCBT. After feature selection and significant analysis, five discriminated FC regarding neuroimaging biomarkers of GCBT were discovered, which are also correlated with clinical symptoms. Using these discriminated functional connections, we could accurately classify the patients before and after GCBT (classification accuracy, 80%) and predict the therapeutic effect of GCBT in asthma (predicted accuracy, 67.8%). The findings in this study would provide a novel sight toward GCBT response prediction and further confirm neural underpinnings of asthma. Moreover, our findings had clinical implications for personalized treatment by identifying asthmatic patients who will be appropriate for GCBT.</p>Clinical Trial Registration<p>The brain mechanisms of group cognitive behavioral therapy to improve the symptoms of asthma (Registration number: Chi-CTR-15007442, http://www.chictr.org.cn/index.aspx).</p>

<p>Carotid plaque neovascularization is one of the major factors for the classification of vulnerable plaque, but the axial force effects of the pulsatile blood flow on the plaque with neovessel and intraplaque hemorrhage was unclear. Together with the severity of stenosis, the fibrous cap thickness, large lipid core, and the neovascularization followed by intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH) have been regarded as high-risk features of plaque rupture. In this work, the effects of these factors were evaluated on the progression and rupture of the carotid atherosclerotic plaques. Five geometries of carotid artery plaque were developed based on contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) images, which contain two types of neovessel and IPH, and geometry without neovessel and IPH. A one-way fluid-structure interaction model was applied to compute the maximum principal stress and strain in the plaque. For that hyper-elastic and non-linear material, Yeoh 3rd Order strain energy density function was used for components of the plaque. The simulation results indicated that the maximum principal stress of plaque in the carotid artery was higher when the degree of the luminal stenosis increased and the thickness of the fibrous cap decreased. The neovessels within the plaque could introduce a 2.5% increments of deformation in the plaque under the pulsatile blood flow pressure. The IPH also contributed to the increased risk of plaque rupture that a gain of stress was 8.983, 14.526, and 34.47 kPa for the plaque with 50, 65, and 75%, respectively, when comparing stress in the plaque with IPH distributed at the middle to the shoulder of the plaque. In conclusion, neovascularization in the plaque could reduce the stability of the plaque by increasing the stress within the plaque. Also, the risk of plaque rupture increased when large luminal stenosis, thin fibrous cap, and IPH were observed.</p>

<p>Child maltreatment not only leads to epigenetic changes, but also increases the risk of related behavioral deficits and mental disorders. These issues presumably are most closely associated with epigenetic changes in the brain, but epigenetic changes in peripheral tissues like blood are often examined instead, due to their accessibility. As such, the reliability of using the peripheral epigenome as a proxy for that of the brain is imperative. Previously, our lab has found aberrant methylation at the Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) gene in the prefrontal cortex of rats following aversive caregiving. The current study examined whether aversive caregiving alters Bdnf DNA methylation in the blood compared to the prefrontal cortex. It was revealed that DNA methylation associated with adversity increased in both tissues, but this methylation was not correlated between tissues. These findings indicate that group trends in Bdnf methylation between blood and the brain are comparable, but variation exists among individual subjects.</p>

<p>Background: Pain has been associated with structural changes of the brain. However, evidence regarding white matter changes in response to acute pain protocols is still scarce.

Tractography analysis indicated that some pain–tract associations are significant only when pain stage is involved in the contrast (posterior corona radiata), while others (middle cerebellar peduncle, pontine crossing) are only when anesthesia is involved in the contrast.</p><p>Conclusions: The association of white matter fractional anisotropy and connectivity, measured before the pain stages, with subjective pain depends on the magnitude of the differences in pain scores.</p>

<p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by dopaminergic neuron death and the abnormal accumulation and aggregation of α-synuclein (α-Syn) in the substantia nigra (SN). Although the abnormal accumulation of α-Syn can solely promote and accelerate the progress of PD, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Mounting evidence confirms that the abnormal expression of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) plays an important role in PD. Our previous study found that exogenous α-Syn induced the downregulation of lncRNA-T199678 in SH-SY5Y cells via a gene microarray analysis. This finding suggested that lncRNA-T199678 might have a potential pathological role in the pathogenesis of PD. This study aimed to explore the influence of lncRNA-T199678 on α-Syn-induced dopaminergic neuron injury. Overexpression of lncRNA-T199678 ameliorated the neuron injury induced by α-Syn via regulating oxidative stress, cell cycle, and apoptosis. Studies indicate lncRNAs could regulate posttranscriptional gene expression via regulating the downstream microRNA (miRNA). To discover the downstream molecular target of lncRNA-T199678, the following experiment found out that miR-101-3p was a potential target for lncRNA-T199678. Further study showed that the upregulation of lncRNA-T199678 reduced α-Syn-induced neuronal damage through miR-101-3p in SH-SY5Y cells and lncRNA-T199678 was responsible for the α-Syn-induced intracellular oxidative stress, dysfunction of the cell cycle, and apoptosis. All in all, lncRNA-T199678 mitigated the α-Syn-induced dopaminergic neuron injury via targeting miR-101-3p, which contributed to promote PD. Our results highlighted the role of lncRNA-T199678 in mitigating dopaminergic neuron injury in PD and revealed a new molecular target for PD.</p>

<p>Resveratrol is a natural polyphenol that has anti-aging and anti-inflammatory properties against stress condition. It is reported that resveratrol has beneficial functions in various metabolic and central nervous system (CNS) diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, depression, and dementia. Recently, many researchers have emphasized the connection between the brain and gut, called the gut–brain axis, for treating both CNS neuropathologies and gastrointestinal diseases. Based on previous findings, resveratrol is involved in glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) secreted by intestine L cells, the patterns of microbiome in the intestine, the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) level, and CNS inflammation. Here, we review recent evidences concerning the relevance and regulatory function of resveratrol in the gut–brain axis from various perspectives. Here, we highlight the necessity for further study on resveratrol's specific mechanism in the gut–brain axis. We present the potential of resveratrol as a natural therapeutic substance for treating both neuropathology and gastrointestinal dysfunction.</p>

<p>by Lindsey S. Brown, Francis J. Doyle III</p>

The molecular circadian clock is driven by interlocked transcriptional-translational feedback loops, producing oscillations in the expressions of genes and proteins to coordinate the timing of biological processes throughout the body. Modeling this system gives insight into the underlying processes driving oscillations in an activator-repressor architecture and allows us to make predictions about how to manipulate these oscillations. The knockdown or upregulation of different cellular components using small molecules can disrupt these rhythms, causing a phase shift, and we aim to determine the dosing of such molecules with a model-based control strategy. Mathematical models allow us to predict the phase response of the circadian clock to these interventions and time them appropriately but only if the model has enough physiological detail to describe these responses while maintaining enough simplicity for online optimization. We build a control-relevant, physiologically-based model of the two main feedback loops of the mammalian molecular clock, which provides sufficient detail to consider multi-input control. Our model captures experimentally observed peak to trough ratios, relative abundances, and phase differences in the model species, and we independently validate this model by showing that the <i>in silico</i> model reproduces much of the behavior that is observed <i>in vitro</i> under genetic knockout conditions. Because our model produces valid phase responses, it can be used in a model predictive control algorithm to determine inputs to shift phase. Our model allows us to consider multi-input control through small molecules that act on both feedback loops, and we find that changes to the parameters of the negative feedback loop are much stronger inputs for shifting phase. The strongest inputs predicted by this model provide targets for new experimental small molecules and suggest that the function of the positive feedback loop is to stabilize the oscillations while linking the circadian system to other clock-controlled processes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FoXWG2V6Wd0" width="1" />

<p>by Chiara Vanalli, Lorenzo Mari, Lorenzo Righetto, Renato Casagrandi, Marino Gatto, Isabella M. Cattadori</p>

Variation in the intensity and duration of infections is often driven by variation in the network and strength of host immune responses. While many of the immune mechanisms and components are known for parasitic helminths, how these relationships change from single to multiple infections and impact helminth dynamics remains largely unclear. Here, we used laboratory data from a rabbit-helminth system and developed a within-host model of infection to investigate different scenarios of immune regulation in rabbits infected with one or two helminth species. Model selection suggests that the immunological pathways activated against <i>Trichostrongylus retortaeformis</i> and <i>Graphidium strigosum</i> are similar. However, differences in the strength of these immune signals lead to the contrasting dynamics of infections, where the first parasite is rapidly cleared and the latter persists with high intensities. In addition to the reactions identified in single infections, rabbits with both helminths also activate new pathways that asymmetrically affect the dynamics of the two species. These new signals alter the intensities but not the general trend of the infections. The type of interactions described can be expected in many other host-helminth systems. Our immune framework is flexible enough to capture different mechanisms and their complexity, and provides essential insights to the understanding of multi-helminth infections.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/76OHfKKzcfE" width="1" />

Genetic diseases are driven by aberrations of the human genome. Identification of such aberrations including structural variations (SVs) is key to our understanding. Conventional short-reads whole genome sequencing (cWGS) can identify SVs to base-pair resolution, but utilizes only short-range information and suffers from high false discovery rate (FDR). Linked-reads sequencing (10XWGS) utilizes long-range information by linkage of short-reads originating from the same large DNA molecule. This can mitigate alignment-based artefacts especially in repetitive regions and should enable better prediction of SVs. However, an unbiased evaluation of this technology is not available. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of different types and sizes of SVs predicted by both the technologies and validated with an independent PCR based approach. The SVs commonly identified by both the technologies were highly specific, while validation rate dropped for uncommon events. A particularly high FDR was observed for SVs only found by 10XWGS. To improve FDR and sensitivity, statistical models for both the technologies were trained. Using our approach, we characterized SVs from the MCF7 cell line and a primary breast cancer tumor with high precision. This approach improves SV prediction and can therefore help in understanding the underlying genetics in various diseases.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jdwFVwO0xYA" width="1" />

There has been considerable debate and concern as to whether there is a replication crisis in the scientific literature. A likely cause of poor replication is the multiple comparisons problem. An important way in which this problem can manifest in the M/EEG context is through post hoc tailoring of analysis windows (a.k.a. regions-of-interest, ROIs) to landmarks in the collected data. Post hoc tailoring of ROIs is used because it allows researchers to adapt to inter-experiment variability and discover novel differences that fall outside of windows defined by prior precedent, thereby reducing Type II errors. However, this approach can dramatically inflate Type I error rates. One way to avoid this problem is to tailor windows according to a contrast that is orthogonal (strictly parametrically orthogonal) to the contrast being tested. A key approach of this kind is to identify windows on a <i>fully flattened</i> average. On the basis of simulations, this approach has been argued to be safe for post hoc tailoring of analysis windows under many conditions. Here, we present further simulations and mathematical proofs to show exactly why the Fully Flattened Average approach is unbiased, providing a formal grounding to the approach, clarifying the limits of its applicability and resolving published misconceptions about the method. We also provide a statistical power analysis, which shows that, in specific contexts, the fully flattened average approach provides higher statistical power than Fieldtrip cluster inference. This suggests that the Fully Flattened Average approach will enable researchers to identify more effects from their data without incurring an inflation of the false positive rate.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vZw38Wgx7Rg" width="1" />

Interruption to gestation through preterm birth can significantly impact cortical development and have long-lasting adverse effects on neurodevelopmental outcome. We compared cortical morphology captured by high-resolution, multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in <i>n</i> = 292 healthy newborn infants (mean age at birth = 39.9 weeks) with regional patterns of gene expression in the fetal cortex across gestation (<i>n</i> = 156 samples from 16 brains, aged 12 to 37 postconceptional weeks [pcw]). We tested the hypothesis that noninvasive measures of cortical structure at birth mirror areal differences in cortical gene expression across gestation, and in a cohort of <i>n</i> = 64 preterm infants (mean age at birth = 32.0 weeks), we tested whether cortical alterations observed after preterm birth were associated with altered gene expression in specific developmental cell populations. Neonatal cortical structure was aligned to differential patterns of cell-specific gene expression in the fetal cortex. Principal component analysis (PCA) of 6 measures of cortical morphology and microstructure showed that cortical regions were ordered along a principal axis, with primary cortex clearly separated from heteromodal cortex. This axis was correlated with estimated tissue maturity, indexed by differential expression of genes expressed by progenitor cells and neurons, and engaged in stem cell differentiation, neuron migration, and forebrain development. Preterm birth was associated with altered regional MRI metrics and patterns of differential gene expression in glial cell populations. The spatial patterning of gene expression in the developing cortex was thus mirrored by regional variation in cortical morphology and microstructure at term, and this was disrupted by preterm birth. This work provides a framework to link molecular mechanisms to noninvasive measures of cortical development in early life and highlights novel pathways to injury in neonatal populations at increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorder.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0-va7WPrmPw" width="1" />

<p>A dual recombinase fluorescent reporter strategy reveals that many retinorecipient brain regions associated with nonimage forming vision are innervated by retinal projections from both image and non‐image forming retinal ganglion cells.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the output neurons of the retina, allow us to perceive our visual environment. RGCs respond to rod/cone input through the retinal circuitry, however, a small population of RGCs are in addition intrinsically photosensitive (ipRGCs) and project to unique targets in the brain to modulate a broad range of subconscious visual behaviors such as pupil constriction and circadian photoentrainment. Despite the discovery of ipRGCs nearly two decades ago, there is still little information about how or if conventional RGCs (non‐ipRGCs) target ipRGC‐recipient nuclei to influence subconscious visual behavior. Using a dual recombinase fluorescent reporter strategy, we showed that conventional RGCs innervate many subconscious ipRGC‐recipient nuclei, apart from the suprachiasmatic nucleus. We revealed previously unrecognized stratification patterns of retinal innervation from ipRGCs and conventional RGCs in the ventral portion of the lateral geniculate nucleus. Further, we found that the percent innervation of ipRGCs and conventional RGCs across ipsi‐ and contralateral nuclei differ. Our data provide a blueprint to understand how conventional RGCs and ipRGCs innervate different brain regions to influence subconscious visual behaviors.</p>

<p>Schizophrenia (SCZ) is an inherited disease, with the familial risk being among the most important factors when evaluating an individual’s risk for SCZ. However, robust imaging biomarkers for the disease that can be used for diagnosis and determination of the prognosis are lacking. Here, we explore the potential of functional connectivity (FC) for use as a biomarker for the early detection of high-risk first-degree relatives (FDRs). Thirty-eight first-episode SCZ patients, 38 healthy controls (HCs), and 33 FDRs were scanned using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. The subjects’ brains were parcellated into 200 regions using the Craddock atlas, and the FC between each pair of regions was used as a classification feature. Multivariate pattern analysis using leave-one-out cross-validation achieved a correct classification rate of 88.15% [sensitivity 84.06%, specificity 92.18%, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.93] for differentiating SCZ patients from HCs. FC located within the default mode, frontal-parietal, auditory, and sensorimotor networks contributed mostly to the accurate classification. The FC patterns of each FDR were input into each classification model as test data to obtain a corresponding prediction label (a total of 76 individual classification scores), and the averaged individual classification score was then used as a robust measure to characterize whether each FDR showed an SCZ-type or HC-type FC pattern. A significant negative correlation was found between the average classification scores of the FDRs and their semantic fluency scores. These findings suggest that FC combined with a machine learning algorithm could help to predict whether FDRs are likely to show an SCZ-specific or HC-specific FC pattern.</p>

<p>The tsunami effect of the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting many aspects of scientific activities. Multidisciplinary experimental studies with international collaborators are hindered by the closing of the national borders, logistic issues due to lockdown, quarantine restrictions, and social distancing requirements. The full impact of this crisis on science is not clear yet, but the above-mentioned issues have most certainly restrained academic research activities. Sharing innovative solutions between researchers is in high demand in this situation. The aim of this paper is to share our successful practice of using web-based communication and remote control software for real-time long-distance control of brain stimulation. This solution may guide and encourage researchers to cope with restrictions and has the potential to help expanding international collaborations by lowering travel time and costs.</p>

<p>Afferents from the nucleus accumbens (NAc) are a major source of input into the ventral pallidum (VP). Research reveals that these afferents are GABAergic, however, stimulation of these afferents induces both excitatory and inhibitory responses within the VP. These are likely to be partially mediated by enkephalin and substance P (SP), which are also released by these afferents, and are known to modulate VP neurons. However, less is known about the potentially differential effects stimulation of these afferents has on subpopulations of neurons within the VP and the cellular mechanisms by which they exert their effects. The current study aimed to research this further using brain slices containing the VP, stimulation of the NAc afferents, and multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings of their VP targets. Stimulation of the NAc afferents induced a pause in the tonic firing in 58% of the neurons studied in the VP, while 42% were not affected. Measures used to reveal the electrophysiological difference between these groups found no significant differences in firing frequency, coefficient of variation, and spike half-width. There were however significant differences in the pause duration between neurons in the dorsal and ventral VP, with stimulation of NAc afferents producing a significantly longer pause (0.48 ± 0.06 s) in tonic firing in dorsal VP neurons, compared to neurons in the ventral VP (0.21 ± 0.09 s). Pauses in the tonic firing of VP neurons, as a result of NAc afferent stimulation, were found to be largely mediated by GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, as the application of picrotoxin significantly reduced their duration. Opioid agonists and antagonists were found to have no significant effects on the pause in tonic activity induced by NAc afferent stimulation. However, NK-1 receptor antagonists caused significant decreases in the pause duration, suggesting that SP may contribute to the inhibitory effect of NAc afferent stimulation via activation of NK-1 receptors.</p>

<p>Worldwide environmental tragedies of anthropogenic origin causing massive release of metals and other pollutants have been increasing considerably. These pollution outbreaks affect the ecosystems and impact human health. Among those tragedies, recent large-scale environmental disasters in Brazil strongly affected riverside populations, leading to high-risk exposure to methylmercury (MeHg). MeHg is highly neurotoxic to the developing brain. This toxicant causes neural stem cell dysfunction and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. However, less is known about the effects of MeHg in the postnatal neurogenic niche, which harbors neural stem cells and their progeny, in the adult brain. Therefore, taking in consideration the impact of MeHg in human health it is urgent to clarify possible associations between exposure to mercury, accelerated cognitive decline, and neurodegenerative diseases. In this perspectives paper, we discuss the neurotoxic mechanisms of MeHg on postnatal neurogenesis and the putative implications associated with accelerated brain aging and early-onset cognitive decline in populations highly exposed to this environmental neurotoxicant.</p>

<p>Frontostriatal disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease (PD), are characterized by progressive disruption of cortico-subcortical dopaminergic loops involved in diverse higher-order domains, including language. Indeed, syntactic and emotional language tasks have emerged as potential biomarkers of frontostriatal disturbances. However, relevant studies and models have typically considered these linguistic dimensions in isolation, overlooking the potential advantages of targeting multidimensional markers. Here, we examined whether patient classification can be improved through the joint assessment of both dimensions using sentential stimuli. We evaluated 31 early PD patients and 24 healthy controls via two syntactic measures (functional-role assignment, parsing of long-distance dependencies) and a verbal task tapping social emotions (envy, Schadenfreude) and compared their classification accuracy when analyzed in isolation and in combination. Complementarily, we replicated our approach to discriminate between patients on and off medication. Results showed that specific measures of each dimension were selectively impaired in PD. In particular, joint analysis of outcomes in functional-role assignment and Schadenfreude improved the classification accuracy of patients and controls, irrespective of their overall cognitive and affective state. These results suggest that multidimensional linguistic assessments may better capture the complexity and multi-functional impact of frontostriatal disruptions, highlighting their potential contributions in the ongoing quest for sensitive markers of PD.</p>

<p>White matter lesions induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion are associated with cognitive impairment in vascular dementia (VaD). Previous studies have shown that acupuncture can ameliorate the cognitive deficits of individuals with VaD. However, the neuroimaging mechanisms of acupuncture on white matter perfusion and integrity remain elusive. In this study, the VaD model was induced by bilateral common carotid arteries occlusion (BCCAO) in rats. Novel object recognition task and Morris water maze were performed to evaluate short-term memory and spatial learning and memory. Arterial spin labeling and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were used to measure the cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the white matter integrity. Pathological examinations detected the myelin loss and concomitant neuroinflammation. The results demonstrate that BCCAO rats with reduced CBF exhibited worse performance and altered DTI parameters, including decreased fractional anisotropy, increased radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity in white matter regions. Acupuncture ameliorated cognitive impairment, increased CBF, and protected the myelin sheath integrity but not the axons of BCCAO rats. These protective effects of acupuncture on white matter were significantly correlated with improved CBF. Pathological examination confirmed that the loss of myelin basic protein and microglial accumulation associated IL-1β and IL-6 production were attenuated by acupuncture treatment. Our findings suggest that acupuncture protects cognitive function of BCCAO rats by improving white matter perfusion and integrity.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly. It may be caused by oxidative stress, inflammation, and cerebrovascular dysfunctions in the brain. LongShengZhi Capsule (LSZ), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been approved by the China Food and Drug Administration for treatment of patients with cardiovascular/cerebrovascular disease. LSZ contains several neuroprotective ingredients, including Hirudo, Astmgali Radix, Carthami Flos (Honghua), Persicae Semen (Taoren), Acori Tatarinowii Rhizoma (Shichangpu), and Acanthopanax Senticosus (Ciwujia). In this study, we aimed to determine the effect of LSZ on the AD process. Double transgenic mice expressing the amyloid-β precursor protein and mutant human presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) to model AD were treated with LSZ for 7 months starting at 2 months of age. LSZ significantly improved the cognition of the mice without adverse effects, indicating its high degree of safety and efficacy after a long-term treatment. LSZ reduced AD biomarker Aβ plaque accumulation by inhibiting β-secretase and γ-secretase gene expression. LSZ also reduced p-Tau expression, cell death, and inflammation in the brain. Consistently, in vitro, LSZ ethanol extract enhanced neuronal viability by reducing L-glutamic acid-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in HT-22 cells. LSZ exerted antioxidative effects by enhancing superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase expression, reduced Aβ accumulation by inhibiting β-secretase and γ-secretase mRNA expression, and decreased p-Tau level by inhibiting NF-κB-mediated inflammation. It also demonstrated neuroprotective effects by regulating the Fas cell surface death receptor/B-cell lymphoma 2/p53 pathway. Taken together, our study demonstrates the antioxidative stress, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects of LSZ in the AD-like pathological process and suggests it could be a potential medicine for AD treatment.</p>

<p>Alpha-synuclein (α-Syn) is widely distributed and involved in the regulation of the nervous system. The phosphorylation of α-Syn at serine 129 (p<sup>Ser129</sup>α-Syn) is known to be closely associated with α-Synucleinopathies, especially Parkinson's disease (PD). The present study aimed to explore the α-Syn accumulation and its phosphorylation in the enteric nervous system (ENS) in patients without neurodegeneration. Patients who underwent colorectal surgery for either malignant or benign tumors that were not suitable for endoscopic resection (n = 19) were recruited to obtain normal intestinal specimens, which were used to assess α-Syn immunoreactivity patterns using α-Syn and p<sup>Ser129</sup>α-Syn antibodies. Furthermore, the sub-location of α-Syn in neurons was identified by α-Syn/neurofilament double staining. Semi-quantitative counting was used to evaluate the expression of α-Syn and p<sup>Ser129</sup>α-Syn in the ENS. Positive staining of α-Syn was detected in all intestinal layers in patients with non-neurodegenerative diseases. There was no significant correlation between the distribution of α-Syn and age (p = 0.554) or tumor stage (p = 0.751). Positive staining for p<sup>Ser129</sup>α-Syn was only observed in the submucosa and myenteric plexus layers. The accumulation of p<sup>Ser129</sup>α-Syn increased with age. In addition, we found that the degenerative changes of the ENS were related to the degree of tumor malignancy (p = 0.022). The deposits of α-Syn were present in the ENS of patients with non-neurodegenerative disorders; particularly the age-dependent expression of p<sup>Ser129</sup>α-Syn in the submucosa and myenteric plexus. The current findings of α-Syn immunostaining in the ENS under near non-pathological conditions weaken the basis of using α-Syn pathology as a suitable hallmark to diagnose α-Synucleinopathies including PD. However, our data provided unique perspectives to study gastrointestinal dysfunction in non-neurodegenerative disorders. These findings provide new evidence to elucidate the neuropathological characteristics and α-Syn pathology pattern of the ENS in non-neurodegenerative conditions.</p>

<p>Background: Suspected non-Alzheimer disease pathophysiology (SNAP) refers to the subjects who feature negative β-amyloid (Aβ) but positive tau or neurodegeneration biomarkers. It accounts for a quarter of the elderly population and is associated with cognitive decline. However, the underlying pathophysiology is still unclear.</p><p>Methods: We included 111 non-demented subjects, then classified them into three groups using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ 1–42 (A), phosphorylated tau 181 (T), and total tau (N). Specifically, we identified the normal control (NC; subjects with normal biomarkers, A-T-N-), SNAP (subjects with normal amyloid but abnormal tau, A−T+), and predementia Alzheimer’s disease (AD; subjects with abnormal amyloid and tau, A+T+). Then, we used the static amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (sALFF) and dynamic ALFF (dALFF) variance to reflect the intrinsic functional network strength and stability, respectively. Further, we performed a correlation analysis to explore the possible relationship between intrinsic brain activity changes and cognition.</p><p>Results: SNAP showed decreased sALFF in left superior frontal gyrus (SFG) while increased sALFF in left insula as compared to NC. Regarding the dynamic metric, SNAP showed a similarly decreased dALFF in the left SFG and left paracentral lobule as compared to NC. By contrast, when compared to NC, predementia AD showed decreased sALFF in left inferior parietal gyrus (IPG) and right precuneus, while increased sALFF in the left insula, with more widely distributed decreased dALFF variance across the frontal, parietal and occipital lobe. When directly compared to SNAP, predementia AD showed decreased sALFF in left middle occipital gyrus and IPG, while showing decreased dALFF variance in the left temporal pole. Further correlation analysis showed that increased sALFF in the insula had a negative correlation with the general cognition in the SNAP group. Besides, sALFF and dALFF variance in the right precuneus negatively correlated with attention in the predementia AD group.</p><p>Conclusion: SNAP and predementia AD show distinct functional impairment patterns. Specifically, SNAP has functional impairments that are confined to the frontal region, which is usually spared in early-stage AD, while predementia AD exhibits widely distributed functional damage involving the frontal, parietal and occipital cortex.</p>

<p>Body‐brain isomorphism of pig rostrum and cortical rostrum gyrus

</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Physiological studies of the last century mapped a somatosensory cortical gyrus representing the pig’s rostrum. Here we describe the extraordinary correspondence of this gyrus to the rostrum. The pig rostrum is packed with microvibrissae (~470 per hemi‐rostrum) and innervated by a prominent infra‐orbital nerve, containing about 80000 axons. The pig’s rostrum has three major skin‐folds. The nostrils have a rectangular medial wall and a funnel‐like lateral opening, nasal channels run obliquely from lateral (surface) to medial (inside). The rostrum gyrus mimics rostrum geometry in great detail. The putative representation of skin folds coincides with blood sinus and folds of the rostrum gyrus. The putative nostril representation is an oblique sulcus running from lateral (surface) to medial (inside). As observed in rodents, layer 4 is thin in the nostril sulcus. The side of the nostril sulcus representing the medial wall of the nostril is rectangular, whereas the side of the nostril sulcus representing the lateral wall is funnel‐like. Proportions and geometry of the rostrum and the rostrum gyrus are similar, albeit with a collapsed nostril and a larger inter‐individual variability in the gyrus. The pig’s cortical rostrum gyrus receives dense thalamic innervation, has a thin layer 1 and contains roughly 8 million neurons. With all that, the rostrum gyrus looks like a model of the pig rostrum at a scale of ~1:2. Our findings are reminiscent of the raccoon cortex with its forepaw‐like somatosensory forepaw‐representation. Representing highly relevant afferents in three‐dimensional body‐part‐models might facilitate isomorphic cortical computations in large‐brained tactile specialists.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease (CMT) reduces health‐related quality of life (QOL), especially in children. Defining QOL in pediatric CMT can help physicians monitor disease burden clinically and in trials. We identified items pertaining to QOL in children with CMT and conducted validation studies to develop a pediatric CMT‐specific QOL outcome measure (pCMT‐QOL).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Development and validation of the pCMT‐QOL patient‐reported outcome measure was iterative, involving identifying relevant domains, item pool generation, prospective pilot testing and clinical assessments, structured focus‐group interviews, and psychometric testing. Testing was conducted in children with CMT seen at participating sites from the USA, United Kingdom, and Australia.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We conducted systematic literature reviews and analysis of generic QOL measures to identify six domains relevant to QOL in children with CMT. 60 items corresponding to those domains were developed de novo, or identified from literature review and CMT‐specific modification of items from the pediatric Neuro‐QOL measures. The draft version underwent prospective feasibility and face content validity assessments to develop a working version of the pCMT‐QOL measure. From 2010‐2016, the pCMT‐QOL working version was administered to 398 children ages 8‐18 seen at the participating study sites of the Inherited Neuropathies Consortium. The resulting data underwent rigorous psychometric analysis, including factor analysis, test‐retest reliability, internal consistency, convergent validity, IRT analysis, and longitudinal analysis, to develop the final pCMT‐QOL patient‐reported outcome measure.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The pCMT‐QOL patient‐reported outcome measure is a reliable, valid, and sensitive measure of health‐related QOL for children with CMT.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Outcome prognostication unbiased by early care limitations(ECL) is essential for guiding treatment in patients presenting with intracerebral hemorrhage(ICH). This study aims to determine whether the max‐ICH Score provides improved and clinically useful prognostic estimation of functional long‐term outcomes after ICH.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This multicenter validation study compared the max‐ICH Score’s vs the ICH Score’s prognostication regarding diagnostic accuracy (discrimination, calibration) and clinical utility using decision curve analysis. We performed a joint investigation of individual participant data of consecutive spontaneous ICH patients(n=4,677) from two retrospective German‐wide studies(RETRACE I+II; anticoagulation‐associated ICH only) conducted at 22 participating centers, one German prospective single‐center study(UKER‐ICH; non‐anticoagulation‐associated ICH only), and one U.S.‐based prospective longitudinal single‐center study(MGH; both anticoagulation‐ and non‐anticoagulation‐associated ICH), treated between January 2006 and December 2015.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 4,677 included ICH patients, 1,017(21.7%) were affected by ECL[German‐cohort:15.6%(440/2377); MGH:31.0%(577/1283)]. Validation of long‐term functional outcome prognostication by the max‐ICH Score provided good and superior discrimination in patients without ECL compared to the ICH Score[Area under the receiver operating curve(AUROC),German‐cohort:0.81(0.78‐0.83) vs 0.74(0.72‐0.77),p&lt;0.01; MGH:0.85(0.81‐0.89) vs 0.78(0.74‐0.82),p&lt;0.01], and for the entire cohort[AUROC,German‐cohort:0.84(0.82‐0.86) vs 0.80(0.77‐0.82),p&lt;0.01; MGH:0.83(0.81‐0.85) vs 0.77(0.75‐0.79),p&lt;0.01]. Both scores showed no evidence of poor calibration. The clinical utility investigated by decision curve analysis showed at high threshold probabilities(0.8, aiming to avoid false‐positive poor outcome attribution), that the max‐ICH Score provided a clinical net‐benefit compared to the ICH Score(14.1 vs 2.1 net‐predicted poor outcomes per 100 patients).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The max‐ICH score provides valid and improved prognostication of functional outcome after ICH. The associated clinical net‐benefit in minimizing false poor outcome attribution may potentially prevent unwarranted care limitations in patients with ICH.</p>

<p>Here, we provide the first detailed description of spinal afferent nerve endings in the uterus of a vertebrate. This was achieved using an in vivo anterograde tracing technique from thoracolumbar (T13‐L3) dorsal root ganglia in female mice. Our key findings revealed that at least three distinct morphological types of spinal afferent nerve ending can be readily identified throughout multiple layers of the uterine wall; the vast majority of which are peptidergic (immunoreactive to calcitonin gene‐related peptide).

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Major sensory innervation to the uterus is provided by spinal afferent nerves, whose cell bodies lie predominantly in thoracolumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRG). While the origin of the cell bodies of uterine spinal afferents is clear, the identity of their sensory endings has remained unknown. Hence, our major aim was to identify the location, morphology, and calcitonin gene‐related peptide (CGRP)‐immunoreactivity of uterine spinal afferent endings supplied by thoracolumbar DRG. We also sought to determine the degree of uterine afferent innervation provided by the vagus nerve. Using an anterograde tracing technique, nulliparous female C57BL/6 mice were injected unilaterally with biotinylated dextran into thoracolumbar DRG (T13‐L3). After 7–9 days, uterine horns were stained to visualize traced nerve axons and endings immunoreactive to CGRP. Whole uteri from a separate cohort of animals were injected with retrograde neuronal tracer (DiI) and dye uptake in nodose ganglia was examined. Anterogradely labeled axons innervated each uterine horn, these projected rostrally or caudally from their site of entry, branching to form varicose endings in the myometrium and/or vascular plexus. Most spinal afferent endings were CGRP‐immunoreactive and morphologically classified as “simple‐type.” Rarely, uterine nerve cell bodies were labeled in nodose ganglia. Here, we provide the first detailed description of spinal afferent nerve endings in the uterus of a vertebrate. Distinct morphological types of spinal afferent nerve endings were identified throughout multiple anatomical layers of the uterine wall. Compared to other visceral organs, uterine spinal afferent endings displayed noticeably less morphological diversity. Few neurons in nodose ganglia innervate the uterus.</p>
