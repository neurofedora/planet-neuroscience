              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Zcchc12-Containing Nociceptors Are Required for Noxious Heat Sensation</a></h4>

              
                <p>DRG neurons are classified into distinct types to mediate the somatosensation with different modalities. Recently, transcriptional profilings of DRG neurons by single-cell RNA-sequencing have provided new insights into the neuron typing and functional properties. Zinc-finger CCHC domain-containing 12 (<I>Zcchc12</I>) was reported to be the representative marker for a subtype of galanin-positive (<I>Gal</I><sup>+</sup>) DRG neurons. However, the characteristics and functions of <I>Zcchc12</I><sup>+</sup> neurons are largely unknown. Here, we genetically labeled <I>Zcchc12</I><sup>+</sup> neurons in <I>Zcchc12</I>-CreERT2::Ai9 mice, and verified that <I>Zcchc12</I> represented a new subpopulation of DRG neurons in both sexes. <I>Zcchc12</I><sup>+</sup> neurons centrally innervated the superficial laminae in spinal dorsal horn, and peripherally terminated as free nerve endings in the epidermis and cluster-shaped fibers in the dermis of footpads and nearby. In addition, <I>Zcchc12</I><sup>+</sup> neurons also formed circumferential endings surrounding the hair follicles in hairy skin. Functionally, <I>in vivo</I> calcium imaging in DRGs revealed that <I>Zcchc12</I><sup>+</sup> neurons were polymodal nociceptors and could be activated by mechanical and noxious thermal stimuli. Behavioral tests showed that selective ablation of <I>Zcchc12</I><sup>+</sup> DRG neurons reduced the sensitivity to noxious heat in mice. Together, we identified a new subpopulation of <I>Zcchc12</I><sup>+</sup> nociceptors essential for noxious heat sensation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> <I>Zcchc12</I> represents a new subpopulation of DRG neurons. The characteristics and functions of <I>Zcchc12</I><sup>+</sup> neurons are largely unknown.

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Ipsilateral Stimulus Encoding in Primary and Secondary Somatosensory Cortex of Awake Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Lateralization is a hallmark of somatosensory processing in the mammalian brain. However, in addition to their contralateral representation, unilateral tactile stimuli also modulate neuronal activity in somatosensory cortices of the ipsilateral hemisphere. The cellular organization and functional role of these ipsilateral stimulus responses in awake somatosensory cortices, especially regarding stimulus coding, are unknown. Here, we targeted silicon probe recordings to the vibrissa region of primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory cortex of awake head-fixed mice of either sex while delivering ipsilateral and contralateral whisker stimuli. Ipsilateral stimuli drove larger and more reliable responses in S2 than in S1, and activated a larger fraction of stimulus-responsive neurons. Ipsilateral stimulus-responsive neurons were rare in layer 4 of S1, but were located in equal proportion across all layers in S2. Linear classifier analyses further revealed that decoding of the ipsilateral stimulus was more accurate in S2 than S1, whereas S1 decoded contralateral stimuli most accurately. These results reveal substantial encoding of ipsilateral stimuli in S1 and especially S2, consistent with the hypothesis that higher cortical areas may integrate tactile inputs across larger portions of space, spanning both sides of the body.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Tactile information obtained by one side of the body is represented in the activity of neurons of the opposite brain hemisphere. However, unilateral tactile stimulation also modulates neuronal activity in the other, or ipsilateral, brain hemisphere. This ipsilateral activity may play an important role in the representation and processing of tactile information, in particular when the sense of touch involves both sides of the body. Our work in the whisker system of awake mice reveals that neocortical ipsilateral activity, in particular that of deep layer excitatory neurons of secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), contains information about the presence and the velocity of unilateral tactile stimuli, which supports a key role for S2 in integrating tactile information across both body sides.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Differential Contributions of Ventral Striatum Subregions to the Motivational and Hedonic Components of the Affective Processing of Reward</a></h4>

              
                <p>The ventral striatum is implicated in the affective processing of reward, which can be divided into a motivational and a hedonic component. Here, we examined whether these two components rely on distinct neural substrates within the ventral striatum in humans (11 females and 13 males). We used a high-resolution fMRI protocol targeting the ventral striatum combined with a pavlovian-instrumental task and a hedonic reactivity task. Both tasks involved an olfactory reward, thereby allowing us to measure pavlovian-triggered motivation and sensory pleasure for the same reward within the same participants. Our findings show that different subregions of the ventral striatum are dissociable in their contributions to the motivational versus the hedonic component of the affective processing of reward. Parsing the neural mechanisms of the interplay between pavlovian incentive and hedonic processes may have important implications for understanding compulsive reward-seeking behaviors such as addiction, binge eating, or gambling.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Calretinin-Expressing Synapses Show Improved Synaptic Efficacy with Reduced Asynchronous Release during High-Rate Activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Calretinin (CR) is a major calcium binding protein widely expressed in the CNS. However, its synaptic function remains largely elusive. At the auditory synapse of the endbulb of Held, CR is selectively expressed in different subtypes. Combining electrophysiology with immunohistochemistry, we investigated the synaptic transmission at the endbulb of Held synapses with and without endogenous CR expression in mature CBA/CAJ mice of either sex. Two synapse subtypes showed similar basal synaptic transmission, except a larger quantal size in CR-expressing synapses. During high-rate stimulus trains, CR-expressing synapses showed improved synaptic efficacy with significantly less depression and lower asynchronous release, suggesting more efficient exocytosis than non-CR-expressing synapses. Conversely, CR-expressing synapses had a smaller readily releasable pool size, which was countered by higher release probability and faster synaptic recovery to support sustained release during high-rate activity. EGTA-AM treatment did not change the synaptic transmission of CR-expressing synapses, but reduced synaptic depression and decreased asynchronous release at non-CR-expressing synapses, suggesting that CR helps to minimize calcium accumulation during high-rate activity. Both synapses express parvalbumin, another calcium-binding protein with slower kinetics and higher affinity than CR, but not calbindin. Furthermore, CR-expressing synapses only express the fast isoform of vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGluT1), while most non-CR-expressing synapses express both VGluT1 and the slower VGluT2, which may underlie their lagged synaptic recovery. The findings suggest that, paired with associated synaptic machinery, differential CR expression regulates synaptic efficacy among different subtypes of auditory nerve synapses to accomplish distinctive physiological functions in transmitting auditory information at high rates.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> CR is a major calcium-binding protein in the brain. It remains unclear how endogenous CR impacts synaptic transmission. We investigated the question at the large endbulb of Held synapses with selective CR expression and found that CR-expressing and non-CR-expressing synapses had similar release properties under basal synaptic transmission. During high-rate activity, however, CR-expressing synapses showed improved synaptic efficacy with less depression, lower asynchronous release, and faster recovery. Furthermore, CR-expressing synapses use exclusive VGluT1 to refill synaptic vesicles, while non-CR-expressing synapses use both VGluT1 and the slower isoform of VGluT2. Our findings suggest that CR may play significant roles in promoting synaptic efficacy during high-rate activity, and selective CR expression can differentially impact signal processing among different synapses.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Distinct Medial Orbitofrontal-Striatal Circuits Support Dissociable Component Processes of Risk/Reward Decision-Making</a></h4>

              
                <p>The medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) regulates a variety of cognitive functions, including refining action selection involving reward uncertainty. This region sends projections to numerous subcortical targets, including the ventral and dorsal striatum, yet how these corticostriatal circuits differentially regulate risk/reward decision-making is unknown. The present study examined the contribution of mOFC circuits linking the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and dorsomedial striatum (DMS) to risk/reward decision-making using pharmacological disconnections. Male rats were well trained on a probabilistic discounting task involving choice between small/certain or large/risky rewards, with the probability of obtaining the larger reward decreasing or increasing over a session. Disconnection of mOFC-striatal pathways was achieved using infusions of GABA agonists inactivating the mOFC in one hemisphere, combined with NAc or DMS inactivation in the contralateral or ipsilateral hemisphere. Perturbing mOFC -&gt; NAc circuits induced suboptimal, near-random patterns of choice that manifested as a flattening of the discounting curve. Animals were equally likely to stay or shift following rewarded/nonrewarded choices, suggesting this pathway mediates use of information about reward history to stabilize decision biases. In contrast, mOFC -&gt; DMS disconnection impaired adjustments in decision biases, causing opposing changes in risky choice depending on how probabilities varied over time. This was driven by alterations in lose-shift behavior, suggesting mOFC -&gt; DMS circuits track volatility in nonrewarded actions to adjust choice in accordance with changes in profitability. Thus, separate mOFC-striatal projection pathways regulate dissociable processes underlying decision-making, with mOFC -&gt; NAc circuits aiding in establishing and stabilizing tasks states and mOFC -&gt; DMS circuits facilitating transitions across states to promote flexible reward seeking.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The medial orbitofrontal cortex regulates a variety of goal-directed behaviors, yet the functional circuits through which it mediates higher order decision-making functions are unclear. The present study revealed that different mOFC projection pathways facilitate diverse aspects of decision-making involving risks and rewards by engaging separate networks of neurons that interface with distinct ventral and dorsal striatal targets. These findings clarify some of the normal functions of these corticostriatal pathways and may have implications for understanding how dysfunction in these circuits relate to certain psychiatric disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Integrated Amygdala, Orbitofrontal and Hippocampal Contributions to Reward and Loss Coding Revealed with Human Intracranial EEG</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neurophysiological work in primates and rodents have shown the amygdala plays a central role in reward processing through connectivity with the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and hippocampus. However, understanding the role of oscillations in each region and their connectivity in different stages of reward processing in humans has been hampered by limitations with noninvasive methods such as poor spatial and temporal resolution. To overcome these limitations, we recorded local field potentials (LFPs) directly from the amygdala, OFC and hippocampus simultaneously in human male and female epilepsy patients performing a monetary incentive delay (MID) task. This allowed us to dissociate electrophysiological activity and connectivity patterns related to the anticipation and receipt of rewards and losses in real time. Anticipation of reward increased high-frequency gamma (HFG; 60&ndash;250 Hz) activity in the hippocampus and theta band (4&ndash;8 Hz) synchronization between amygdala and OFC, suggesting roles in memory and motivation. During receipt, HFG in the amygdala was involved in outcome value coding, the OFC cue context-specific outcome value comparison and the hippocampus reward coding. Receipt of loss decreased amygdala-hippocampus theta and increased amygdala-OFC HFG amplitude coupling which coincided with subsequent adjustments in behavior. Increased HFG synchronization between the amygdala and hippocampus during reward receipt suggested encoding of reward information into memory for reinstatement during anticipation. These findings extend what is known about the primate brain to humans, showing key spectrotemporal coding and communication dynamics for reward and punishment related processes which could serve as more precise targets for neuromodulation to establish causality and potential therapeutic applications.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dysfunctional reward processing contributes to many psychiatric disorders. Neurophysiological work in primates has shown the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and hippocampus play a synergistic role in reward processing. However, because of limitations with noninvasive imaging, it is unclear whether the same interactions occur in humans and what oscillatory mechanisms underpin them. We addressed this issue by recording local field potentials (LFPs) from all three regions in human epilepsy patients during monetary reward processing. There was increased amygdala-OFC high-frequency coupling when losing money which coincided with subsequent adjustments in behavior. In contrast, increased amygdala-hippocampus high-frequency phase-locking suggested a role in reward memory. The findings highlight amygdala networks for reward and punishment processes that could act as more precise neuromodulation targets to treat psychiatric disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Neural Representations of Emotional Experiences Are More Similar Than Those of Neutral Experiences</a></h4>

              
                <p>Stimuli that evoke the same feelings can nevertheless look different and have different semantic meanings. Although we know much about the neural representation of emotion, the neural underpinnings of emotional similarity are unknown. One possibility is that the same brain regions represent similarity between emotional and neutral stimuli, perhaps with different strengths. Alternatively, emotional similarity could be coded in separate regions, possibly those sensitive to emotional valence and arousal. In behavior, the extent to which people consider similarity along emotional dimensions when they evaluate the overall similarity between stimuli has never been investigated. Although the emotional features of stimuli may dominate explicit ratings of similarity, it is also possible that people neglect emotional dimensions as irrelevant to that judgment. We contrasted these hypotheses in (male and female) healthy controls using two measures of similarity and two picture databases of complex negative and neutral scenes, the second of which provided exquisite control over semantic and visual attributes. The similarity between emotional stimuli was greater than between neutral stimuli in the inferior temporal cortex, the fusiform face area, and the precuneus. Additionally, only the similarity between emotional stimuli was significantly represented in early visual cortex, anterior insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Intriguingly, despite the stronger neural similarity between emotional stimuli, the same participants did not rate them as more similar to each other than neutral stimuli. These results contribute to our understanding of how emotion is represented within a general conceptual workspace and of the overgeneralization bias in anxiety disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We tested differences in similarity between emotional and neutral scenes. Arousal and negative valence did not increase similarity ratings. When conditions were equated on semantic similarity, participants rated emotional stimuli as similar to each other as neutral ones. Despite this equivalence, the similarity among the neural representations of emotional compared with neutral stimuli was higher in regions, which also expressed similarity between neutral stimuli and in unique regions. We report a striking difference between behavioral and neural similarity; strong neural similarity between emotional pictures did not influence similarity judgements in the same participants in the behavioral rating task after the scan. These findings may have an impact on research about the neural representations of emotional categories and the overgeneralization bias in anxiety disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors Expressed by Striatal Interneurons Inhibit Striatal Activity and Control Striatal-Dependent Behaviors</a></h4>

              
                <p>Acetylcholine is an important modulator of striatal activity, and it is vital to controlling striatal-dependent behaviors, including motor and cognitive functions. Despite this significance, the mechanisms determining how acetylcholine impacts striatal signaling are still not fully understood. In particular, little is known about the role of nAChRs expressed by striatal interneurons. In the present study, we used FISH to determine which neuronal types express the most prevalent beta2 nicotinic subunit in the mouse striatum. Our data support a common view that nAChR expression is mostly restricted to striatal interneurons. Surprisingly though, cholinergic interneurons were identified as a population with the highest expression of beta2 nicotinic subunit. To investigate the functional significance of beta2-containing nAChRs in striatal interneurons, we deleted them by injecting the AAV-Cre vector into the striatum of <I>beta2-flox/flox</I> male mice. The deletion led to alterations in several behavioral domains, namely, to an increased anxiety-like behavior, decrease in sociability ratio, deficit in discrimination learning, and increased amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion and c-Fos expression in mice with beta2 deletion. Further colocalization analysis showed that the increased c-Fos expression was present in both medium spiny neurons and presumed striatal interneurons. The present study concludes that, despite being relatively rare, beta2-containing nAChRs are primarily expressed in striatal neurons by cholinergic interneurons and play a significant role in behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A large variety of nAChRs are expressed in the striatum, a brain region that is crucial in the control of behavior. The complexity of receptors with different functions is hindering our understanding of mechanisms through which striatal acetylcholine modulates behavior. We focused on the role of a small population of beta2-containing nAChRs. We identified neuronal types expressing these receptors and determined their impact in the control of explorative behavior, anxiety-like behavior, learning, and sensitivity to stimulants. Additional experiments showed that these alterations were associated with an overall increased activity of striatal neurons. Thus, the small population of nicotinic receptors represents an interesting target for a modulation of response to stimulant drugs and other striatal-based behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Critical Period for Development of Cerebellar-Mediated Autism-Relevant Social Behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>The cerebellum has been increasingly implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with many ASD-linked genes impacting both cerebellar function and development. However, the precise timing and critical periods of when abnormal cerebellar neurodevelopment contributes to ASD-relevant behaviors remains poorly understood. In this study, we identify a critical period for the development of ASD-relevant behaviors in a cerebellar male mouse model of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), by using the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, rapamycin, to pharmacologically inhibit dysregulated downstream signaling. We find independent critical periods during which abnormal ASD-relevant behaviors develop for the two core ASD diagnostic criteria, social impairments and behavioral flexibility, and delineate an anatomic, physiological, and behavioral framework. These findings not only further our understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying the timing of ASD-relevant behaviors but also have the capacity to inform potential therapies to optimize treatment interventions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> No targeted treatments currently exist for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This complex developmental disorder has established links to genetic and circuit aberrations, yet the precise timing and coordination of these underlying mechanisms that contribute to the spectrum of physiological and behavioral abnormalities remains unclear. Cerebellar pathology is consistently seen in ASD individuals; therefore, we sought to identify the specific windows for cerebellar involvement in the development of ASD-relevant behaviors. Using pharmacologic treatment paradigms, we outline distinct critical periods of developmental vulnerability for ASD-relevant social and inflexible behaviors. From this study, we posit a refined window of time during which ASD symptoms develop that will inform therapeutic timing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The ZIP3 Zinc Transporter Is Localized to Mossy Fiber Terminals and Is Required for Kainate-Induced Degeneration of CA3 Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Tight regulation of neuronal Zn<sup>2+</sup> is critical for physiological function. Multiple Zn<sup>2+</sup> transporters are expressed in the brain, yet their spatial distribution and distinct roles are largely unknown. Here, we show developmental regulation of the expression of Zn<sup>2+</sup> transporters ZIP1 and ZIP3 in mouse hippocampal neurons, corresponding to previously described increase in neuronal vesicular Zn<sup>2+</sup> during the first postnatal month. Rates of Zn<sup>2+</sup> uptake in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons, monitored using FluoZin-3 fluorescence, were higher in mature neurons, which express higher levels of ZIP1 and ZIP3. Zn<sup>2+</sup> uptake was attenuated by ~50% following silencing of either ZIP1 or ZIP3. Expression of both ZIP1 and ZIP3 was ubiquitous on somas and most neuronal processes in the cultured neurons. In contrast, we observed distinct localization of the transporters in adult mouse hippocampal brain, with ZIP1 predominantly expressed in the CA3 stratum pyramidale, and ZIP3 primarily localized to the stratum lucidum. Consistent with their localization, silencing of ZIP1 expression <I>in vivo</I> reduced Zn<sup>2+</sup> uptake in CA3 neurons while ZIP3 silencing reduced Zn<sup>2+</sup> influx into dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells in acute hippocampal slices. Strikingly, <I>in vivo</I> silencing of ZIP3, but not ZIP1, protected CA3 neurons from neurodegeneration following kainate-induced seizures. Our results indicate that distinct Zn<sup>2+</sup> transporters control Zn<sup>2+</sup> accumulation and toxicity in different neuronal populations in the hippocampus and suggest that selective regulation of Zn<sup>2+</sup> transporters can prevent seizure induced brain damage.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Zinc plays a major role in neuronal function and its dysregulation is associated with neurodegeneration. Multiple zinc transporters are expressed in neurons, yet little is known on their distinct roles. Here, we show that the plasma membrane ZIP1 and ZIP3 zinc transporters are expressed on distinct neuronal populations in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. We show that ZIP1 mediates zinc influx into postsynaptic cells, while ZIP3 is responsible for zinc re-uptake from this synapse into dentate granule cells. We further show that silencing of ZIP3, but not ZIP1, can rescue the postsynaptic cells from kainate-induced neurodegeneration. This suggests that neuronal zinc toxicity and degeneration can be modulated by regulation of specific zinc transporters function.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Striatal Indirect Pathway Dysfunction Underlies Motor Deficits in a Mouse Model of Paroxysmal Dyskinesia</a></h4>

              
                <p>Abnormal involuntary movements, or dyskinesias, are seen in many neurologic diseases, including disorders where the brain appears grossly normal. This observation suggests that alterations in neural activity or connectivity may underlie dyskinesias. One influential model proposes that involuntary movements are driven by an imbalance in the activity of striatal direct and indirect pathway neurons (dMSNs and iMSNs, respectively). Indeed, in some animal models, there is evidence that dMSN hyperactivity contributes to dyskinesia. Given the many diseases associated with dyskinesia, it is unclear whether these findings generalize to all forms. Here, we used male and female mice in a mouse model of paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD) to assess whether involuntary movements are related to aberrant activity in the striatal direct and indirect pathways. In this model, as in the human disorder PNKD, animals experience dyskinetic attacks in response to caffeine or alcohol. Using optically identified striatal single-unit recordings in freely moving PNKD mice, we found a loss of iMSN firing during dyskinesia bouts. Further, chemogenetic inhibition of iMSNs triggered dyskinetic episodes in PNKD mice. Finally, we found that these decreases in iMSN firing are likely because of aberrant endocannabinoid-mediated suppression of glutamatergic inputs. These data show that striatal iMSN dysfunction contributes to the etiology of dyskinesia in PNKD, and suggest that indirect pathway hypoactivity may be a key mechanism for the generation of involuntary movements in other disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Involuntary movements, or dyskinesias, are part of many inherited and acquired neurologic syndromes. There are few effective treatments, most of which have significant side effects. Better understanding of which cells and patterns of activity cause dyskinetic movements might inform the development of new neuromodulatory treatments. In this study, we used a mouse model of an inherited human form of paroxysmal dyskinesia in combination with cell type-specific tools to monitor and manipulate striatal activity. We were able to narrow in on a specific group of neurons that causes dyskinesia in this model, and found alterations in a well-known form of plasticity in this cell type, endocannabinoid-dependent synaptic LTD. These findings point to new areas for therapeutic development.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Morphology and Dendrite-Specific Synaptic Properties of Midbrain Neurons Shape Multimodal Integration</a></h4>

              
                <p>Multimodal integration facilitates object recognition and response to sensory cues. This depends on spatiotemporal coincidence of sensory information, recruitment of NMDA-type glutamate receptors and inhibitory feedback. Shepherd's crook neurons (SCNs) in the avian optic tectum (TeO) are an ideal model for studying cellular mechanism of multimodal integration. They receive different sensory modalities through spatially segregated dendrites, are important for stimulus selection and have an axon-carrying dendrite (AcD). We performed whole-cell patch-clamp experiments in chicken midbrain slices of both sexes. We emulated visual and auditory input <I>in vitro</I> by stimulating presynaptic afferents electrically. Simultaneous stimulation enhanced responses inversely depending on stimulation amplitude demonstrating the principle of inverse effectiveness. Contribution of NMDA-type glutamate receptors prolonged postsynaptic events for visual inputs only, causing a strong modality-specific difference in synaptic efficacy. We designed a multicompartment model to study the effect of morphological and physiological parameters on multimodal integration by varying the distance between soma and axonal origin and the amount of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) contribution. These parameters changed the preference of the model for one input channel and adjusted the range of input rates at which multimodal enhancement occurred on naturalistic stimulation. Thus, the unique morphology and synaptic features of SCNs shape the integration of input at different dendrites and generates an enhanced multimodal response.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Multimodal integration improves perception and responses to objects. The underlying cellular mechanism depends on a balance between excitation and inhibition, and NMDA-type glutamate receptors that are involved in the multiplicative nature of enhancement following the principle of inverse effectiveness. Based on a detailed analysis of an identified multimodal cell type in the vertebrate midbrain, we studied the influence of cellular morphology and unimodal synaptic properties on multimodal integration. We can show that the combination of cellular morphology and modality-specific synaptic properties including NMDA receptor (NMDAR) contribution is optimal for nonlinear, multimodal enhancement and determines the dynamic response range of the integrating neuron. Our findings mechanistically explain how synaptic properties and cellular morphology of a midbrain neuron contribute to multimodal enhancement.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Metabolite Saccharopine Impairs Neuronal Development by Inhibiting the Neurotrophic Function of Glucose-6-Phosphate Isomerase</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mutations in the <I>Aminoadipate-Semialdehyde Synthase</I> (<I>AASS</I>) gene encoding &alpha;-aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase lead to hyperlysinemia-I, a benign metabolic variant without clinical significance, and hyperlysinemia-II with developmental delay and intellectual disability. Although both forms of hyperlysinemia display biochemical phenotypes of questionable clinical significance, an association between neurologic disorder and a pronounced biochemical abnormality remains a challenging clinical question. Here, we report that Aass mutant male and female mice carrying the R65Q mutation in &alpha;-ketoglutarate reductase (LKR) domain have an elevated cerebral lysine level and a normal brain development, whereas the Aass mutant mice carrying the G489E mutation in saccharopine dehydrogenase (SDH) domain exhibit elevations of both cerebral lysine and saccharopine levels and a smaller brain with defective neuronal development. Mechanistically, the accumulated saccharopine, but not lysine, leads to impaired neuronal development by inhibiting the neurotrophic effect of glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI). While extracellular supplementation of GPI restores defective neuronal development caused by G498E mutation in SDH of Aass. Altogether, our findings not only unravel the requirement for saccharopine degradation in neuronal development, but also provide the mechanistic insights for understanding the neurometabolic disorder of hyperlysinemia-II.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Behavioral Timescale Cooperativity and Competitive Synaptic Interactions Regulate the Induction of Complex Spike Burst-Dependent Long-Term Potentiation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Although Hebbian LTP has an important role in memory formation, the properties of Hebbian LTP cannot fully account for, and in some cases seem incompatible with, fundamental properties of associative learning. Importantly, findings from computational and neurophysiological studies suggest that burst-dependent forms of plasticity, where dendritic spikes and bursts of action potentials provide the postsynaptic depolarization needed for LTP induction, may overcome some of the limitations of conventional Hebbian LTP. Thus, I investigated how excitatory synapses onto CA1 pyramidal cells interact during the induction of complex spike (CS) burst-dependent LTP in hippocampal slices from male mice. Consistent with previous findings, theta-frequency trains of synaptic stimulation induce a Hebbian form of plasticity where postsynaptic CS bursts provide the depolarization needed for NMDAR activation and LTP induction. However, in contrast to conventional Hebbian plasticity, where cooperative LTP induction requires coactivation of synapses on a timescale of tens of milliseconds, cooperative interactions between synapses activated several seconds apart can induce CS burst-dependent LTP. A novel, retroactive form of heterosynaptic plasticity, where activation of one group of synapses triggers LTP induction at other synapses that were active seconds earlier, also contributes to cooperativity in CS burst-dependent LTP. Moreover, competitive synaptic interactions that emerge during prolonged bouts of postsynaptic CS bursting potently regulate CS burst-dependent LTP. Together, the unusual properties of synaptic cooperativity and competition in CS burst-dependent LTP enable Hebbian synapses to operate and interact on behavioral timescales.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> While EPSP-evoked complex spike (CS) bursting induces LTP at excitatory synapses onto hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, the properties of synaptic interactions during the induction of CS burst-dependent LTP have not been investigated. Here I report that interactions between independent synaptic inputs during the induction of CS burst-dependent LTP exhibit a number of novel, computationally relevant properties. Unlike conventional Hebbian LTP, the induction of CS burst-dependent LTP is regulated by proactive and retroactive cooperative interactions between synapses activated several seconds apart. Moreover, activity-dependent, competitive interactions between synapses allow strongly activated synapses to suppress LTP induction at more weakly activated synapses. Thus, CS burst-dependent LTP exhibits a number of the unique properties that overcome significant limitations of standard Hebbian plasticity rules.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">APT1-Mediated Depalmitoylation Regulates Hippocampal Synaptic Plasticity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Palmitoylation may be relevant to the processes of learning and memory, and even disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder and aging-related cognitive decline. However, underlying mechanisms of palmitoylation in these processes remain unclear. Herein, we used acyl-biotin exchange, coimmunoprecipitation and biotinylation assays, and behavioral and electrophysiological methods, to explore whether palmitoylation is required for hippocampal synaptic transmission and fear memory formation, and involved in functional modification of synaptic proteins, such as postsynapse density-95 (PSD-95) and glutamate receptors, and detected if depalmitoylation by specific enzymes has influence on glutamatergic synaptic plasticity. Our results showed that global palmitoylation level, palmitoylation of PSD-95 and glutamate receptors, postsynapse density localization of PSD-95, surface expression of AMPARs, and synaptic strength of cultured hippocampal neurons were all enhanced by TTX pretreatment, and these can be reversed by inhibition of palmitoylation with palmitoyl acyl transferases inhibitors, 2-bromopalmitate and N-(tert-butyl) hydroxylamine hydrochloride. Importantly, we also found that acyl-protein thioesterase 1 (APT1)-mediated depalmitoylation is involved in palmitoylation of PSD-95 and glutamatergic synaptic transmission. Knockdown of APT1, not protein palmitoyl thioesterase 1, with shRNA, or selective inhibition, significantly increased AMPAR-mediated synaptic strength, palmitoylation levels, and synaptic or surface expression of PSD-95 and AMPARs. Results from hippocampal tissues and fear-conditioned rats showed that palmitoylation is required for synaptic strengthening and fear memory formation. These results suggest that palmitoylation and APT1-mediated depalmitoylation have critical effects on the regulation of glutamatergic synaptic plasticity, and it may serve as a potential target for learning and memory-associated disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Fear-related anxiety disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder, are prevalent psychiatric conditions, and fear memory is associated with hyperexcitability in the hippocampal CA1 region. Palmitoylation is involved in learning and memory, but mechanisms coupling palmitoylation with fear memory acquisition remain poorly understood. This study demonstrated that palmitoylation is essential for postsynapse density-95 clustering and hippocampal glutamatergic synaptic transmission, and APT1-mediated depalmitoylation plays critical roles in the regulation of synaptic plasticity. Our study revealed that molecular mechanism about downregulation of APT1 leads to enhancement of AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission, and that palmitoylation cycling is implicated in fear conditioning-induced synaptic strengthening and fear memory formation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">AMIGO1 Promotes Axon Growth and Territory Matching in the Retina</a></h4>

              
                <p>Dendrite and axon arbor sizes are critical to neuronal function and vary widely between different neuron types. The relative dendrite and axon sizes of synaptic partners control signal convergence and divergence in neural circuits. The developmental mechanisms that determine cell-type-specific dendrite and axon size and match synaptic partners' arbor territories remain obscure. Here, we discover that retinal horizontal cells express the leucine-rich repeat domain cell adhesion molecule AMIGO1. Horizontal cells provide pathway-specific feedback to photoreceptors&mdash;horizontal cell axons to rods and horizontal cell dendrites to cones. AMIGO1 selectively expands the size of horizontal cell axons. When <I>Amigo1</I> is deleted in all or individual horizontal cells of either sex, their axon arbors shrink. By contrast, horizontal cell dendrites and synapse formation of horizontal cell axons and dendrites are unaffected by AMIGO1 removal. The dendrites of rod bipolar cells, which do not express AMIGO1, shrink in parallel with horizontal cell axons in <I>Amigo1 knockout</I> (<I>Amigo1 KO</I>) mice. This territory matching maintains the function of the rod bipolar pathway, preserving bipolar cell responses and retinal output signals in <I>Amigo1 KO</I> mice. We previously identified AMIGO2 as a scaling factor that constrains retinal neurite arbors. Our current results identify AMIGO1 as a scaling factor that expands retinal neurite arbors and reveal territory matching as a novel homeostatic mechanism. Territory matching interacts with other homeostatic mechanisms to stabilize the development of the rod bipolar pathway, which mediates vision near the threshold.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neurons send and receive signals through branched axonal and dendritic arbors. The size of these arbors is critical to the function of a neuron. Axons and dendrites grow during development and are stable at maturity. The mechanisms that determine axon and dendrite size are not well understood. Here, we identify a cell surface protein, AMIGO1, that selectively promotes axon growth of horizontal cells, a retinal interneuron. Removal of AMIGO1 reduces the size of horizontal cell axons without affecting the size of their dendrites or the ability of both arbors to form connections. The changes in horizontal cell axons are matched by changes in synaptic partner dendrites to stabilize retinal function. This identifies territory matching as a novel homeostatic plasticity mechanism.</p>

     alt="Identification and characterization of rostral ventromedial medulla neurons synaptically connected to the urinary bladder afferents in female rats with or without neonatal cystitis"/>
<p>Talluri et al identified and characterized rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) neurons that are synaptically linked to the bladder and the colon and studied the effect of early life bladder inflammation on molecular expressions of these neurons. They demonstrated alterations of synaptic connectivity and GABAergic/serotonergic expressions in bladder-related RVM neurons in rats with neonatal cystitis.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The neurons in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) play a major role in pain modulation. We have previously shown that early-life noxious bladder stimuli in rats resulted in an overall spinal GABAergic disinhibition and a long-lasting bladder/colon sensitization when tested in adulthood. However, the neuromolecular alterations within RVM neurons in the pathophysiology of early life bladder inflammation have not been elucidated. In this study, we have identified and characterized RVM neurons that are synaptically linked to the bladder and colon and examined the effect of neonatal bladder inflammation on molecular expressions of these neurons. A transient bladder inflammation was induced by intravesicular instillation of protamine sulfate and zymosan during postnatal days 14 through 16 (P14–16) followed by pseudorabies virus PRV-152 and PRV-614 injections into the bladder and colon, respectively, on postnatal day P60. Tissues were examined 96 h postinoculation for serotonergic, GABAergic, and enkephalinergic expressions using in situ hybridization and/or immunohistochemistry techniques. The results revealed that &gt; 50% of RVM neurons that are synaptically connected to the bladder (i.e., PRV-152+) were GABAergic, 40% enkephalinergic, and about 14% expressing serotonergic marker tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TpH2). Neonatal cystitis resulted in a significant increase in converging neurons in RVM receiving dual synaptic inputs from the bladder and colon. In addition, neonatal cystitis significantly downregulated vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) with a concomitant increase in TpH2 expression in bladder-linked RVM neurons, suggesting an alteration in supraspinal signaling. These alterations of synaptic connectivity and GABAergic/serotonergic expressions in RVM neurons may contribute to bladder pain modulation and cross-organ visceral sensitivity.</p>

     alt="Basal forebrain magnocellular cholinergic systems are damaged in mice following neonatal hypoxia-ischemia"/>
<p>Mouse cholinergic systems: Poor executive function and decreases in memory and learning are seen after neonatal HIE. We examined the cholinergic systems to determine if there is pathology there that could contribute to these functional outcomes. In contrast to normal, after neonatal HI on P10, loss of permanent attrition of ChAT neurons in the MSN, nbM, and striatum is found. ChAT+ neurons are crenated with shorter dystrophic dendrites. Increased and larger lysosomes are also present in the nbM. Within the injured ipsilateral cortex, AChE activity is abnormally increased. We hypothesize that permanent injury to the cholinergic systems after neonatal HI is responsible for these poor neurologic outcomes.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) causes lifelong neurologic disability. Despite the use of therapeutic hypothermia, memory deficits and executive functions remain severely affected. Cholinergic neurotransmission from the basal forebrain to neocortex and hippocampus is central to higher cortical functions. We examined the basal forebrain by light microscopy and reported loss of choline acetyltransferase-positive (ChAT)+ neurons, at postnatal day (P) 40, in the ipsilateral medial septal nucleus (MSN) after neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) in mice. There was no loss of ChAT+ neurons in the ipsilateral nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM) and striatum. Ipsilateral striatal and nbM ChAT+ neurons were abnormal with altered immunoreactivity for ChAT, shrunken and crenated somas, and dysmorphic appearing dendrites. Using confocal images with 3D reconstruction, nbM ChAT+ dendrites in HI mice were shorter than sham (<i>p</i> = .0001). Loss of ChAT+ neurons in the MSN directly correlated with loss of ipsilateral hippocampal area. In the nbM and striatum, percentage of abnormal ChAT+ neurons correlated with loss of ipsilateral cerebral cortical and striatal area, respectively. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity increased in adjacent ipsilateral cerebral cortex and hippocampus and the increase was linearly related to loss of cortical and hippocampal area. Numbers and size of cathepsin D+ lysosomes increased in large neurons in the ipsilateral nbM. After neonatal HI, abnormalities were found throughout the major cholinergic systems in relationship to amount of forebrain area loss. There was also an upregulation of cathepsin D+ particles within the nbM. Cholinergic neuropathology may underlie the permanent dysfunction in learning, memory, and executive function after neonatal brain injury.</p>

<p>The central connections of the pallial nuclei of the adult zebrafish were examined by means of carbocyanine dye tracing, showing specialized afferent and efferent projections and indicating a modular organization for different neural processes.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We studied the connections (connectome) of the adult zebrafish pallium using carbocyanine dye tracing and ancillary anatomical methods. The everted zebrafish pallium (dorsal telencephalic area, D) is composed of several major zones (medial, lateral, dorsal, central, anterior, and posterior) distinguishable by their topography, cytoarchitecture, immunohistochemistry, and genoarchitecture. Our comprehensive study reveals poor interconnectivity between these pallial areas, especially between medial (Dm), lateral/dorsal (Dl, Dd), and posterior (Dp) regions. This suggests that the zebrafish pallium has dedicated modules for different neural processes. Pallial connections with extrapallial regions also show compartmental organization. Major extratelencephalic afferents come from preglomerular nuclei (to Dl, Dd, and Dm), posterior tuberal nucleus (to Dm), and lateral recess nucleus (to Dl). The subpallial (ventral, V) zones dorsal Vv, Vd, and Vs, considered homologues of the striatum, amygdala, and pallidum, are mainly afferent to Dl/Dd and Dp. Regarding the efferent pathways, they also appear characteristic of each pallial region. Rostral Dm projects to the dorsal entopeduncular nucleus. Dp is interconnected with the olfactory bulbs. The central region (Dc) defined here receives mainly projections from Dl–Dd and projects toward the pretectum and optic tectum, connections, which help to delimiting Dc. The connectome of the adult pallium revealed here complements extant studies on the neuroanatomical organization of the brain, and may be useful for neurogenetic studies performed during early stages of development. The connectome of the zebrafish pallium was also compared with the pallial connections reported in other teleosts, a large group showing high pallial diversity.</p>

     alt="Do crocodiles have a zona incerta?"/>
<p>A zona incerta is a feature common to all known mammalian brains but characters to identify it rely mainly on its location and, in particular, its relationship to the thalamic reticular nucleus. In <i>Alligator mississippiensis</i>, the neuronal morphology of the entopeduncular nucleus, a nucleus closely associated with but separate from the thalamic reticular nucleus complex was examined. This neuronal aggregate is suggested to be the crocodilian counterpart of the zona incerta of mammals.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In mammals, the zona incerta is thought to be involved in a number of behaviors: visceral activity, arousal, attention, and posture and locomotion. These diverse and complex features suggested that the zona incerta functions as a global or integrative node. Nevertheless, despite multiple investigations into its anatomy, physiology, and behavior in a variety of mammals, no specific character identifies the zona incerta besides its appearance in fiber-stained material and its relationship to surrounding structures. One such structure is the thalamic reticular nucleus whose caudal pole often contains some intermingled cells of the zona incerta. In crocodilians, the entopeduncular nucleus (ep) abuts the caudal pole of the thalamic reticular nucleus and displays different immunohistochemical properties and soma size when compared with neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus itself. To determine if neurons in the ep differed from those in the thalamic reticular nucleus in <i>Alligator mississippiensis</i>, the ep was investigated using Golgi methodology. The morphology and soma size of neurons in the ep differed from those in the thalamic reticular nucleus and indicated that these two areas are indeed separate neuronal aggregates. Based on these data and the known relationships of the zona incerta to surrounding structures in mammals, the ep of crocodilians is suggested to be the counterpart of the zona incerta of mammals.</p>

<p>In the chick model, Müller glia (MG) readily reprogram into proliferating Müller glia-derived progenitor cells (MGPCs), but neuronal differentiation is limited. Isoforms of Nuclear Factor I (NFI) are cell-intrinsic factors that limit neurogenic potential.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The regenerative potential of Müller glia (MG) is extraordinary in fish, poor in chick and terrible in mammals. In the chick model, MG readily reprogram into proliferating Müller glia-derived progenitor cells (MGPCs), but neuronal differentiation is very limited. The factors that suppress the neurogenic potential of MGPCs in the chick are slowly being revealed. Isoforms of Nuclear Factor I (NFI) are cell-intrinsic factors that limit neurogenic potential; these factors are required for the formation of MG in the developing mouse retina and deletion of these factors reprograms MG into neuron-like cells in mature mouse retina. Accordingly, we sought to characterize the patterns of expression of NFIs in the developing, mature and damaged chick retina. In addition, we characterized patterns of expression of NFIs in the retinas of large mammals, pigs and monkeys. Using a combination of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and immunolabeling, we probed for patterns of expression. In embryonic chick, levels of NFIs are very low in early E5 (embryonic day 5) retinal progenitor cells (RPCs), upregulated in E8 RPCs, further upregulated in differentiating MG at E12 and E15. NFIs are maintained in mature resting MG, microglia and neurons. Levels of NFIs are reduced in activated MG in retinas treated with NMDA and/or insulin+FGF2, and further downregulated in proliferating MGPCs. However, levels of NFIs in MGPCs were significantly higher than those seen in RPCs. Immunolabeling for NFIA and NFIB closely matched patterns of expression revealed in different types of retinal neurons and glia, consistent with findings from scRNA-seq. In addition, we find expression of NFIA and NFIB through progenitors in the circumferential marginal zone at the far periphery of the retina. We find similar patterns of expression for NFIs in scRNA-seq databases for pig and monkey retinas. Patterns of expression of NFIA and NFIB were validated with immunofluorescence in pig and monkey retinas wherein these factors were predominantly detected in MG and a few types of inner retinal neurons. In summary, NFIA and NFIB are prominently expressed in developing chick retina and by mature neurons and glia in the retinas of chicks, pigs and monkeys. Although levels of NFIs are decreased in chick, in MGPCs these levels remain higher than those seen in neurogenic RPCs. We propose that the neurogenic potential of MGPCs in the chick retina is suppressed by NFIs.</p>

     alt="Morphological analysis of the cerebellum and its efferent system in a basal actinopterygian fish, Polypterus senegalus"/>
<p>In the present study, we revealed that the cerebellar efferent neurons in <i>Polypterus senegalus</i> are localized in restricted regions within the granular layer (i.e., mainly in the ventrolateral region of the auricula cerebelli) and have long dendrites extending within the granular layer to reach the clusters of the Purkinje cells (PCs) but not the molecular layer (ML). The morphological feature of these long extending dendrites passing through the granular layer in <i>Polypterus</i> is more similar to those of teleostean eurydendroid cells (EC) than to mammalian cerebellar efferent neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN). These findings suggest that the efferent system of the <i>Polypterus</i> cerebellum has intermediate features between teleosts and amniote vertebrates.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Although all vertebrate cerebella contain granule cells, Purkinje cells, and efferent neurons, the cellular arrangement and neural circuitry are highly diverse. In amniotes, cerebellar efferent neurons form clusters, deep cerebellar nuclei, lie deep in the cerebellum, and receive synaptic inputs from Purkinje cells but not granule cells. However, in the cerebellum of teleosts, the efferent neurons, called eurydendroid cells, lie near the cell bodies of Purkinje cells and receive inputs both from axons of Purkinje cells and granule cell parallel fibers. It is largely unknown how the cerebellar structure evolved in ray-finned fish (actinopterygians). To address this issue, we analyzed the cerebellum of a bichir <i>Polypterus senegalus</i>, one of the most basal actinopterygians. We found that the cell bodies of Purkinje cells are not aligned in a layer; incoming climbing fibers terminate mainly on the basal portion of Purkinje cells, revealing that the <i>Polypterus</i> cerebellum has unique features among vertebrate cerebella. Retrograde labeling and marker analyses of the efferent neurons revealed that their cell bodies lie in restricted granular areas but not as deep cerebellar nuclei in the cerebellar white matter. The efferent neurons have long dendrites like eurydendroid cells, although they do not reach the molecular layer. Our findings suggest that the efferent system of the bichir cerebellum has intermediate features between teleosts and amniote vertebrates, and provides a model to understand the basis generating diversity in actinopterygian cerebella.</p>

<p>Using a combination of genetic reporters, viral tracing, molecular analyses, and electrophysiological profiling, this study elucidates the Neuropsin-expressing Retinal Ganglion Cell (Opn5-RGC) types of the mouse retina. These neurons are spatially nonhomogenous and stratify their dendrites in the outer sublamina of the IPL. Additionally, Opn5-RGCs are high-density, motion and edge-encoding RGC types that project to image-forming and image-stabilizing central targets in the brain. This study diversifies the potential photoreceptive compartments of the mouse eye.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Obtaining a parts list of the sensory components of the retina is vital to understand the effects of light in behavior, health, and disease. Rods, cones, and intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) are the best described photoreceptors in the mammalian retina, but recent functional roles have been proposed for retinal neuropsin (Opn5)—an atypical opsin. However, little is known about the pattern of <i>Opn5</i> expression in the retina. Using cre (<i>Opn5<sup>cre</sup>
</i>) and cre-dependent reporters, we uncover patterns of <i>Opn5</i> expression and find that <i>Opn5</i> is restricted to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). <i>Opn5</i>-RGCs are nonhomogenously distributed through the retina, with greater densities of cells located in the dorsotemporal quadrant. In addition to the local topology of these cells, using cre-dependent AAV viral tracing, we surveyed their central targets and found that they are biased towards image-forming and image-stabilizing regions. Finally, molecular and electrophysiological profiling reveal that <i>Opn5</i>-RGCs comprise previously defined RGC types that respond optimally to edges and object-motion (F-mini-ONs, HD2, HD1, LEDs, ooDSRGCs, etc.). Together, these data describe the second collection of RGCs that express atypical opsins in the mouse, and expand the roles of image-forming cells in retinal physiology and function.</p>

     alt="Ultrastructural analysis of the morphological phenotypes of microglia associated with neuroinflammatory cues"/>
<p>We used a high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image analysis to characterize the ultrastructural morphology of human microglia under neuroinflammatory cues. The C20 human microglia cell line was stimulated by antiinflammatory (IL-4), proinflammatory (TNF-α), and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated cues (Aβ), and the resulting effects on microglia morphology associated with changes in microdomain (higher-order branching of processes and surface topography) were analyzed. The use of SEM enabled the characterization of microglia morphology in resolving fine details about microglia ultrastructure that were previously unappreciated.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Microglia are the primary resident immune cells of the central nervous system that are responsible for the maintenance of brain homeostasis. There is a plethora of evidence to suggest that microglia display distinct phenotypes that are associated with the alteration of cell morphology under varying environmental cues. However, it has not been fully explored how the varying states of microglial activation are linked to the alteration of microglia morphology, especially in the microdomain. The objective of this study was to quantitatively characterize the ultrastructural morphology of human microglia under neuroinflammatory cues. To address this, a human cell line of microglia was stimulated by antiinflammatory (IL-4), proinflammatory (TNF-α), and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated cues (Aβ, Aβ + TNF-α). The resulting effects on microglia morphology associated with changes in microdomain were analyzed using a high-resolution scanning electron microscopy. Our findings demonstrated that microglial activation under proinflammatory and AD-cues were closely linked to changes not only in cell shape but also in cell surface topography and higher-order branching of processes. Furthermore, our results revealed that microglia under proinflammatory cues exhibited unique morphological features involving cell-to-cell contact and the formation of vesicle-like structures. Our study provides insight into the fine details of microglia morphology associated with varying status of microglial activation.</p>

     alt="Morphological and distributional properties of SMI-32 immunoreactive ganglion cells in the rat retina"/>
<p>Using intracellular neurobiotin injections combined with SMI-32 antibody staining, we reveal that SMI-32+ retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are distributed evenly throughout the rat retina. We compared morphological features of SMI-32+ ON cells and OFF cells in the central, middle, and peripheral retinal regions and show that cells in different regions have different characteristics. We classified SMI-32+ RGCs into five clusters based on morphological features and found that a majority of SMI-32+ RGCs belong to alpha-like cells, but a small proportion of them have small somas and small dendritic fields.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>SMI-32 is widely used to identify entire populations of alpha retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), and several SMI-32<sup>+</sup> RGC subsets have been studied thoroughly in rodents. However, due to the thick cover of SMI-32<sup>+</sup> neurofilaments, the morphology of SMI-32<sup>+</sup> RGCs in the central retinal region is obscured and rarely described. Moreover, SMI-32 labels more than one morphological RGC type and the full morphological characteristics and distribution of SMI-32<sup>+</sup> RGCs have yet to be discovered. Here, using intracellular neurobiotin injections combined with SMI-32 antibody staining, we investigated morphological and distributional properties of the entire SMI-32<sup>+</sup> RGCs population in the rat retina. We found that SMI-32<sup>+</sup> RGCs were evenly distributed throughout the rat retina. We compared the morphological features of SMI-32<sup>+</sup> ON and OFF cells in the central, middle, and peripheral retinal regions. We found that SMI-32<sup>+</sup> RGCs in different regions have distinct characteristics, such as the soma area and the dendritic field area, and Sholl analysis of ON cells and OFF cells revealed significant differences between each region. We classified SMI-32<sup>+</sup> RGCs into five clusters based on morphological features and found that a majority of SMI-32<sup>+</sup> RGCs belong to alpha-like cells; however, a small proportion of SMI-32<sup>+</sup> RGCs had small soma and small dendritic fields. Together, we present a full description of the morphology and distribution of SMI-32 immunoreactive RGCs in the rat retina.</p>

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Endothelial cells (ECs) are key players in the development and maintenance of the vascular tree, the establishment of the blood–brain barrier and control of blood flow. Disruption in ECs is an early and active component of vascular pathogenesis. However, our ability to selectively target ECs in the CNS for identification and manipulation is limited. Here, in the mouse retina, a tractable model of the CNS, we utilized a recently developed AAV-BR1 system to identify distinct classes of ECs along the vascular tree using a GFP reporter. We then developed an inducible EC-specific ectopic Connexin 43 (Cx43) expression system using AAV-BR1-CAG-DIO-Cx43-P2A-DsRed2 in combination with a mouse line carrying inducible CreERT2 in ECs. We targeted Cx43 because its loss has been implicated in microvascular impairment in numerous diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and vascular edema. GFP-labeled ECs were numerous, evenly distributed along the vascular tree and their morphology was polarized with respect to the direction of blood flow. After tamoxifen induction, ectopic Cx43 was specifically expressed in ECs. Similarly to endogenous Cx43, ectopic Cx43 was localized at the membrane contacts of ECs and it did not affect tight junction proteins. The ability to enhance gap junctions in ECs provides a precise and potentially powerful tool to treat microcirculation deficits, an early pathology in numerous diseases.</p>

<p>We investigated developmental changes in axonal projections to and from motor cortical regions, RA and AId, that underlie learned vocal behavior in juvenile zebra finches (<i>Taeniopygia guttata</i>). We used tract-tracing techniques to label the projections of LMAN-core to AId and of RA to DLM in juvenile songbirds. The volume and density of terminal label in the LMAN-core→AId projection declined substantially during early stages of sensorimotor learning.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Vocal learning in songbirds is mediated by cortico-basal ganglia circuits that govern diverse functions during different stages of development. We investigated developmental changes in axonal projections to and from motor cortical regions that underlie learned vocal behavior in juvenile zebra finches (<i>Taeniopygia guttata</i>). Neurons in LMAN-core project to RA, a motor cortical region that drives vocal output; these RA-projecting neurons send a transient collateral projection to AId, a region adjacent to RA, during early vocal development. Both RA and AId project to a region of dorsal thalamus (DLM), which forms a feedback pathway to cortico-basal ganglia circuitry. These projections provide pathways conveying efference copy and a means by which information about vocal motor output could be reintegrated into cortico-basal ganglia circuitry, potentially aiding in the refinement of juvenile vocalizations during learning. We used tract-tracing techniques to label the projections of LMAN-core to AId and of RA to DLM in juvenile songbirds. The volume and density of terminal label in the LMAN-core→AId projection declined substantially during early stages of sensorimotor learning. In contrast, the RA→DLM projection showed no developmental change. The retraction of LMAN-core→AId axon collaterals indicates a loss of efference copy to AId and suggests that projections that are present only during early stages of sensorimotor learning mediate unique, temporally restricted processes of goal-directed learning. Conversely, the persistence of the RA→DLM projection may serve to convey motor information forward to the thalamus to facilitate song production during both learning and maintenance of vocalizations.</p>

                <p>by Michael F. Staddon, Edwin M. Munro, Shiladitya Banerjee</p>

The actin cortex is an active adaptive material, embedded with complex regulatory networks that can sense, generate, and transmit mechanical forces. The cortex exhibits a wide range of dynamic behaviours, from generating pulsatory contractions and travelling waves to forming organised structures. Despite the progress in characterising the biochemical and mechanical components of the actin cortex, the emergent dynamics of this mechanochemical system is poorly understood. Here we develop a reaction-diffusion model for the RhoA signalling network, the upstream regulator for actomyosin assembly and contractility, coupled to an active actomyosin gel, to investigate how the interplay between chemical signalling and mechanical forces regulate stresses and patterns in the cortex. We demonstrate that mechanochemical feedback in the cortex acts to destabilise homogeneous states and robustly generate pulsatile contractions. By tuning active stress in the system, we show that the cortex can generate propagating contraction pulses, form network structures, or exhibit topological turbulence.

                <p>by Lei Wang, Jiangguo Zhang, Dali Wang, Chen Song</p>

One of the unique traits of membrane proteins is that a significant fraction of their hydrophobic amino acids is exposed to the hydrophobic core of lipid bilayers rather than being embedded in the protein interior, which is often not explicitly considered in the protein structure and function predictions. Here, we propose a characteristic and predictive quantity, the membrane contact probability (MCP), to describe the likelihood of the amino acids of a given sequence being in direct contact with the acyl chains of lipid molecules. We show that MCP is complementary to solvent accessibility in characterizing the outer surface of membrane proteins, and it can be predicted for any given sequence with a machine learning-based method by utilizing a training dataset extracted from MemProtMD, a database generated from molecular dynamics simulations for the membrane proteins with a known structure. As the first of many potential applications, we demonstrate that MCP can be used to systematically improve the prediction precision of the protein contact maps and structures.

                <p>by Nicolas Franco, Pietro Coletti, Lander Willem, Leonardo Angeli, Adrien Lajot, Steven Abrams, Philippe Beutels, Christel Faes, Niel Hens</p>

Several important aspects related to SARS-CoV-2 transmission are not well known due to a lack of appropriate data. However, mathematical and computational tools can be used to extract part of this information from the available data, like some hidden age-related characteristics. In this paper, we present a method to investigate age-specific differences in transmission parameters related to susceptibility to and infectiousness upon contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection. More specifically, we use panel-based social contact data from diary-based surveys conducted in Belgium combined with the next generation principle to infer the relative incidence and we compare this to real-life incidence data. Comparing these two allows for the estimation of age-specific transmission parameters. Our analysis implies the susceptibility in children to be around half of the susceptibility in adults, and even lower for very young children (preschooler). However, the probability of adults and the elderly to contract the infection is decreasing throughout the vaccination campaign, thereby modifying the picture over time.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Performance of early warning signals for disease re-emergence: A case study on COVID-19 data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniele Proverbio, Françoise Kemp, Stefano Magni, Jorge Gonçalves</p>

Developing measures for rapid and early detection of disease re-emergence is important to perform science-based risk assessment of epidemic threats. In the past few years, several early warning signals (EWS) from complex systems theory have been introduced to detect impending critical transitions and extend the set of indicators. However, it is still debated whether they are generically applicable or potentially sensitive to some dynamical characteristics such as system noise and rates of approach to critical parameter values. Moreover, testing on empirical data has, so far, been limited. Hence, verifying EWS performance remains a challenge. In this study, we tackle this question by analyzing the performance of common EWS, such as increasing variance and autocorrelation, in detecting the emergence of COVID-19 outbreaks in various countries. Our work illustrates that these EWS might be successful in detecting disease emergence when some basic assumptions are satisfied: a slow forcing through the transitions and not-fat-tailed noise. In uncertain cases, we observe that noise properties or commensurable time scales may obscure the expected early warning signals. Overall, our results suggest that EWS can be useful for active monitoring of epidemic dynamics, but that their performance is sensitive to certain features of the underlying dynamics. Our findings thus pave a connection between theoretical and empirical studies, constituting a further step towards the application of EWS indicators for informing public health policies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Addressing the mean-correlation relationship in co-expression analysis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yi Wang, Stephanie C. Hicks, Kasper D. Hansen</p>

Estimates of correlation between pairs of genes in co-expression analysis are commonly used to construct networks among genes using gene expression data. As previously noted, the distribution of such correlations depends on the observed expression level of the involved genes, which we refer to this as a <i>mean-correlation relationship</i> in RNA-seq data, both bulk and single-cell. This dependence introduces an unwanted technical bias in co-expression analysis whereby highly expressed genes are more likely to be highly correlated. Such a relationship is not observed in protein-protein interaction data, suggesting that it is not reflecting biology. Ignoring this bias can lead to missing potentially biologically relevant pairs of genes that are lowly expressed, such as transcription factors. To address this problem, we introduce spatial quantile normalization (SpQN), a method for normalizing local distributions in a correlation matrix. We show that spatial quantile normalization removes the mean-correlation relationship and corrects the expression bias in network reconstruction.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Analysis of localized cAMP perturbations within a tissue reveal the effects of a local, dynamic gap junction state on ERK signaling</a></h4>

              
                <p>by João Pedro Fonseca, Elham Aslankoohi, Andrew H. Ng, Michael Chevalier</p>

Beyond natural stimuli such as growth factors and stresses, the ability to experimentally modulate at will the levels or activity of specific intracellular signaling molecule(s) in specified cells within a tissue can be a powerful tool for uncovering new regulation and tissue behaviors. Here we perturb the levels of cAMP within specific cells of an epithelial monolayer to probe the time-dynamic behavior of cell-cell communication protocols implemented by the cAMP/PKA pathway and its coupling to the ERK pathway. The time-dependent ERK responses we observe in the perturbed cells for spatially uniform cAMP perturbations (all cells) can be very different from those due to spatially localized perturbations (a few cells). Through a combination of pharmacological and genetic perturbations, signal analysis, and computational modeling, we infer how intracellular regulation and regulated cell-cell coupling each impact the intracellular ERK response in single cells. Our approach reveals how a dynamic gap junction state helps sculpt the intracellular ERK response over time in locally perturbed cells.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">TMED2 binding restricts SMO to the ER and Golgi compartments</a></h4>

Hedgehog (HH) signaling is important for embryonic pattering and stem cell differentiation. The G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) Smoothened (SMO) is the key HH signal transducer modulating both transcription-dependent and transcription-independent responses. We show that SMO protects naive mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) from dissociation-induced cell death. We exploited this SMO dependency to perform a genetic screen in haploid ESCs where we identify the Golgi proteins TMED2 and TMED10 as factors for SMO regulation. Super-resolution microscopy shows that SMO is normally retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi compartments, and we demonstrate that TMED2 binds to SMO, preventing localization to the plasma membrane. Mutation of TMED2 allows SMO accumulation at the plasma membrane, recapitulating early events after HH stimulation. We demonstrate the physiologic relevance of this interaction in neural differentiation, where TMED2 functions to repress HH signal strength. Identification of TMED2 as a binder and upstream regulator of SMO opens the way for unraveling the events in the ER–Golgi leading to HH signaling activation.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Greater Diffusion Restriction in White Matter in Preclinical Alzheimer Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The Alzheimer's continuum is biologically defined by beta-amyloid deposition, which at the earliest stages is superimposed upon white matter degeneration in aging. However, the extent to which these co-occurring changes is characterized is relatively underexplored. The goal of this study was to use diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) and biophysical modeling to detect and describe amyloid-related white matter changes in preclinical Alzheimer disease.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cognitively unimpaired participants ages 45 to 85 years completed brain magnetic resonance imaging, amyloid positron emission tomography (florbetapir), neuropsychological testing, and other clinical measures at baseline in a cohort study. We tested whether beta-amyloid-negative (AB−) and -positive (AB+) participants differed on DKI-based conventional (ie, fractional anisotropy [FA], mean diffusivity [MD], mean kurtosis) and modeling (ie, axonal water fraction [AWF], extra-axonal radial diffusivity [<i>D</i>
<sub>e,⊥</sub>]) metrics, and whether these metrics were associated with other biomarkers.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found significantly greater diffusion restriction (higher FA/AWF, lower MD/<i>D</i>
<sub>e,⊥</sub>) in white matter in AB+ than AB− (partial <i>η</i>
<sup>2</sup> =0.08–0.19), more notably in the extra-axonal space within primarily late myelinating tracts. Diffusion metrics predicted amyloid status incrementally over age (area under the curve = 0.84) with modest yet selective associations, where AWF (a marker of axonal density) correlated with speed/executive functions and neurodegeneration, whereas <i>D</i>
<sub>e,⊥</sub> (a marker of gliosis/myelin repair) correlated with amyloid deposition and white matter hyperintensity volume.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results support prior evidence of a nonmonotonic change in diffusion behavior, where an early increase in diffusion restriction is hypothesized to reflect inflammation and myelin repair prior to an ensuing decrease in diffusion restriction, indicating glial and neuronal degeneration.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Decreasing Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Expenditures and Improving Quality at the Health System Level</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to evaluate a multicomponent health system intervention designed to reduce escalating disease-modifying treatment (DMT) expenditures and improve multiple sclerosis (MS) outcomes by increasing use of preferred formulary and highly effective DMTs (HETs).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a trend study of treatment utilization and expenditure outcomes prior to (2009–2011) and during (2012–2018) MS Treatment Optimization Program (MSTOP) implementation in Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) compared to a Kaiser Permanente region of similar size. Annual relapse rates (ARRs) were obtained from KPSC's electronic health records.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Adherence to preferred formulary DMTs increased from 25.4% in 2011 to 72.2% in 2017 following MSTOP implementation in KPSC and 22.1% to 43.8%, respectively, in the comparator. KPSC's annual DMT expenditures in 2018 were less than in 2011 despite an 11.3% increase in DMT-treated members. The decline in average per patient per year of treatment expenditures from a peak of $43.1 K in 2014 to $26.3 K in 2018 in KPSC was greater than the comparator, which peaked at $52.1 K and declined to $40.0 K in 2018. Over the 7 years following initiation of MSTOP, cumulative MS DMT expenditures were $161.6 million less than the comparator. HET use increased to 62.5% of per patient treatment-years versus 32.4% in the comparator. This corresponded to a 69% decline in adjusted ARR (95% confidence interval = 64.1–73.2%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) among DMT-treated patients in KPSC.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>A novel, expert-led health system intervention reduced MS DMT expenditures despite rising prices while simultaneously reducing MS relapse rates. Our focus on health system progress toward meaningful, measurable targets could serve as a model to improve quality and affordability of MS care in other settings. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>As SARS-CoV-2 is known to invade neural cell mitochondria, a plasma system for quantifying central nervous system proteins in living humans was used to investigate neuropathogenic mechanisms of long-COVID-19.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 proteins and mitochondrial proteins (MPs) in enriched plasma neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs) and astrocyte-derived EVs (ADEVs) were quantified in resolved acute COVID-19 without post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), PASC without neuropsychiatric manifestations (NP), PASC with NP and healthy controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>NDEV and ADEV mean levels of SARS-CoV-2 S1 and nucleocapsid (N) proteins were higher in all PASC sub-groups than controls, but only N levels were higher in PASC with than without NP. Exosome marker CD81-normalized NDEV mean levels of subunit 6 of MP respiratory chain complex I and subunit 10 of complex III, and neuroprotective MPs Humanin and mitochondrial open-reading frame of the 12S rRNA-c (MOTS-c) all were decreased significantly in PASC with NP but not in PASC without NP relative to controls. NDEV levels of MPs voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 1 (VDAC1) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1 (NMDAR1) were decreased in PASC without and with NP, whereas those of calcium channel MPs mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), sodium/calcium exchanger (NCLX) and leucine zipper EF-hand containing transmembrane 1 protein (LETM1) were decreased only in PASC with NP. ADEV levels of MCU and NCLX only were increased in PASC without and with NP.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Abnormal NDEV and ADEV levels of SARS-CoV-2 N and S1 protein and MPs correlate with NP and may be biomarkers for long-COVID prognostics and therapeutic trials.</p>

                Bernacchia et al. developed a theory of sequential activity in recurrent circuits that predicted the prevalence of “spurious” sequences in cortical activity that are unrelated to sequences in the inputs and their experience-dependent erasure by Hebbian plasticity. They confirmed these predictions in visual cortical recordings.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cold protection allows local cryotherapy in a clinical-relevant model of traumatic optic neuropathy</a></h4>

              
                Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) is potentially an important therapy for central nervous system (CNS) trauma. However, its clinical application remains controversial, hampered by two major factors: 1) Many of the CNS injury sites, such as the optic nerve (ON), are deeply buried, preventing access for local TH. The alternative is to apply TH systemically, which significantly limits the applicable temperature range. 2) Even with possible access for “local refrigeration”, cold-induced cellular damage offsets the benefit of TH. Here we present a clinically translatable model of traumatic optic neuropathy (TON) by applying clinical trans-nasal endoscopic surgery to goats and non-human primates. This model faithfully recapitulates clinical features of TON such as the injury site (pre-chiasmatic ON), the spatiotemporal pattern of neural degeneration, and the accessibility of local treatments with large operating space. We also developed a computer program to simplify the endoscopic procedure and expand this model to other large animal species. Moreover, applying a cold-protective treatment, inspired by our previous hibernation research, enables us to deliver deep hypothermia (4°C) locally to mitigate inflammation and metabolic stress (indicated by the transcriptomic changes after injury) without cold-induced cellular damage, and confers prominent neuroprotection both structurally and functionally. Intriguingly, neither treatment alone was effective, demonstrating that in situ deep hypothermia combined with cold protection constitutes a breakthrough for TH as a therapy for TON and other CNS traumas.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Testosterone pulses paired with a location induce a place preference to the nest of a monogamous mouse under field conditions</a></h4>

              
                Changing social environments such as the birth of young or aggressive encounters present a need to adjust behavior. Previous research examined how long-term changes in steroid hormones mediate these adjustments. We tested the novel concept that the rewarding effects of transient testosterone pulses (T-pulses) in males after social encounters alters their spatial distribution on a territory. In free-living monogamous California mice (<i>Peromyscus californicus</i>), males administered three T-injections at the nest spent more time at the nest than males treated with placebo injections. This mimics T-induced place preferences in the laboratory. Female mates of T-treated males spent less time at the nest but the pair produced more vocalizations and call types than controls. Traditionally, transient T-changes were thought to have transient behavioral effects. Our work demonstrates that in the wild, when T-pulses occur in a salient context such as a territory, the behavioral effects last days after T-levels return to baseline.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Steroid hormone signaling activates thermal nociception during Drosophila peripheral nervous system development</a></h4>

              
                Sensory neurons enable animals to detect environmental changes and avoid harm. An intriguing open question concerns how the various attributes of sensory neurons arise in development. <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> larvae undergo a behavioral transition by robustly activating a thermal nociceptive escape behavior during the second half of larval development (third instar). The Class IV dendritic arborization (C4da) neurons are multimodal sensors which tile the body wall of <i>Drosophila</i> larvae and detect nociceptive temperature, light, and mechanical force. In contrast to the increase in nociceptive behavior in the third instar, we find that ultraviolet light-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in C4da neurons decreases during the same period of larval development. Loss of ecdysone receptor has previously been shown to reduce nociception in third instar larvae. We find that ligand-dependent activation of ecdysone signaling is sufficient to promote nociceptive responses in second instar larvae and suppress expression of <i>subdued</i> (encoding a TMEM16 channel). Reduction of <i>subdued</i> expression in second instar C4da neurons not only increases thermal nociception but also decreases the response to ultraviolet light. Thus, steroid hormone signaling suppresses <i>subdued</i> expression to facilitate the sensory switch of C4da neurons. This regulation of a developmental sensory switch through steroid hormone regulation of channel expression raises the possibility that ion channel homeostasis is a key target for tuning the development of sensory modalities.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Tropical land use alters functional diversity of soil food webs and leads to monopolization of the detrital energy channel</a></h4>

              
                Agricultural expansion is among the main threats to biodiversity and functions of tropical ecosystems. It has been shown that conversion of rainforest into plantations erodes biodiversity, but further consequences for food-web structure and energetics of belowground communities remains little explored. We used a unique combination of stable isotope analysis and food web energetics to analyze in a comprehensive way consequences of the conversion of rainforest into oil palm and rubber plantations on the structure of and channeling of energy through soil animal food webs in Sumatra, Indonesia. Across the 23 animal groups studied, most of the taxa switched to freshly-fixed plant carbon (low Δ<sup>13</sup>C values) indicating 'fast' energy channeling in plantations as opposed to 'slow' energy channeling through the detrital pathway in rainforests (high Δ<sup>13</sup>C values). These shifts led to changes in isotopic divergence, dispersion, evenness and uniqueness. However, earthworms as major detritivores stayed unchanged in their trophic niche and monopolized the detrital pathway in plantations, resulting in similar energetic metrics across land-use systems. Functional diversity metrics of soil food webs were associated with reduced amount of litter, tree density and species richness in plantations, providing guidelines how to improve the complexity of the structure of and channeling of energy through soil food webs. Our results highlight the strong restructuring of soil food webs with the conversion of rainforest into plantations threatening soil functioning and ecosystem stability in the long term.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Suppression weakens unwanted memories via a sustained reduction of neural reactivation</a></h4>

              
                Aversive events sometimes turn into intrusive memories. However, prior evidence indicates that such memories can be controlled via a mechanism of retrieval suppression. Here, we test the hypothesis that suppression exerts a sustained influence on memories by deteriorating their neural representations. This deterioration, in turn, would hinder their subsequent reactivation and thus impoverish the vividness with which they can be recalled. In an fMRI study, participants repeatedly suppressed memories of aversive scenes. As predicted, this process rendered the memories less vivid. Using a pattern classifier, we observed that suppression diminished the neural reactivation of scene information both globally across the brain and locally in the parahippocampal cortices. Moreover, the decline in vividness was associated with reduced reinstatement of unique memory representations in right parahippocampal cortex. These results support the hypothesis that suppression weakens memories by causing a sustained reduction in the potential to reactivate their neural representations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Behavioral and imaging analysis of Foxg1 heterozygous mice</a></h4>

              
                FOXG1 Syndrome (FS) is a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder that is caused by a heterozygous loss-of-function (LOF) mutation of the  FOXG1  gene, which encodes a transcriptional regulator important for telencephalic brain development. People with FS have marked developmental delays, impaired ambulation, movement disorders, seizures, and behavior abnormalities including autistic features. Current therapeutic approaches are entirely symptomatic, however the ability to rescue phenotypes in mouse models of other genetic neurodevelopmental disorders such as Rett syndrome, Angelman syndrome, and Phelan-McDermid syndrome by postnatal expression of gene products has led to hope that similar approaches could help modify the disease course in other neurodevelopmental disorders such as FS. While FoxG1 protein function plays a critical role in embryonic brain development, the ongoing adult expression of FoxG1 and behavioral phenotypes that present when FoxG1 function is removed postnatally provides support for opportunity for improvement with postnatal treatment. Here we generated a new mouse allele of  Foxg1  that disrupts protein expression and characterized the behavioral and structural brain phenotypes in heterozygous mutant animals. These mutant animals display changes in locomotor behavior, gait, anxiety, social interaction, aggression, and learning and memory compared to littermate controls. Additionally, they have structural brain abnormalities reminiscent of people with FS. This information provides the framework for future studies to evaluate the potential for post-natal expression of FoxG1 to modify the disease course in this severe neurodevelopmental disorder.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inhibiting presynaptic calcium channel mobility in the auditory cortex suppresses synchronized input processing</a></h4>

              
                The emergent coherent population activity from thousands of stochastic neurons in the brain is believed to constitute a key neuronal mechanism for salient processing of external stimuli and its link to internal states like attention and perception. In the sensory cortex, functional cell assemblies are formed by recurrent excitation and inhibitory influences. The stochastic dynamics of each cell involved is largely orchestrated by presynaptic CAV2.1 voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). Cav2.1 VGCCs initiate the release of neurotransmitters from the presynaptic compartment and are therefore able to add variability into synaptic transmission which can be partly explained by their mobile organization around docked vesicles. To investigate the relevance of Cav2.1 channel surface mobility for the input processing in the primary auditory cortex (A1) in vivo, we make use of a new optogenetic system which allows us to acutely cross-link Cav2.1 VGCCs via a photo-cross-linkable cryptochrome mutant, CRY2olig. In order to map neuronal activity across all cortical layers of the A1, we performed laminar current-source density (CSD) recordings with varying auditory stimulus sets in transgenic mice with a citrine tag on the N-terminus of the VGCCs. Clustering VGCCs suppresses overall sensory-evoked population activity, particularly when stimuli lead to a highly synchronized distribution of synaptic inputs. Our findings reveal the importance of membrane dynamics of presynaptic calcium channels for sensory encoding by dynamically adjusting network activity across a wide range of synaptic input strength.

                Since the ancestors of modern humans separated from those of Neandertals, around one hundred amino acid substitutions spread to essentially all modern humans. The biological significance of these changes is largely unknown. Here, we examine all six such amino acid substitutions in the three proteins known to have key roles in kinetochore function and chromosome segregation and to be highly expressed in the stem cells of the developing neocortex. When we introduce these modern human-specific substitutions in the mouse, three substitutions in two of these proteins, KIF18a and KNL1, cause a prolongation of metaphase and a reduction in chromosome segregation errors in apical progenitors of the developing neocortex. Conversely, the ancestral substitutions cause a reduction in metaphase length and an increase in chromosome segregation errors in human brain organoids. Our data also show that, in these aspects, Neandertals were more similar to chimpanzees than to modern humans. Thus, the fidelity of chromosome segregation during neocortex development improved in modern humans after their divergence from Neandertals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Convergent impact of schizophrenia risk genes</a></h4>

              
                Schizophrenia is a highly heritable psychiatric disorder with a complex genetic risk architecture that reflects the additive impact of hundreds of risk variants. While many schizophrenia-associated risk variants are thought to regulate the expression of target genes in a cell-type-specific manner, the mechanisms by which the effect of these myriad variants combine to contribute to risk remain unclear. Here we apply a CRISPR-based approach to evaluate in parallel twelve schizophrenia eGenes (that encompass common variation) in human glutamatergic neurons. Querying the shared neuronal impacts across risk genes uncovers a convergent effect concentrated on pathways of brain development and synaptic signaling. Our analyses reveal shared and divergent downstream effects of these twelve genes, independent of their previously annotated biological roles. General convergence of gene expression increases with increasing polygenicity, while the specificity of convergence increases between functionally similar genes. Convergent networks show brain-region and developmental period-specific enrichments, as well as disorder-specific enrichments for both rare and common variant target genes across schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and intellectual disability. These gene targets are drug-able and potentially represent novel points of therapeutic intervention. Convergent signatures are also resolved in the post-mortem brain. Overall, convergence suggests a model to explain how non-additive interactions arise between risk genes and may explain cross-disorder pleiotropy of genetic risk for psychiatric disorders.

                Parvalbumin-positive (PV) neurons, the main class of inhibitory neurons in the neocortex, play critical roles in maintaining normal brain function and are implicated in a variety of brain disorders. Here we found that their function is modulated in a time- and sleep-dependent manner naturally during the day. We first show that PV-evoked inhibition is stronger by the end of the light (ZT12) compared to the end of dark (ZT0) cycle. In addition, both PV's excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission slowly oscillate but in the opposite directions during the light/dark cycle. Whereas excitatory synapses are predominantly regulated by experience, inhibitory synapses are regulated by sleep. Mechanistically, we found that the daily regulation of PV's inhibitory synapses is mediated by acetylcholine activating M1 receptors. Consistent with our ex vivo findings, we show in vivo that PV's spontaneous activity display clear oscillation, which is opposite to that of the pyramidal neurons. Finally, we demonstrate that the daily changes in PV neural activity negatively correlate with the dLGN-evoked responses in V1, underscoring the physiological significance of PV's daily regulation.

                The isolation of synaptoneurosomes (SNs) represents a useful means to study synaptic events. However, the size and density of synapses varies in different regions of the central nervous system (CNS), and this also depends on the experimental species studied, making it difficult to define a generic protocol for SNs preparation. To characterize synaptic failure in the spinal cord (SC) in the Tg-SOD1/G93A mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we applied a method we originally designed to isolate cortical and hippocampal SNs to SC tissue. Interestingly, we found that the SC SNs were isolated in a different gradient fraction to the cortical/hippocampal SNs. We compared the relative levels of synaptoneurosomal proteins in control (Tg-SOD1) animals, with Tg-SOD1/G93A mice at onset and those that were symptomatic using iTRAQ proteomics. The results obtained suggest that an important regulator of local synaptic translation, MNK1 (MAP kinase interacting serine/threonine kinase 1), might well influence the early stages of ALS.

                Background: Several genetic models that recapitulate neurodegenerative features of Parkinson's disease (PD) exist, which have been largely based on genes discovered in monogenic PD families. However, spontaneous genetic mutations have not been linked to the pathological hallmarks of PD in non-human vertebrates. Objective: To describe the genetic and pathological findings of three yellow crowned parrot (Amazona ochrocepahala) siblings with a severe and rapidly progressive neurological phenotype. Methods: The phenotype of the three parrots included severe ataxia, head tilt, and stargazing, while their parents were phenotypically normal. Tests to identify avian viral infections and brain imaging studies were all negative. Due to their inability to survive independently, they were all euthanized at age 3 months and their brains underwent neuropathological examination and proteosome activity assays. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on the three affected parrots and their parents. Results: The brains of affected parrots exhibited neuronal loss, spongiosis, and Lewy bodies in the neocortex, amygdala, hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray matter, dorsal vagal nucleus, in some cerebellar Purkinje cells, and in the basal ganglia. Proteasome activity was significantly reduced in the affected parrots compared to a control (p<0.05). WGS identified a single homozygous missense mutation (p.V559L) in a highly conserved amino acid residue within the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of the Calcium Dependent Secretion Activator 2 (CADPS2) gene. Mutations in the CADPS2 PH domain may affect -synuclein aggregation, since this is the domain that binds -synuclein selectively to interact with other proteins. Interestingly, CADPS2 expression is regulated by two well-known PD genes, LRRK2 and SNCA. Conclusions: Our data suggest that a homozygous mutation in the CADPS2 gene causes a severe neurodegenerative phenotype with Lewy bodies in parrots. Although CADPS2 variants have not been reported to cause PD in humans, further investigation of the gene in model organisms might provide important insights into the pathophysiology of Lewy body disorders.

                Retinal glial cells; microglia, astrocytes, and Muller glia provide homeostatic support, regulate vascular blood flow, and react to injury by releasing inflammatory cytokines. Glial reactivity has been shown to be relevant for retinal vascular pathology and neuronal death. Non-apoptotic expression of endothelial caspase-9 (EC Casp9) was recently identified as a key mediator of retinal edema, hypoxic-ischemic injury, and neurodegeneration in retinal vein occlusion (RVO). In the current study we aimed to determine the glial responses that are modulated by EC Casp9 as a means to identify relevant neuro-immune mechanisms for the development of retinal edema and neurodegeneration. To this end we used a mouse model of RVO and a tamoxifen inducible EC Casp9 KO mouse line. We show that EC Casp9 leads to an increase in reactive microglia and to macrogliosis in a time-dependent manner. RVO induced an EC Casp9 dependent astroglial caspase-6 and cleavage of GFAP. Cytokine array analysis revealed that RVO increases expression of inflammatory cytokines out of which CX3CL1, IGF-1, IL-4, LIX, IL-1a;, M-CSF, TNF-a;, IL-1B;, IL-10, and VEGF-A, were regulated by EC Casp9. Moreover, we found that EC Casp9 deletion resulted in protection from contrast sensitivity decline one day post-RVO. These results demonstrate that caspase-9 in hypoxic endothelial cells regulates retinal inflammatory signaling in microglia, astrocytes and Muller cells and changes in visual function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">On the Geometry of Interacting Axon Tracts in Relation to Their Functional Properties</a></h4>

              
                It is well known that demyelination associated with multiple sclerosis alters coupling between axons in a diseased nerve tract due to exposure of ion channels. In this work we ask the question whether the presence of electric fields as a coupling mechanism between nerve axons, has any impact on the expected conduction properties of the nerve under focal demyelination. Using an approximate geometry for a bundle of three axons, we allow electric fields generated at a node of Ranvier to influence other nodes of Ranvier on different axons. In order to introduce focal demyelination, we allow a new type of structure, intermediate between a node and an internodal segment. We find that the nerve's conduction profiles are different with and without field-based coupling. This is important because it opens up the possibility for an experimental investigation to study whether field-based coupling predominates over current-based coupling. Fields and currents may also be measured using different methods and so there are implications for bioinstrumentation. From a systems perspective, the study is based on a novel equation which allows electric fields to act as sources of current at axons' nodes of Ranvier, thereby generating new behaviors from the set of coupled partial differential equations that model the electrodynamics of the nerve. In addition to our simulation study of focal demyelination, we present a justification for a certain geometric W-matrix used in our phenomenological 2019 model. We also provide the first simulations of a tract of tortuous axons, showing the impact of tract tortuosity on conduction velocity. The tortuous model is analyzed geometrically to illustrate the mechanism of synchronization. Finally, this same model is shown to be castable as a learning machine - a formulation that has neuroscience implications.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Different astrocyte-to-neuron conversion tracing reporters affect results in mouse striatum under Ptbp1 knockdown</a></h4>

              
                Conversion of astrocytes to neurons (AtN) is a promising potential strategy for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies have reported that shRNA-, CasRx-, or ASO-mediated Ptbp1 suppression could reprogram resident astrocytes to neurons. However, some groups have disputed the data interpretation of the reported AtN conversion events. These controversies surrounding AtN conversion may due to differences in the astrocyte fate-mapping systems they applied from that in the original study, i.e., recombinant mouse strains with astrocyte specific reporter constructs versus AAV-based labeling systems. Here, we applied two AAV-based tracing systems to label astrocytes with either a GFAP-driven tdTomato reporter (AAV-GFAP::tdTomato) or GFAP-driven HA-tagged Cas13X (AAV-GFAP::Cas13X-NLS-HA-sgPtbp1) and found conflicting observations of AtN conversion in mouse striatum. Our findings indicated that inconsistent AtN outcomes may arise from different fate-mapping systems between AAV and transgenic mice, as well as through use of different reporter proteins. Thus, the complexity of astrocyte labeling systems warrants careful attention when drawing conclusions about whether AtN conversion occurs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Novel Adult Cortical Neuron Processing and Screening method illustrates Sex- and Age-dependent effects of pharmaceutical compounds</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative diseases and neurotraumatic injuries are typically age-associated disorders that can reduce neuron survival, neurite outgrowth, and synaptic plasticity leading to loss of cognitive capacity, executive function, and motor control. In pursuit of reducing the loss of said neurological functions, novel compounds are sought that promote neuron viability, neuritogenesis, and/or synaptic plasticity. Current high content in vitro screenings typically use cells that are iPSC-derived, embryonic, or originate from post-natal tissues; however, most patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases and neurotrauma are of middle-age and older. The chasm in maturity between the neurons used in drug screens and those in a target population is a barrier for translational success of in vitro results. It has been historically challenging to culture adult neurons let alone conduct screenings; therefore, age-appropriate drug screenings have previously not been plausible. We have modified Miltenyi protocol to increase neuronal yield, neuron purity, and neural viability at a reduced cost to expand our capacity to screen compounds directly in primary adult neurons. Furthermore, we have developed the first morphology-based screening system using adult cortical neurons. By using primary adult cortical neurons from mice that were 4 to 48 weeks old for screening of a library of pharmaceuticals, we have demonstrated age- and sex-dependent effects on neuritogenesis and neuron survival in vitro. Utilizing age- and sex-appropriate in vitro models to find novel compounds increasing neuron survival and neurite outgrowth, made possible by our modified adult neuron processing method, will greatly increase the relevance of in vitro screening for finding neuroprotective compounds.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The origin of diffuse noxious inhibitory controls</a></h4>

              
                Pain alerts us to actual or potential tissue damage. During acute pain, our central nervous system acts endogenously to modulate pain processing, thus reducing or enhancing pain perception. However, during chronic pain, the balance between inhibitory and facilitatory processes are tipped in favour of pro-pain modulation. Diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC) is a naturally occurring pain inhibitory pathway that projects from the brainstem to the spinal cord to inhibit neuronal activity therein in a manner that is 1) subserved by noradrenaline, and 2) dysfunctional in chronicity. To harness its high therapeutic potential, we aimed to anatomically and functionally define DNIC. Through employing an intersectional opto- and chemogenetic approach to modulate activity in brainstem noradrenergic nuclei, here we show that spinal neuronal firing observed upon DNIC activation during electrophysiological experiments, and animal pain thresholds observed during behavioural experiments, are modulated in a pro-pain manner upon opto-manipulation of A5 spinally projecting noradrenergic neurons, thus evidencing the DNIC origin. Given the plasticity of the functional expression of DNIC in disease, and the success of back and forward translation of paradigms that evoke DNIC in pre-clinical and clinical models, our findings offer an attractive avenue of studies for disease specific analgesic interventions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A comparison of intracranial volume estimation methods and their cross-sectional and longitudinal associations with age</a></h4>

              
                Intracranial volume (ICV) is frequently used in volumetric brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, both as an adjustment factor for head size and as a variable of interest. Associations with age have been reported in both longitudinal and cross-sectional studies, but results have varied, potentially due to differences in ICV estimation methods. Here, we compared five commonly used ICV estimation methods and their cross-sectional and longitudinal associations with age. T1-weighted cross-sectional MRI data was included for 651 healthy individuals recruited through the NORMENT Centre (mean age = 46.1 years, range = 12.0-85.8 years) and 2,410 healthy individuals recruited through the UK Biobank study (UKB, mean age = 63.2 years, range = 47.0-80.3 years), where follow-up data was also available with a mean follow-up interval of 2.3 years. ICV was estimated with FreeSurfer (eTIV and sbTIV), SPM12, CAT12, and FSL. We assessed Pearson correlations, performed Bland-Altman analysis, and tested the explained variance of sex, height, body weight, and age on pairwise differences between ICV estimation methods. We fitted regression models to test linear and non-linear cross-sectional associations between age and ICV. For the UKB dataset, we further assessed longitudinal ICV change using linear mixed-effects (LME) models. We found overall high correlations across ICV estimation method, with the lowest correlations between FSL and eTIV (r=0.87) and between FSL and CAT12 (r=0.89). Widespread proportional bias was found in the Bland-Altman analyses, i.e., agreement between methods varying as a function of head size. Body weight, age, and sex explained the most variance in the differences between ICV estimation methods, indicating possible confounding by these variables for some estimation methods. In the NORMENT dataset, cross-sectional associations with age were found only for FSL and SPM12, indicating a positive association. For the UKB dataset, we observed negative cross-sectional associations with age for all ICV estimation methods. Longitudinal associations with age were found for all ICV estimation methods, with estimated annual percentage change ranging from -0.291 % to -0.416 % across the sampled age range. This convergence of longitudinal results across ICV estimation methods, in the largest dataset to date, offers strong evidence for age-related ICV reductions in mid- to late adulthood.

                Maps of the nervous system that identify individual cells along with their type, subcellular components, and connectivity have the potential to reveal fundamental organizational principles of neural circuits. Volumetric nanometer-resolution imaging of brain tissue provides the raw data needed to build such maps, but inferring all the relevant cellular and subcellular annotation layers is challenging. Here, we present Segmentation-Guided Contrastive Learning of Representations ("SegCLR"), a self-supervised machine learning technique that produces highly informative representations of cells directly from 3d electron microscope imagery and segmentations. When applied to volumes of human and mouse cerebral cortex, SegCLR enabled the classification of cellular subcompartments (axon, dendrite, soma, astrocytic process) with 4,000-fold less labeled data compared to fully supervised approaches. Surprisingly, SegCLR also enabled inference of cell types (neuron vs. glia and subtypes of each) from fragments with lengths as small as 10 micrometers, a task that can be difficult for humans to perform and whose feasibility greatly enhances the utility of imaging portions of brains in which many neuron fragments terminate at a volume boundary. These predictions were further augmented via Gaussian process uncertainty estimation to enable analyses restricted to high confidence subsets of the data.

                Memories are often strengthened by sleep, which can also boost integration and relational learning. This process can be facilitated by a technique called targeted memory reactivation (TMR), which involves re-applying cues that were associated with learned material during wake during subsequent sleep. We tested whether TMR during slow wave sleep increases the solving of inference pairs in a transitive inference task. Because the slow oscillation up-state is thought to be more important for plasticity, we also asked whether stimulation is more beneficial at this phase. Our data show that TMR can boost inference on the most difficult pairs, but only when presented during the down-to-up transition of the slow oscillation. Such stimulation was associated with classifiable replay, whereas stimulation of the up-to-down transition produced no apparent replay and led to below-chance performance. These findings demonstrate that targeted memory replay in sleep can play a role in integration and relational learning.

                Double visual maps in the EphA3 knockin mouse have been used extensively to investigate the mechanisms for the formation of ordered nerve connections. Here, EphA3+ and EphA3- retinal ganglion cells, forming a mosaic, each make a separate map on the superior colliculus. We constructed ordered 2D maps from EphA3 knockin Fourier-based intrinsic imaging data. Over both EphA3+/- and EphA3+/+ genotypes, the extent and location in the visual field of each projection of a double map vary considerably. Aided by computer modelling results, we suggest that all EphA3 knockin maps are examples of a single type, with the amount of EphA3 in EphA3+ retinal cells varying between animals. Previous analysis of the same dataset suggested that EphA3+/- maps represent an unstable transition between single (wild type) and double (EphA3+/+) maps, reflecting a balance between molecular and electrical signalling. In contrast, our analysis highlights the importance of molecular-based cues in establishing the retinotopic map.

                Functional ultrasound imaging has recently joined the neuroimaging realm providing a brain-wide, high spatiotemporal resolution strategy to monitor local and global brain hemodynamic changes. However, analysis is mostly driven by the local signal change, regional average, or single-voxel extraction while rarely considering cerebrovascular specificities including vessel density and arteriovenous pattern. In this paper, we present the digitization and the skeletonization of the rat brain vasculature based on the signal segmentation of the ultrasound image without the need of contrast agent. We have performed cortex-wide extraction and quantification of vessel features including number, length, and vein/artery discrimination. Then, we evaluated our approach in a pathological context of cortical stroke with which we have identified the ischemic core and quantified an average drop of ~50% in detected vessels. This result is encouraging in that it indicates the feasibility of a strategy for the longitudinal follow-up of patient-specific cerebrovascular neuro-pathologies

                Training animals on perceptual decision making tasks is essential to many fields of neuroscience. Current protocols generally use water as a reward in water-deprived animals. This can be challenging since it requires balancing animals' deprivation level with their well-being. Moreover, trial number is limited once they reach satiation. Here, we present electrical stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) as an alternative reward in mice that avoids deprivation entirely while yielding stable motivation for thousands of trials. We conducted a comparison of MFB rewarded and water-deprived animals on two auditory discrimination tasks of increasing difficulty. MFB rewarded mice learnt the hard task faster and with higher overall accuracy levels than their water-deprived counterparts. Moreover, they performed up to 4600 trials within a session without loss of motivation. Importantly, MFB stimulation does not impact the sensory behaviour under study since psychometric parameters and response times are preserved. Finally, in accordance with the lack of deprivation, MFB mice lack signs of metabolic or behavioural stress compared to water-deprived mice (open field, home cage behaviour). Overall, using MFB stimulation as a reward is a highly promising tool for task learning since it enhances task performance whilst avoiding deprivation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sleep spindles favor emotion regulation over memory consolidation of stressors in PTSD</a></h4>

              
                Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a trauma-induced debilitating condition, with symptoms that revolve around a declarative memory of a severe stressor. How does the brain process declarative and emotional information of stressors in PTSD? We evaluated the role of NREM sleep spindles in this process after exposure to laboratory stress, in a cohort of human subjects with different levels of PTSD symptoms. Subjects performed two laboratory visits: 1) a stress visit which involved exposure to negatively-valent images in the morning and 2) a control visit. In both visits subjects had a sleep/nap opportunity in the afternoon monitored via electroencephalography (EEG). In the stress visit, self-reported anxiety confirmed elevated stress immediately after stressor exposure (pre-sleep) that decayed to control levels post-sleep. An image recall session took place in the late afternoon. Overall, NREM2 spindle rates were elevated in the stress visit as compared to the control visit. This increase in NREM2 spindle rates, especially over occipital cortex, was significantly greater in subjects with high vs. low PTSD symptoms. However in high-PTSD subjects, NREM2 spindle rates correlated with poorer recall accuracy of stressor images as compared to lower symptomatic individuals while surprisingly correlating with a greater reduction in anxiety levels across sleep. Thus although NREM2 spindles are known to play a role in declarative memory processes, our findings highlight an important role of NREM sleep in favoring sleep-dependent anxiety regulation over memory consolidation after exposure to stressors in PTSD and shed new light on the function of NREM2 spindles in PTSD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Focal Non-invasive Deep-brain Stimulation with Temporal Interference for the Suppression of Epileptic Biomarkers</a></h4>

              
                Neurostimulation applied from deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes is an effective therapeutic intervention in patients suffering from intractable drug-resistant epilepsy when resective surgery is contraindicated or failed. Inhibitory DBS to suppress seizures and associated epileptogenic biomarkers could be performed with high-frequency stimulation (HFS), typically between 100 - 165Hz, to various deep-seated targets such as for instance the Mesio-temporal lobe (MTL) which leads to changes in brain rhythms, specifically in the hippocampus. The most prominent alterations concern high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), namely increase in ripples, a reduction in pathological Fast Ripples (FRs), and a decrease in pathological interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs). In the current study, we use Temporal Interference stimulation to provide a non-invasive focal DBS (130 Hz) of the MTL, specifically the hippocampus, which increases physiological ripples, and decreases the number of FRs and IEDs in a mouse model of epilepsy. Similarly, we show the inability of 130 Hz transcranial current stimulation (TCS) to achieve similar results. The method could potentially revolutionize how DBS, certainly in epilepsy, is performed, and we therefore further demonstrate the translatability to human subjects via measurements of the TI stimulation vs TCS in human cadavers. Results show the better penetration of TI fields into the human hippocampus as compared with TCS. Finally, we provide evidence of the efficacy of the specific form of Pulse-width Modulated TI (PWM-TI), implemented with square waves, which is used in this study.

                Autoantibodies against leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1) occur in patients with encephalitis who present with frequent focal seizures and a pattern of amnesia consistent with focal hippocampal damage. To investigate whether the cellular and subcellular distribution of LGI1 may explain the localisation of these features, and gain broader insights into LGI1 neurobiology, we analysed the detailed localisation of LGI1, and the diversity of its protein interactome, in mouse brains using recombinant monoclonal LGI1-antibodies derived from encephalitis patients. Combined immunofluorescence and mass spectrometry analyses showed that LGI1 is enriched in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic contact sites, most densely within CA3 regions of the hippocampus. LGI1 is secreted in both neuronal somatodendritic and axonal compartments, and occurs in oligodendrocytic, neuro-oligodendrocytic and astro-microglial protein complexes. Proteomic data support the hypothesis that destabilization of Kv1 / MAGUK complexes by autoantibodies could promote excitability, but did not reveal LGI1 complexes with postsynaptic glutamate receptors. Our results extend our understanding of regional, cellular and subcellular LGI1 expression profiles and reveal novel LGI1-associated complexes, thus providing insights into the complex biology of LGI1 and its relationship to seizures and memory loss.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pain as a Trigger for Epigenetic Modifications in Limbic Circuitry</a></h4>

              
                Chronic pain involves both central and peripheral neuronal plasticity that encompasses changes in the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nociceptors. Within the forebrain, mesocorticolimbic regions associated with emotional regulation have recently been shown to exhibit enduring gene expression changes in models of chronic pain. To better understand how such enduring transcriptional changes might be regulated within brain structures associated with processing of pain or affect, we examined epigenetic modifications associated with active or permissive transcriptional states (histone H3 lysine 4 mono and trimethylation, and histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation) in periaqueductal gray, lateral hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, and ventral tegmental area five weeks after sciatic nerve injury to model chronic pain. For mice in chronic pain, we observed an overall trend for a reduction of these epigenetic markers in periaqueductal gray, lateral hypothalamus, and nucleus accumbens, but not ventral tegmental area. Moreover, we discovered that some epigenetic modifications exhibited changes associated with pain history, while others were associated with individual differences in pain sensitivity. When taken together, these results suggest that chronic pain may lead to a suppression of transcription and gene expression in key limbic brain structures and circuits, which may ultimately result in maladaptive plasticity within these systems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuroimaging within the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network (DIAN): PET and MRI</a></h4>

              
                The Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) Observational Study is an international collaboration studying autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease (ADAD). This rare form of Alzheimer disease (AD) is caused by mutations in the presenilin 1 (PSEN1), presenilin 2 (PSEN2), or amyloid precursor protein (APP) genes. As individuals from these families have a 50% chance of inheriting the familial mutation, this provides researchers with a well-matched cohort of carriers vs non-carriers for case-control studies. An important trait of ADAD is that the age at symptom onset is highly predictable and consistent for each specific mutation, allowing researchers to estimate an individual's point in their disease time course prior to symptom onset. Although ADAD represents only a small proportion (approximately 0.1%) of all AD cases, studying this form of AD allows researchers to investigate preclinical AD and the progression of changes that occur within the brain prior to AD symptom onset. Furthermore, the young age at symptom onset (typically 30-60 years) means age-related comorbidities are much less prevalent than in sporadic AD, thereby allowing AD pathophysiology to be studied independent of these confounds. A major goal of the DIAN Observational Study is to create a global resource for AD researchers. To that end, the current manuscript provides an overview of the DIAN magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) protocols and highlights the key imaging results of this study to date.

                Growing evidence supports functional network alterations in autism spectrum disorder, however much less is known about the neural mechanisms underlying autistic traits in typically developing children. Using resting-state electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, we examined whether functional connectivity could predict autistic trait expression in 127 children aged between 4-12 years. Regression models showed that right anterior theta connectivity was a significant predictor of autistic traits (p = 0.013), with increased connectivity in this region associated with greater autistic trait expression. These results corroborate similar recent findings in adults, extending this observation to a cohort of children spanning early-to-middle childhood. These findings further highlight EEG-derived functional connectivity as a sensitive physiological correlate of autistic trait expression in neurotypical children.

	<p>The present electroencephalography (EEG) study observed how the brain processes visual stimuli (words and shapes) displayed with four different duration times (17 ms, 33 ms, 67 ms, and 100 ms). All stimuli had to be classified into &amp;amp;ldquo;I saw nothing&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;I saw a blur&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;I saw a word,&amp;amp;rdquo; or &amp;amp;ldquo;I saw a shape&amp;amp;rdquo; via distinct button presses while brain potentials were being measured. The neurophysiological correlates of word and shape processing were subsequently analysed and compared for two distinct time points at the occipito-parietal area in both hemispheres (P7 and P8). In a further step, word and shape identification rates were also analysed. Identification rates revealed that participants recognized words and shapes when presented for 17 ms at a rate of only 6% and 7%, which is poor enough to assume an overall lack of conscious recognition. Analysis of EEG data revealed two time points of interest, one at 210 ms and the other at 280 ms post stimulus onset. Brain potentials at the earlier time point reflect modulations in presentation duration with increased amplitudes elicited by longer presentations. At this time point, no differences were seen between words and shapes in both hemispheres. The later time point, though, clearly distinguished between word and shape processing with totally missing amplitudes (i.e., brain activity) in the case of shapes in general in both hemispheres. Crucially, words presented for only 17 ms still elicited an average brain potential amplitude significantly different from the corresponding 17 ms presentations of shapes at this time point at electrode location P7, even though both stimuli categories were basically not seen (i.e., not consciously recognized). This later word-specific brain potential for the shortest presentation duration is interpreted as neurophysiological evidence of subliminal word processing. Strikingly, this difference was not found in the right hemisphere at P8.</p>

	<p>A common approach to cognitive intervention for adults is memory strategy training, but limited work of this type has examined intervention effects in relation to self-regulation (e.g., strategy usage, memory beliefs) and few have established near transfer (training-related performance gain on untrained tasks related to the target task). The present research, Everyday Memory Clinic&amp;amp;mdash;Revised (EMC-R), examined whether relatively brief face-name association training, offering elements focused on self-regulation, can improve name recall, enhance memory self-regulation, and lead to near transfer. Participants were 122 healthy, well-educated middle-aged and older adults (51&amp;amp;ndash;90 years old) randomly assigned to a strategy training program (SO), a comparable program with a theoretical self-regulatory boost (SB), or a waitlist control group. Compared to the waitlist group, both groups of trainees demonstrated higher pretest-posttest improvements in name recall (target task), memory self-efficacy, and effective strategy use, as well as the near transfer of gains to nontrained associative tasks, a rare finding in strategy training research. Furthermore, changes in memory self-efficacy and strategy use fully mediated the effect of training on name recall. This innovative approach for brief memory intervention offers a model for successful training that can be easily disseminated via community centers and lifelong learning programs.</p>

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is a progressive age-related movement disorder caused by dopaminergic neuron loss in the substantia nigra. Diffusion-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies&amp;amp;mdash;namely, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)&amp;amp;mdash;have been performed in the context of PD, either with or without the involvement of sleep disorders (SDs), to deepen our understanding of cerebral microstructural alterations. Analyzing the clinical characteristics and neuroimaging features of SDs in early PD patients is beneficial for early diagnosis and timely invention. In our present study, we enrolled 36 early PD patients (31 patients with SDs and 5 patients without) and 22 healthy controls. Different types of SDs were assessed using the Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder Questionnaire&amp;amp;mdash;Hong Kong, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, International Restless Legs Scale and PD Sleep Scale-2. Brain MRI examinations were carried out in all the participants, and a region-of-interest (ROI) analysis was used to determine the DTI-based fractional anisotropy (FA) values in the substantia nigra (SN), thalamus (Thal) and hypothalamus (HT). The results illustrate that SDs showed a higher prevalence in the early PD patients than in the healthy controls (86.11% vs. 27.27%). Early PD patients with nighttime problems (NPs) had longer courses of PD than those without (5.097 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.925 vs. 2.200 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.095; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), and these patients with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) or restless legs syndrome (RLS) had more advanced Hoehn and Yahr stages (HY stage) than those without (1.522 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.511 and 1.526 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.513, respectively; both p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Compared with the early PD patients without probable rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (pRBD), those with pRBD had longer courses, more advanced HY stages and worse motor and non-motor symptoms of PD (course(years), 3.385 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.895 vs. 5.435 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.160; HY stages, 1.462 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.477 vs. 1.848 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.553; UPDRS, 13.538 &amp;amp;plusmn; 7.333 vs. 21.783 &amp;amp;plusmn; 10.766; UPDRS, 6.538 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.898 vs. 7.957 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.345; all p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). In addition, the different number of SD types in early PD patients was significantly inversely associated with the severity of damage in the SN and HT. All of the early PD patients with various SDs had injuries in the SN, in whom the damage was more pronounced in patients with NP than those without. Moreover, early PD patients with NP, RLS or pRBD had worse degrees of HT damage than those without. The current study demonstrated the pathophysiological features and neuroimaging changes in early PD patients with various types of sleep disorders, which will help in early diagnosis and therapy.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">PLUS: Predicting cancer metastasis potential based on positive and unlabeled learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Junyi Zhou, Xiaoyu Lu, Wennan Chang, Changlin Wan, Xiongbin Lu, Chi Zhang, Sha Cao</p>

Metastatic cancer accounts for over 90% of all cancer deaths, and evaluations of metastasis potential are vital for minimizing the metastasis-associated mortality and achieving optimal clinical decision-making. Computational assessment of metastasis potential based on large-scale transcriptomic cancer data is challenging because metastasis events are not always clinically detectable. The under-diagnosis of metastasis events results in biased classification labels, and classification tools using biased labels may lead to inaccurate estimations of metastasis potential. This issue is further complicated by the unknown metastasis prevalence at the population level, the small number of confirmed metastasis cases, and the high dimensionality of the candidate molecular features. Our proposed algorithm, called Positive and unlabeled Learning from Unbalanced cases and Sparse structures (PLUS), is the first to use a positive and unlabeled learning framework to account for the under-detection of metastasis events in building a classifier. PLUS is specifically tailored for studying metastasis that deals with the unbalanced instance allocation as well as unknown metastasis prevalence, which are not considered by other methods. PLUS achieves superior performance on synthetic datasets compared with other state-of-the-art methods. Application of PLUS to The Cancer Genome Atlas Pan-Cancer gene expression data generated metastasis potential predictions that show good agreement with the clinical follow-up data, in addition to predictive genes that have been validated by independent single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Regulation of sedimentation rate shapes the evolution of multicellularity in a close unicellular relative of animals</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Omaya Dudin, Sébastien Wielgoss, Aaron M. New, Iñaki Ruiz-Trillo</p>

Significant increases in sedimentation rate accompany the evolution of multicellularity. These increases should lead to rapid changes in ecological distribution, thereby affecting the costs and benefits of multicellularity and its likelihood to evolve. However, how genetic and cellular traits control this process, their likelihood of emergence over evolutionary timescales, and the variation in these traits as multicellularity evolves are still poorly understood. Here, using isolates of the ichthyosporean genus <i>Sphaeroforma</i>-close unicellular relatives of animals with brief transient multicellular life stages-we demonstrate that sedimentation rate is a highly variable and evolvable trait affected by at least 2 distinct physical mechanisms. First, we find extensive (>300×) variation in sedimentation rates for different <i>Sphaeroforma</i> species, mainly driven by size and density during the unicellular-to-multicellular life cycle transition. Second, using experimental evolution with sedimentation rate as a focal trait, we readily obtained, for the first time, fast settling and multicellular <i>Sphaeroforma arctica</i> isolates. Quantitative microscopy showed that increased sedimentation rates most often arose by incomplete cellular separation after cell division, leading to clonal “clumping” multicellular variants with increased size and density. Strikingly, density increases also arose by an acceleration of the nuclear doubling time relative to cell size. Similar size- and density-affecting phenotypes were observed in 4 additional species from the <i>Sphaeroforma</i> genus, suggesting that variation in these traits might be widespread in the marine habitat. By resequencing evolved isolates to high genomic coverage, we identified mutations in regulators of cytokinesis, plasma membrane remodeling, and chromatin condensation that may contribute to both clump formation and the increase in the nuclear number-to-volume ratio. Taken together, this study illustrates how extensive cellular control of density and size drive sedimentation rate variation, likely shaping the onset and further evolution of multicellularity.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Transient global ischemia is a leading cause of learning and memory dysfunction and induces a pattern of delayed neuronal death in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus by down-regulating GluR2 mRNA AMPA receptors in this cerebral area. This study sought to investigate the neuroprotective effect of coumestrol against spatial memory impairment induced by global ischemia that leads to neural death by reducing the GluR2 receptors content in the hippocampal CA1 area. Our studies demonstrated that coumestrol administration prevented spatial memory deficits in mice. These findings suggest a cognitive enhancement role of coumestrol against cognitive impairment in ischemic events.</p>

                Network functions of GABA-releasing interneurons undergo profound developmental changes. Kirmse and Zhang outline a conceptual framework describing how the strengthening of synaptic inhibition enables the cortex to progressively disengage from extra-cortical drive. They propose that the transition to interneuron-mediated inhibitory stabilization of recurrent glutamatergic subnetworks is a central principle of corticogenesis.

Mechanistically, PRMT7 loss activates retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptors (RLR) pathway. Genome-wide analysis shows that PRMT7 regulates the IFN pathway, antigen presentation, and chemokine signaling. Thus, inhibiting PRMT7 improves treatment outcomes in melanoma. PRMT7 deficiency in melanoma enhances sensitivity to immune checkpoint therapy.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Pathogen size alters C-type lectin receptor signaling in dendritic cells to influence CD4 Th9 cell differentiation</a></h4>

              
                Oh et al. show that dendritic cells exposed to C. albicans hyphae more strongly induce IL-9-producing T cells compared with cells exposed to yeast. They find that this TH9 response is driven in large part by Dectin-1 sensing microbe size, leading to elevated production of IL-33.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Asthmatic bronchial smooth muscle increases rhinovirus replication within the bronchial epithelium</a></h4>

              
                Esteves et al. report that asthmatic bronchial smooth muscle cells downregulate the PKR antiviral pathway within bronchial epithelium. CCL20 expression is increased in asthmatic bronchial smooth muscle cells. CCL20 inhibits the PKR antiviral pathway and increased rhinovirus replication in bronchial epithelium.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Microbes affect gut epithelial cell composition through immune-dependent regulation of intestinal stem cell differentiation</a></h4>

              
                Liu et al. find that gut microbes impact intestinal stem cell differentiation, thus changing epithelial composition. All microbes stimulate the Imd/Relish pathway (NF-κB), but pathogens additionally generate stress and damage that stimulate the JAK-STAT pathway, leading to accumulation of enteroendocrine cells.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Rif1 and Hmgn3 regulate the conversion of murine trophoblast stem cells</a></h4>

              
                Zhang et al. find that Rif1-null ESCs can contribute to trophectoderm (TE) lineages and functional placenta, mainly via upregulation of key 2-cell embryo (2C)-related genes including Hmgn3. Overexpression of Hmgn3 also promotes the conversion of trophoblast stem cells (TSCs). These findings identify two crucial modules for TE specification.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Genome-wide analysis of haploinsufficiency in human embryonic stem cells</a></h4>

              
                Sarel-Gallily et al. establish a heterozygous genome-wide loss-of-function CRISPR library for studying haploinsufficiency in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and discover over 600 essential haploinsufficiency genes, which are relatively conserved, intolerant to mutations, and enriched in several pathways, including WNT and TGF-β. This unique library elucidates dosage-dependent effects in hESCs.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Selenoprotein P-mediated reductive stress impairs cold-induced thermogenesis in brown fat</a></h4>

              
                ROS-mediated sulfenylation is essential for the activation of UCP1 in brown adipose tissue (BAT). Selenoprotein P (SeP) is the diabetes-associated hepatokine. Oo et al. reveal that local and circulating SeP impairs UCP1 sulfenylation and thermogenesis via reductive stress in BAT and may be a therapeutic target against obesity and diabetes.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Temporally distinct regulatory pathways coordinate thermo-responsive storage organ formation in potato</a></h4>

              
                Park et al. show that transcript levels of FT homolog StSP6A are suppressed by different regulatory pathways at the early and late stages to inhibit tuber formation under high-temperature conditions in potato. This study reveals that potato has temporally distinct molecular mechanisms that finely control tuberization at high temperatures.
