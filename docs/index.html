              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03263">FAPEX: Fractional Amplitude-Phase Expressor for Robust Cross-Subject Seizure Prediction</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.03263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise, generalizable subject-agnostic seizure prediction (SASP) remains a fundamental challenge due to the intrinsic complexity and significant spectral variability of electrophysiological signals across individuals and recording modalities. We propose FAPEX, a novel architecture that introduces a learnable fractional neural frame operator (FrNFO) for adaptive time-frequency decomposition. Unlike conventional models that exhibit spectral bias toward low frequencies, our FrNFO employs fractional-order convolutions to capture both high and low-frequency dynamics, achieving approximately 10% improvement in F1-score and sensitivity over state-of-the-art baselines. The FrNFO enables the extraction of instantaneous phase and amplitude representations that are particularly informative for preictal biomarker discovery and enhance out-of-distribution generalization. FAPEX further integrates structural state-space modeling and channelwise attention, allowing it to handle heterogeneous electrode montages. Evaluated across 12 benchmarks spanning species (human, rat, dog, macaque) and modalities (Scalp-EEG, SEEG, ECoG, LFP), FAPEX consistently outperforms 23 supervised and 10 self-supervised baselines under nested cross-validation, with gains of up to 15% in sensitivity on complex cross-domain scenarios. It further demonstrates superior performance in several external validation cohorts. To our knowledge, these establish FAPEX as the first epilepsy model to show consistent superiority in SASP, offering a promising solution for discovering epileptic biomarker evidence supporting the existence of a distinct and identifiable preictal state and clinical translation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03502">Emergent tuning heterogeneity in cortical circuits is sensitive to cellular neuronal dynamics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.03502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cortical circuits exhibit high levels of response diversity, even across apparently uniform neuronal populations. While emerging data-driven approaches exploit this heterogeneity to infer effective models of cortical circuit computation (e.g. Genkin et al. Nature 2025), the power of response diversity to enable inference of mechanistic circuit models is largely unexplored. Within the landscape of cortical circuit models, spiking neuron networks in the balanced state naturally exhibit high levels of response and tuning diversity emerging from their internal dynamics. A statistical theory for this emergent tuning heterogeneity, however, has only been formulated for binary spin models (Vreeswijk & Sompolinsky, 2005). Here we present a formulation of feature-tuned balanced state networks that allows for arbitrary and diverse dynamics of postsynaptic currents and variable levels of heterogeneity in cellular excitability but nevertheless is analytically exactly tractable with respect to the emergent tuning curve heterogeneity. Using this framework, we present a case study demonstrating that, for a wide range of parameters even the population mean response is non-universal and sensitive to mechanistic circuit details. As our theory enables exactly and analytically obtaining the likelihood-function of tuning heterogeneity given circuit parameters, we argue that it forms a powerful and rigorous basis for neural circuit inference.

                arXiv:2511.03503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent evidence suggests that beta-band activity plays a key role in decision-making. Here we review our recent work in humans and non-human primates showing that beta-band frequency shifts in frontal cortex signal categorical decision outcomes. We revisit our previous proposal suggesting that content-specific beta reflects the flexible recruiting of transient neural ensembles and update it to emphasize frequency as the relevant parameter. We argue that beta frequency shifts arise from changes in connectivity between weakly coupled oscillators and that, more than a spectral fingerprint, they reflect an active mechanism to (re)-activate behaviorally relevant communication channels in the brain.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03643">Explaining Human Choice Probabilities with Simple Vector Representations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.03643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When people pursue rewards in stochastic environments, they often match their choice frequencies to the observed target frequencies, even when this policy is demonstrably sub-optimal. We used a ``hide and seek'' task to evaluate this behavior under conditions where pursuit (seeking) could be toggled to avoidance (hiding), while leaving the probability distribution fixed, or varying complexity by changing the number of possible choices. We developed a model for participant choice built from choice frequency histograms treated as vectors. We posited the existence of a probability antimatching strategy for avoidance (hiding) rounds, and formalized this as a vector reflection of probability matching. We found that only two basis policies: matching/antimatching and maximizing/minimizing were sufficient to account for participant choices across a range of room numbers and opponent probability distributions. This schema requires only that people have the ability to remember the relative frequency of the different outcomes. With this knowledge simple operations can construct the maximizing and minimizing policies as well as matching and antimatching strategies. A mixture of these two policies captures human choice patterns in a stochastic environment.

                arXiv:2511.03671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate and quantify the basin geometry and extreme final state uncertainty of two identical electrically asymmetrically coupled Chialvo neurons. The system's diverse behaviors are presented, along with the mathematical reasoning behind its chaotic and nonchaotic dynamics as determined by the structure of the coupled equations. The system is found to be multistable with two qualitatively different attractors. Although each neuron is individually nonchaotic, the chaotic basin takes up the vast majority of the coupled system's state space, but the nonchaotic basin stretches to infinity due to chance synchronization. The boundary between the basins is found to be fractal, leading to extreme final state sensitivity. This uncertainty and its potential effect on the synchronization of biological neurons may have significant implications for understanding human behavior and neurological disease.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06286">A 7T fMRI dataset of synthetic images for out-of-distribution modeling of vision</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.06286v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale visual neural datasets such as the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) are boosting computational neuroscience research by enabling models of the brain with performances beyond what was possible just a decade ago. However, because the stimuli of these datasets typically live within a common naturalistic visual distribution, they do not allow for strict out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization tests which are crucial for the development of more robust models. Here, we address this limitation by releasing NSD-synthetic, a dataset consisting of 7T fMRI responses from the same eight NSD participants for 284 synthetic images. We show that NSD-synthetic's fMRI responses reliably encode stimulus-related information and are OOD with respect to NSD. Furthermore, we provide a proof of principle that OOD generalization tests on NSD-synthetic reveal differences between models of the brain that are not detected with the original NSD data; we demonstrate that the degree of OOD (quantified as the distance between a set of responses and the training data used for modeling) is predictive of the magnitude of model failures; and we show that less strict OOD generalization tests can can be usefully applied even within the domain of naturalistic stimuli. These results showcase how NSD-synthetic enables OOD generalization tests that facilitate the development of more robust models of visual processing and the formulation of more accurate theories of human vision.

                arXiv:2509.00730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the neural correlates of consciousness remains a central challenge in neuroscience. In this study, we investigate the relationship between consciousness and neural responsiveness by analyzing intracranial ECoG recordings from non-human primates across three distinct states: wakefulness, anesthesia, and recovery. Using a nonequilibrium recurrent neural network (RNN) model, we fit state-dependent cortical dynamics to extract the neural response function as a dynamics complexity indicator. Our findings demonstrate that the amplitude of the neural response function serves as a robust dynamical indicator of conscious state, consistent with the role of a linear response function in statistical physics. Notably, this aligns with our previous theoretical results showing that the response function in RNNs peaks near the transition between ordered and chaotic regimes -- highlighting criticality as a potential principle for sustaining flexible and responsive cortical dynamics. Empirically, we find that during wakefulness, neural responsiveness is strong, widely distributed, and consistent with rich nonequilibrium fluctuations. Under anesthesia, response amplitudes are significantly suppressed, and the network dynamics become more chaotic, indicating a loss of dynamical sensitivity. During recovery, the neural response function is elevated, supporting the gradual re-establishment of flexible and responsive activity that parallels the restoration of conscious processing. Our work suggests that a robust, brain-state-dependent neural response function may be a necessary dynamical condition for consciousness, providing a principled framework for quantifying levels of consciousness in terms of nonequilibrium responsiveness in the brain.

                arXiv:2511.02766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gut microbiota has emerged as a fundamental regulator of sleep physiology, influencing neural, endocrine, and immune pathways through the gut-microbiota-brain axis (GMBA). This bidirectional communication system modulates neurotransmitter production, circadian rhythms, and metabolic homeostasis, while disruptions in microbial composition have been linked to sleep disorders, neuroinflammation, and systemic immune dysfunction. Recent findings suggest that gut dysbiosis contributes to sleep disturbances by altering serotonin, GABA, and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolism, with implications for neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic syndromes, and mood disorders. Additionally, the gut microbiota interacts with the endocrine and immune systems, shaping inflammatory responses and stress adaptation mechanisms. This review explores the intricate connections between sleep and the gut microbiota, integrating emerging research on microbiota-targeted therapies, such as probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and chrononutrition, as potential interventions to restore sleep homeostasis and improve health outcomes

Abstract: Many networks in nature and applications have an approximate low-rank structure in the sense that their connectivity structure is dominated by a few dimensions. It is natural to expect that dynamics on such networks would also be low-dimensional. Indeed, theoretical results show that low-rank networks produce low-dimensional dynamics whenever the network is isolated from external perturbations or input. However, networks in nature are rarely isolated. Here, we study the dimensionality of dynamics in recurrent networks with low-dimensional structure driven by high-dimensional inputs or perturbations. We find that dynamics in such networks can be high- or low-dimensional and we derive precise conditions on the network structure under which dynamics are high-dimensional. In many low-rank networks, dynamics are suppressed in directions aligned with the network's low-rank structure, a phenomenon we term ``low-rank suppression.'' We show that several low-rank network structures arising in nature satisfy the conditions for generating high-dimensional dynamics and low-rank suppression. Our results clarify important, but counterintuitive relationships between a recurrent network's connectivity structure and the structure of the dynamics it generates.

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial neural networks for machine learning, and language modeling in particular, have established a family of recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures that, unlike conventional RNNs with vector-form hidden states, use two-dimensional (2D) matrix-form hidden states. Such 2D-state RNNs, known as Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs), can be interpreted as a neural network whose synaptic weights (called fast weights) dynamically change over time as a function of input observations, and serve as short-term memory storage; corresponding synaptic weight modifications are controlled or programmed by another network (the programmer) whose parameters are trained (e.g., by gradient descent). In this Primer, we review the technical foundations of FWPs, their computational characteristics, and their connections to transformers and state space models. We also discuss connections between FWPs and models of synaptic plasticity in the brain, suggesting a convergence of natural and artificial intelligence.

                arXiv:2511.01885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) advances toward superhuman capabilities, aligning these systems with human values becomes increasingly critical. Current alignment strategies rely largely on externally specified constraints that may prove insufficient against future super-intelligent AI capable of circumventing top-down controls.
  This research investigates whether artificial neural networks (ANNs) can develop patterns analogous to biological mirror neurons cells that activate both when performing and observing actions, and how such patterns might contribute to intrinsic alignment in AI. Mirror neurons play a crucial role in empathy, imitation, and social cognition in humans. The study therefore asks: (1) Can simple ANNs develop mirror-neuron patterns? and (2) How might these patterns contribute to ethical and cooperative decision-making in AI systems?
  Using a novel Frog and Toad game framework designed to promote cooperative behaviors, we identify conditions under which mirror-neuron patterns emerge, evaluate their influence on action circuits, introduce the Checkpoint Mirror Neuron Index (CMNI) to quantify activation strength and consistency, and propose a theoretical framework for further study.
  Our findings indicate that appropriately scaled model capacities and self/other coupling foster shared neural representations in ANNs similar to biological mirror neurons. These empathy-like circuits support cooperative behavior and suggest that intrinsic motivations modeled through mirror-neuron dynamics could complement existing alignment techniques by embedding empathy-like mechanisms directly within AI architectures.

Abstract: Objective. Personalized transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) has gained growing attention due to the substantial inter-individual variability in brain anatomy and physiology. While previous reviews have discussed the physiological mechanisms and clinical applications of tES, there remains a critical gap in up-to-date syntheses focused on the computational modeling frameworks that enable individualized stimulation optimization. Approach. This review presents a comprehensive overview of recent advances in computational techniques supporting personalized tES. We systematically examine developments in forward modeling for simulating individualized electric fields, as well as inverse modeling approaches for optimizing stimulation parameters. We critically evaluate progress in head modeling pipelines, optimization algorithms, and the integration of multimodal brain data. Main results. Recent advances have substantially accelerated the construction of subject-specific head conductor models and expanded the landscape of optimization methods, including multi-objective optimization and brain network-informed optimization. These advances allow for dynamic and individualized stimulation planning, moving beyond empirical trial-and-error approaches.Significance. By integrating the latest developments in computational modeling for personalized tES, this review highlights current challenges, emerging opportunities, and future directions for achieving precision neuromodulation in both research and clinical contexts.

Abstract: AlphaEvolve is a generic evolutionary coding agent that combines the generative capabilities of LLMs with automated evaluation in an iterative evolutionary framework that proposes, tests, and refines algorithmic solutions to challenging scientific and practical problems. In this paper we showcase AlphaEvolve as a tool for autonomously discovering novel mathematical constructions and advancing our understanding of long-standing open problems.
  To demonstrate its breadth, we considered a list of 67 problems spanning mathematical analysis, combinatorics, geometry, and number theory. The system rediscovered the best known solutions in most of the cases and discovered improved solutions in several. In some instances, AlphaEvolve is also able to generalize results for a finite number of input values into a formula valid for all input values. Furthermore, we are able to combine this methodology with Deep Think and AlphaProof in a broader framework where the additional proof-assistants and reasoning systems provide automated proof generation and further mathematical insights.
  These results demonstrate that large language model-guided evolutionary search can autonomously discover mathematical constructions that complement human intuition, at times matching or even improving the best known results, highlighting the potential for significant new ways of interaction between mathematicians and AI systems. We present AlphaEvolve as a powerful new tool for mathematical discovery, capable of exploring vast search spaces to solve complex optimization problems at scale, often with significantly reduced requirements on preparation and computation time.

                arXiv:2511.02877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting chaotic time series requires models that can capture the intrinsic geometry of the underlying attractor while remaining computationally efficient. We introduce a novel reservoir computing (RC) framework that integrates time-delay embedding with Random Fourier Feature (RFF) mappings to construct a dynamical reservoir without the need for traditional recurrent architectures. Unlike standard RC, which relies on high-dimensional recurrent connectivity, the proposed RFF-RC explicitly approximates nonlinear kernel transformations that uncover latent dynamical relations in the reconstructed phase space. This hybrid formulation offers two key advantages: (i) it provides a principled way to approximate complex nonlinear interactions among delayed coordinates, thereby enriching the effective dynamical representation of the reservoir, and (ii) it reduces reliance on manual reservoir hyperparameters such as spectral radius and leaking rate. We evaluate the framework on canonical chaotic systems-the Mackey-Glass equation, the Lorenz system, and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. This novel formulation demonstrates that RFF-RC not only achieves superior prediction accuracy but also yields robust attractor reconstructions and long-horizon forecasts. These results show that the combination of delay embedding and RFF-based reservoirs reveals new dynamical structure by embedding the system in an enriched feature space, providing a computationally efficient and interpretable approach to modeling chaotic dynamics.

                arXiv:2511.02897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different bitstring representations can yield varying computational performance. This work compares three bitstring implementations in C++: std::bitset, boost::dynamic_bitset, and a custom direct implementation. Their performance is benchmarked in the context of concatenation within a Linear Genetic Programming system. Benchmarks were conducted on three platforms (macOS, Linux, and Windows MSYS2) to assess platform specific performance variations. The results show that the custom direct implementation delivers the fastest performance on Linux and Windows, while std::bitset performs best on macOS. Although consistently slower, boost::dynamic_bitset remains a viable and flexible option. These findings highlight the influence of compiler optimisations and system architecture on performance, providing practical guidance for selecting the optimal method based on platform and application requirements.

                arXiv:2511.02957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pavement infrastructure monitoring is challenged by complex spatial dependencies, changing environmental conditions, and non-linear deterioration across road networks. Traditional Pavement Management Systems (PMS) remain largely reactive, lacking real-time intelligence for failure prevention and optimal maintenance planning. To address this, we propose a unified Digital Twin (DT) and Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for scalable, data-driven pavement health monitoring and predictive maintenance. Pavement segments and spatial relations are modeled as graph nodes and edges, while real-time UAV, sensor, and LiDAR data stream into the DT. The inductive GNN learns deterioration patterns from graph-structured inputs to forecast distress and enable proactive interventions. Trained on a real-world-inspired dataset with segment attributes and dynamic connectivity, our model achieves an R2 of 0.3798, outperforming baseline regressors and effectively capturing non-linear degradation. We also develop an interactive dashboard and reinforcement learning module for simulation, visualization, and adaptive maintenance planning. This DT-GNN integration enhances forecasting precision and establishes a closed feedback loop for continuous improvement, positioning the approach as a foundation for proactive, intelligent, and sustainable pavement management, with future extensions toward real-world deployment, multi-agent coordination, and smart-city integration.

Abstract: The Self-Optimization (SO) model can be considered as the third operational mode of the classical Hopfield Network, leveraging the power of associative memory to enhance optimization performance. Moreover, it has been argued to express characteristics of minimal agency, which renders it useful for the study of artificial life. In this article, we draw attention to another facet of the SO model: its capacity for creativity. Drawing on creativity studies, we argue that the model satisfies the necessary and sufficient conditions of a creative process. Moreover, we show that learning is needed to find creative outcomes above chance probability. Furthermore, we demonstrate that modifying the learning parameters in the SO model gives rise to four different regimes that can account for both creative products and inconclusive outcomes, thus providing a framework for studying and understanding the emergence of creative behaviors in artificial systems that learn.

                arXiv:2510.21908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models display in-context learning as an emergent effect of scale, but they rely on static weights during inference. In contrast, biological systems continually adapt via synaptic plasticity. We investigate whether explicit, biologically inspired plasticity can endow Transformers with faster in-sequence adaptation. To this end, we augment decoder-only Transformers with fast-weight modules updated either by (i) a neuromodulated Hebbian rule or (ii) the gradient-based plasticity mechanism of Duan et al. (2023). Across copying, regression, and few-shot classification tasks (CIFAR-FS, Omniglot), Hebbian plasticity consistently achieves lower loss and stronger few-shot generalization, while gradient-based updates perform best on long-horizon credit assignment. When associations are short and linearly separable, static weights suffice, defining a clear boundary condition for when plasticity helps. Analysis of learned modulatory signals reveals that gradient-based rules maintain large, persistent updates, whereas Hebbian plasticity is sharply gated around salient events. Together, these results show that explicit plasticity complements attention by enabling rapid, task-specific adaptation, and clarify when different plasticity mechanisms are most effective.

                arXiv:2505.19458v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theoretical understanding of self-attention (SA) has been steadily progressing. A prominent line of work studies a class of SA layers that admit an energy function decreased by state updates. While it provides valuable insights into inherent biases in signal propagation, it often relies on idealized assumptions or additional constraints not necessarily present in standard SA. Thus, to broaden our understanding, this work aims to relax these energy constraints and provide an energy-agnostic characterization of inference dynamics by dynamical systems analysis. In more detail, we first consider relaxing the symmetry and single-head constraints traditionally required in energy-based formulations. Next, we show that analyzing the Jacobian matrix of the state is highly valuable when investigating more general SA architectures without necessarily admitting an energy function. It reveals that the normalization layer plays an essential role in suppressing the Lipschitzness of SA and the Jacobian's complex eigenvalues, which correspond to the oscillatory components of the dynamics. In addition, the Lyapunov exponents computed from the Jacobians demonstrate that the normalized dynamics lie close to a critical state, and this criticality serves as a strong indicator of high inference performance. Furthermore, the Jacobian perspective also enables us to develop regularization methods for training and a pseudo-energy for monitoring inference dynamics.

                arXiv:2511.00529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Improvisation-the art of spontaneous creation that unfolds moment-to-moment without a scripted outcome-requires practitioners to continuously sense, adapt, and create anew. It is a fundamental mode of human creativity spanning music, dance, and everyday life. The open-ended nature of improvisation produces a stream of novel, unrepeatable moments-an aspect highly valued in artistic creativity. In parallel, open-endedness (OE)-a system's capacity for unbounded novelty and endless "interestingness"-is exemplified in natural or cultural evolution and has been considered "the last grand challenge" in artificial life (ALife). The rise of generative AI now raises the question in computational creativity (CC) research: What makes a "good" improvisation for AI? Can AI learn to improvise in a genuinely open-ended way? In this work-in-progress paper, we report insights from in-depth interviews with 6 experts in improvisation across dance, music, and contact improvisation. We draw systemic connections between human improvisational arts and the design of future experiential AI agents that could improvise alone or alongside humans-or even with other AI agents-embodying qualities of improvisation drawn from practice: active listening (umwelt and awareness), being in the time (mindfulness and ephemerality), embracing the unknown (source of randomness and serendipity), non-judgmental flow (acceptance and dynamical stability, balancing structure and surprise (unpredictable criticality at edge of chaos), imaginative metaphor (synaesthesia and planning), empathy, trust, boundary, and care (mutual theory of mind), and playfulness and intrinsic motivation (maintaining interestingness).

                <p>Amblyopia (lazy eye) is a developmental disorder of the visual cortex that causes deficits in visual acuity and shape perception. The loss of visual acuity is thought to originate from weakened cortical responses to stimuli. Here, we provide evidence for a similar mechanism to explain distortions in shape perception. We introduce a computational model that simulates perceptual distortions of grating patterns drawn by humans with amblyopia (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B2">Barrett et al., 2003</cross-ref>). The model simulates a large variety of distortions by performing a weighted sum of rectified sinusoidal gratings (average, 3.3 gratings ~6 times larger than foveal receptive fields in the primary visual cortex) with different dark/light duty cycles. The simulations accurately reproduce self-reported perceptions of amblyopic patients and decrease drawing-percept differences when ideal percepts (stimuli) are replaced with simulated percepts (9.03 &plusmn; 12.37%; <I>p</I> = 0.0002; Wilcoxon test comparing normalized Laplacian pyramid distances; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B34">Laparra et al., 2016</cross-ref>). The simulations also reveal an increase in the number of stimulus orientations contributing to visual percepts in amblyopia and a strong correlation between contrast sensitivity deficits and both magnitude of perceived visual distortions (<I>r</I> = 0.96; <I>p</I> = 0.0007) and predicted spread of cortical activation (<I>r</I> = 0.82; <I>p</I> = 0.02). The results also demonstrate a compensatory shift in the spatial frequency distribution of cortical filters in amblyopia, which closely resembles the spatial frequency shift caused by contrast reduction in thalamocortical inputs of male cats. Taken together, our results indicate that amblyopia compensates weakened cortical responses by increasing the spread of cortical activation to include neurons with mismatched stimulus preferences that cause perceptual distortions.</p>

                <p>In humans, the superior temporal sulcus (STS) combines auditory and visual information. However, the extent to which it relies on visual information from the ventral or dorsal stream remains uncertain. To address this, we analyzed open-source functional magnetic resonance imaging data collected from 15 participants (6 females and 9 males) as they watched a movie. We used artificial neural networks to investigate the relationship between multivariate response patterns in auditory cortex, the two visual streams, and the rest of the brain, finding that distinct portions of the STS combine information from the two visual streams with auditory information.</p>

                <p>Selective spatial attention plays a critical role in perception in the daily environment where multiple sensory stimuli exist. Even covertly directing attention to a specific location facilitates the brain's information processing of stimuli at the attended location. Previous behavioral and neurophysiological studies have shown that microsaccades (MSs), tiny involuntary saccadic eye movements, reflect such a process in terms of visual space and can be a marker of spatial attention. However, it is unclear whether auditory spatial attention processes that are supposed to interact with visual attention processes influence MSs and vice versa. Here, we examine the relationship between MS direction and auditory spatial attention during dichotic oddball sound detection tasks with human participants of both sexes. The results showed that the MS direction was generally biased contralateral to the ear to which the oddball sound was presented or that to which sustained auditory attention was directed. The postoddball modulation of MS direction was associated with the behavioral performance of the detection task. The results suggest that the inhibition of stimulus-directed MSs occurs to reduce erroneous orientation of ocular responses during selective detection tasks. We also found that the correlation between MS direction and neural response to the tone originated from the auditory brainstem (frequency-following response). Overall, the present study suggests that MSs can be a marker of auditory spatial attention and that the auditory neural activity fluctuates over time with the states of attention and the oculomotor system, also involving auditory subcortical processes.</p>

                <p>Humans frequently make decisions that impact close others. Prior research has shown that people have stable preferences regarding such decisions and maintain rich, nuanced mental representations of their close social partners. Yet, if and how such mental representations shape social decisions preferences remains to be seen. Using a combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and natural language processing, this study investigated how neural and linguistic representations of close others relate to social decision-making. After nominating a parent and friend, male and female participants (<I>N</I> = 63) rated their characteristics while undergoing fMRI and made hypothetical social decisions involving said parent and friend. Neural representations of parents and friends, relative to the self, were linked to social decision preferences. Specifically, greater neural similarity between self and parent in the temporoparietal junction and nucleus accumbens was associated with a preference for parents, while greater self&ndash;friend similarity in the medial prefrontal cortex was associated with friend preference. In a follow-up study, linguistic analysis of written descriptions of close others from an independent sample of males and females (<I>N</I> = 1,641) revealed that social decision preferences could be reliably predicted from semantic features of the text. High correspondence between neural and linguistic data in the imaging sample further strengthened the association with social decision preferences. These findings help elucidate the neural and linguistic underpinnings of social decision-making, emphasizing the critical role of mental representations in guiding choices involving familiar others.</p>

                <p>Neuroscience has advanced rapidly over the past century by applying reductionist methods to dissect brain function at molecular, cellular, and circuit levels, primarily in animal models. While this approach has generated extraordinary insights, the field now faces an epistemological bottleneck: efforts to build holistic models of human cognition from fragmented reductionist data are failing to capture the complexity of real-world brain function. Current translational pathways are dominated by a clinical mission&mdash;using dysfunction to model normal function&mdash;which limits ecological validity and reinforces blind spots. We argue that neuroscience must broaden its ontological mission beyond treatment of DSM-defined disorders to include functional misalignments and productivity in everyday life, encompassing education, workplaces, and social contexts. To achieve this, we propose the concept of behavioral "wind tunnels," an analogy to the facilities that transformed aerodynamics. Like wind tunnels, such environments would provide a controlled yet naturalistic middle ground between laboratory reductionism and the uncontrolled complexity of real-world settings. They would enable scalable capture of cognitive traits and states across wide populations, long time horizons, and multiple functional dimensions, yielding ecologically valid feedback loops essential for both theory and application. Embedding neuroscience into real-world contexts would align the field with pressing societal needs&mdash;optimizing human skills in an AI-disrupted economy, fostering resilience to global crises, and advancing brain health as an economic and societal asset. Just as wind tunnels transformed aviation from theory to reliable practice, neuroscience must now adopt analogous infrastructures to realize its full potential for humanity.</p>

                <p>Adaptive behavior depends on a dynamic balance between acquisition and extinction memories. Male and female rodents differ in extinction learning rates, suggesting potential sex-based differences in this balance. In males, deletion of extinction-recruited neurons in the central nucleus (CN) of the amygdala impairs extinction retrieval, shifting behavior toward acquisition (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B31">Lay et al., 2023</cross-ref>). Here, we tested whether this mechanism also operates in females. In contrast to previously reported findings in males, deleting extinction-recruited CN neurons after single or extended extinction training had no effect on extinction retrieval in female rats. This lack of behavioral impact was not due to sex differences in CN activation during extinction. However, during early extinction, females showed greater activity in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) than males. Deletion of this BLA ensemble produced a more substantial reduction in conditioned approach than in non-deletion controls. These findings uncover a potential interplay between the CN and BLA in regulating conditioned approach in females. While ablation of extinction-recruited CN neurons do not modulate extinction retrieval in females, targeted BLA neuronal ablation during early extinction shifts behavior toward low, extinction-level responding. Thus heightened BLA activation during early extinction may prevent the emergence of extinction-like behavior in females. These findings, taken together with those reported by <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B31">Lay et al. (2023)</cross-ref>, offer new insights into potential sex-based differences in the neural mechanisms underlying extinction and may inform the development of sex-based treatments for cue-triggered appetitive behaviors.</p>

                <p>Computer programming is a cornerstone of modern society, yet little is known about how the human brain enables this recently invented cultural skill. According to the neural recycling hypothesis, cultural skills (e.g., reading, math) repurpose preexisting neural "information maps." Alternatively, such maps could emerge de novo during learning, as they do in artificial neural networks. Representing and manipulating logical algorithms, such as "for" loops and "if" conditionals, is key to programming. Are representations of these algorithms acquired when people learn to program? Alternatively, do they predate instruction and get "recycled"? College students (<I>n</I> = 22, 11 females and 11 males) participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study before and after their first programming course (Python) and completed a battery of behavioral tasks. After a one-semester Python course, reading Python functions (relative to working memory control) activated an independently localized left-lateralized frontoparietal reasoning network. This same network was already engaged by pseudocode, plain English descriptions of Python, even before the course. Critically, multivariate population codes in this frontoparietal network distinguished "for" loops and "if" conditional algorithms, both before and after. Representational similarity analysis revealed shared information in the frontoparietal network before and after instruction. Programming recycles preexisting representations of logical algorithms in frontoparietal cortices, supporting the recycling framework of cultural skill acquisition.</p>

                <p>Methamphetamine (METH) is a widely abused psychoactive drug that readily establishes reward memories contributing to METH relapse. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is central to cognition, motivation, reward, and emotion, and the hippocampus is critically involved in reward memory. The mPFC possesses an enormous variety of projection neurons. However, the direct projection from the mPFC to the hippocampus involved in METH addiction has not been studied well. To explore the role of a mPFC-hippocampus pathway of regulating METH reward memory, conditioned place preference (CPP) was used to detect reward memory and recombinant adeno-associated virus 2/9s (rAAV2/9s) were used to label neurons, identify projections, and optogenetically explore involvement of the male mice mPFC-hippocampus pathway in regulating METH-CPP. We found that a novel prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PrL) projection directly to the dorsal hippocampus CA1 (dCA1) regulated CPP induced by METH. Moreover, optogenetic activation or inhibition and silencing the PrL to dCA1 glutamatergic pathway with tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) modulated METH-CPP. Our results reveal a PrL to dCA1 glutamatergic pathway that regulates METH-CPP and could serve as a potential target for treating METH use disorder.</p>

                <p>In sporadic neurodegenerative diseases, the endogenous proteins &alpha;-synuclein in Parkinson's disease and tau in Alzheimer's disease undergo pathogenic prion-like propagation over many years, accumulating in both soluble and insoluble forms in neurons including synapses, where they impair synaptic transmission and potentially cause various neuronal symptoms. To investigate the functional outcome of such synaptic accumulation, we induced accumulation of endogenous proteins in murine and human synapses by incubating mouse (of either sex) neuronal cultures with pathogenic preformed fibrils (pffs). Two weeks after treatment with human &alpha;-synuclein or tau pff, the respective endogenous proteins accumulated in neurons including presynaptic terminals, where we also observed tubulin accumulation, suggesting microtubule over-assembly. These were not associated with mRNA upregulation and were prevented by pharmacological stimulation of autophagy. Both pffs caused accumulation of p62 in cell bodies, suggesting compromised protein degradation. pHluorin imaging in synapses indicated a marked prolongation of vesicular endocytic time, which was rescued by pharmacological depolymerization of microtubules or by the overexpression of full-length dynamin 1. Since dynamin is a high-affinity binding partner of microtubules as well as an endocytic key molecule, over-assembled microtubules can sequester dynamin, thereby inhibiting endocytosis. We conclude that pff-induced accumulation of &alpha;-synuclein or tau in presynaptic terminals can disrupt vesicle endocytosis through a common mechanism. Since endocytosis-dependent vesicle recycling is critical for maintaining neurotransmitter release, its disruption can affect the neurocircuitry operations involved, thereby causing diverse symptoms associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, our data suggest a common molecular mechanism underlying synaptic dysfunctions associated with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.</p>

                <p>Although TREK1 channels are widely expressed in several thalamic nuclei, the role of this K<SUB>2P</SUB> family member in modulating thalamic cell excitability and physiological thalamocortical oscillatory activity is not well studied. Here we explored the contribution of TREK1 channels to membrane properties of two important building blocks of the thalamocortical (TC) system, namely, GABAergic neurons of reticular thalamic nucleus (RTN) and TC neurons in different sensory thalamic nuclei including the ventrobasal complex (VB; somatosensory system) and the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN; auditory system), using male TREK1 knock-out (TREK1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>) mice. Furthermore, we show that the loss of TREK1 channels has distinct effects on neuronal function in different thalamic nuclei. Compared with controls, TREK1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice exhibit decreased excitability in RTN neurons, while VB neurons maintain similar excitability levels. Additionally, the absence of TREK1 channels alters the action potential (AP) characteristics in VB TC neurons and affects GABAergic inhibitory tone in RTN neurons. In TREK1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice, the excitability of cortical pyramidal cells is increased. It is tempting to assume that this combination of changes contributes to a high number of sharp, spindle-like oscillations observed in sleep local field potential (LFP) recordings of these mice. In addition, TREK1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice show a lower amount of delta (1&ndash;4&nbsp;Hz) oscillations during slow-wave sleep and a time-of-day-dependent alteration in the amount of sleep and wakefulness. They also show disturbed auditory signal processing and altered excitability in the auditory thalamus. These findings underline the relevance of TREK1 channels&rsquo; broad contribution to the thalamus and thalamocortical system.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/45/e0489252025?rss=1">Walking Modulates Active Auditory Sensing</a></h4>

              
                <p>Walking provides the motor foundation for navigation, while navigation ensures that walking is purposeful and adaptive to environmental contexts. Sensory processing of environmental information acts as the informational bridge that connects walking and adaptive navigation. In the current study, we assessed if walking and the walking direction influences neuronal dynamics underlying environmental information processing. To this end, we conducted two experiments with 12 male and 18 female participants while they walked along an 8-shaped path. Auditory entrainment stimuli were continuously presented, and mobile electroencephalogram was recorded. We found increased auditory entrainment (auditory steady-state response) and early auditory evoked responses during walking compared with standing or stepping in place. We also replicated the well-established reduction of occipital alpha power during walking. The increase of auditory entrainment and the decrease of alpha power were correlated across participants. In the second experiment, randomly presented transient burst sounds led to a perturbation of the auditory entrainment response. The perturbation response was stronger during walking compared with standing; however, only when the burst sounds were presented to one ear but not to both ears. Most importantly, we found that the auditory entrainment was systematically modulated dependent on the walking path. The entrainment responses changed as a function of the turning direction. In general, the current work shows that walking changes auditory processing in a walking path-dependent way which might serve to optimize navigation. The walking path-related modulation might further reflect a shift of attention, marking a form of higher-order active sensing.</p>

                <p>Epileptic seizures involve a cortical excitation&ndash;inhibition imbalance driven by dysfunctional interneurons that contribute to gamma oscillation generation. While impaired gamma oscillations are commonly reported in epilepsy, the dynamics of broadband and narrowband gamma as well as beta oscillations remain underexplored. These oscillations may serve as noninvasive electrophysiological markers associated with altered cortical dynamics, potentially reflecting underlying excitation&ndash;inhibition imbalance in epilepsy. Here, we recorded high-density electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography data to investigate visual stimuli-elicited cortical oscillations in 48 neurotypical (20 females) and 49 children (26 females) with epilepsy. We found that epilepsy is characterized by reduced amplitude and prolonged latency of evoked cortical response compared with controls after visual stimulation, with alterations in N1 peaks and M100, M150, and M250 components (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05). Additionally, source imaging revealed disrupted oscillatory features in epilepsy patients, including suppressed power, reduced amplitude, and increased latency in evoked and induced beta and gamma oscillations from the visual cortex (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05). These alterations were consistent across diverse epilepsy subtypes, including focal, generalized, and nonlesional epilepsy cases. Utilizing these differences, we developed a novel classification model that differentiates individuals with epilepsy from controls with high accuracy, offering potential clinical utility in epilepsy diagnosis. Our results suggest disrupted beta and gamma oscillations may be associated with impaired inhibitory mechanisms and altered cortical dynamics, potentially indicative of an excitation&ndash;inhibition imbalance. Our findings highlight the potential of noninvasive electrophysiological biomarkers to capture cortical dynamics possibly influenced by excitation&ndash;inhibition imbalance in epilepsy, supporting their use in early diagnosis and disease monitoring.</p>

                <p>Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurogenetic disorder characterized by motor coordination and cognitive deficits. In AS, hippocampal neurons show reduced filamentous (F-)actin, a decrease we also reported in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, along with impaired mechanosensitive ion channel activity. Currently, there are no pharmacological targets to prevent the decrease of F-actin in AS. Here, we utilize a first-in-class selective cofilin inhibitor (SZ-3) to restore PIEZO2 function in DRG neurons and glutamate-evoked currents in hippocampal neurons from AS mice. Using atomic force microscopy, we demonstrate that inhibiting cofilin, an actin-severing protein, with SZ-3 increases cellular stiffness by stabilizing the actin cytoskeleton. Furthermore, systemic administration of SZ-3 in male and female AS mice enhances their performance in the rotarod and T-maze tests. These findings support that cytoskeletal dysregulation contributes to impaired ion channel function and behavioral deficits and that actin-binding proteins could serve as a target for enhancing motor coordination and spatial learning in AS.</p>

                <p>How do humans integrate landmarks to update their spatial position during active navigation? Using immersive virtual reality and high-density mobile EEG, we investigated the neural underpinnings of landmark-based recalibration during path integration in freely moving male and female humans. Participants navigated predefined routes, indicated the start position to quantify accumulated errors, and once per route corrected their estimate using a visual landmark. Our findings reveal that homing error accumulated along the course of navigation, but a briefly presented intramaze landmark effectively corrected accumulated errors. However, this effect was transient and less pronounced when participants were highly confident in their self-motion-based spatial representation suggesting that internal priors can hinder the assimilation of novel spatial cues. Theta activity in the retrosplenial complex supported the realignment of internal spatial representations by anchoring self-motion-derived estimates to visual landmark cues. Increased theta power and phase resetting upon landmark presentation accompanied subtle corrections, supporting a smooth realignment of spatial representations, whereas diminished synchronization marked the need for more extensive spatial updating. In addition, we identified motor-related theta response that scaled with rotational acceleration. Taken together, these findings highlight the dual role of theta oscillations in flexibly integrating multimodal signals, supporting both the recalibration of spatial representations to external cues and the encoding of self-motion information during naturalistic human navigation<I>.</I></p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/45/e1041252025?rss=1">Functional Connectivity Is Dominated by Aperiodic, Rather Than Oscillatory, Coupling</a></h4>

              
                <p>Functional connectivity (FC) has attracted significant interest in the identification of specific circuits underlying brain (dys)function. Classical analyses to estimate FC (i.e., filtering electrophysiological signals in canonical frequency bands and using connectivity metrics) assume that these reflect oscillatory networks. However, this approach conflates nonoscillatory, aperiodic neural activity with oscillations, raising the possibility that these functional networks may reflect aperiodic rather than oscillatory activity. Here, we provide the first study quantifying, in two different human electroencephalography (EEG) databases (<I>n</I> = 59, 30 females and 29 males; <I>n</I> = 103, 62 females and 41 males), the contribution of aperiodic activity on reconstructed oscillatory functional networks in resting state. We also followed the same approach on cognitive task recordings (<I>n</I> = 59, 30 females and 29 males) as a complementary analysis. We found that ~99% of delta, theta, and gamma functional networks, over 90% of beta functional networks, and between 23 and 61% of alpha functional networks were actually driven by aperiodic activity. While there is no universal consensus on how to identify and quantify neural oscillations, our results demonstrate that oscillatory functional networks may be drastically sparser than commonly assumed. These findings suggest that most FC studies focusing on resting state data actually reflect aperiodic networks instead of oscillations-based networks. We highly recommend that oscillatory network analyses first check the presence of aperiodicity-unbiased neural oscillations before estimating their statistical coupling to strengthen the robustness, interpretability, and reproducibility of FC studies.</p>

                Background Tourism is a vital component of economic development, particularly in emerging economies like India, where international tourist arrivals contribute significantly to foreign exchange earnings, employment generation, and regional growth. While prior research has explored various determinants of tourism demand, limited empirical studies have assessed the macroeconomic underpinnings of ITA using time series models capable of handling mixed integration orders. This study investigates the short-run and long-run effects of international tourist arrivals on GDP, FDI, and inflation in India. Methods This study uses the Autoregressive Distributed Lag bounds testing approach on annual data spanning from 1995 to 2022. The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test was conducted to determine the stationarity properties of the time series data, after which the optimal lag structure for the ARDL model was identified using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The model was built on a time series dataset spanning 1995 to 2022, and the empirical results provide both statistically significant findings and interpretive depth that are relevant to policy and theory. Results The findings of this study confirm a statistically significant and positive relationship between GDP and international tourist arrivals in both the short and long run. The ARDL (1,2,0,2) model demonstrated strong explanatory power (Adjusted R² = 0.9565), and the bounds test confirmed the presence of cointegration among the variables. However, FDI and inflation were found to be statistically insignificant in influencing ITA. The error correction term was negative and empirically significant, indicating that approximately 51% of the disequilibrium adjusts each year toward long-run equilibrium. Conclusion This study highlights GDP as the primary macroeconomic driver of international tourism demand in India, with implications for economic planning and tourism policy. While FDI and inflation were not significant in this model, their potential indirect effects needs further investigation.

                Background Biobanks are critical infrastructures for biomedical research but are energy- and cost-intensive due to reliance on ultra-low temperature (ULT) storage and redundant systems. The challenge is reducing environmental impact without compromising specimen quality or continuity. Service centers are well positioned to address this challenge, operating at scale and providing governance beyond the capacity of individual laboratories. Methods The Johns Hopkins Biobank, a CAP-accredited service-center repository, partnered with the School of Medicine Energy and Sustainability Committee to conduct a freezer audit across 34 departments and two campuses. Inventories were assessed for age, utilization, and efficiency, and policies were implemented to encourage migration of biospecimens into centralized storage. Strategies prioritized vapor-phase liquid nitrogen (LN2) for viable collections and incorporated MVE Variō systems as energy-efficient alternatives for ULT needs. Governance required investigators to evaluate centralized options before acquiring new freezers, reinforced through outreach at faculty meetings and symposia. Results The audit identified nearly 1,300 ULT freezers, with over 70% beyond their median life expectancy of 8.5 years. Consolidation of specimens into a Biobank-managed freezer farm reduced institutional energy demand and improved monitoring. LN2 provided stability for viable specimens, while Variō units offered adjustable storage (–20 °C to –150 °C) with minimal electricity use and no facility cooling load. Governance helped to curb uncontrolled expansion of departmental freezers, while the Biobank functioned as an emergency response resource with at-temperature backup capacity. Adoption of centralized storage has been gradual but continues to expand. Conclusions This case study demonstrates how an academic service center can integrate sustainability, quality, and contingency planning. The Johns Hopkins Biobank illustrates that shared resources, supported by institutional governance, provide a practical framework to reduce environmental impact while ensuring uncompromising specimen protection.

                Background The continuous increase in emissions has exacerbated climate change, which is a concern for everyone on a global scale. In addition, the dynamics of democratic quality and development dimensions have been identified as key determinants that affect environmental quality in various countries. This study aims to analyze how economic growth (GDP), human development index (HDI), and democracy (DM) affect Environmental Degradation (ED), particularly in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Methods This study used panel data from 30 countries, divided into 15 developed and 15 developing countries, over an annual period from 2015 to 2022. The variables used in this study consist of CO2 as the dependent variable, while GDP, HDI, and DM serve as independent variables. Considering the characteristics of larger cross-section data and shorter time-series ranges, we used a dynamic panel model with two-step Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation method to achieve the research objectives. Results The results show that HDI has a negative and significant effect on CO2 emissions in developed countries, but contrasts with developing countries. Democracy is negatively and significantly correlated with CO2 emissions, with the effect being more pronounced in developed countries. The study also confirms the existence of an Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) with an inverted U-shaped pattern, supporting the hypothesis in both groups of Eurasian countries. Conclusion The results of the study show that there is a significant dynamic relationship that can be measured by comparing econometric results in Eurasian countries with different levels of development. This study is the first of its kind on the subject in this region, making an important contribution to the empirical literature and enhancing the understanding of the impact of socio-economic-political variables on pollution emissions.

                Background Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is a rare, inherited disorder primarily affecting the kidneys and liver. Disease-causing variants in PKHD1 lead to a disruption of the encoded protein fibrocystin/polyductin. This study aims to identify disease causing variants in PKHD1 in families from the Dhofar region of Oman. Methods We conducted a case series of six families with antenatal diagnoses of ARPKD and postnatal deaths. Genetic testing was performed on neonates using Sanger sequencing and next-generation sequencing (NGS) to detect variants in PKHD1. In silico analysis of mutational consequences was performed. Results 5 distinct homozygous variants in the PKHD1 gene were identified, including three pathogenic frameshift variants (c.6111_6112delTT, c.7011dupT and c.9550dupT), a nonsense variant (c.340C>T) and a homozygous deletion spanning exons 58-60 of the PKHD1. These alleles have not been reported in previous studies. In silico modelling identified pathogenic alleles, predicted to lead to either truncated protein products or nonsense-mediated decay. Discussion Our findings identify disease causing PKHD1 variants in this genetically distinct Dhofar population, potentially due to factors such as geographical isolation, consanguinity, and founder effects. The identification of previously undescribed variants underscores the need for regional genetic studies in understanding ARPKD and its genotype-phenotype correlations. Conclusion This study reveals distinct PKHD1 disease-causing variants in the Dhofar region of Oman, contributing to the broader genetic understanding of ARPKD. These findings highlight the value of region-specific genetic research in identifying new disease causing variants.

In atrial fibrillation (AF), atrial biomechanics are altered, reducing atrial movement. It remains unclear whether these changes are due to altered anatomy, myocardial stiffness, or constraints from surrounding structures. Understanding the causes of changed atrial deformation in AF could enhance tissue characterization and inform AF diagnosis, stratification, and treatment. We created patient-specific anatomical models of the left atrium (LA) from CT images. Passive LA biomechanics were simulated using finite deformation continuum mechanics equations. LA stiffness was represented by the Guccione material law, where <i>α</i> scaled the anisotropic stiffness parameters. Regional passive stiffness parameters were calibrated to peak regional deformation during the reservoir phase and validated against deformation transients derived from retrospective gated CT images during the reservoir and conduit phase. Physiological LA deformation varies regionally, with the roof deforming significantly less than other regions during the reservoir phase. The fitted model matched peak patient deformations globally and regionally with an average error of 0.90±0.39 mm over our cohort. We compared deformation transients through the reservoir and conduit phases and found that the simulated deformation transients were within an average of ±0.38 mm per unit time of the CT-derived deformation transients. Regional stiffness varied across the atria with average <i>α</i> values of 1.8, 1.6, 2.2, 1.6 and 2.1 across the cohort in the anterior, posterior, septum, lateral and roof regions respectively. Using mixed effect models, we found no correlation between regional patient LA deformation and regional estimates of wall thickness or regional volumes of epicardial adipose tissue. We found a significant correlation between regionally calibrated stiffness and CT-derived LA biomechanics (<i>p</i> = 0.023). We have shown that regional heterogeneity in stiffness contributes to regional LA biomechanics, while anatomical features appeared less important. These findings provide insight into the underlying causes of altered LA biomechanics in AF.

                <p>by Ethan S. Rappaport, Renato Mirollo, Babak Momeni</p>

The human microbiota plays a key role in resisting the colonization of pathogenic microbes, a process known as colonization resistance. However, there is a need to better understand the mechanisms by which colonization of invaders is blocked. Environmental resource supply and resource diversity are essential factors in forming these communities but testing how the environment affects resistance in natural communities is challenging. Here we use a consumer-resource model and computational invasion simulations to investigate how environmental resource diversity and supply affect the richness-resistance relationship, overall colonization resistance, and cross-feeding dynamics. We find a non-monotonic trend between species richness and resistance, shaped by environmental characteristics. Our results show that colonization resistance is negatively correlated with both resource supply and resource diversity except when resource supply is limited. Lastly, we observe that cross-feeding weakens colonization resistance by increasing the diversity of available resources, but this trend disappears with limited resource supply. This work provides insights about colonization resistance in microbial communities of consumers, resources, and resource conversion and exchange.

                <p>by Alberto Liardi, Fernando E. Rosas, Robin L. Carhart-Harris, George Blackburne, Daniel Bor, Pedro A. M. Mediano</p>

A key feature of information theory is its universality, as it can be applied to study a broad variety of complex systems. However, many information-theoretic measures can vary significantly even across systems with similar properties, making normalisation techniques essential for allowing meaningful comparisons across datasets. Inspired by the framework of Partial Information Decomposition (PID), here we introduce Null Models for Information Theory (NuMIT), a null model-based non-linear normalisation procedure which improves upon standard entropy-based normalisation approaches and overcomes their limitations. We provide practical implementations of the technique for systems with different statistics, and showcase the method on synthetic models and on human neuroimaging data. Our results demonstrate that NuMIT provides a robust and reliable tool to characterise complex systems of interest, allowing cross-dataset comparisons and providing a meaningful significance test for PID analyses.

                <p>by Diana Madeira</p>

Thermal tolerance determines winners and losers in a warming world. Oxygen limitation has been the primary hypothesis for the mechanistic basis of thermal tolerance. A new study in PLOS Biology suggests otherwise, reigniting debate on what truly sets thermal limits.

Oxygen limitation is thought to represent a key mechanism underlying thermal tolerance. This primer discusses how a recent PLOS Biology article challenges this idea, by showing minimal protective effects of oxygen supersaturation in aquatic ectotherms exposed to heat stress.

                Background Rapid advances in general-purpose artificial intelligence are compressing automation timelines: around 40–50% of tasks in advanced economies are technically automatable, and a quarter of total hours could be migrated to machines before 2030. Fears of large-scale displacement from artificial-intelligence (AI) adoption have prompted calls for either mass reskilling or unconditional cash transfers. Another option, the emergence of a “supervisory economy” in which humans specialise in overseeing AI systems, remains empirically under-examined. Methods Using a balanced panel of 12 economies observed annually from 2014 to 2023, we construct a sector-weighted AI-exposure index and match it to labour-force data on unemployment, supervisory employment, public transfers, R&D, and GDP per capita. Two-way fixed-effects regressions are estimated, first linearly and then with a quadratic AI term to capture non-linearity in technology shocks. Robustness checks include lagged covariates, alternative normalisations and clustered standard errors. Results The preferred quadratic specification reveals an inverted-U relationship between aggregate AI exposure and unemployment: joblessness rises at low-to-moderate exposure but falls once adoption surpasses approximately 1.7 standard deviations above the mean. Supervisory depth—measured as the share of senior- and middle-management roles—has no significant standalone effect and does not significantly moderate AI’s impact. Higher real income consistently dampens unemployment, while public transfers and contemporaneous R&D outlays show limited short-run cushioning. Conclusions National labour markets appear to follow a concave AI trajectory: modest automation initially displaces routine labour, but at high penetration, complementary demand offsets job losses. However, simply expanding managerial layers is insufficient to buffer early shocks; effective resilience likely hinges on coupling oversight capacity with targeted technical upskilling and productivity-enhancing growth. Policy mixes that rely primarily on cash transfers or untargeted innovation spending risk delaying, rather than mitigating, employment re-equilibration in the age of AI.

                Purpose This mixed-methods action research study investigates the integration of ethically designed generative AI tools as catalysts for active learning in English as Foreign Language (EFL) writing instruction. The research is situated within resource-constrained higher education contexts and is grounded in Kolb’s experiential learning theory and active learning principles. Design/methodology The study employed a quasi-experimental design involving 148 undergraduate students from Bahauddin Zakariya University, Pakistan. Over a 15-week intervention, an experimental group utilized AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude AI, Meta AI, and Canva) within a cognitive partnership model, while a control group received traditional teacher-centered instruction. Quantitative data on writing performance was supplemented by qualitative data from semi-structured interviews to capture student experiences and the development of ethical awareness. Findings Quantitative results show the experimental group achieved statistically significant improvements in writing performance (Z = -6.325, p < .001) compared to modest gains in the control group (Z = -2.128, p = 0.033), with notable skill progression emerging after 6-8 weeks. Qualitative analysis revealed that AI tools successfully functioned as cognitive partners, metacognitive mirrors, and equity tools. A strong majority of participants (79.7%) expressed positive views about AI integration, with 86% indicating intentions for continued use. Originality/value The paper provides a practical model for embedding AI tools in collaborative-learning settings while upholding academic integrity through a disciplined process of ethical reflection. The findings challenge the presumption that technology alone drives educational improvement, demonstrating instead that it is the pedagogical structures mediating AI interaction that determine an effective and ethical educational process.

                Background South Africa continues to underperform in primary mathematics, with foundational gaps evident across content and cognitive skills. This study investigates domain-specific patterns of achievement and cognitive demand using the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2023, benchmarking South African Grade 5 learners against Singaporean Grade 4 learners. Methods A quantitative secondary analysis was conducted on nationally representative TIMSS 2023 datasets comprising 10,424 South African learners from 285 schools and 6,530 Singaporean learners from 181 schools. Mathematics achievement was disaggregated by content domains (Number, Measurement and Geometry, Data) and cognitive domains (Knowing, Applying, Reasoning). Weighted estimates, mean differences, and effect sizes (Cohen’s d) were computed to characterise performance gaps within and between countries. Results South African learners scored well below the international centre point across all content and cognitive domains. The largest content gap with Singapore occurred in Measurement and Geometry, indicating persistent weaknesses in spatial reasoning. We observed the widest disparity in the cognitive domain of knowing, which reflected fragile factual knowledge and procedural fluency. South African learners showed relatively stronger performance in applying mathematical concepts, indicating some competence with routine and structured tasks; however, their deficits in knowing hindered their progression to reasoning, particularly in multi-step and non-routine problem-solving, which were the weakest areas. Conclusions Early mathematics learning in South Africa is characterised by weak foundational knowledge, underdeveloped spatial reasoning, and limited opportunities for higher-order thinking. Targeted reforms should improve number and fact fluency, provide better teaching support for geometry and measurement, and add learning tasks that build on what learners are good at to help them think more clearly. Aligning curriculum intent, teacher development, and assessment expectations is essential to close domain-specific gaps and advance equitable foundational learning outcomes.

Collard greens, also known as “Sukuma wiki,” are a member of the Brassica oleracea var. viridis family and are known for their medicinal properties. The aim of this study was to identify phytochemicals in the ethanol extract of collard green leaves that has traditional use in treating male infertility in Uganda. Method The leaves were dried and crushed into fine powder and the powdered leaves (800 g) A was cold macerated in 5 liters of 99% ethanol (1:5 w/v) for 72 hours in sterile glass container. The ethanol extract (5g) was subjected to Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Results Phytochemical analysis of the Ethanol extract from Brassica oleracea var. viridis (Collard green) leaves revealed the presence of various compounds, including flavonoids, alkaloids, phenolic compounds, fatty acids, and terpenoids. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis identified 77 bioactive compounds, such as 2-Methoxy-4-vinylphenol, 2, 7-Dimethyl-1, 7-octadien-3-amine, Octadecanoic acid, 9, 12, 15-Octadecatrienoic acid, Pentadecanoic acid, and several phenolic derivatives. Conclusion In conclusion, the phytochemicals identified in Brassica oleracea var. viridis (Collard greens), including Phytol, Omega-3 fatty acids, phenols, flavonoids, and sterols, demonstrate potential benefits for enhancing male fertility and reproductive health. These phytochemicals exert their beneficial action through their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and possibly neuroprotective properties. There is need for further research to establish the effectiveness of these phytochemicals in clinical settings and provide concrete guidelines for their use in treating male infertility.

                Individuals withdrawing from opioids tend to prefer the company of peers who are also withdrawing. In this issue of Neuron, Huo et al. reveal that this preference is driven by corticotropin-releasing hormone signaling in the amygdala, uncovering a new mechanism for addiction-related changes in social behavior.

                Schönsberg et al. show that a simple recurrent neural network with continuous Hebbian plasticity reproduces classic perceptual biases like contraction and repulsion. Tested across three different tasks, the model matches experimental data without fine-tuning, suggesting that distinct biases can arise from a unified local learning mechanism in the brain.

By modulating AKT, CKB fine-tunes insulin signaling and glycolysis to restrain ChREBP activation, thereby controlling de novo lipogenesis. This work links creatine metabolism to nutrient-responsive transcriptional regulation of lipid accumulation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106098">Convergent iridescence and divergent chemical signals in sympatric sister-species of Amazonian butterflies</a></h4>

              
                The evolution of traits in closely-related species living in sympatry strongly depends on both shared selective pressures and reproductive interference. In closely-related <i>Morpho</i> butterfly species living in the understory of the neo-tropical rainforest, the blue iridescent coloration of the wings is likely involved in predation evasion, as well as in mate recognition and courtship. We used spectrophotometry, behavioral experiments, visual modeling, and chemical analyses to characterize the evolution of visual and chemical traits in two closely-related species, <i>Morpho helenor</i> and <i>Morpho achilles</i>. We specifically compared trait variation between samples from allopatric and sympatric populations of <i>M. helenor</i> to test the effect of ecological interactions with <i>M. achilles</i> on trait evolution. We quantified the differences in wing iridescence and tested for variations in the sexual preference for this trait. We found a strong similarity in iridescence between <i>M. helenor</i> and <i>M. achilles</i> in sympatry, while the iridescence of <i>M. helenor</i> diverged in allopatry, suggesting that predation favors local resemblance. Although intraspecific behavioral experiments showed that iridescent signals could be used as visual cues during intraspecific mate choice, the strong resemblance of the iridescent signals between species may impair these species' visual recognition. In contrast, the divergent chemical bouquets detected between species suggest that the visual similarity of sympatric <i>Morpho</i> species may have favored the divergence of alternative traits involved in species recognition, such as chemical cues.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102337">Sox9 prevents retinal degeneration and is required for limbal stem cell differentiation in the adult mouse eye</a></h4>

              
                <i>Sox9</i> is a transcription factor with multiple roles during development and in adult organ homeostasis. In the adult eye, <i>Sox9</i> expression persists in several cell types, including the retinal pigmented epithelium cells and the Müller glial (MG) cells, as well as in the limbal and corneal basal epithelia. To uncover the role of <i>Sox9</i> in these cell types, we induced the deletion of the gene in adult mice. We found that, after <i>Sox9</i> ablation, mutant mice undergo a severe process of retinal degeneration characterized by the loss of MG cells and complete depletion of the photoreceptors layer. Moreover, by combining single-cell RNA sequencing and <i>Sox9</i> lineage tracing, we found that <i>Sox9</i> is expressed in a basal limbal stem cell population with the ability to form two types of long-lived cell clones involved in stem cell maintenance and homeostasis. Mosaic analysis of <i>Sox9</i> positive and negative cells confirmed that the gene is essential for limbal stem cell differentiation. Our results show that <i>Sox9</i> is required for the maintenance of retinal integrity and for limbal stem cell differentiation in the adult mouse eye.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103971">Birds migrate longitudinally in response to the resultant Asian monsoons of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau uplift</a></h4>

              
                The uplift of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is one of the greatest geological events on Earth, pivotally shaping biogeographic patterns across continents, especially for migratory species that need to overcome topographical barriers to fulfil their annual circle. However, how the uplift influences animal migration strategies remains largely unclear. We compare the current flyways of 50 avian species migrating across the plateau with those reconstructed before the uplift as a counterfactual. We find that the major effect of the plateau uplift is changing avian migratory directions from the latitudinal to the longitudinal. The monsoon system generated by the uplift rather than the high elevation per se shapes those changes. These findings unveil how an important global geological event has influenced biogeographic patterns of migratory birds, yielding testable hypotheses for how observed avian distributions emerge.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105734">Mixed evidence for the rhythmicity of auditory perceptual judgements in humans</a></h4>

              
                Numerous studies advocate for a rhythmic mode of perception. However, the evidence in the context of hearing remains inconsistent. We propose that the divergent conclusions drawn from previous work stem from conceptual and methodological issues. These include ambiguous assumptions regarding the origin of rhythmicity, variations in tasks and attentional demands, and differing analytical approaches for statistical testing. To address these points, we conducted a series of experiments in which human participants performed auditory tasks involving monaural targets presented against binaural white noise backgrounds, while also recording eye movements. These experiments varied in whether stimuli were presented randomly or required motor initialisation, the necessity of memory across trials, and the manipulation of attentional demands. Our findings challenge the notion of universal rhythmicity in hearing, but support the existence of paradigm- and ear-specific fluctuations in sensitivity and biases at multiple frequencies. The rhythmicity for sounds in the left and right ears appears independent among participants, and the rhythmicity in performance is possibly linked to oculomotor activity and attentional requirements. Overall, these results may help to resolve conflicting conclusions drawn in previous work and provide specific avenues for further studies into the rhythmicity of auditory perception.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107030">Layers of immunity: Deconstructing the Drosophila effector response</a></h4>

              
                The host innate immune response relies on the cooperation of multiple defense modules. In insects and other arthropods, which have only innate immune mechanisms, four main immune-specific modules have been described in the defense against microbial invaders: the Toll pathway, the Imd pathway, the melanization response, and phagocytosis by plasmatocytes. Our present understanding of their relative importance remains fragmented as their contribution to host defense has never been simultaneously assessed across a large panel of pathogens. Here, we use newly described immune mutants in a controlled genetic background to systematically delete these four immune modules individually, in pairs, or even all four simultaneously. Surprisingly, flies simultaneously deficient in all four immune modules are viable (poor viability), homozygous fertile, and display no overt morphological defects, suggesting these immune mechanisms are not strictly required for organismal development. We assessed the contribution of each module individually and collectively against a diverse panel of viruses, fungi, and bacteria. We find these four modules largely function independently and additively in host defense. We could confirm previous findings on the importance of Imd and Toll, and their antimicrobial peptide and Bomanin (Bom) effectors, against relevant microbes. We also reveal a highly important role of melanization against viruses. Examining microbial load kinetics confirms how these modules contribute to resistance or tolerance against specific microbes. The set of immune-deficient lines provided here offers tools to better assess the role of these immune modules in host defense.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106913">Heterozygosity at a conserved candidate sex determination locus is associated with female development in the clonal raider ant (Ooceraea biroi)</a></h4>

              
                Sex determination is a developmental switch that triggers sex-specific developmental programs. This switch is ‘flipped’ by the expression of genes that promote male- or female-specific development. Many lineages have evolved sex chromosomes that act as primary signals for sex determination. However, haplodiploidy (males are haploid and females are diploid), which occurs in ca. 12% of animal species, is incompatible with sex chromosomes. Haplodiploid taxa must, therefore, rely on other strategies for sex determination. One mechanism, ‘complementary sex determination’ (CSD), uses heterozygosity as a proxy for diploidy. In CSD, heterozygosity at a sex determination locus triggers female development, while hemizygosity or homozygosity permits male development. CSD loci have been mapped in honeybees and two ant species, but we know little about their evolutionary history. Here, we investigate sex determination in the clonal raider ant, <i>Ooceraea biroi</i>. We identified a 46 kb candidate CSD locus at which all females are heterozygous, but most diploid males are homozygous for either allele. As expected for CSD loci, the candidate locus has more alleles than most other loci, resulting in a peak of nucleotide diversity. This peak negligibly affects the amino acid sequences of protein-coding genes, suggesting that heterozygosity of a non-coding genomic sequence triggers female development. This locus is distinct from the CSD locus in honeybees but homologous to a CSD locus mapped in two distantly related ant species, implying that this molecular mechanism has been conserved since a common ancestor that lived approximately 112 million years ago.

">Distinct patterns of de novo coding variants contribute to Tourette Syndrome etiology</a></h4>

              
                Tourette syndrome (TS) is a highly heritable childhood-onset neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by persistent motor and vocal tics. While both common and rare variants contribute to TS susceptibility, the role of rare de novo mutations (DNMs) remains incompletely characterized. Here, we report findings from the largest TS whole-exome sequencing study to date, analyzing 1,466 TS trios alongside 6,714 autism spectrum disorder (ASD) trios and 5,880 unaffected sibling controls from the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC) and SPARK cohorts. Leveraging a trio-based design across these cohorts enabled calibrated assessment of DNM burden while controlling for background mutation rates. We observed a significant exome-wide enrichment of protein-truncating DNMs in TS probands, particularly within genes intolerant to loss-of-function variation (pLI [&ge;] 0.9), with little contribution from damaging missense variants. Notably, TS probands did not exhibit enrichment in previously implicated ASD or developmental delay (DD) genes, but elsewhere in the genome, suggesting a distinct rare variant architecture. Using a Bayesian statistical framework that integrates both de novo and rare inherited coding variants, we identified three candidate TS risk genes with FDR [&le;] 0.05: PPP5C, EXOC1, and GXYLT1. Literature shows that they have prior links to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. These findings reveal a rare variant burden in TS that is genetically distinguishable from ASD, underscore the importance of loss-of-function mutations in TS risk, and nominate novel candidate genes for future functional investigation.

">Inducible Calling Cards: Developing Mouse Reagents for Experimentally Controlled Transposon Insertion in vivo.</a></h4>

              
                The piggyBac transposase enables robust forward genetic screens in mice. Further, fusions of piggyBac with specific transcription factors (TFs) enables recovery of recoverable transposons (Calling Cards) for recording location of DNA binding events in vitro and in vivo. Such applications would be enhanced by engineering inducible transposases, such that timing of recording could be precisely controlled in vivo, as has been previously developed in vitro. Here, we tested two approaches for applying inducible Calling Cards (iCC) in the murine brain. We engineered knock-ins of inducible versions of two TFs: Jun, an immediate early gene that serves as a proxy for neural activity, and Sp1, a promiscuous binder of CpG unmethylated regions that indicates active promoters. We fused hyperPiggyBac transposase and a tamoxifen-inducible domain (ERT2) to these TFs and tested the system for efficacy and temporal control of insertions, both in vitro and in vivo. Jun-iCC mice developed normally with no behavioral abnormalities, showed tamoxifen-dependent recording, and captured neural activity during pharmacologically induced seizures. Jun-iCC yields relatively low numbers of insertions, likely due to the transient expression of Jun. In contrast, Sp1-iCC provided substantially higher insertion numbers, but transgenic animals exhibited developmental abnormalities, including reduced viability, anophthalmia, and reduced body weight, suggesting that ERT2 domains may sequester Sp1 and thus significantly impact development. Nonetheless, these inducible Calling Cards mouse lines enable drug-inducible integration of transposon cargo into specific loci in the living mouse.

">Limited Effects of Isolated Congenital Anosmia on Cerebral White Matter Morphology</a></h4>

              
                Lack of sensory input is associated with alterations in brain morphology; mainly in or near cerebral regions normally devoted to processing of the missing sense. We have in multiple studies demonstrated that the only consistent morphological finding within the gray matter of individuals born without the sense of smell (isolated congenital anosmia; ICA), are changes in or near the olfactory sulcus. For the connecting tissue of the brain, the white matter (WM), previous studies have yielded inconsistent findings. Here, we show that individuals with ICA (n=49) exhibit alterations in WM volume as compared to age- and sex-matched controls. Consistent evidence from both voxel-based morphometry and multi-voxel pattern analysis shows that individuals with ICA show decreased WM in areas surrounding the olfactory sulcus. Importantly, no WM alterations were found in areas surrounding the olfactory (piriform) cortex. In contrast to congenital sensory loss in other systems, we show that morphological alterations due to lifelong olfactory deprivation are limited. Alterations are primarily localized around the olfactory sulcus and likely due to the absence of olfactory bulbs. A possible explanation for the lack of major morphological alterations in individuals with congenital anosmia is that the olfactory regions may be recruited for non-olfactory functions.

">Feedforward representation of face information in the fusiform face area revealed by VASO 7T layer fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Recognizing faces is a critical cognitive process in social interaction. Face recognition has been extensively studied with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), ranging from large coverage studies comprehensively examining the entire face pathway to high-resolution laminar-specific (layer) fMRI studies probing feedforward and feedback signals in early visual and face-selective areas during particular face processing. However, it is still unclear which brain region structures face information in the face pathway. To further elucidate this mechanism, we investigated fusiform face area (FFA) during passive face image presentation using a whole-brain vascular space occupancy (VASO) 7T layer fMRI open dataset combined with multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA). We analysed lateral occipital cortex (LOC) as a control region and BOLD data in the dataset as a control contrast. We trained multiple binary classification decoders with various image categories (e.g., face vs. others, house vs. others) and three cortical layer groups independently to assess information representation across cortical depths. Our results revealed that decoding accuracies in VASO data peaked in the middle layer of FFA, suggesting feedforward signature specifically during face processing. This effect was not observed in LOC or in decoders for other image categories. These findings indicate that face information is structured prior to processing in the FFA, consistent with previous reports suggesting that face-related features are partially extracted before reaching higher-level face areas. Overall, this study highlights the potential of combining high-specificity VASO layer-fMRI with high-sensitivity MVPA to dissect cortical information flow.

">Linking Electrophysiological Metrics to Oxidative Metabolism: Implications for EEG-fMRI Association</a></h4>

              
                Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is widely used to study brain function, yet its biophysiological basis remains incompletely understood. Building on our recent work, we investigated how EEG activity and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) are related to one another, and how they jointly underpin rs-fMRI metrics. Using a multimodal dataset with macrovascular correction applied to all rs-fMRI metrics, we first examined associations between EEG metrics and CMRO2, then applied mediation analysis to evaluate how CMRO2 mediates EEG-fMRI associations. We found that bandlimited EEG theta and alphafractional power was significantly associated with CMRO2. Bandlimited EEG coherence was also associated with CMRO2 across all the bands. Bandlimited EEG fractional power and coherence were also significantly associated with cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) in a manner that varied by frequency. EEG broadband temporal complexity was positively associated with CMRO2; and EEG coherence was negatively associated with OEF. Notably, there are pronounced sex differences in these relationships, which suggests that the biophysical underpinnings of rs-fMRI are sex dependent. Moreover, the baseline metabolic and hemodynamic variables did partially mediate EEG-fMRI associations, with CMRO2 serving as the primary mediator. However, most of the mediations are partial, highlighting the complex interplay among electrophysiological activity, oxidative metabolism, and hemodynamics. This study advances our understanding of the biophysical basis of rs-fMRI and provides a foundation for developing sex-specific diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders.

">Neural Dynamics Underlying Repeated Learning of Visual Image Sequences</a></h4>

              
                Humans possess a remarkable ability to recognize visual objects with high fidelity, supported by complex neural mechanisms underlying memory retrieval. Event-related potential (ERP) studies have identified two key neural signatures of recognition memory: the parietal old/new effect and the frontal old/new effect. Despite extensive research on these ERP components, the extent to which these components reflect distinct memory processes remains debated. In the present study, we investigated how repetitive learning modulates these ERP components. Participants repeatedly studied a fixed list of 32 real-world images across up to five study-test repetitions while EEG was recorded. Additionally, a separate set size 1 condition served as a proxy for working memory. Our results showed that with increased repetitions, the parietal old/new effect exhibited enhanced amplitude and earlier peak latency, reflecting more efficient retrieval of well-learned memories. In contrast, the frontal old/new effect remained unchanged in both amplitude and timing. These findings suggest that the parietal old/new effect is a sensitive neural marker of learning-related changes in long-term memory representations, while the frontal effect is less influenced by repetition. Additionally, despite similarly high accuracy between the well-practiced set size 32 condition and the set size 1 working memory condition, both parietal and frontal old/new effects peaked significantly earlier for set size 1, suggesting that access to working memory is substantially faster than even well-practiced long-term memory. Together, our results highlight the unique role of the parietal old/new effect, but not the frontal old/new effect, in repetitive learning, despite both components being important for successful recognition of learnt visual stimuli.

">A Caveat Regarding the Unfolding Argument: Implications of Plasticity for Computational Theories of Consciousness</a></h4>

              
                The unfolding argument in the neuroscience of consciousness posits that causal structure cannot account for consciousness because any recurrent neural network (RNN) can be "unfolded" into a functionally equivalent feedforward neural network (FNN) with identical input-output behavior. Subsequent debate has focused on dynamical properties and philosophy of science critiques. We examine a novel caveat to the unfolding argument for RNN systems with plasticity in the connection weights. We demonstrate through rigorous mathematical proofs that plasticity negates the functional equivalence between RNN and FNN. Our proofs address history-dependent plasticity, dynamical systems analysis, information-theoretic considerations, perturbational stability, complexity growth, and resource limitations. We demonstrate that neuronal systems that possess properties such as plasticity, history-dependence, and complex temporal information encoding have features that cannot be captured by a static FNN. Our findings delineate limitations of the unfolding argument that apply if consciousness arises from temporally extended dynamic neural processes rather than static input-output mappings. This work has implications for various theories of consciousness, and for the fields of computational neuroscience and philosophy of mind more generally, providing new constraints for theories of consciousness.

">Structural and functional brain asymmetry in relation to heterogeneous causes of situs inversus totalis</a></h4>

              
                Various aspects of brain organization differ between the left and right hemispheres. Clues to the developmental origins of these asymmetries may be gained through associations with situs inversus totalis (SIT), a rare condition in which visceral organs are reversed on the left-right axis. In the largest previous brain imaging analyses of SIT (38 cases, 38 controls from Belgium), typical functional asymmetries such as left-hemisphere language dominance were mostly unaltered, but various aspects of asymmetrical cerebral structure - petalia, bending, and posterior venous anatomy - were often reversed in this condition. SIT can be a monogenic trait that arises from rare genetic variants, usually affecting motile cilia which help to create the embryonic left-right body axis. However, most SIT cases do not have obvious genetic causes and may arise from environmental or random effects during embryogenesis. We sequenced the genomes of 23 SIT cases and 23 controls from the Belgian brain imaging dataset and pooled with prior data from 15 cases and 15 controls. We aimed to discover whether there are altered brain asymmetries in SIT cases with disruptive DNA variants in ciliary genes, or in other types of genes, as compared to genetically unsolved cases. In total, 19 cases had likely causal variants affecting ciliary function, while 19 cases remained genetically unsolved. Functional and structural brain asymmetries were not significantly different in genetically solved versus unsolved SIT cases. Therefore, functional brain asymmetries seem largely independent of known mechanisms of visceral situs formation, while structural brain torque is altered in SIT regardless of the presence or absence of overt genetic causes.

">Choosing the best or avoiding the worst: complementary and opponent value signals in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Whether the brain encodes the subjective value of pleasant and unpleasant situations via a single integrated circuit or through distinct pathways remains unresolved. It is also unclear how neural value signals guide choices when the context involves choosing the most favorable option or avoiding the most unfavorable one. To address these questions, we recorded intracerebral activity from 27 participants as they first rated pleasant and unpleasant scenarios and then made binary choices across all combinations of item domain (pleasant/unpleasant) and choice frame (choose best/worst). Ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) broadband gamma activity (BGA, 50 to150 Hz) tracked the value of pleasant items during rating and pre-choice, correlating positively with the most pleasant item irrespective of choice frame. Similarly, anterior insula (aIns) BGA tracked the value of unpleasant items during rating and pre-choice, correlating negatively with the most unpleasant item irrespective of choice frame. The difference in relative value correlations between the vmPFC and aIns was larger for choices involving a conflict between item domain and choice frame, consistent with slower response times and choices less aligned with value differences in these trials. These findings reveal dissociable yet complementary neural systems for pleasant and unpleasant valuation and highlight how such signals may guide flexible decision making across contexts.

">Fully Automated EEG Source Imaging Using Structured Sparsity for Single and Multiple Synchronous Epileptic Activities</a></h4>

              
                Accurate localization of epileptic zones from High-Resolution ElectroEncephaloGraphy (HR-EEG) data can be challenging, especially when multiple synchronous zones are involved, and is highly dependent on the chosen EEG Source Imaging (ESI) method. Since a given scalp-level electrical pattern can result from multiple source configurations, ESI methods address this ill-posed inverse problem by imposing constraints on the structure of underlying sources. Here, we present an efficient approach that imposes sparsity on both the source-level activity and its spatial gradient. Unlike other methods that generally require a heuristic choice of a regularization parameter that balances between data fidelity and constraints, our method iteratively adjusts the parameter value based on the noise level in a fully automated way. The performance of the new method is evaluated across different scenarios of realistic synthetic HR-EEG data, including unifocal and synchronous multifocal cortical epileptic activity. Based on multiple performance indices, we demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional methods in accurately reconstructing epileptic sources. We also show that the method reduces polarity artifacts responsible for ghost sources and spatial discontinuities. Its ability to recover homogeneous, well-delineated regions of activity is further confirmed using real EEG data capturing a typical absence seizure.

">Human-specific fast synaptic kinetics enable rapid detection of predictive features</a></h4>

              
                Humans can discern the underlying principles in complex environments, but the cellular basis of this ability is unclear. By comparing layer 2/3 cortical pyramidal neurons in five mammals (mouse, rat, marmoset, macaque and human), we found that human neurons exhibited distinctively faster kinetics of excitatory synaptic transmissions. In a computational model, neurons with human-type synapses detected hidden patterns more quickly in noise, and this superiority was only evident in unsupervised learning. Tracking synaptic weights revealed that human synapses were potentiated sharply and persistently by the patterns, while macaque-type synapses were broadly potentiated, which were easily eroded. These data suggest that the human-specific acceleration of synaptic kinetics enables the rapid extraction of latent structures in complex environments, providing a cellular basis for our efficient cognitive abilities.

">Functionally Relevant and Reliable Brain Stimulation Targets for Enhancement of Novel Word-Learning</a></h4>

              
                Linking word forms and their meanings is central to language learning. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), has shown potential to enhance this process, but with variable effects. This study aimed to (1) identify reliable and functionally relevant tDCS target brain regions to enhance novel-word learning, using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) compatible associative picture-pseudoword learning task, and (2) assess test retest reliability (TRR) of behavioral and imaging outcomes. Twenty healthy individuals completed two fMRI sessions using parallel task versions. Participants learned picture pseudoword associations across four learning blocks. A lexical decision task served as control condition. Behavioral learning was analyzed using linear mixed models. Whole brain and region of interest analyses examined learning related activity changes and their behavioral relevance. TRR was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients. Participants successfully acquired the novel-word forms, indexed by increased accuracy and faster latency across stages. Behavioral outcomes showed good to excellent TRR. The task elicited robust language learning related activity and activity changes across stages were correlated with learning success. The control task showed no consistent activity changes. Task-related brain activity showed substantial variability, but a subset of voxels (~30%) within significant clusters showed good consistency. In sum, we identified accessible, reliable and functionally relevant cortical targets for enhancing novel word learning by tDCS. TRR results support the usefulness of APPL task for future concurrent tDCS fMRI research. Our study also outlines a general path towards optimization of brain stimulation studies by implementing an empirically informed approach for selecting reliable and relevant target regions and implementation of reliable experimental and imaging paradigms.

">Functional architecture for speed tuning in primary visual cortex of carnivores</a></h4>

              
                Perception of motion critically depends on detecting the speed and direction of moving stimuli. The primary visual cortex (V1) of some mammals, including primates and carnivores, exhibits functional organization for key receptive field properties such as orientation, direction, and spatial frequency; however, less is known about the organization of speed-tuned cells. While individual V1 neurons have been shown to exhibit speed selectivity, functional architecture for speed preference has been primarily reported in higher cortical areas such as primate area MT. Using multi-channel electrophysiology in anesthetized female ferrets, we investigated the joint tuning of V1 neurons for spatial frequency, temporal frequency, orientation/direction, and speed. We found significant clustering of cells tuned for speed and for speed preference within single electrode penetrations. We found that both simple and complex cells can exhibit speed tuning, and no strong variation across cortical layers. In reanalysis of intrinsic signal imaging data from cat V1, we observed repeating "hot spots" of high speed selectivity separated by "cold spots" with low tuning for speed. These findings indicate that a functional architecture for speed tuning is present within V1 itself and transmitted to downstream cortical regions.

">An induced pluripotent stem cell-based chemical genetic approach for studying spinal muscular atrophy</a></h4>

              
                Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic disease characterized by degeneration of spinal cord motor neurons and neuromuscular junctions. Despite recent development in therapies for SMA, treatment efficacy largely relies on administration of drugs early in disease progression and is impacted by underlying patient genetics. Drug discovery for other diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) has also been hindered by heterogeneity in patient genetics and clinical presentations, as well as the need for early intervention. To address these hurdles, we utilized a chemical genetic-based screening approach to adapt the Connectivity Map (CMAP)/L1000 platform to study SMA. To do this, we differentiated moderate and severe SMA patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells into neuronal cells utilizing a forward programming differentiation protocol, exposed each to 360 neuroactive or CNS disease-related compounds, and interrogated resulting changes in expression of >400 neural genes in a platform we term CMAPneuro. In doing so, we generated 4,559 transcriptional profiles identifying stimuli that modulate gene expression differences across SMA neurons. Finally, we make these data queryable, allowing the research community to 1.) identify CNS disease-related perturbagens that mimic or reverse differentially expressed genes, or 2.) explore the transcriptional response of a given perturbation in diverse SMA neuronal cells.

">Natural variation in the oxytocin receptor gene predicts social observation in female prairie voles</a></h4>

              
                Genetic variation in the oxytocin receptor gene (Oxtr) has been linked to differences in brain OXTR expression and long-term social bonds, but whether it shapes the moment-to-moment dynamics of early social interactions is unclear. Here we examined how the intronic Oxtr single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) NT213739 in female prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) shapes their dynamic social interactions with an opposite-sex conspecific. Leveraging a computational pipeline to analyze the movements of freely interacting voles, we found that C/C females, which expressed higher OXTR levels in the nucleus accumbens than T/T females, spent more time socially observing novel males from a distance, especially early in interactions. This genotype-phenotype relationship persisted in multiple contexts, including the social preference test. Thus, natural Oxtr variation biases social observation in females toward unfamiliar males before bonds form, consistent with models where accumbens OXTR enhances the salience of social cues. These findings show that SNPs can shape subtle behavioral dimensions in early social encounters, with important implications for the role of oxytocin in the study of social attachment.

">Reduced cerebrovascular reactivity is more pronounced in female than male youth with complex congenital heart defects</a></h4>

              
                Congenital heart defects (CHD) are the most common type of neonatal malformation. Neonates with complex CHD present with cerebrovascular dysfunction, including deficits in cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), a measure of vascular reserve. However, it is unknown whether these deficits persist beyond the perioperative period. Here, we compared CVR between 53 youth with CHD and 54 age-matched controls without CHD. We found that youth with CHD present with relative CVR deficits in the whole grey matter and in the anterior cerebral artery territory when compared to controls. Important sex differences were identified in the middle cerebral artery territory, with females having lower relative CVR than males in the CHD group. Severity of CHD also had an impact on CVR, with greater deficits in individuals with single-ventricle as compared to two-ventricle physiology. Finally, in the CHD group, a lower CVR was found to be associated with reduced performance on the Metacognitive Abilities Index. These results support that cerebrovascular deficits in CHD survivors are persistent and that CVR offers great promise as a biomarker of cognitive difficulties, which could be targeted in future interventions.

">No sex differences in predictive processing</a></h4>

              
                Statistical learning, defined as the implicit extraction of environmental regularities, is recognized as a universal and evolutionarily conserved mechanism, and constitutes a fundamental aspect of predictive processing. Still, whether it is modulated by sex or hormonal influences remains an open question. The present study investigated whether statistical learning varies as a function of sex or women's hormonal status. We re-analyzed data from 473 young adults who completed an online visuomotor Alternating Serial Reaction Time (ASRT) task, comparing (i) age-matched men and women, (ii) women using or not using hormonal contraceptives, and (iii) cycling women across self-reported menstrual phases. Robust statistical learning emerged across all groups. Neither sex, hormonal contraceptive use, nor menstrual phase significantly modulated the magnitude or trajectory of statistical learning. Bayesian analyses consistently favored models excluding group effects. In addition, we observed small but noteworthy baseline differences in visuomotor performance, including faster initial responses in men and a slight premenstrual decline in accuracy. These findings suggest that while implicit statistical learning itself is largely resilient to sex-related and hormonal influences, sex and menstrual cycle may still shape aspects of visuomotor behavior, pointing to distinct levels of sensitivity within predictive cognition.

">Ephaptic-Axonal Interactions Shape Radial Biases DuringNeural Self-Organization</a></h4>

              
                Communication in the brain seems to not just be mediated by axonal action potential transmission resulting in post synaptic modulations, but also by electrical field effects of depolarizing neurons, i.e. ephaptic coupling. The significant role of ephaptic coupling in synchronizing neural ensembles has been conjectured to indirectly affect ontogenetic neural circuit development through sub threshold impacts on spike timing. We therefore hypothesized synchronously firing ensembles to emerge at spatial distances where ephaptic and axonal signals were most temporally correlated. To test our model of ephaptic axonal interactions during neural self-organization, we compared its predictions to developmental outcomes of cortical rat tissue on high-density multielectrode arrays in vitro. We observed a cosinusoidal variation of synchronous activity over radial distances that can be understood to result from the joint effects of ephaptic and axonal signals during gamma-band bursts. Recurrent amplification of this theorized interaction effect during ontogenetic differentiation appears to radially bias the spectral profile of neural activity in the spatial distribution of neural ensembles. While long- term plasticity has been conventionally attributed to synaptic action alone, we show that that the interaction effects with ephaptic waves deserve further investigation.

">Similar processing of novelty in rat dorsal and intermediate CA1 despite differences in spatial tuning</a></h4>

              
                Elucidating the fundamental neural mechanisms of hippocampal information processing is necessary for understanding memory formation and related brain disorders. Differences in hippocampal genetics, anatomy, and connectivity across the longitudinal axis suggest functional heterogeneity in this structure. The dorsal pole is suggested to be primarily involved in spatial processing, whereas the ventral pole is implicated in emotional processing. Connectivity and genetic studies show this functional segregation is more prominent near their respective poles and weaker toward the intermediate region. The current study compares the firing properties of CA1 cells in the dorsal and intermediate regions of the hippocampus during spatial or social/odor novelty. We measured basic spatial properties, firing rate response, and remapping to the spatial re-configuration of a linear track or the social/odor presentation of a novel male conspecific, female bedding, or coyote urine. Behaviorally, the average rat exhibited slower maze running latencies during the novel spatial manipulation and spent more time adjacent to the chamber containing the novel social/odor stimulus. As previously shown, dorsal cells had fewer, smaller place fields, and higher spatial information content than intermediate cells in the hippocampus. Despite the differences in place field characteristics, cells in both regions responded similarly to spatial and social/odor manipulations. Taken together, these data support the differentiation of some functions, together with an overlap of other functions progressing along the longitudinal axis, which may facilitate the integration of information throughout the hippocampus.

">Transcriptional Profiling of D1-MSNs Reveals SIRT1-Dependent and -Independent Responses to Chronic Social Defeat Stress</a></h4>

              
                SIRT1 is a critical regulator of neuronal functions and has been implicated in various neurological disorders, including depression. In a previous study, we demonstrated the pro-depressive roles of SIRT1 in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) using the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) model, a well-validated preclinical mouse model of depression. We found that SIRT1 modulates synaptic functions and exhibits pro-susceptible effects specifically in D1-medium spiny neurons in the NAc. In this study, we extended our investigation of SIRT1 functions by employing cell-type-specific transcriptomics to compare control and susceptible groups under CSDS. Our results revealed that in wild-type mice with functional SIRT1, cellular metabolism is crucial for inducing susceptibility to depression. Conversely, in the absence of functional SIRT1 expression, circadian clock-controlled transcriptional regulation becomes a key factor. These findings suggest that SIRT1 differentially modulates key pathophysiological mechanisms of depression via its deacetylase functions, highlighting its role in both metabolic and circadian regulation in the brain. This research provides new insights into the molecular underpinnings of depression and identifies potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

">A chemogenetic ligand-receptor pair for voltage-gated sodium channel subtype-selective inhibition</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal excitability relies on the tightly regulated expression and discrete subcellular localization of voltage-gated sodium channels (Navs). These large membrane protein complexes control the movement of sodium ions across cell membranes and are responsible for initiating and propagating action potentials. A desire to better understand the role of Nav subtypes in electrical signal conduction and the relationship between channel dysregulation and specific human pathologies (e.g., epilepsy, musculoskeletal disorders, neuropathic pain) motivates the development of high-precision pharmacological reagents to facilitate Nav studies. Investigations of Nav physiology and nerve cell conduction are limited by a lack of available methods with which to modulate acutely and reversibly the function of individual channel subtypes. Moreover, discriminating between Navs expressed in different cell types is not possible even with potent and selective ligands that target specific channel homologues. We have capitalized on both chemical design and protein engineering to advance a chemogenetic tool to inhibit a single Nav isoform. A synthetic derivative of the bis-guanidinium toxin saxitoxin (STX) is paired with two unique outer pore-forming amino acid mutations to achieve ~100:1 selectivity for the engineered channel over wild-type Nav1.1-1.4, 1.6, and 1.7. The designer ligand is nanomolar potent against the mutant channel and acts within seconds to block sodium ion conduction; washing cells with buffer solution rapidly and completely restores channel function. This technology will empower studies of Nav physiology and have additional applications for manipulating action potential signals given the requisite role of Navs in electrogenesis.

">Assessing molecular, cellular and transcriptomic bases of laminar perfusion and cytoarchitecture coupling in the human cortex</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how cellular architecture organizes cortical function requires mesoscopic approaches that resolve structure-function coupling in vivo. Here we introduce cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cell-body staining intensity (CSI) similarity index (CCSI), a localized similarity index between the CBF estimates from ultra-high-field 7T arterial spin labeling images and CSI from the BigBrain histology images to serve as a quantitative marker of laminar perfusion-cytoarchitecture coupling. CCSI revealed a reproducible, region- specific alignment between laminar vascular and cellular profiles across the cortex. Going beyond CBF, CCSI selectively tracked mitochondrial respiratory capacity and colocalized with capillary endothelial and mature non-myelination oligodendrocyte populations forming neurovascular interfaces. Transcriptomic enrichment highlighted pathways related to vascular remodeling, oxidative metabolism, and lipid-myelin homeostasis, indicating that CCSI reflects integrated metabolic-structural specialization. At the systems level, CCSI strengthened structure-function gradient correspondence in transmodal cortices, such as the default mode network. Together, these findings establish CCSI as a physiologically grounded, non-invasive marker of perfusion-cytoarchitecture alignment, providing a cross-scale framework linking cortical microstructure, metabolism, and functional organization.

">Sickness engrams modulate anticipatory immune responses</a></h4>

              
                A threat to survival in the wild is vulnerability to infection. The immune system is essential for defence against foreign species which cause sickness. During infection the brain triggers conserved behaviors, including fever, tiredness and anorexia that support immunity. The immune system stores infection information via adaptive immunity, however it remains unclear whether the brain stores immune-related information as long-term memory engrams. Here we demonstrate that mice form contextual memories for sickness events. Upon sickness-memory recall mice lower whole-body metabolism, and increase coactivation between the hippocampus and sickness regions such as the central amygdala, alongside elevated engram activation. Optogenetic reactivation of sickness engrams decreases metabolism, similar to natural recall. Finally, natural recall and artificial reactivation of a sickness-memory increased genes associated with the acute phase response in the liver. These findings suggest that sickness experiences are encoded as engrams, which upon reactivation trigger coordinated metabolic and innate immune responses.

">Does wearable neurofeedback training improve memory aptitudes in healthy adults?--A systematic review and meta-analysis</a></h4>

              
                Neurofeedback training (NFT) provides individuals with real-time feedback on their brain activity, enabling voluntary modulation. Interest in NFT for memory enhancement has surpassed the cumulative evidence in healthy adults, especially for modalities feasible outside of laboratory settings. To address this gap, this systematic review and meta-analysis focused on electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), both of which are portable and widely accessible. Randomized controlled trials published between January 1990 and September 2022 were retrieved from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and APA PsycInfo. Of the 44 eligible studies, 24 reported sufficient data for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Using a random-effects model, we found that NFT produced a small-to-moderate improvement in memory performance (standardized mean difference = 0.28; 95% confidence interval = 0.065-0.48; t(11.9) = 2.86; p = 0.014), with moderate heterogeneity. No publication bias was detected. Subgroup meta-analyses revealed significant effects in younger adults, for EEG-based protocols, and in tasks assessing verbal and short-term memory tasks. Meta-regression identified a positive association between daily session duration and effect size, with sessions longer than 30 minutes more likely to produce positive effects. As effects also varied by targeted brain regions and EEG frequency bands used for neurofeedback, protocol differences likely contributed to the observed variability in outcomes. Long-term follow-up is warranted to determine the persistence of NFT effects.

">Influence of exoskeleton stiffness on primary afferent feedback during stretch perturbations of isolated muscle-tendon unit</a></h4>

              
                Exoskeletons assist and augment human movement, but their effects on proprioceptive feedback remain poorly understood. We examined how parallel exoskeleton stiffness influences primary muscle spindle firing. In an anesthetized rat preparation, controlled stretches of the medial gastrocnemius were applied with springs (0-0.5 N/mm) attached in parallel to the muscle-tendon unit (MTU) to simulate passive exoskeleton assistance. Fascicle length was measured with sonomicrometry, force and MTU length with a servo motor, and spindle instantaneous firing rate (IFR) with dorsal root recordings. Increasing exoskeleton stiffness decreased biological muscle force (3.1 {+/-} 0.6 N to 1.6 {+/-} 0.6 N, p < 0.001) and stiffness (4.4 {+/-} 1.5 N/mm to 2.3 {+/-} 1.3 N/mm, p < 0.01), while fascicle length increased (7.9 {+/-} 1.3 mm to 8.3 {+/-} 1.5 mm, p < 0.005). Despite these altered mechanics, spindle firing did not significantly change, and showed weak correlations with muscle length, velocity, force, and yank (R2 > 0.14). These results indicate that exoskeleton stiffness modifies fascicle dynamics without altering spindle firing. Previously proposed models of primary afferent firing did not sufficiently explain these results. This is the first in situ investigation of exoskeleton effects on primary afferent feedback during active contractions.

">Efficient mixed representation of active and passive motion in the mouse visual thalamus during natural behaviour</a></h4>

              
                During natural behaviour, changes in the visual scene are largely driven by the subject's own movements, which can be actively generated (e.g., walking) or passively imposed by external forces (e.g., riding a vehicle). How the visual system represents such active and passive motion components is poorly understood. To address these questions, we developed an assay to dissect the motion of freely moving mice into active and passive components and to study its influence upon neural activity in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and adjacent regions. Chronically implanted mice were placed in an arena where they actively moved; at irregular intervals, the arena was tilted, resulting in passive movement. We then used 3D tracking to decompose mouse head motion into active and passive components. We observed widespread responses to tilt events in dLGN, which persisted in darkness. Light-responsive units exhibited mixed selectivity for active and passive motion, primarily encoding the speed of self-motion irrespectively of its causes. However, individual neurons varied in their relative tuning to active versus passive components, allowing partial separation at the population level. Furthermore, a decoding analysis showed that population activity decorrelated active and passive head motion signals by representing their leading principal components. Together, these results indicate that, during natural behaviour, the visual thalamus takes advantage of the coupled dynamics of active and passive movements to encode an efficient, low-dimensional representation of the subject's motion.

">Structured and Target-Specific Development of Cortico-Cortical Connectivity in the Mouse Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian cortex exhibits highly stereotyped long-range connectivity, yet the developmental principles that specify precise cortico-cortical projection patterns remain poorly defined. Two dominant models propose that target specificity arises either from early inter-regional exuberant outgrowth followed by pruning, or through initially directed axonal targeting. To resolve this, we systematically mapped the postnatal development of V1 cortico-cortical projection neurons (CCPNs) to eleven higher visual areas (HVAs) in mice using rapid and complementary retrograde, anterograde, and single-cell tracing methods. We found that V1[-&gt;]HVA connectivity develops via spatiotemporally staggered axon extension and pruning programs, aligned with target position along the medial-lateral axis. Reciprocal HVA[-&gt;]V1 feedback emerges concurrently and is refined over time, yielding gradually aligned bidirectional connectivity. Notably, both multiplexed retrograde tracing and MAPseq-based single-cell profiling revealed that individual V1 neurons initialize and retain specific projection motifs with limited variation over development, arguing against global exuberance followed by selective, inter-areal pruning. Instead, our findings support a directed guidance model, in which distinct V1 CCPN subtypes establish selective projection patterns early, followed by local, target-dependent refinement. This structured yet heterogeneous developmental strategy provides an anatomical framework for how precise long-range cortical networks emerge.

">Ablation of microglial estrogen receptor alpha predisposes to diet-induced obesity in male mice</a></h4>

              
                Estrogen receptor alpha (ER) signaling has metabolic and anti-inflammatory properties in addition to its impact on reproductive function. In male but not female mice, inflammatory activation of microglia, the resident macrophages of the brain, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diet-induced obesity (DIO), raising the possibility that differences in microglial estrogen signaling may account for the sexual dimorphism. In this study, we assessed metabolic and CNS histopathological properties in a mouse model with inducible microglia-specific ablation of ER (MG-ERKO). Male MG-ERKO mice developed increased weight gain and insulin resistance relative to controls during high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. Indirect calorimetry analysis revealed that reduced energy expenditure was the main driver of the obese phenotype. In contrast, female MG-ERKO mice fed HFD developed mild insulin resistance with no change in body weight gain compared to controls. Immunohistochemical analyses of the microglial activation marker IBA1 in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) revealed that female MG-ERKO mice had increased number of microglia without showing morphological signs of activation. In contrast, MBH microglial number was unchanged in MG-ERKO male mice, but the cells adopted more activated morphological profiles. Finally, HFD-fed MG-ERKO male mice had increased POMC neuron-microglia interactions but fewer overall hypothalamic POMC neurons, suggesting microglia may disrupt POMC neuron integrity to promote DIO. Together, these findings indicate that sex-specific actions of estrogen in microglia limit the metabolic complications of HFD feeding.

">Emotional Responses to Naturalistic and AI-generated Affective Pictures: A Systematic Comparison</a></h4>

              
                Pictures depicting naturalistic scenes are widely used in studies of human emotion. However, the practical use of affective pictures is limited by several factors, including the difficulty of obtaining content-diverse, high-quality, openly accessible, and standardized stimuli that are necessary for specific research questions. The use of artificially generated (AI) pictures could address this limitation, but it is unclear if AI-generated pictures evoke reliable emotional responses. The present study sought to address these challenges by comparing emotional responses to AI-generated pictures with responses to original, standardized, pictures. In two study iterations, standardized pictures containing pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant content were selected from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) and other sources. Then, a matched AI-counterpart was created for each original picture using generative deep neural networks. A total of 109 participants viewed the picture sets while pupil diameter and electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded. Evaluative ratings of hedonic valence and emotional arousal were also collected. For both AI and original exemplars, pictures depicting emotional content elicited stronger responses than neutral content for ratings and EEG-derived variables, with weaker effect sizes for the AI-generated pictures. Furthermore, picture-level analyses found that ratings and EEG measures were strongly correlated between matched AI and original pictures. Pupil data also showed the expected content effects in study iteration 2, but not in iteration 1. Together, this initial study suggests that AI-generated picture sets can effectively elicit well-established self-reported affect and physiological responses, presenting a promising avenue for future studies of human emotion.

                Over the past decade, studies in EMI contexts describe a range of music-based interventions for EFL learners that generally fall into several categories. Many interventions rely on song listening as the core activity. Some studies use song listening alone, while others combine it with activities such as lyric analysis, dictation, gap-filling, or group discussion. Digital platforms—via Spotify, YouTube, LyricsTraining, and other web-based tools—have also been deployed to deliver authentic music experiences and provide interactive feedback. A smaller set of studies reports the use of music cloze exercises, jazz chants, pop music selections, children’s songs, humorous songs, and even singing paired with body movement or drama to enhance engagement and fluency. Quantitative reports detail meaningful improvements. For example, one study documented an increase in mean engagement scores from 3.06 to 7 following a 10-week song listening intervention, while another showed test scores rising from 65% to 82% when song listening was coupled with lyric analysis. Other studies note enhancements in reduced form recognition, listening comprehension, and overall motivation. Together, these findings illustrate that music-based interventions—whether grounded in traditional song listening or enhanced by digital and interactive components—are associated with increased listening engagement and measurable gains in fluency.

                Non-heteronormative persons within South African Pentecostal communities experience unique challenges that arise from the intersection of sexual orientation and religious belief. Although the South African constitutional framework ostensibly grants rights and protections to sexually diverse individuals, Pentecostal expressions of Christianity largely continue to uphold heteronormative understandings, rendering sexual diversity undesirable and invisible. This scoping review paper aims to systematically map the literature on the experiences, theological discourses, and pastoral care of non-heteronormative persons in South African Pentecostalism, utilising Arksey and O’Malley’s framework. By analysing, collating, and summarising the existing body of work, the review aims to identify categories of evidence and information gaps to facilitate the possibility of further developing inclusive theological and pastoral practices and paradigms within/pastoral care within South African Pentecostalism. Ultimately, the findings will guide researchers, policymakers, and faith communities in devising interventions and responses to foster acceptance, inclusion, and well-being.

                Global climate change poses significant challenges to human health and nutrition, particularly affecting lactating individuals and their infants. This review examines the impact of climate change on lactation, focusing on physiological, socioeconomic, and public health implications. Rising temperatures and heat stress can reduce milk production and alter milk composition, while malnutrition and water scarcity exacerbate these effects. Vulnerable populations face heightened risks, emphasizing the need for targeted mitigation strategies. Recommendations include enhancing nutritional support, securing water supplies, reducing environmental toxin exposure, and integrating lactation considerations into climate policies. Employing a social-ecological lens, this review underscores the necessity of a holistic approach to support lactating individuals in a warming world. Future research should explore the complex interactions between climate stressors and lactation to develop effective public health interventions.

                The farming industry faces continuous threats from pest control and farm security issues because rodents cause significant damage to crops and disrupt farm operations. Traditional pest control methods require continuous human interaction which proves both resource-intensive and inefficient. Modern agricultural practices benefit from sustainable solutions through the combination of renewable energy with smart technologies. This research presents an innovative solar-powered motion-sensor system that utilizes OpenCV and YOLOv8 computer vision frameworks to autonomously detect and classify rodent intruders on farmland real-time. The system demonstrates its ability to detect and prevent rodent intruders according to initial testing results. The OpenCV/YOLO system uses motion sensor signals to analyze movement patterns before distinguishing rodents in their various groups. The solar-powered system operates continuously which decreases human intervention needs and enhances farm surveillance capabilities. The model demonstrates its capability to defend crops from rodent damage and enhance farm resistance against land degradation threats, resulting to improved crop yield and management. KPIs have been evaluable to prove the system’s efficiency and reliable to be used in agricultural practices to manage animal pests. The current system encounters problems with detecting wild animals beyond rodents as well as tracking rodent activity beneath ground level. Future developments could include improved pest capture systems alongside enhanced surveillance features for detecting both unauthorized human intruders and large animals. Future research should also invest in real-time implementation in fields with real data. The automated monitoring technology needs to be integrated with reliable sources of energy to create sustainable agricultural operations that are efficient and resilient, hence enhancing food security.

                Background Micro and small enterprises (MSEs) are pivotal to economic development, yet their growth is often constrained by limited financial capabilities and restricted access to finance. Among Muslim women entrepreneurs in Mbarara City, Uganda, these challenges are compounded by gendered financial barriers and adherence to Islamic financial principles. While financial literacy and debt management skills are known drivers of performance, the mechanisms through which these skills translate into tangible business outcomes remain underexplored. This study investigates whether access to finance mediates the relationship between debt management skills and the performance of Muslim women-owned MSEs. Methods A cross-sectional design was employed using purposive sampling to select 170 Muslim women-owned MSEs in Mbarara City. Data were collected through a structured questionnaire and analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) in SmartPLS 4. The study assessed the measurement and structural models for reliability, validity, and predictive accuracy, and mediation was tested using the Sobel and bootstrapping methods. Results Findings revealed a significant partial mediating effect of access to finance on the relationship between debt management skills and business performance (Sobel z = 8.6661, p < 0.001). Approximately 52.9% of the total effect of debt management on performance operated indirectly through access to finance, while 47.1% was direct. The model explained 97.0% of the variance in performance and 94.4% in access to finance, with strong reliability and validity indicators (Cronbach’s α = 0.938–0.968; AVE = 0.940–0.956). The model fit indices (SRMR = 0.016; NFI = 0.901) confirmed an excellent fit. Overall, debt management skills significantly enhanced both access to finance (β = 0.313, p < 0.001) and performance (β = 0.342, p < 0.001). Conclusion Access to finance significantly amplifies the impact of debt management skills on business performance, underscoring its critical mediating role. The findings affirm that financial competence alone is insufficient without corresponding access to financial resources. Recommendations Integrated interventions that combine financial literacy training especially in debt management, budgeting, and Sharia-compliant finance with enhanced access to affordable, gender-sensitive financial products are essential to bridge the capability resource gap and promote sustainable growth among Muslim women-owned MSEs.

                This quantitative study investigates the current landscape of inclusive education for children with special needs in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, with a focus on identifying perceived barriers, assessing institutional support, and quantifying the attitudes of key stakeholders, including teachers, special educators, school administrators, and parents. Drawing on a sample of 550 participants across three major districts of Jeddah, the research utilized a structured questionnaire incorporating Likert-scale items to capture perceptions of inclusion, obstacles to implementation, and the systemic support available in schools. Descriptive analysis revealed generally positive attitudes toward inclusive education (M = 3.85), though moderate levels of perceived barriers (M = 2.90) and institutional support (M = 3.23) suggest significant implementation challenges remain. ANOVA and t-tests showed no statistically significant differences in attitudes across gender or professional roles, indicating a shared understanding of inclusive values across stakeholder groups. However, regression analysis showed no significant predictors of attitudes in a linear model, whereas path analysis revealed that institutional support had a strong positive effect (β = 0.431, p < 0.0001), and perceived barriers had a significant negative effect (β = -0.270, p < 0.0001). These findings underscore the importance of structural and systemic factors in shaping inclusive education outcomes. The study concludes with recommendations for improving institutional support, enhancing teacher training, and fostering inclusive infrastructure, while also noting limitations related to geography and self-reporting. The research contributes to Saudi Arabia’s broader Vision 2030 goals by offering evidence-based insights for creating a more inclusive and equitable education system.

Considerable effort has been paid to improving diagnostic testing for human, plant and animal diseases, including strategies for targeting the use of diagnostic tests towards individuals who are more likely to be infected. We use machine learning to assess the surrounding risk landscape under which a diagnostic test is applied to augment its interpretation. We develop this to predict the occurrence of bovine tuberculosis incidents in cattle herds, exploiting the availability of exceptionally detailed testing records. We show that, without compromising test specificity, test sensitivity can be improved so that the proportion of infected herds detected improves by over 5 percentage points, or 240 additional infected herds detected in one year beyond those detected by the skin test alone. We also use feature importance testing for assessing the weighting of risk factors. While many factors are associated with increased risk of incidents, of note are several factors that suggest that in some herds there is a higher risk of infection going undetected.

                <p>by Emmanuelle A. Dankwa, Léa Cavalli, Ruchita Balasubramanian, Melike Hazal Can, Hening Cui, Katherine M. Jia, Yunfei Li, Sylvia K. Ofori, Nicole A. Swartwood, Carrie G. Wade, Caroline O. Buckee, Jeffrey W. Imai-Eaton, Nicolas A. Menzies</p>
Objective/Background <p>Transmission-dynamic models are commonly used to study infectious disease epidemiology. Calibration involves identifying model parameter values that align model outputs with observed data or other evidence. Inaccurate calibration and inconsistent reporting produce inference errors and limit reproducibility, compromising confidence in the validity of modeled results. No standardized framework exists for reporting on calibration of infectious disease models, and an understanding of current calibration approaches is lacking.</p> Methods <p>We developed the Purpose-Inputs-Process-Outputs (PIPO) framework for reporting calibration practices and applied it in a scoping review to assess calibration approaches and evaluate reporting comprehensiveness in transmission-dynamic models of tuberculosis, HIV and malaria published between January 1, 2018, and January 16, 2024. We searched relevant databases and websites to identify eligible publications, including peer-reviewed studies where these models were calibrated to empirical data or published estimates.</p> Results <p>We identified 411 eligible studies encompassing 419 models, with 74% (n = 309) being compartmental models and 20% (n = 81) individual-based models (IBMs). The predominant analytical purpose was to evaluate interventions (71% of models, n = 298). Parameters were calibrated mainly because they were unknown or ambiguous (40%, n = 168), or because determining their value was relevant to the scientific question beyond being necessary to run the model (20%, n = 85). The choice of calibration method was significantly associated with model structure (p-value<0.001) and stochasticity (p-value = 0.006), with approximate Bayesian computation more frequently used with IBMs and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo with compartmental models. Regarding reporting comprehensiveness, all PIPO framework items were reported in 4% (n = 18) of models; 11–14 items in 66% (n = 277), and 10 or fewer items in 28% (n = 124). Implementation code was the least reported, available in only 20% (n = 82) of models.</p> Conclusions <p>Reporting on calibration is heterogeneous in recent infectious disease modeling literature. Our proposed framework for reporting of calibration approaches could support improved reproducibility and credibility of modeled analyses.</p>
