              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Mimics of Pediatric Small Vessel Primary Angiitis of the Central Nervous System</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Small vessel primary angiitis of the central nervous system is a rare and often severe disease characterized by central nervous system-restricted inflammatory vasculitis on histopathology. Diagnosis requires brain biopsy for confirmation and is suggested prior to starting immunotherapy when feasible. However, emerging evidence suggests that other neuroinflammatory conditions may have a clinical and radiographic phenotype that mimics small vessel primary angiitis, at times with overlapping pathologic features as well. Such diagnoses, including anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody associated disease and central nervous system-restricted hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, can be non-invasively diagnosed with serum antibody or genetic testing that would prompt different monitoring and treatment paradigms. To determine the ultimate diagnosis of patients who were suspected prior to biopsy to have small vessel primary angiitis, we reviewed the clinical, radiographic and pathological features of a cohort of patients at a single center undergoing brain biopsy for non-oncologic indications.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical data was retrospectively extracted from the medical record. Pathology and neuroimaging review was conducted.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 21 patients over a 19-year time-period, of whom 14 (66.7%) were ultimately diagnosed with entities other than small vessel primary angiitis that would have obviated the need for brain biopsy. Diagnoses included anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody associated disease (n=9), central nervous system-restricted hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (n=3), anti-GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor encephalitis (n=1), and Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (n=1).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study highlights the importance of pursuing now readily available non-invasive testing for mimicking diagnoses before performing a brain biopsy for suspected small vessel primary angiitis of the central nervous system.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Non-invasive classification of macrophage polarisation by 2P-FLIM and machine learning</a></h4>

              
                In this study, we utilise fluorescence lifetime imaging of NAD(P)H-based cellular autofluorescence as a non-invasive modality to classify two contrasting states of human macrophages by proxy of their governing metabolic state. Macrophages derived from human blood-circulating monocytes were polarised using established protocols and metabolically challenged using small molecules to validate their responding metabolic actions in extracellular acidification and oxygen consumption. Large field-of-view images of individual polarised macrophages were obtained using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). These were challenged in real time with small-molecule perturbations of metabolism during imaging. We uncovered FLIM parameters that are pronounced under the action of carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), which strongly stratifies the phenotype of polarised human macrophages; however, this performance is impacted by donor variability when analysing the data at a single-cell level. The stratification and parameters emanating from a full field-of-view and single-cell FLIM approach serve as the basis for machine learning models. Applying a random forests model, we identify three strongly governing FLIM parameters, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC-AUC) value of 0.944 and out-of-bag (OBB) error rate of 16.67% when classifying human macrophages in a full field-of-view image. To conclude, 2P-FLIM with the integration of machine learning models is showed to be a powerful technique for analysis of both human macrophage metabolism and polarisation at full FoV and single-cell level.

	<p>The main objective of this study was to demonstrate that computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling can be used to study the contribution of covert and overt vascular architecture to the risk for cerebrovascular disease in sickle cell disease (SCD) and to determine the mechanisms of response to therapy such as chronic red blood cell (cRBC) transfusions. We analyzed baseline (screening), pre-randomization and study exit magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) images from 10 (5 each from the transfusion and observation arms) pediatric sickle SCD participants in the silent cerebral infarct transfusion (SIT) trial using CFD modeling. We reconstructed the intracranial portion of the internal carotid artery and branches and extracted the geometry using 3D Slicer. We cut specific portions of the large intracranial artery to include segments of the internal carotid, middle, anterior, and posterior cerebral arteries such that the vessel segment analyzed extended from the intracranial beginning of the internal carotid artery up to immediately after (~0.25 inches) the middle cerebral artery branching point. Cut models were imported into Ansys 2021R2/2022R1 and laminar and time-dependent flow simulation was performed. Change in time averaged mean velocity, wall shear stress, and vessel tortuosity were compared between the observation and cRBC arms. We did not observe a correlation between time averaged mean velocity (TAMV) and mean transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocity at study entry. There was also no difference in change in time average mean velocity, wall shear stress (WSS), and vessel tortuosity between the observation and cRBC transfusion arms. WSS and TAMV were abnormal for 2 (developed TIA) out of the 3 participants (one participant had silent cerebral infarctions) that developed neurovascular outcomes. CFD approaches allow for the evaluation of vascular topology and hemodynamics in SCD using MRA images. In this proof of principle study, we show that CFD could be a useful tool and we intend to carry out future studies with a larger sample to enable more robust conclusions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Emx1-Cre Is Expressed in Peripheral Autonomic Ganglia That Regulate Central Cardiorespiratory Functions</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The Emx1-IRES-Cre transgenic mouse is commonly used to direct genetic recombination in forebrain excitatory neurons. However, the original study reported that Emx1-Cre is also expressed embryonically in peripheral autonomic ganglia, which could potentially affect the interpretation of targeted circuitry contributing to systemic phenotypes. Here, we report that Emx1-Cre is expressed in the afferent vagus nerve system involved in autonomic cardiorespiratory regulatory pathways. Our imaging studies revealed expression of Emx1-Cre driven tdtomato fluorescence in the afferent vagus nerve innervating the dorsal medulla of brainstem, cell bodies in the nodose ganglion, and their potential target structures at the carotid bifurcation such as the carotid sinus and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG). Photostimulation of the afferent terminals in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) <I>in vitro</I> using Emx1-Cre driven ChR2 reliably evoked EPSCs in the postsynaptic neurons with electrophysiological characteristics consistent with the vagus afferent nerves. In addition, optogenetic stimulation targeting the Emx1-Cre expressing structures identified in this study, such as vagus nerve, carotid bifurcation, and the dorsal medulla surface transiently depressed cardiorespiratory rate in urethane anesthetized mice <I>in vivo</I>. Together, our study demonstrates that Emx1-IRES-Cre is expressed in the key peripheral autonomic nerve system and can modulate cardiorespiratory function independently of forebrain expression. These results raise caution when interpreting systemic phenotypes of Emx1-IRES-Cre conditional recombinant mice, and also suggest the utility of this line to investigate modulators of the afferent vagal system.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Perinatal Morphine Exposure Leads to Sex-Dependent Executive Function Deficits and Microglial Changes in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Children exposed prenatally to opioids are at an increased risk for behavioral problems and executive function deficits. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) and amygdala (AMG) regulate executive function and social behavior and are sensitive to opioids prenatally. Opioids can bind to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to activate microglia, which may be developmentally important for synaptic pruning. Therefore, we tested the effects of perinatal morphine exposure on executive function and social behavior in male and female mouse offspring, along with microglial-related and synaptic-related outcomes. Dams were injected once daily subcutaneously with saline (<I>n</I> = 8) or morphine (MO; 10 mg/kg; <I>n</I> = 12) throughout pregestation, gestation, and lactation until offspring were weaned on postnatal day 21 (P21). Male MO offspring had impairments in attention and accuracy in the five-choice serial reaction time task, while female MO offspring were less affected. Targeted gene expression analysis at P21 in the PFC identified alterations in microglial-related and TLR4-related genes, while immunohistochemical analysis in adult brains indicated decreased microglial Iba1 and phagocytic CD68 proteins in the PFC and AMG in males, but females had an increase. Further, both male and female MO offspring had increased social preference. Overall, these data demonstrate male vulnerability to executive function deficits in response to perinatal opioid exposure and evidence for disruptions in neuron&ndash;microglial signaling.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Frmpd1 Facilitates Trafficking of G-Protein Transducin and Modulates Synaptic Function in Rod Photoreceptors of Mammalian Retina</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Trafficking of transducin (G&alpha;<SUB>t</SUB>) in rod photoreceptors is critical for adaptive and modulatory responses of the retina to varying light intensities. In addition to fine-tuning phototransduction gain in rod outer segments (OSs), light-induced translocation of G&alpha;<SUB>t</SUB> to the rod synapse enhances rod to rod bipolar synaptic transmission. Here, we show that the rod-specific loss of Frmpd1 (FERM and PDZ domain containing 1), in the retina of both female and male mice, results in delayed return of G&alpha;<SUB>t</SUB> from the synapse back to outer segments in the dark, compromising the capacity of rods to recover from light adaptation. Frmpd1 directly interacts with Gpsm2 (G-protein signaling modulator 2), and the two proteins are required for appropriate sensitization of rod-rod bipolar signaling under saturating light conditions. These studies provide insight into how the trafficking and function of G&alpha;<SUB>t</SUB> is modulated to optimize the photoresponse and synaptic transmission of rod photoreceptors in a light-dependent manner.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Commanding or Being a Simple Intermediary: How Does It Affect Moral Behavior and Related Brain Mechanisms?</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Psychology and neuroscience research have shown that fractioning operations among several individuals along a hierarchical chain allows diffusing responsibility between components of the chain, which has the potential to disinhibit antisocial actions. Here, we present two studies, one using fMRI (Study 1) and one using EEG (Study 2), designed to help understand how commanding or being in an intermediary position impacts the sense of agency and empathy for pain. In the age of military drones, we also explored whether commanding a human or robot agent influences these measures. This was done within a single behavioral paradigm in which participants could freely decide whether or not to send painful shocks to another participant in exchange for money. In Study 1, fMRI reveals that activation in social cognition-related and empathy-related brain regions was equally low when witnessing a victim receive a painful shock while participants were either commander or simple intermediary transmitting an order, compared with being the agent directly delivering the shock. In Study 2, results indicated that the sense of agency did not differ between commanders and intermediary, no matter whether the executing agent was a robot or a human. However, we observed that the neural response over P3 event-related potential was higher when the executing agent was a robot compared with a human. Source reconstruction of the EEG signal revealed that this effect was mediated by areas including the insula and ACC. Results are discussed regarding the interplay between the sense of agency and empathy for pain for decision-making.</p>

                <p>Here, we report the generation and comprehensive characterization of a knock-in mouse model for the hotspot p.Arg87Cys variant of the cytoplasmic FMR1-interacting protein 2 (<i>CYFIP2</i>) gene, which was recently identified in individuals diagnosed with West syndrome, a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. The <i>Cyfip2</i>
<sup>
   <i>+/R87C</i>
</sup> mice recapitulated many neurological and neurobehavioral phenotypes of the patients, including spasm-like movements, microcephaly, and impaired social communication. Age-progressive cytoarchitectural disorganization and gliosis were also identified in the hippocampus of <i>Cyfip2</i>
<sup>
   <i>+/R87C</i>
</sup> mice. Beyond identifying a decrease in CYFIP2 protein levels in the <i>Cyfip2</i>
<sup>
   <i>+/R87C</i>
</sup> brains, we demonstrated that the p.Arg87Cys variant enhances ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of CYFIP2.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Nocturnal Pulse Event Frequency is Reduced in Multiple System Atrophy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Risk of sudden death in multiple system atrophy (MSA) is greatest during sleep with unknown mechanisms<b>.</b> We compared nocturnal pulse event frequency in 46 MSA patients and age-sex matched controls undergoing overnight pulse oximetry. Nocturnal oxyhemoglobin desaturation indices (ODI) and pulse event indices (PEI) were recorded and relationships between pulse oximetry variables and survival were analyzed. MSA patients had lower PEI (3.1 ± 5.3 vs. 12.8 ± 10.8, p &lt;0.001) despite greater hypoxic burden and similar frequency of respiratory events. Nocturnal pulse events were not associated with severity of daytime autonomic failure. Two MSA patients had suspected sudden death, both with severely reduced PEI. MSA patients have fewer nocturnal pulse events compared with controls, despite similar respiratory event frequency, suggesting abnormal cardiac responses to sleep disordered breathing. Whether this contributes to sudden death in MSA requires further study.</p>

                The article presents a dataset on the characteristics of stablecoins. Stablecoins represent a relatively young but increasingly important branch of the cryptocurrency market. Although they all share the same goal of maintaining a stable value in the digital market, they form a highly heterogeneous group. They differ in terms of collateral and stabilization mechanism, peg, availability of the technical documentation, presence on crypto exchanges or age. The dataset is cross-sectional and was created based on internet research. Individual information was collected from websites of the stablecoin projects and a crypto-data aggregator, and to a lesser extent from other auxiliary sources (websites related to finance and cryptocurrencies). The dataset is unique as there are no publicly available databases encompassing the features of stablecoins. It can be used in all stablecoin-related analyses to characterise the examined coins and to investigate the relationship between cryptocurrency market developments and stablecoin features.

                Background: Medicines that are expired or deteriorated within a household must be disposed of in an effective and environmentally friendly manner, to the point that they do not end up being a risk to the community and the environment. To do this, the members of Peruvian households must have the knowledge and the appropriate attitude, together with the necessary tools for the effective disposal of these drugs. For this reason, the research objective is as follows: to evaluates the relationship between the level of knowledge and attitudes on how to dispose of medicines in households in the district of San Juan de Miraflores. Methods: Hypothetical-deductive, quantitative approach, applied type and non-experimental, observational design, for which 385 households in the district of San Juan de Miraflores were surveyed. Results: 48.3% of the respondents have an average level of knowledge of how to dispose of medicines. 93.2% of the respondents have a positive attitude towards the disposal of medicines, and there is a relationship between the level of knowledge and attitude towards the disposal of medicines (P-value = 0.000). Conclusions: Increased knowledge is associated with a better attitude to the disposal of medicines.

                Background: Given the chemical richness of medicinal plants (Bidens pilosa L. and Croton floccosus) in Ecuador, they are considered the natural source of numerous medicines. Methods: The leaves were dried at 40°C and 50°C and the extracts were characterized by means of phytochemical screening, verifying the presence of secondary metabolites such as alkaloids, reducing sugars, phenols, flavonoids, tannins and saponins. Three extraction processes were carried out, with two solvents of different polarities: hexane and ethanol. The extraction methods that were applied to the leaves of the plants were Soxhlet, ultrasonic bath and maceration, the latter two at room temperature and Soxhlet at the boiling temperature of the solvent. Determination of the total content of phenols and flavonoids is carried out using the Follin-Ciocalteau colorimetric reaction, Quercetin standard, Aluminum Chloride solution measured with a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The antioxidant activity was performed with the DPPH radical and measured with the same equipment. Results: The highest content of total phenols obtained by employing the Soxhlet method for extraction when the material was dried at 50°C was 48.609 ± 0.370 mg GAE/g of dry sample for Bidens pilosa L. while in the case of Croton floccosus it was 128.212 ± 0.601 mg GAE/g of dry sample obtained from the extraction by means of maceration. Finally, the antioxidant activity against the 1.1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl radical was determined, and it was found that the Bidens pilosa L. species performed better and responded better to the test, with an IC50 value of 239.33 µg/mL, than Croton floccosus (IC50 of 644.125 µg/mL). Conclusions: The following preliminary phytochemical study of the Bidens pilosa L. and Croton floccosus plants provided important information on the content of secondary metabolites and response to the DPPH radical reported for the first time in Ecuador, which may be future use for medicinal application.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Potential impact of artificial intelligence on the emerging world order [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The fast-paced diffusion of technologies broadly falling under the umbrella of artificial intelligence (AI) is said to be shaping the emerging world order in international relations (IR). It is expected that the global AI race will pave the way for another rise and fall of great powers in the international system, similar to the impact caused by the three industrial revolutions of the past. The literature in IR identifies three major powers – namely, the United States of America (USA), China, and Russia, as the leading contenders in this AI race. The ongoing AI-enabled fourth industrial revolution is all the more unique due to the markedly different approaches these three powers have adopted for integrating AI into their military, political, and socio-economic spheres. The AI strategies of these countries further reflect their capabilities and intentions towards how they plan on employing the technology to elevate their prestige and power status in the international system. This paper draws from a historiography of the First, Second, and Third Industrial Revolutions to study how technological innovations have altered relative power capabilities of nations, triggering a re-ordering of power hierarchies at a systemic level. Drawing from this understanding, it analyses the nature of AI as an emerging technology and assesses whether it can cause systemic alterations. It critically examines and compares the AI strategies of the USA, China, and Russia as leading contenders in the global AI race and outlines their strengths and weaknesses. It further draws from the Adoption Capacity Theory to argue that the AI race may well be determined by the relative capacity of the major institutions in each of these countries to manage and adapt to the disruptions this technology is bound to bring to the fore.

                Background: The aim was to evaluate the antifungal activity of propolis extract against Candida albicans (or C. albicans) in patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis. Methods: The research presents a quantitative approach with an experimental design, with a population of C. albicans strains isolated from patients diagnosed with vulvovaginal candidiasis who were admitted to the Gynecology Service of the Maria del Socorro Clinic, district of Ate, Lima; a sample of 34 strains was chosen in total, considering three repetitions per strain, obtaining 102 experimental units. The antifungal susceptibility test was carried out by the disc diffusion plate method using a single concentration of propolis extract, with fluconazole as a positive control. Results: Propolis extract was shown to inhibit all strains of C. albicans, as was fluconazole, with the effect of the latter being significantly greater than that of the product under investigation. Conclusions: The conclusion is that propolis extract does show antifungal activity against C. albicans in patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis.

                Background: Drinking coffee is known to have both positive and negative aftermath on periodontal health. The current study is aiming to systematically review the impact of coffee consumption on periodontal health status. Methods: An article search was carried out in two electronic databases (PUBMED and Web of Sciences). The assessment of the included articles were conducted using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tool. Data were analyzed qualitatively. Result: A total of 10 articles were included in this study. Most (5) of the studies discovered a negative correlation between coffee intake and periodontal health, while 4 other studies found the protective effect of daily coffee consumption against alveolar bone loss. Last, only one study found that coffee intake did not relate with periodontitis. Conclusion: The effect of coffee consumption on periodontal health was fragmented since coffee has complex components that may give either beneficial effects or negative impact on periodontal health.

                Background: Areca nut (Areca catechu Linn.) is the seed of the fruit of the oriental palm that is commonly used among Southeast Asian communities. Chrysanthemum (Dendrathema grandiflora) is a flowering plant originating from East Asia and dominantly grows in China. Both of these plants have strong antioxidant activities. To investigate the mechanism of their wound healing activities, we prepared areca nut and chrysanthemum polyethylene oral gel and performed several in vivo assays using Sprague–Dawley rats. Methods: Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into five groups: Negative control group (rats with base gel treatment), positive control group (rats treated with triamcinolone acetonide), F1 (treatment with 20% areca nut:80% chrysanthemum), F2 (treatment with 50% areca nut:50% chrysanthemum), and F3 (treatment with 80% areca nut:20% chrysanthemum). Traumatic ulcers were performed on the buccal mucosa of all experimental animals that received topical oral gel and triamcinolone acetonide twice a day for seven days. The clinical and histological characteristics were analyzed and scored. Results: During the six days, the ulcerated area receded linearly over time and was completely cicatrized in F2, F3, and positive control group (Dependent t-test, p<0.05). There were significant increases in body weight in F2 and positive control groups. There were no significant differences between groups in histology examination (Kruskal Wallis test, p<0.05). The moderate score of TNF-α levels was seen in F2 and positive control groups (ANOVA/Tukey test, p<0.05). In the collagenases assay, a high concentration of areca nut (F3) induced the abundance of collagen during the ulcer healing process. Conclusions: The combination of areca nut and chrysanthemum extract in the oral gel can optimize the healing of traumatic oral ulcers in Sprague-Dawley rats through the increase of TNF-α and collagen deposition.

                Background: Since the beginning of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak, different animal species have been implicated as possible intermediate hosts that could facilitate the transmission of the virus between species. The detection of these hosts has intensified, reporting wild, zoo, farm, and pet animals. The goal of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins (IgG) in domestic dogs and cats and its epidemiological association with the frequency of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients in Villavicencio, Colombia. Methods: 300 dogs and 135 cats were randomly selected in a two-stage distribution by clusters according to COVID-19 cases (positive RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2) within the human population distributed within the eight communes of Villavicencio. Indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique was applied in order to determine anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in sera samples. Kernel density estimation was used to compare the prevalence of COVID-19 cases with the seropositivity of dogs and cats. Results: The overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 4.6% (95% CI=3.2-7.4). In canines, 3.67% (95% CI=2.1-6.4) and felines 6.67% (95% CI=3.6-12.18). Kernel density estimation indicated that seropositive cases were concentrated in the southwest region of the city. There was a positive association between SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in pet animals and their habitat in Commune 2 (adjusted OR=5.84; 95% CI=1.1-30.88). Spearman's correlation coefficients were weakly positive (p=0.32) between the ratio of COVID-19 cases in November 2020 and the results for domestic dogs and cats from the eight communes of Villavicencio. Conclusions: In the present research cats were more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection than dogs. This study provides the first positive results of anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA serological tests in domestic dogs and cats in Colombia with information about the virus transmission dynamics in Latin America during the COVID-19 pandemic.

                Background: Reelin has fundamental functions in the developing and mature brain. Its absence gives rise to the Reeler phenotype in mice, the first described cerebellar mutation. In homozygous mutants missing the Reelin gene (reln-/-), neurons are incapable of correctly positioning themselves in layered brain areas such as the cerebral and cerebellar cortices. We here demonstrate that by employing ex vivo cultured cerebellar slices one can reduce the number of animals and use a non-recovery procedure to analyze the effects of Reelin on the migration of Purkinje neurons (PNs). Methods: We generated mouse hybrids (L7-GFPrelnF1/) with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged PNs, directly visible under fluorescence microscopy. We then cultured the slices obtained from mice with different reln genotypes and demonstrated that when the slices from reln-/- mutants were co-cultured with those from reln+/- mice, the Reelin produced by the latter induced migration of the PNs to partially rescue the normal layered cortical histology. We have confirmed this observation with Voronoi tessellation to analyze PN dispersion. Results: In images of the co-cultured slices from reln-/- mice, Voronoi polygons were larger than in single-cultured slices of the same genetic background but smaller than those generated from slices of reln+/- animals. The mean roundness factor, area disorder, and roundness factor homogeneity were different when slices from reln-/- mice were cultivated singularly or co-cultivated, supporting mathematically the transition from the clustered organization of the PNs in the absence of Reelin to a layered structure when the protein is supplied ex vivo. Conclusions: Neurobiologists are the primary target users of this 3Rs approach. They should adopt it for the possibility to study and manipulate ex vivo the activity of a brain-secreted or genetically engineered protein (scientific perspective), the potential reduction (up to 20%) of the animals used, and the total avoidance of severe surgery (3Rs perspective).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">abmAnimalMovement: An R package for simulating animal movement using an agent-based model [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Animal movement datasets are growing in number and depth, and researchers require a growing number of analytical approaches to adequately answer questions using movement datasets. As the complexity of questions and analyses increase, deciding on the best approach both in terms of study design and analysis can become more difficult. A potential solution is to simulate an array of synthetic datasets under varying study designs and simulation parametrisations to gain insight into the impact of analysis choice(s) in different contexts. The abmAnimalMovement R package provides the means of simulating animal movement for this purpose. The abmAnimalMovement simulations use a discrete time agent-based model and does not require previous movement data as an input. The simulations include a number of key internal and external movement influences, as well as parameters for navigation and mobility capacity of the animal. Internal influences include three predefined behavioural states (e.g., rest, explore, forage) and any number of activity cycles (e.g., diel, seasonal). External influences are implemented via matrices describing landscape characteristics (e.g., shelter quality, foraging resources, movement ease), and predefined points describing shelter sites and points the animal aims to avoid. Navigation capacity is defined by the range the animal can dynamically choose a foraging location to which it is subsequently attracted. Mobility capacity is implemented by user defined distributions, from which step length and turn angles are draw at each time step, governing the possible subsequent locations of the animal. Critically, the navigation capacity (the choice of destination) operates on a different time scale to the mobility capacity, allowing the internal state of the animal to differ from the observed movements. When combined with other emergent properties, such as site fidelity generated via repeated shelter site use, the simulations offer opportunities to test whether movement analyses can accurately recover hidden mechanisms, states, and drivers.

                Background: Infertility remains a significant issue in the world of health. Now Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) is widely used to help couples with infertility. In ART diminish ovarian reserve patients have a very low success rate of pregnancy. To help patients with Diminished Ovarian Reserve (DOR), research is conducted using an animal model. vinylcychlohexene diepoxide (VCD) has ovotoxic effects. This study looked at the use of VCD in inducing targeted DOR conditions in animals (rats), create a model that could be used for future animal studies in infertility. Methods: Adult female Rattus norvegicus were used in this study. All were given VCD injections at 80 mg/kg intraperitoneally for 15 days. An examination of Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) levels will be carried out on days 0,3,5,7, and 15. To mimic IVF process, all rats got an injection of 10 IU of Pregnant Mare Serum Gonadotropin (PMSG) and 10 IU human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) to confirm DOR. Ovarectomy was performed, dominant follicles were taken, denudation was carried out, and the oocytes were cultured for 12 hours. Then, oocytes were assessed through a microscope. Results: Starting from day 5 post VCD induction, there was a significant increase in the FSH level in the group of rats that were induced with the administered VCD dose compared to the control group that experienced normal FSH fluctuations. The FSH concentration reached >50%. It was found that the number of degenerated oocytes had an average of 1.11. Oocytes that were in Germinal-Vesicle (GV) stage had an average of 1.89, while in the Metaphase I (M1) stage the average is 2.882. Lastly, the number of oocytes in the Metaphase (MII) stage which is fully matured had an average of 1.117. Conclusions: VCD can become an important tool for future studies that needs an animal model with DOR.

                Glioblastoma (GBM), a deadly brain tumor, is still one of the few lasting challenges of contemporary oncology. Current therapies fail to significantly improve patient survival due to GBM’s tremendous genetic, transcriptomic, immunological, and sex-dependent heterogeneity. Over the years, clinical differences between males and females were characterized. For instance, higher incidence of GBM in males or distinct responses to cancer chemotherapy and immunotherapy between males and females have been noted. However, despite the introduction of single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, these differences were not further investigated as studies were focused only on exposing the general picture of GBM heterogeneity. Hence, in this study, we summarized the current state of knowledge on GBM heterogeneity exposed by single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics with regard to genetics, immunology, and sex-dependent differences. Additionally, we highlighted future research directions which would fill the gap of knowledge on the impact of patient’s sex on the disease outcome.

                Background: Episiotomy procedure enlarges the vaginal outlet to facilitate childbirth. Polyglactin 910 fast-absorbing sutures are widely used for the repair of episiotomy because of their rapid absorption and less inflammatory response. This study was designed for subjective assessment of perineal pain post-episiotomy repair, with Trusynth Fast® and Vicryl Rapide® polyglactin 910 fast-absorbing sutures. Method: This was a single-blind, randomized, prospective study conducted between January 7, 2021 and July 14, 2021 across two centers in India. Primiparous or multiparous women (18—40 years), who required episiotomy during vaginal delivery were included, and either Trusynth Fast® (n=47) or Vicryl Rapide® (n=49) suture was used for their episiotomy repair. The primary endpoint, perineal pain was assessed with visual analogue scale at all follow-up visits. The secondary endpoints, quantity of local anesthesia, number of sutures used, time to repair episiotomy, intraoperative suture handling, analgesics used, early and late wound complications, wound re-suturing, time to complete healing, presence of residual sutures, return to sexual activity, dyspareunia, and adverse events were also recorded. Results: The study showed no significant difference in perineal pain between the two groups at any visit. A statistically significant difference (p<0.05) in total score of episiotomy healing scale on day 2 (0.13±0.34 versus 0.35±0.56) and swelling on day 2 (8.51 versusversus 28.57%) was noted between Trusynth Fast® and Vicryl Rapide® group. Non-significant difference was observed between the groups regarding anesthesia, number of sutures, time to repair episiotomy, intraoperative suture handling, analgesics, puerperal fever, wound infection, dehiscence, hematoma, urinary incontinence, re-suturing, time to complete healing, return to sexual activity and dyspareunia. Conclusion: Trusynth Fast® suture is clinically equivalent to Vicryl Rapide® suture and can be used for episiotomy repair with minimal risk of perineal pain and wound complications.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Optimal noise level for coding with tightly balanced networks of spiking neurons in the presence of transmission delays</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jonathan Timcheck, Jonathan Kadmon, Kwabena Boahen, Surya Ganguli</p>

Neural circuits consist of many noisy, slow components, with individual neurons subject to ion channel noise, axonal propagation delays, and unreliable and slow synaptic transmission. This raises a fundamental question: how can reliable computation emerge from such unreliable components? A classic strategy is to simply average over a population of <i>N</i> weakly-coupled neurons to achieve errors that scale as 1 / N. But more interestingly, recent work has introduced networks of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons that achieve coding errors that scale <i>superclassically</i> as 1/<i>N</i> by combining the principles of predictive coding and fast and tight inhibitory-excitatory balance. However, spike transmission delays preclude such fast inhibition, and computational studies have observed that such delays can cause pathological synchronization that in turn destroys superclassical coding performance. Intriguingly, it has also been observed in simulations that noise can actually <i>improve</i> coding performance, and that there exists some optimal level of noise that minimizes coding error. However, we lack a quantitative theory that describes this fascinating interplay between delays, noise and neural coding performance in spiking networks. In this work, we elucidate the mechanisms underpinning this beneficial role of noise by deriving <i>analytical</i> expressions for coding error as a function of spike propagation delay and noise levels in predictive coding tight-balance networks of LIF neurons. Furthermore, we compute the minimal coding error and the associated optimal noise level, finding that they grow as power-laws with the delay. Our analysis reveals quantitatively how optimal levels of noise can rescue neural coding performance in spiking neural networks with delays by preventing the build up of pathological synchrony without overwhelming the overall spiking dynamics. This analysis can serve as a foundation for the further study of precise computation in the presence of noise and delays in efficient spiking neural circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modelling membrane reshaping by staged polymerization of ESCRT-III filaments</a></h4>

ESCRT-III filaments are composite cytoskeletal polymers that can constrict and cut cell membranes from the inside of the membrane neck. Membrane-bound ESCRT-III filaments undergo a series of dramatic composition and geometry changes in the presence of an ATP-consuming Vps4 enzyme, which causes stepwise changes in the membrane morphology. We set out to understand the physical mechanisms involved in translating the changes in ESCRT-III polymer composition into membrane deformation. We have built a coarse-grained model in which ESCRT-III polymers of different geometries and mechanical properties are allowed to copolymerise and bind to a deformable membrane. By modelling ATP-driven stepwise depolymerisation of specific polymers, we identify mechanical regimes in which changes in filament composition trigger the associated membrane transition from a flat to a buckled state, and then to a tubule state that eventually undergoes scission to release a small cargo-loaded vesicle. We then characterise how the location and kinetics of polymer loss affects the extent of membrane deformation and the efficiency of membrane neck scission. Our results identify the near-minimal mechanical conditions for the operation of shape-shifting composite polymers that sever membrane necks.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Hippocampal and medial prefrontal cortices encode structural task representations following progressive and interleaved training schedules</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sam C. Berens, Chris M. Bird</p>

Memory generalisations may be underpinned by either encoding- or retrieval-based generalisation mechanisms and different training schedules may bias some learners to favour one of these mechanisms over the other. We used a transitive inference task to investigate whether generalisation is influenced by progressive vs randomly interleaved training, and overnight consolidation. On consecutive days, participants learnt pairwise discriminations from two transitive hierarchies before being tested during fMRI. Inference performance was consistently better following progressive training, and for pairs further apart in the transitive hierarchy. BOLD pattern similarity correlated with hierarchical distances in the left hippocampus (HIP) and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) following both training schedules. These results are consistent with the use of structural representations that directly encode hierarchical relationships between task features. However, such effects were only observed in the MPFC for recently learnt relationships. Furthermore, the MPFC appeared to maintain structural representations in participants who performed at chance on the inference task. We conclude that humans preferentially employ encoding-based mechanisms to store map-like relational codes that can be used for memory generalisation. These codes are expressed in the HIP and MPFC following both progressive and interleaved training but are not sufficient for accurate inference.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Kinetic and data-driven modeling of pancreatic β-cell central carbon metabolism and insulin secretion</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Patrick E. Gelbach, Dongqing Zheng, Scott E. Fraser, Kate L. White, Nicholas A. Graham, Stacey D. Finley</p>

Pancreatic β-cells respond to increased extracellular glucose levels by initiating a metabolic shift. That change in metabolism is part of the process of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and is of particular interest in the context of diabetes. However, we do not fully understand how the coordinated changes in metabolic pathways and metabolite products influence insulin secretion. In this work, we apply systems biology approaches to develop a detailed kinetic model of the intracellular central carbon metabolic pathways in pancreatic β-cells upon stimulation with high levels of glucose. The model is calibrated to published metabolomics datasets for the INS1 823/13 cell line, accurately capturing the measured metabolite fold-changes. We first employed the calibrated mechanistic model to estimate the stimulated cell’s fluxome. We then used the predicted network fluxes in a data-driven approach to build a partial least squares regression model. By developing the combined kinetic and data-driven modeling framework, we gain insights into the link between β-cell metabolism and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The combined modeling framework was used to predict the effects of common anti-diabetic pharmacological interventions on metabolite levels, flux through the metabolic network, and insulin secretion. Our simulations reveal targets that can be modulated to enhance insulin secretion. The model is a promising tool to contextualize and extend the usefulness of metabolomics data and to predict dynamics and metabolite levels that are difficult to measure <i>in vitro</i>. In addition, the modeling framework can be applied to identify, explain, and assess novel and clinically-relevant interventions that may be particularly valuable in diabetes treatment.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A new computational model illuminates the extraordinary eyes of Phronima</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Zahra M. Bagheri, Anna-Lee Jessop, Julian C. Partridge, Karen J. Osborn, Jan M. Hemmi</p>

Vision in the midwater of the open ocean requires animals to perform visual tasks quite unlike those of any other environment. These tasks consist of detecting small, low contrast objects and point sources against a relatively dim and uniform background. Deep-sea animals have evolved many extraordinary visual adaptations to perform these tasks. Linking eye anatomy to specific selective pressures, however, is challenging, not least because of the many difficulties of studying deep-sea animals. Computational modelling of vision, based on detailed morphological reconstructions of animal eyes, along with underwater optics, offers a chance to understand the specific visual capabilities of individual visual systems. Prior to the work presented here, comprehensive models for apposition compound eyes in the mesopelagic, the dominant eye form of crustaceans, were lacking. We adapted a model developed for single-lens eyes and used it to examine how different parameters affect the model’s ability to detect point sources and extended objects. This new model also allowed us to examine spatial summation as a means to improve visual performance. Our results identify a trade-off between increased depth range over which eyes function effectively and increased distance at which extended objects can be detected. This trade-off is driven by the size of the ommatidial acceptance angle. We also show that if neighbouring ommatidia have overlapping receptive fields, spatial summation helps with all detection tasks, including the detection of bioluminescent point sources. By applying our model to the apposition compound eyes of <i>Phronima</i>, a mesopelagic hyperiid amphipod, we show that the specialisations of the large medial eyes of <i>Phronima</i> improve both the detection of point sources and of extended objects. The medial eyes outperformed the lateral eyes at every modelled detection task. We suggest that the small visual field size of <i>Phronima</i>’s medial eyes and the strong asymmetry between the medial and lateral eyes reflect <i>Phronima</i>’s need for effective vision across a large depth range and its habit of living inside a barrel. The barrel’s narrow aperture limits the usefulness of a large visual field and has allowed a strong asymmetry between the medial and lateral eyes. The model provides a useful tool for future investigations into the visual abilities of apposition compound eyes in the deep sea.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A new machine learning method for cancer mutation analysis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mahnaz Habibi, Golnaz Taheri</p>

It is complicated to identify cancer-causing mutations. The recurrence of a mutation in patients remains one of the most reliable features of mutation driver status. However, some mutations are more likely to happen than others for various reasons. Different sequencing analysis has revealed that cancer driver genes operate across complex pathways and networks, with mutations often arising in a mutually exclusive pattern. Genes with low-frequency mutations are understudied as cancer-related genes, especially in the context of networks. Here we propose a machine learning method to study the functionality of mutually exclusive genes in the networks derived from mutation associations, gene-gene interactions, and graph clustering. These networks have indicated critical biological components in the essential pathways, especially those mutated at low frequency. Studying the network and not just the impact of a single gene significantly increases the statistical power of clinical analysis. The proposed method identified important driver genes with different frequencies. We studied the function and the associated pathways in which the candidate driver genes participate. By introducing lower-frequency genes, we recognized less studied cancer-related pathways. We also proposed a novel clustering method to specify driver modules. We evaluated each driver module with different criteria, including the terms of biological processes and the number of simultaneous mutations in each cancer. Materials and implementations are available at: https://github.com/MahnazHabibi/MutationAnalysis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Finding logic models for sustainable marine development that deliver on social equity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yoshitaka Ota, Gerald G. Singh, Timothy Clark, Marleen S. Schutter, Wilf Swartz, Andrés M. Cisneros-Montemayor</p>

Sustainable development is often represented as contributing to desirable outcomes across economic, environmental, and social goals, yet policies and interventions attempting to deliver sustainable development often disagree on the order in which these categories of goals should be addressed. In this Essay, we identify and review 5 approaches (called logic models) for sustainable development in ocean systems based on existing policies and interventions and consider the evidence for their contributions to equity—the ultimate goal of sustainable development according to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Two of the 5 logic models prioritize economic growth and lead to social and environmental benefits, 2 prioritize environmental health as a prerequisite for sustainable economic and social benefits, and the final logic model is community driven and prioritizes social dimensions. Looking towards the 2030 maturation of the SDGs, we will need to understand what models are best suited to deliver on equity gains and prevent future inequities in development and how best to operationalize them.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Tackling the mangrove restoration challenge</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Catherine E. Lovelock, Edward Barbier, Carlos M. Duarte</p>

Mangroves have been converted and degraded for decades. Rates of loss have declined over the past decades, but achieving resilient coastlines requires both conservation and restoration. Here, we outline the challenges for the global restoration of mangroves and what actions could enhance restoration. Ambitious global targets for mangrove restoration, if successful, could deliver global benefits of carbon sequestration, fisheries production, biodiversity, and coastal protection. However, large-scale mangrove planting efforts have often failed, and smaller projects may not deliver landscape-scale benefits, even though they are more suited to community management. Solutions to achieving global targets include reducing risks of large projects and increasing the uptake and effectiveness of smaller projects. Sustainable mangrove restoration requires investment in capacity building in communities and institutions, and mechanisms to match restoration opportunities with prospective supporters and investors. Global reporting standards will support adaptive management and help fully understand and monitor the benefits of mangrove restoration.

Multiomics approaches need to be applied in the central Arctic Ocean to benchmark biodiversity change and to identify novel species and their genes. As part of MOSAiC, EcoOmics will therefore be essential for conservation and sustainable bioprospecting in one of the least explored ecosystems on Earth.

The MOSAiC ice-drift study across the Arctic Ocean is providing unprecedented opportunities to explore one of the least known ecosystems on Earth. In this Community Page, members of the EcoOmics project explain how data from MOSAiC will be used to study unique species, from viruses to multicellular animals.

Black in Marine Science was founded in 2020 to celebrate black marine scientists, spread environmental awareness, and inspire the next generation of scientific thought leaders. Black in Marine Science began as a week but has become a movement.

After decades of feeling isolated in the field, a group of Black marine scientists and allies came together to create the first ever Black In Marine Science Week. This Perspective discusses how the Black In Marine Science organizing team realized that after the major success of the week and the uncovering of shared experiences of racism, there was much more work to be done.

Solutions to complex and unprecedented global challenges are urgently needed. Overcoming these challenges requires input and innovative solutions from all experts, including Early Career Ocean Professionals (ECOPs). To achieve diverse inclusion from ECOPs, fundamental changes must occur at all levels—from individuals to organizations. Drawing on insights from across the globe, we propose 5 actionable pillars that support the engagement of ECOPs in co-design processes that address ocean sustainability: sharing knowledge through networks and mentorship, providing cross-boundary training and opportunities, incentivizing and celebrating knowledge co-design, creating inclusive and participatory governance structures, and catalyzing culture change for inclusivity. Foundational to all actions are the cross-cutting principles of justice, equity, diversity, and inclusivity. In addition, the pillars are cross-boundary in nature, including collaboration and innovation across sectors, disciplines, regions, generations, and backgrounds. Together, these recommendations provide an actionable and iterative path toward inclusive engagement and intergenerational exchange that can develop ocean solutions for a sustainable future.

                <p>by Jennifer Jacquet, Daniel Pauly</p>

The current conception of sustainable fisheries focuses on single “stocks” targeted by industrial fisheries to supply growing global markets, including those for fishmeal. Sustainable fisheries should be reimagined to minimize exploitation and prioritize artisanal and subsistence fishing that feeds people.

Wild animals cannot simultaneously be sustainably exploited and supply growing global markets. This Perspective argues that the current definition of ‘sustainable fisheries’ should be reimagined to minimize exploitation and prioritize small-scale artisanal and subsistence fishing.

                <p>by Michelle Bender, Rachel Bustamante, Kelsey Leonard</p>

Humanity’s relationship with the Ocean needs to be transformed to effectively address the multitude of governance crises facing the Ocean, including overfishing, climate change, pollution, and habitat destruction. Earth law, including Rights of Nature, provides a pathway to center humanity as a part of Nature and transform our relationship from one of dominion and separateness towards holism and mutual enhancement. Within the Earth law framework, an Ocean-centered approach views humanity as interconnected with the Ocean, recognizes societies’ collective duty and reciprocal responsibility to protect and conserve the Ocean, and puts aside short-term gain to respect and protect future generations of all life and the Ocean’s capacity to regenerate and sustain natural cycles. This Essay presents Ocean-centered governance as an approach to help achieve the 10 challenges for collective impact put forward as part of the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development and therefore living in a harmonious relationship with the Ocean.

                <p>by Madeleine J. H. van Oppen, Melinda A. Coleman</p>

The rapid growth in genomic techniques provides the potential to transform how we protect, manage, and conserve marine life. Further, solutions to boost the resilience of marine species to climate change and other disturbances that characterize the Anthropocene require transformative approaches, made more effective if guided by genomic data. Although genetic techniques have been employed in marine conservation for decades and the availability of genomic data is rapidly expanding, widespread application still lags behind other data types. This Essay reviews how genetics and genomics have been utilized in management initiatives for ocean conservation and restoration, highlights success stories, and presents a pathway forward to enhance the uptake of genomic data for protecting our oceans.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effectiveness, survival and safety of guselkumab attending to basal characteristics in moderate-to-severe psoriatic patients: a cohort study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease which can impact quality of life. In the past decade multiple biologic treatments have been released with encouraging results. Guselkumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting IL-23p19. Multiple randomized clinical trials have demonstrated its efficacy in psoriasis, but response differences among patient subpopulations have not been extensively reported. Furthermore, patients in real life are often non-eligible for clinical trials and their responses may differ from pivotal studies. Methods: This is a retrospective, observational study of real clinical practice of patients receiving guselkumab treatment in Spain. Patients treated with guselkumab were included between February 2019 to December 2021. This study evaluates the potential differential effect of baseline demographic and disease characteristics on therapeutic responses to guselkumab. We measured effectiveness and survival by the psoriasis area and severity index, the dermatology life quality index as well as Kaplan meier curves, respectively. Categorical and quantitative variables are reported with frequencies, and with mean and standard deviation, respectively. Differences between groups in psoriasis area and severity index and dermatology life quality index, were calculated using a mixed-effects analysis. Survival was calculated using Kaplan meier curves and log-rank tests. Results: A total of 87 patients were included. In this study, our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness, safety and survival of guselkumab attending to demographic characteristics. No differences in psoriasis area and severity index or dermatology life quality index baseline values or therapeutic responses were noted at 52 weeks of follow-up among all the subgroups analysed (age, sex, psoriasis duration, body mass index, and comorbidities). A difference in drug survival was only seen between gender groups. Conclusions: Our research has demonstrated the consistency of guselkumab effectiveness across patient subgroups. No baseline features affected the effectiveness or drug survival of guselkumab, except for lower drug survival in female patients.

in patients with multiple sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ocrelizumab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, counteracts induction of humoral immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). We aimed to assess if serum ocrelizumab concentration measured at time of vaccination could predict the humoral response after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. In 52 MS patients, we found ocrelizumab concentration at time of vaccination to be a good predictor for SARS-CoV-2 IgG anti-RBD titers after vaccination (comparable to B-cell count). As the course of ocrelizumab concentration may be predicted using pharmacokinetic models, this may be a superior biomarker to guide optimal timing for vaccinations in B-cell depleted MS patients.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate stroke outcomes at 3, 6, and 12 months post-stroke overall and by ethnicity in a population-based, longitudinal study.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>First-ever ischemic strokes (2014–2019, n = 1,332) among Mexican American persons (n = 807) and non-Hispanic white persons (n = 525) were identified from the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi Project. Data were collected from patient or proxy interviews (baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months post-stroke) and medical records, including functional (activities of daily living/instrumental activities of daily living score), neurological (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale), cognitive (Modified Mini-Mental State Examination), and quality of life (QOL) outcomes (12-domain Stroke-specific Quality of Life scale). Outcome trajectories were analyzed using multivariable adjusted linear models, with generalized estimating equations to account for within-subject correlations; interactions between ethnicity and time were included to investigate ethnic differences in outcomes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The median age was 67 years (interquartile range 58,78), 48.5% were women, and 60.6% were Mexican American persons. For all outcomes, significant improvement was seen between 3 and 6 months (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05 for all), with stability between 6 and 12 months. Mexican American persons had significantly worse outcomes compared with non-Hispanic white persons at all time points (3, 6, and 12 months), with the exception of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, which did not differ by ethnicity at 6 and 12 months, and the average change in outcomes did not vary significantly by ethnicity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Outcomes were at their worst at 3 months post-stroke, and ethnic disparities were already present, suggesting the need for early assessment and strategies to improve outcomes and possibly reduce disparities. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Our aim was to assess the real-world effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors for treatment of patients with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a multicenter survey compiling retrospective data from 79 PML patients, including 38 published cases and 41 unpublished cases, who received immune checkpoint inhibitors as add-on to standard of care. One-year follow-up data were analyzed to determine clinical outcomes and safety profile. Logistic regression was used to identify variables associated with 1-year survival.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Predisposing conditions included hematological malignancy (n = 38, 48.1%), primary immunodeficiency (n = 14, 17.7%), human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (n = 12, 15.2%), inflammatory disease (n = 8, 10.1%), neoplasm (n = 5, 6.3%), and transplantation (n = 2, 2.5%). Pembrolizumab was most commonly used (n = 53, 67.1%). One-year survival was 51.9% (41/79). PML–immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) was reported in 15 of 79 patients (19%). Pretreatment expression of programmed cell death-1 on circulating T cells did not differ between survivors and nonsurvivors. Development of contrast enhancement on follow-up magnetic resonance imaging at least once during follow-up (OR = 3.16, 95% confidence interval = 1.20–8.72, <i>p</i> = 0.02) was associated with 1-year survival. Cerebrospinal fluid JC polyomavirus DNA load decreased significantly by 1-month follow-up in survivors compared to nonsurvivors (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Thirty-two adverse events occurred among 24 of 79 patients (30.4%), and led to treatment discontinuation in 7 of 24 patients (29.1%).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In this noncontrolled retrospective study of patients with PML who were treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, mortality remains high. Development of inflammatory features or overt PML-IRIS was commonly observed. This study highlights that use of immune checkpoint inhibitors should be strictly personalized toward characteristics of the individual PML patient. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Allergic Diseases and Risk of Incident Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To examine the associations between the allergic triad (asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis) and risk of dementia.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants comprised 6,785,948 adults aged ≥40 years who participated in a national health examination in 2009 without any history of dementia before baseline. From 2009 to 2017, we prospectively investigated the associations between physician-diagnosed allergic diseases and risk of incident dementia (all-cause, Alzheimer's disease [AD], vascular dementia [VaD]) ascertained using national health insurance claims data.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>During 8.1 years of follow-up, 260,705 dementia cases (195,739 AD, 32,789 VaD) were identified. Allergic diseases were positively associated with dementia risk. Compared with individuals without allergic diseases, multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) of all-cause dementia were 1.20 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19–1.22) in those with asthma, 1.10 (95% CI 1.09–1.12) with allergic rhinitis, 1.16 (95% CI 1.11–1.21) with atopic dermatitis, and 1.13 (95% CI 1.12–1.14) with any of these allergies. Similarly, individuals with any of the allergic triad had a higher risk of AD (HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.14–1.17) and VaD (HR 1.04; 95% CI 1.01–1.06) than those without any allergic disease. As the number of comorbid allergic diseases increased, the risk of dementia increased linearly (<i>P</i>
<sub>trend</sub> ≤ 0.002). Compared with individuals without allergies, those with all three allergic diseases had substantially increased risk of all-cause dementia (HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.35–1.75), AD (HR 1.46; 95% CI 1.25–1.70), and VaD (HR 1.99, 95% CI 1.44–2.75).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis were significantly associated with increased risk of all-cause dementia and subtypes, with dose–effect relationships with the severity of allergic diseases. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Awareness and intention to register halal certification of micro and small-scale food enterprises [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This paper discusses halal awareness of MSE food producers in West Java Province, Indonesia. Halal awareness is the first step toward obtaining halal certificates, which confirm that the product is lawful according to Islamic Sharia. Unfortunately, despite Islam being the religion of most Indonesians, most food sold in the market lacks a halal certificate due to a lack of awareness among food producers about the importance of selling halal-certified foods. Methods: This study aims at measuring the level of halal awareness and the intention of MSE food producers to register halal certification. Halal awareness is assumed to be influenced by knowledge of halal and the food producers’ perception of the benefits of halal certificates. Furthermore, halal awareness, attitudes, and perception of ease of procedures will encourage the intention to register halal certification. An electronic Google Form with a cover letter and a set of questionnaires was distributed to collect data. Partial Least Square - Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) was chosen to evaluate the adopted theoretical models in the exploratory research.. Results: The results show that halal awareness is influenced by knowledge of halal and perception of its benefits. Moreover, halal awareness influences positively the intention to obtain a halal certificate, but the intention is not significantly affected by attitudes to produce halal foods and perception of procedures for obtaining halal certification. This shows that halal awareness will increase the intention to register halal certification. However,  misconceptions about the procedures for obtaining halal certificates keep them from registering. Conclusions: MSE food producers in West Java Province, Indonesia have a good level of awareness about halal food. However, their products are not halal-certified due to the perception of the procedures for obtaining halal certificates are relatively complicated and costly for them.

                Background:  Most primary school Physical Education (PE) has relatively little health-enhancing moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). - A promising theory and evidence-based intervention, the ‘SHARP Principles’ model, has been effective in making PE lessons more active in one area of England. This protocol paper explains the rationale for use of the SHARP intervention, and the methods used to examine the feasibility and acceptability of a version of SHARP translated for use in Scotland (SHARP Scotland). Methods: The feasibility of SHARP Scotland will be evaluated by key areas of focus for feasibility studies: Acceptability, Implementation, Integration, Limited Efficacy Testing. A combination of process measures, including observations, session delivery records, accelerometry-data collection, questionnaires, and semi-structured qualitative focus groups with teachers and pupils will be used. The feasibility and suitability of the SHARP Scotland intervention for a future Randomised Control Trial (RCT) will be assessed. The study will involve children from 8-11 years old (Primary 4 to 6) in two schools, one large urban school, and one smaller school; four classes will be randomly assigned to the intervention group (will be taught by class teachers with SHARP approach training), and four classes randomly assigned to the usual-care (standard curriculum) control group (taught by class teachers without SHARP training). Within the 8-week intervention, MVPA in the intervention group will be targeted by encouraging class teachers to deliver their PE classes in more active ways, following SHARP Principles. A maximum of 64 PE lessons delivered in a SHARP way will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the intervention. Discussion: The outcome of this study will be an assessment of whether applying the SHARP intervention is feasible in Scottish schools. Identification of any modifications to the intervention or evaluation which are required will provide insight for a fully powered effectiveness trial in the future, if appropriate.

                Background: Parkinson's disease is an attractive disease model to extend research towards a better understanding of the interrelationship between genes and the environment (exposome) therefore is an ideal model for a polypharmacological approach due to its clinical heterogeneity. Methods: In this paper, we present a series of polypharmacological chemical scaffolds extracted from ChEMBL 30 Database, with two or more targets of PD-related proteins obtained through chemoinformatics methods. This way, we describe the first adaptation of the Dual Activity Difference (DAD) map that allows the direct identification of "dual activity cliffs". Results: We identified 25 antiparkinson small molecules whose pharmacological targets are directed to dopaminergic and muscarinic acetyl choline M1-M5 receptors; 2 small molecules with three pharmacological targets with norepinephrine transporter, dopaminergic D1-D2 and muscarinic acetyl choline M1-M5 receptors; 6 with both targets norepinephrine transporter and muscarinic acetyl choline M1-M5 receptors; 2 small molecules with norepinephrine transporter and muscarinic acetyl choline M1-M5 receptors and 1 with both adenosine A2a and Dopamine D1-D5 receptors. Conclusion: Chemoinformatics methods identified 36 polypharmacological chemical scaffolds related to Parkinson's disease. Demonstrating that the design of polypharmacological drugs is an opportunity in PD.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Smoking behavior intervention based on implicit approach: a cross-sectional pilot study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Indonesia is the country with the highest smoking rate in Southeast Asia and the third-highest globally. Smoking has become one of Indonesia's biggest addiction problems. The goal of this research is to develop smoking behavior intervention based on an implicit approach. Methods: This article contains a two-step study that was part of a comprehensive study on smoking behavior in Indonesia. The first study, applying measurement of Stroop task to 117 male-university-students with results revealed that smoking behavior was associated with attention bias. This result is the basis for developing an implicit approach-based intervention. In the second study, the research aims to develop an intervention by investigating the effects of the experimental retraining by manipulating the automatic-avoidance-action tendencies using an approach-avoidance task (AAT) on 40 male university student smokers that proved to have an attentional bias in the first study. Results: The outcomes of the studies showed that the retraining (six weeks, twice a week) proved to shape the AAT effect and reduce the cigarettes consumption of the smokers. This pilot research becomes initial step to develop smoking cessation interventions in Indonesia using an implicit cognition approach.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Internally generated time in the rodent hippocampus is logarithmically compressed</a></h4>

              
                The Weber-Fechner law proposes that our perceived sensory input increases with physical input on a logarithmic scale. Hippocampal 'time cells' carry a record of recent experience by firing sequentially during a circumscribed period of time after a triggering stimulus. Different cells have'time fields' at different delays up to at least tens of seconds. Past studies suggest that time cells represent a compressed timeline by demonstrating that fewer time cells fire late in the delay and their time fields are wider. This paper asks whether the compression of time cells obeys the Weber-Fechner Law. Time cells were studied with a hierarchical Bayesian model that simultaneously accounts for the firing pattern at the trial level, cell level, and population level. This procedure allows separate estimates of the within-trial receptive field width and the across-trial variability. After isolating across-trial variability, time field width increased linearly with delay. Further, the time cell population was distributed evenly along a logarithmic time axis. These findings provide strong quantitative evidence that the neural temporal representation in rodent hippocampus is logarithmically compressed and obeys a neural Weber-Fechner Law.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Postsynaptic plasticity of cholinergic synapses underlies the induction and expression of appetitive and familiarity memories in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                In vertebrates, several forms of memory-relevant synaptic plasticity involve postsynaptic rearrangements of glutamate receptors. In contrast, previous work indicates that <i>Drosophila</i> and other invertebrates store memories using presynaptic plasticity of cholinergic synapses. Here, we provide evidence for postsynaptic plasticity at cholinergic output synapses from the <i>Drosophila</i> mushroom bodies (MBs). We find that the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit α5 is required within specific MB output neurons (MBONs) for appetitive memory induction, but is dispensable for aversive memories. In addition, nAChR α2 subunits mediate memory expression and likely function downstream of α5 and the postsynaptic scaffold protein Dlg. We show that postsynaptic plasticity traces can be induced independently of the presynapse, and that <i>in vivo</i> dynamics of α2 nAChR subunits are changed both in the context of associative and non-associative (familiarity) memory formation, underlying different plasticity rules. Therefore, regardless of neurotransmitter identity, key principles of postsynaptic plasticity support memory storage across phyla.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Discrete GPCR-triggered endocytic modes enable β-arrestins to flexibly regulate cell signaling</a></h4>

              
                β-arrestins are master regulators of cellular signaling that operate by desensitizing ligand-activated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) at the plasma membrane and promoting their subsequent endocytosis. The endocytic activity of β-arrestins is ligand-dependent, triggered by GPCR binding, and increasingly recognized to have a multitude of downstream signaling and trafficking consequences that are specifically programmed by the bound GPCR. However, only one biochemical 'mode' for GPCR-mediated triggering of the endocytic activity is presently known- displacement of the β-arrestin C-terminus (CT) to expose CCP-binding determinants that are masked in the inactive state. Here we revise this view by uncovering a second mode of GPCR-triggered endocytic activity that is independent of the β-arrestin CT and, instead, requires the cytosolic base of the β-arrestin C-lobe (CLB). We further show each of the discrete endocytic modes is triggered in a receptor-specific manner, with GPCRs that bind β-arrestin transiently ('class A') primarily triggering the CLB-dependent mode and GPCRs that bind more stably ('class B') triggering both the CT and CLB -dependent modes in combination. Moreover, we show that different modes have opposing effects on the net signaling output of receptors- with the CLB-dependent mode promoting rapid signal desensitization and the CT-dependent mode enabling prolonged signaling. Together, these results fundamentally revise understanding of how β-arrestins operate as efficient endocytic adaptors while facilitating diversity and flexibility in the control of cell signaling.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Quantifying how post-transcriptional noise and gene copy number variation bias transcriptional parameter inference from mRNA distributions</a></h4>

              
                Transcriptional rates are often estimated by fitting the distribution of mature mRNA numbers measured using smFISH (single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization) with the distribution predicted by the telegraph model of gene expression, which defines two promoter states of activity and inactivity. However, fluctuations in mature mRNA numbers are strongly affected by processes downstream of transcription. In addition, the telegraph model assumes one gene copy, but in experiments cells may have two gene copies as cells replicate their genome during the cell cycle. Whilst it is often presumed that post-transcriptional noise and gene copy number variation affect transcriptional parameter estimation, the size of the error introduced remains unclear. To address this issue, here we measure both mature and nascent mRNA distributions of GAL10 in yeast cells using smFISH and classify each cell according to its cell cycle phase. We infer transcriptional parameters from mature and nascent mRNA distributions, with and without accounting for cell cycle phase and compare the results to live-cell transcription measurements of the same gene. We find that: (i) correcting for cell cycle dynamics decreases the promoter switching rates and the initiation rate, and increases the fraction of time spent in the active state, as well as the burst size; (ii) additional correction for post-transcriptional noise leads to further increases in the burst size and to a large reduction in the errors in parameter estimation. Furthermore, we outline how to correctly adjust for measurement noise in smFISH due to uncertainty in transcription site localisation when introns cannot be labelled. Simulations with parameters estimated from nascent smFISH data, which is corrected for cell cycle phases and measurement noise, leads to autocorrelation functions that agree with those obtained from live-cell imaging.

                Orb2 the Drosophila homolog of Cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein (CPEB) forms prion-like oligomers. These oligomers consist of Orb2A and Orb2B isoforms and their formation are dependent on the oligomerization of the Orb2A isoform. Drosophila with a mutation diminishing Orb2A's prion-like oligomerization forms long-term memory but fails to maintain it over time. Since, this prion-like oligomerization of Orb2A plays a crucial role in the maintenance of memory, here we aim to find what regulates this oligomerization. In an immunoprecipitation-based screen, we identify interactors of Orb2A in the Hsp40 and Hsp70 families of proteins. Amongst these, we find an Hsp40 family protein Mrj as a regulator of the conversion of Orb2A to its prion-like form. Mrj interacts with Hsp70 proteins and acts as a chaperone by interfering with the aggregation of pathogenic Huntingtin. Unlike its mammalian homolog, we find Drosophila Mrj is neither an essential gene nor causes any gross neurodevelopmental defect. We observe a loss of Mrj results in a reduction in Orb2 oligomers. Further, the knockdown of Mrj in the mushroom body neurons results in a deficit in long-term memory. Our work implicates a chaperone Mrj in mechanisms of memory regulation through controlling the oligomerization of Orb2A and its association with the translating polysomes.

Somatic fronts can migrate to new positions and any front can be retracted to prune parts of neurons. NeuroDevSim is a multi-core program that uses an innovative shared memory approach to achieve parallel processing without messaging. We demonstrate close to linear strong scaling for medium size models for up to 32 cores and have run large models successfully on 128 cores. Most of the shared memory parallelism is achieved without memory locking. Instead cores have write privileges to private sections of arrays only, while being able to read the entire shared array. Memory conflicts are avoided by a coding rule that allows only active fronts to use methods that need writing access. The exception is collision detection, which is needed to avoid growth of physically overlapping structures. Here a locking mechanism was necessary to control access to grid points that register the location of nearby fronts. A custom approach using a serialized lock broker was able to manage both read and write locking. NeuroDevSim allows easy modeling of neural development for models ranging from a few complex to thousands of simple neurons or a mixture of both.

                Adaptive locomotion of animals depends on proprioception, which provides feedback on body postures to reshape motor output. How proprioception interacts with motor circuits and contributes to motor adaptation remains unclear. Here we characterize proprioception-mediated homeostatic control of undulatory movement in the roundworm C. elegans. The worm responds to optogenetically or mechanically induced decreases in mid-body bending amplitude by increasing its anterior amplitude. Conversely, it responds to increased mid-body amplitude by decreasing the anterior amplitude. This compensatory postural response requires dopaminergic PDE neurons to sense mid-body bending and signal to AVK interneurons via the D2-like dopamine receptor DOP-3. The FMRFamide-like neuropeptide FLP-1 from AVK regulates SMB head motor neurons to modulate anterior bending. We propose that this mechanism optimizes locomotion efficiency. Our findings demonstrate a functional motif for homeostatic behavioral control arising from the interplay between proprioception and neuromodulator signaling within a compact nervous system.

                Mammalian Muumlller glia (MG) possess limited regenerative capacities. However, the intrinsic capacity of mammalian MG to transdifferentiate to generate mature neurons without transgenic manipulations remains speculative. Here we show that MAP4K4, MAP4K6 and MAP4K7, which are conserved Misshapen subfamily of ste20 kinases homologs, repress YAP activity in mammalian MG and therefore restrict their ability to be reprogrammed. However, by treating with a small molecule inhibitor of MAP4K4/6/7, mouse MG regain their ability to proliferate and enter into a retinal progenitor cell (RPC)-like state after NMDA-induced retinal damage; such plasticity was lost in YAP knockout MG. Moreover, spontaneous trans-differentiation of MG into retinal neurons expressing both amacrine and retinal ganglion cell (RGC) markers occurs after inhibitor withdrawal. Taken together, these findings suggest that MAP4Ks block the reprogramming capacity of MG in a YAP-dependent manner in adult mammals, which provides a novel avenue for the pharmaceutical induction of retinal regeneration in vivo.

                Primary sensory regions are believed to instantiate stable neural representations, yet a number of recent rodent studies suggest instead that representations drift over time. We analyzed a massive fMRI dataset using an image-computable encoding model and found systematic changes in model fits that exhibited cumulative drift over many months. Convergent analyses pinpoint changes in neural responsivity as the source of the drift, while population-level representational dissimilarities between visual stimuli were unchanged, suggesting that downstream cortical areas may read-out a stable representation, even as representations within V1 drift.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modulation of implicitly perceived hand size by visuotactile recalibration</a></h4>

              
                When concurrent visual and tactile stimuli are repeatedly presented with a spatial offset, even unisensory tactile stimuli are afterwards perceived with a spatial bias towards the previously presented visual stimuli. This so-called visuotactile ventriloquism aftereffect reflects visuotactile recalibration. It is unknown whether this recalibration occurs within a bodily map and interacts with perceived features like shape and size of body parts. Here, we applied tactile stimuli to participants' hidden left hand and simultaneously presented visual stimuli with spatial offsets that - if integrated with the tactile stimuli - implied an enlarged hand size. We either used a fixed spatial mapping between tactile and visual positions ('congruent'), or a scrambled ('incongruent') mapping. We assessed implicitly perceived hand size via two independent behavioral assessments: pointing movements to unisensory tactile stimuli and tactile distance judgments. Moreover, we assessed explicitly perceived change in hand size with perceptual self-reports. Especially after congruent recalibration, participants localized unimodal tactile stimuli as if they were aiming at an enlarged hand. They also reported tactile distance as shorter after congruent than incongruent recalibration. These modulations resemble those obtained after using tools that prolong the arm and extend reaching space; they suggest that recalibration affected a common, implicit hand representation that underlies both tasks. In contrast, explicit perceptual self-reports did not differ significantly between congruent and incongruent recalibration. Thus, simple visuotactile stimuli are sufficient to modify implicitly perceived body size, indicating a tight link of low-level multisensory processes such as the visuotactile ventriloquism aftereffect and body representation.

                Targeted memory reactivation (TMR) during post-learning sleep enhances memory consolidation in young adults by modulating electrophysiological markers of plasticity (i.e., slow waves (SW) and slow/sigma oscillation coupling). Interestingly, older adults are known to exhibit deficits in motor memory consolidation, an impairment that has been linked to age-related degradations in the same sleep features sensitive to TMR interventions. We thus hypothesized that TMR would enhance motor memory consolidation in older adults via the modulation of these electrophysiological markers. Seventeen healthy older participants (age range: 50-74) were trained on a bimanual motor task involving two sequences that were cued by different sounds. Participants were retested after a 90-minute nap and the following morning. During non-rapid eye movement sleep of the post-learning nap, two different auditory cues were played: one sound associated to a learned - and thus reactivated - sequence and one control sound not associated to learning. Results indicated that changes in performance did not differ between reactivated and non-reactivated sequences. Yet, analyses of electrophysiological data revealed that TMR increased SW density. Moreover, phase-amplitude coupling between slow (0.5-2 Hz) and beta (around 20 Hz) oscillations before the SW trough was strengthened by the presentation of the unassociated sounds. Furthermore, the increase in slow/sigma (12-16 Hz) oscillation coupling around 1.75 sec post-SW trough for unassociated (as compared to associated) sounds was related to higher TMR-induced performance enhancement. Our results collectively demonstrate that, in older adults, TMR did not impact motor performance but modulated sleep-related markers of plasticity likely involved in protection against irrelevant information.

                The major protein-degradation machine, the proteasome, functions at brain synapses and regulates long-term information storage. Here we found that the two essential subcomplexes of the proteasome, the regulatory (19S) and catalytic (20S) particles that recognize and degrade substrates, are differentially distributed within individual rat cortical neurons. Using super-resolution microscopy, we discovered a surprising abundance of free particles (19S) near synapses. The free neuronal 19S particles bind and deubiquitylate Lys63-ubiquitin, a non-proteasome targeting ub-linkage. Pull-down assays revealed a significant over-representation of synaptic molecules as Lys63 interactors. Inhibition of 19S deubiquitylase activity significantly altered excitatory synaptic transmission and reduced the synaptic availability of AMPA receptors at multiple trafficking points in a proteasome-independent manner. Together, these results reveal a moonlighting function of the regulatory proteasomal subcomplex near synapses.

                Sleep and circadian rhythm disruptions are frequent comorbidities of Parkinson's disease (PD), a disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra. Although sleep/circadian disturbances can be observed years before diagnosing PD, it remains unclear whether circadian clocks have a causal role in the degenerative process. We demonstrated here that circadian clocks regulate the rhythmicity and magnitude of the vulnerability of DA neurons to oxidative stress in Drosophila. Circadian pacemaker neurons are presynaptic to a subset of DA neurons and rhythmically modulate their susceptibility to degeneration. The arrhythmic period (per) gene null mutation exacerbates the age-dependent loss of DA neurons and, in combination with brief oxidative stress, causes premature animal death. These findings suggest that circadian clock disruption promotes dopaminergic neurodegeneration.

                Breastfeeding, which is essential for the survival of mammalian infants, is critically mediated by pulsatile secretion of the pituitary hormone oxytocin from the central oxytocin neurons located in the paraventricular and supraoptic hypothalamic nuclei of mothers. Despite its importance, the molecular and neural circuit mechanisms of the milk ejection reflex remain poorly understood, in part because a mouse model to study lactation was only recently established. In our previous study, we successfully introduced fiber photometry-based chronic imaging of the pulsatile activities of oxytocin neurons during lactation. However, the necessity of Cre recombinase-based double knock-in mice substantially compromised the use of various Cre-dependent neuroscience toolkits. To overcome this obstacle, we developed a simple Cre-free method for monitoring oxytocin neurons by an adeno-associated virus vector driving GCaMP6s under a 2.6 kb mouse oxytocin mini-promoter. Using this method, we monitored calcium ion transients of oxytocin neurons in the paraventricular nucleus in wild-type C57BL/6N and ICR mothers without genetic crossing. By combining this method with video recordings of mothers and pups, we found that the pulsatile activities of oxytocin neurons require physical mother-pup contact for the milk ejection reflex. Notably, the intensities and/or frequencies of photometric signals were dynamically modulated by mother-pup reunions after isolation and during natural weaning stages. Collectively, the present study illuminates the temporal dynamics of pulsatile activities of oxytocin neurons in wild-type mice and provides a tool to characterize maternal oxytocin functions.

                Multiphoton calcium imaging is one of the most powerful tools in modern neuroscience. However, multiphoton data require significant pre-processing of images and post-processing of extracted signals. As a result, many algorithms and pipelines have been developed for the analysis of multiphoton data, particularly two-photon imaging data. Most current studies use one of several algorithms and pipelines that are published and publicly available, and add customized upstream and downstream analysis elements to fit the needs of individual researchers. The vast differences in algorithm choices, parameter settings, pipeline composition, and data sources combine to make collaboration difficult, and raise questions about the reproducibility and robustness of experimental results. We present our solution, called NeuroWRAP, which is a tool that wraps multiple published algorithms together, and enables integration of custom algorithms. It enables development of collaborative, shareable custom workflows and reproducible data analysis for multiphoton calcium imaging data enabling easy collaboration between researchers. NeuroWRAP implements an approach to evaluate the sensitivity and robustness of the configured pipelines. When this sensitivity analysis is applied to a crucial step of image analysis, cell segmentation, we find a substantial difference between two popular workflows, CaImAn and Suite2p. NeuroWRAP harnesses this difference by introducing consensus analysis, utilizing two workflows in conjunction to significantly increase the trustworthiness and robustness of cell segmentation results.

                TPL2 (MAP3K8) is a central signaling node in the inflammatory response of peripheral immune cells. We find that TPL2 kinase activity modulates microglial cytokine release and is required for microglia-mediated neuron death in vitro. In acute in vivo neuroinflammation settings, TPL2 kinase activity regulates microglia activation states and brain cytokine levels. In a tauopathy model of chronic neurodegeneration, loss of TPL2 kinase activity reduces neuroinflammation and rescues synapse loss, brain volume loss, and behavioral deficits. Single-cell RNAseq analysis indicates protection in the tauopathy model was associated with reductions in activated microglia subpopulations as well as infiltrating peripheral immune cells. Overall, using various models, we find that TPL2 kinase activity can promote multiple harmful consequences of microglial activation in the brain including cytokine release, iNOS induction, astrocyte activation, and immune cell infiltration. Consequently, inhibiting TPL2 kinase activity could represent a potential therapeutic strategy in neurodegenerative conditions.

                Structural similarity networks are a central focus of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) research into human brain connectomes in health and disease. We present Morphometric INverse Divergence (MIND), a robust method to estimate within-subject structural similarity between cortical areas based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the multivariate distributions of their structural features. Compared to the prior approach of morphometric similarity networks (MSNs) on N>10,000 data from the ABCD cohort, MIND networks were more consistent with known cortical symmetry, cytoarchitecture, and (in N=19 macaques) gold-standard tract-tracing connectivity, and were more invariant to cortical parcellation. Importantly, MIND networks were remarkably coupled with cortical gene co-expression, providing fresh evidence for the unified architecture of brain structure and transcription. Using kinship (N=1282) and genetic data (N=4085), we characterized the heritability of MIND phenotypes, identifying stronger genetic influence on the relationship between structurally divergent regions compared to structurally similar regions. Overall, MIND presents a biologically-validated lens for analyzing the structural organization of the cortex using readily-available MRI measurements.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Decoding Fear or Safety and Approach or Avoidance by Brain-Wide Network Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Discerning safety from threat and positive or negative outcomes of adversity are fundamental for mental health. Many brain structures have been implicated in both adaptive and maladaptive stress coping, however, how multiple regions function together as a network in the processing of this information is unclear. Here, we recorded local field potentials from seven regions of the mesolimbic-hippocampal-prefrontal cortical network (MLHFC) of male rats during the conditioning of a stimulus (CS) to the absence (safety) and then to the anticipation (fear) of footshocks, and during an approach-avoidance task. We developed a machine learning pipeline to investigate the relevance of specific features of oscillatory activity in the decoding of fear versus safety and approach versus avoidance. We found that decoding performance increased as a function of the number of brain regions included, reaching the best classification if all regions were considered. In addition, the best decoding was obtained from frequencies within the theta range (4-10 Hz). Remarkably, decoder models showed robust generalization within but not between individuals. Nevertheless, we were also able to identify patterns of MLHFC activity that decoded stress coping states from all rats. These patterns were characterized by increased brain-wide theta synchrony during fear and preceding approach. Our results indicate that stress coping information is encoded at the brain-wide level and highlight individual variability in this neural processing. Our findings also suggest that MLHFC network theta activity underlies active stress coping with both aversive and positive motivational valences.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A meta-analysis of neural systems underlying delay discounting: implications for transdiagnostic research</a></h4>

              
                The National Institute of Mental Health launched the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative to identify common biological mechanisms underlying mental disorders. A central challenge for this approach is to identify reliable biobehavioral paradigms that engage specific neural circuits implicated across psychiatric disorders. Delay discounting paradigms have been proposed as a promising candidate because both excessive and insufficient tendency to discount future rewards have been reported across a wide range of diagnoses. Because delay discounting involves multiple facets of neurocognitive functions, identifying specific neural systems engaged during the task can inform ongoing efforts in clinical neuroscience to link neural patterns to a core symptom dimension. To this end, we conducted a meta-analysis of 72 fMRI studies of delay discounting by common analytic approaches (contrasts) to test the predictions of commonly proposed mechanisms underlying the decision-making process. Despite being widely used in previous studies, comparing impulsive and patient choices did not reveal any reliable clustering of effects. Our results instead revealed that the subjective value, magnitude, and delay contrasts reliably engage the valuation network, with the subjective value contrast eliciting more widespread activation. Furthermore, both the difficulty and task contrasts engage the frontoparietal network. Taken together, our findings suggest that both reward valuation and action selection are important but do not fully explain impulsive versus patient choices. Taken together, these results provide further support that delay discounting task is a promising measure of reward valuation that reliably activates the valuation network. In addition, we discuss implications for analytic strategies for future studies in clinical neuroscience.

                Rapid advances in tissue clearing protocols have begun to outpace the capabilities of existing microscope objectives: High-resolution imaging inside cm-sized cleared samples is often not possible as it requires multi-immersion objectives with high numerical aperture (NA > 0.7), long working distance (WD > 10 mm) and a large field-of-view (FOV > 1 mm). Here, we introduce a novel mirror-based optical design, the ''Schmidt objective'', which meets all these criteria despite containing only two optical elements. It consists of a spherical mirror in contact with the immersion medium and an aspherical correction plate. We showcase a multi-photon variant of a Schmidt objective that reaches NA 1.08 at an refractive index of 1.56 and demonstrate its versatility by imaging fixed samples in a wide range of immersion media ranging from air and water to BABB, DBE, and ECI. In addition, we demonstrate in vivo imaging by recording neuronal activity in larval zebrafish.

                To navigate, we must represent information about our place in the environment. Traditional research highlights the role of the hippocampal complex in this process. Spurred by recent research highlighting the widespread cortical encoding of cognitive and motor variables previously thought to have localized function, we hypothesized that navigational variables would be likewise encoded widely, especially in the prefrontal cortex, which is often associated with control of volitional behavior. We recorded neural activity from six prefrontal structures while macaques performed a foraging task in an open enclosure. In all six regions, we found strong encoding of allocentric position, head direction, egocentric boundary distance, and linear and angular velocity. These encodings were not accounted for by distance or time to reward. Strength of coding of all variables increase along a ventral-to-dorsal gradient. Together these results argue that encoding of navigational variables is not localized to the hippocampal complex and support the hypothesis that navigation is continuous with other forms of flexible cognition in the service of action.

                Purpose: While the recommended analysis method for magnetic resonance spectroscopy data is linear combination model (LCM) fitting, the supervised deep learning (DL) approach for quantification of MR spectroscopy (MRS) data recently showed encouraging results; however, supervised learning requires ground truth fitted spectra, which is not practical. This work investigates the feasibility and efficiency of the LCM-based self-supervised DL method for the analysis of MRS data. Method: We present a novel DL-based method for the quantification of relative metabolite concentrations, using quantum-mechanics simulated metabolite responses and neural networks. We trained, validated, and evaluated the proposed networks with simulated and publicly accessible in-vivo human brain MRS data and compared the performance with traditional methods. A novel adaptive macromolecule fitting algorithm is included. We investigated the performance of the proposed methods in a Monte Carlo (MC) study. Result: The validation using low-SNR simulated data demonstrated that the proposed methods could perform quantification comparably to other methods. The applicability of the proposed method for the quantification of in-vivo MRS data was demonstrated. Our proposed networks have the potential to reduce computation time significantly. Conclusion: The proposed model-constrained deep neural networks trained in a self-supervised manner with complex data can offer fast and efficient quantification of MRS data.

                Background: The cerebellum critically contributes to higher-order cognitive and emotional functions such fear learning and memory. Prior research on cerebellar volume in PTSD is scant and has neglected neuroanatomical subdivisions of the cerebellum that differentially map on to motor, cognitive, and affective functions. Methods: We quantified cerebellar lobule volumes using structural magnetic resonance imaging in 4,215 adults (PTSD n= 1640; Control n=2575) across 40 sites from the from the ENIGMA-PGC PTSD working group. Using a new state-of-the-art deep-learning based approach for automatic cerebellar parcellation, we obtained volumetric estimates for the total cerebellum and 28 subregions. Linear mixed effects models controlling for age, gender, intracranial volume, and site were used to compare cerebellum total and subregional volume in PTSD compared to healthy controls. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used to control the false discovery rate (p-FDR < 0.05). Results: PTSD was associated with significant grey and white matter reductions of the cerebellum. Compared to controls, people with PTSD demonstrated smaller total cerebellum volume. In addition, people with PTSD showed reduced volume in subregions primarily within the posterior lobe (lobule VIIB, crus II), but also the vermis (VI, VIII), flocculonodular lobe (lobule X), and cerebellar white matter (all p-FDR < 0.05). Effects of PTSD on volume were consistent, and generally more robust, when examining symptom severity rather than diagnostic status. Conclusions: These findings implicate regionally specific cerebellar volumetric differences in the pathophysiology of PTSD. The cerebellum appears to play an important role in high-order cognitive and emotional processes, far beyond its historical association with vestibulomotor function. Further examination of the cerebellum in trauma-related psychopathology will help to clarify how cerebellar structure and function may disrupt cognitive and affective processes at the center of translational models for PTSD.

                Hippocampal replay - the time-compressed, sequential reactivation of ensembles of neurons related to past experience - is a key neural mechanism of memory consolidation. Replay typically coincides with a characteristic pattern of local field potential activity, the sharp-wave ripple (SWR). Reduced SWR rates are associated with cognitive impairment in multiple models of neurodegenerative disease, suggesting that a clinically viable intervention to promote SWRs and replay would prove beneficial. We therefore developed a neurofeedback paradigm for rat subjects in which SWR detection triggered rapid positive feedback in the context of a memory-dependent task. This training protocol increased the prevalence of task-relevant replay during the targeted neurofeedback period by changing the temporal dynamics of SWR occurrence. This increase was also associated with neural and behavioral forms of compensation after the targeted period. These findings reveal short-timescale regulation of SWR generation and demonstrate that neurofeedback is an effective strategy for modulating hippocampal replay.

                There is robust evidence for sex differences in domain-specific cognitive performance in the general population, where females typically show an advantage for verbal memory (VM), while males tend to perform better on tasks of spatial memory (SM). Sex differences in brain structure and connectivity are also well-documented and may provide insight into sex differences in cognition. In this study, we examined sex differences in cognition and morphometric brain connectivity of a large healthy sample (N = 31,180) from the UK Biobank dataset. Using T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and regional cortical thickness values, we applied jackknife bias estimation and graph theory to obtain subject-specific measures of morphometric brain connectivity, hypothesizing that sex-related differences in brain network global efficiency, or overall connectivity, would underlie observed cognitive differences. As predicted, females demonstrated better VM performance and males showed an advantage in SM. Females also demonstrated faster processing speed, with no observed sex difference in executive functioning. Males tended to have higher global efficiency, as well as higher regional connectivity (nodal strengths) in both the left and right hemispheres relative to females. Furthermore, higher global efficiency in males was found to mediate observed sex differences in cognition, predicting poorer verbal memory performance, better spatial memory, and slower processing speed in males. These findings contribute to an improved understanding of the way biological sex and differences in cognitive performance are related to morphometric brain connectivity as derived from graph-theoretic methods.

                Mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) complexes are key mediators of energy metabolism in astrocytes and neurons, with subsequent effects on memory, behaviour and neurodegeneration. Mitochondrial dysfunction and increased blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability are known pathologies in Parkinsons and Alzheimers diseases. However, knowledge of how ETC activities regulate metabolic flux and influence permeability in the BBB is lacking. Using metabolic flux control analysis we show that complex I is a critical control point for oxidative flux and permeability in brain microvascular endothelial cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells. Inhibition of complex I activity immediately reduced the transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) by 60%, leading to an increase in protein transport across the BBB. These events were accompanied by a transient reduction in ATP that was recovered, along with TEER values, over an extended time period. Furthermore, while inhibition of downstream complexes III or IV decreased oxygen respiration rates, no effects on BBB permeability were identified, due to compensatory glycolytic flux and maintenance of ATP synthesis. These data show that mitochondrial complex I is critical for maintaining energy production in endothelial cells and transiently controls BBB permeability, which may contribute to brain disorders where complex I dysfunction is a hallmark.

                Previously, we found that age-dependent beta-amyloid accumulation is not enough to cause synaptic decline. Here, we characterized endolysosomes (late-endosomes and lysosomes) in aged neurons and the aged brain, which might drive synaptic decline since lysosomes are a cellular aging target and relevant for synapses. Neuronal aging induces enlarged endolysosome accumulation in the aged neurons and brain, especially distally, related to the increased anterograde movement. Aged lysosomes abound in neurites but are less degradative due to deacidification despite cathepsin D buildup, leading to late-endosome accumulation. Increasing the acidification of aged lysosomes by ML-SA1 treatment increased degradation and reverted synaptic decline, while lysosome alkalinization by chloroquine treatment mimicked age-dependent lysosome dysfunction and synaptic decline. We identify the deacidification of distal lysosomes as a neuronal mechanism of age-dependent synapse loss. Our findings suggest that future therapeutic strategies to address lysosomal defects might be able to delay age-related synaptic decline.

                Animals can learn to repeat behaviors to earn desired rewards, a process commonly known as reinforcement learning. While previous work has implicated the ascending dopaminergic projections to the basal ganglia in reinforcement learning, little is known about the role of the hippocampus. Here we report that a specific population of hippocampal neurons and their dopaminergic innervation contribute to operant self-stimulation. These neurons are located in the dentate gyrus, receive dopaminergic projections from the locus coeruleus, and express D1 dopamine receptors. Activation of D1+ dentate neurons is sufficient for self-stimulation: mice will press a lever to earn optogenetic activation of these neurons. A similar effect is also observed with selective activation of the locus coeruleus projections to the dentate gyrus, and blocked by D1 receptor antagonism. Calcium imaging of D1+ dentate neurons revealed significant activity at the time of action selection, but not during passive reward delivery. These results reveal the role of dopaminergic innervation of the hippocampus in supporting operant reinforcement.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Early impairments of visually-driven neuronal ensemble dynamics in the rTg4510 tauopathy mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Tau protein pathology is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer Disease or frontotemporal dementia. Synaptic dysfunction and abnormal visual evoked potentials have been reported in murine models of tauopathy, but little is known about the state of the network activity on a single neuronal level prior to brain atrophy. In the present study, oscillatory rhythms and single-cell calcium activity of primary visual cortex pyramidal neuron population were investigated in basal and light evoked states in the rTg4510 tauopathy mouse model prior to neurodegeneration. We found a decrease in their responsivity and overall activity which was insensitive to GABAergic modulation. Despite an enhancement of basal state coactivation of cortical pyramidal neurons, a loss of input-output synchronicity was observed. Spectral power analysis revealed a reduction of basal theta oscillations in rTg4510 mice. Enhanced susceptibility to a sub-convulsive dose of pentylenetetrazol was further indicated by an increase in theta power and higher number of absence-like seizures in rTg4510 compared to control mice. Our results unveil impairments in visual cortical pyramidal neuron processing and define aberrant oscillations as a biomarker candidate in early stages of neurodegenerative tauopathies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Presymptomatic neuroanatomical and cognitive biomarkers of alpha-synuclein propagation in a mouse model of synucleinopathy</a></h4>

              
                There is significant evidence suggesting aggregated misfolded alpha-synuclein, a major component of Lewy bodies, propagates in a prion-like manner contributing to disease progression in Parkinson's disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies. Animal models are essential for understanding and developing treatments for these diseases. However, despite modelling human pathology, most endpoints studied in mice do not translate to humans. Furthermore, the progression by which alpha-synuclein misfolding affects human-relevant measures such as brain volume and underlying subtle, high-level cognitive deficits is poorly understood. Here we used a mouse model of synucleinopathy; hemizygous M83 human A53T alpha-synuclein transgenic mice inoculated with recombinant human alpha-synuclein preformed fibrils (PFF) injected in the right striatum to initiate alpha-synuclein misfolding and aggregation. We examined alpha-synuclein-induced atrophy at 90 days post-injection using ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging as well as high-level cognition and motor function, as biomarkers of alpha-synuclein toxicity. We observed widespread atrophy in bilateral regions that project to or receive input from the injection site, highlighting a network of regions that are consistent with structural changes observed in humans with PD. Moreover, we detected early deficits in reversal learning with touchscreen testing in PFF-injected mice prior to motor dysfunction, consistent with the pathology observed in cortical-striatal and thalamic loops. We show, using translational approaches in mice, that progression of prion-like spreading of alpha-synuclein causes selective atrophy via connected brain regions leading to high-level cognitive deficits. We propose that precise imaging and cognitive biomarkers can provide a more direct and human-relevant measurement of alpha-synuclein-induced toxicity in pre-clinical testing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effective NGN2-based neuronal programming of hiPSCs in an automated microfluidic platform</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative diseases represent an increasing health burden, with a worrying lack of models recapitulating the hallmarks of the pathology. Recently, lab-on-a-chip technology has opened new reliable alternatives to conventional in vitro models able to replicate key aspects of human physiology. For instance, microfluidics allows to mimic the extracellular accumulation of misfolded proteins in the finely controlled microenvironment, thanks to the intrinsic high surface-area-to-volume ratio. Automated microfluidic platforms offer advantages in implementing high-throughput, standardized and parallelized assays, suitable for drug screenings and developing new therapeutic approaches in a cost-effective way. However, the major challenges in the broad application of automated lab-on-a-chip in biological research are the lack of production robustness and ease of use of the devices. Here, we present an automated microfluidic platform able to host the rapid conversion of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into neurons via NGN2 viral programming in a user-friendly manner. The design of the platform, built with multilayer soft-lithography techniques, shows easiness in the fabrication and assembly thanks to the simple geometry and experimental reproducibility at the same time. The all operations are automatically managed from the cell seeding, medium change, doxycycline-mediated neuronal induction, and selection of the genetically engineered cells, to the analysis, including immunofluorescence assay. Our results show a high-throughput, efficient and homogenous conversion of hiPSCs in neurons in 10 days showing the expression of mature marker MAP2, and calcium signaling. The neurons-on-chip model here described represents a fully automated loop system able to address the challenges in the field of neurodegenerative diseases and improve current preclinical models.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Physiological Condition Dependent Changes in Ciliary GPCR Localization in the Brain</a></h4>

              
                Primary cilia are small immotile cellular appendages which mediate diverse types of singling and are found on most mammalian cell types including throughout the central nervous system. Cilia are known to localize certain G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and are critical for mediating the signaling of these receptors. Several of these neuronal GPCRs have recognized roles in feeding behavior and energy homeostasis. Heterologous cell line and model systems like C. elegans and Chlamydomonas have implicated both dynamic GPCR cilia localization and cilia length and shape changes as key for signaling. However, it is unclear if mammalian ciliary GPCRs utilize similar mechanisms in vivo and under what physiological conditions these processes may occur. Here, we use the ciliary GPCRs, melanin concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1) and neuropeptide-Y receptor 2 (NPY2R) as model ciliary receptors to determine if dynamic localization to cilia occurs. We tested physiological conditions in which these GPCRs have been implicated such as feeding behavior, obesity, and circadian rhythm. Cilia were imaged using confocal microscopy and analyzed with a computer assisted approach allowing for unbiased and high throughput analysis of cilia. We analyzed GPCR positive cilia, cilia frequency as well as cilia length and receptor occupancy. Interestingly we observed changes in ciliary length, receptor occupancy, and cilia frequency under different conditions, but no consistent theme across GPCRs or brain nuclei was observed. A better understanding of the subcellular localization dynamics of ciliary GPCRs could reveal unrecognized molecular mechanisms regulating behaviors like feeding.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Direct Brain Recordings Identify a Causal Subsequent-Memory Effect</a></h4>

              
                Endogenous variation in brain state and stimulus-specific evoked activity can both contribute to successful encoding. Previous studies, however, have not clearly distinguished among these components. We address this question by analyzing intracranial EEG recorded from epilepsy patients as they studied and subsequently recalled lists of words. We first trained classifiers to predict recall of either single items or entire lists and found that both classifiers exhibited similar performance. We found that list-level classifier output -- a biomarker of successful encoding -- tracked item presentation and recall events, despite having no information about the trial structure. Across widespread brain regions, decreased low- and increased high-frequency activity (HFA) marked successful encoding of both items and lists. We found regional differences in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, where in the hippocampus HFA correlated more strongly with item recall, whereas in the prefrontal cortex HFA correlated more strongly with list performance. Despite subtle differences in item- and list-level features, the similarity in overall classification performance, spectral signatures of successful recall, and fluctuations of spectral activity across the encoding period argue for a shared endogenous process that causally impacts the brain's ability to learn new information.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Bayesball: Bayesian Integration in Professional Baseball Batters</a></h4>

              
                Pitchers in baseball throw the ball with such high velocity and varying movement that batters only have a few hundred milliseconds to estimate whether to swing and how high to swing--contacting the ball too high or too low may produce hit balls that easily result in an out. Even before the pitcher releases the ball, the batter has some belief, or estimated distribution (a 'prior'), of where the ball may land in the zone. Batters will update this prior belief with information from observing the pitch (the 'likelihood') to calculate their final estimate (the 'posterior'). These models of behavior, called Bayesian models within movement science, predict that when players have better prior information, e.g. because they know the upcoming pitch due to 'tipping', that they will rely more on prior information; by contrast if their prior is less informative, e.g. because the pitch is very random as in the case of a knuckleball, they will instead rely more on the observation. Here we test these models using information from more than a million pitches from professional baseball. We find that batters integrate prior information with noisy observations to manage pitch uncertainty. Moreover, as predicted by a Bayesian model, a batter's estimate of where to swing is biased towards the prior when the pitch is tipped and biased towards the likelihood in the case of pitches with high uncertainty. These results demonstrate that Bayesian ideas are relevant well beyond laboratory experiments and matter in the world of sports.

	<p>Number&amp;amp;ndash;color synesthesia is a condition in which synesthetes perceive numbers with concurrent experience of specific, corresponding colors. It has been proposed that synesthetic association exists primarily between representations of Arabic digit graphemes and colors, and a secondary, semantic connection between numerosity and colors is built via repeated co-activation. However, this distinction between the graphemic and semantic pathways of synesthetic number&amp;amp;ndash;color connection has not been empirically tested. The current study aims to dissociate graphemic and semantic aspects of color activations in number&amp;amp;ndash;color synesthesia by comparing their time courses. We adopted a synesthetic priming paradigm with varied stimuli onset asynchronies (SOAs). A number (2&amp;amp;ndash;6, prime) was presented in one of three notations: digit, dice, or non-canonical dot pattern, and a color patch (target) appeared with an SOA of 0, 100, 300, 400, or 800 ms. Participants reported the color as quickly as possible. Using the congruency effect (i.e., shorter reaction time when target color matched the synesthetic color of number prime) as an index of synesthetic color activation level, we revealed that the effect from the graphemic pathway is quick and relatively persistent, while the effect from the semantic pathway unfolds at a later stage and is more transient. The dissociation between the graphemic and semantic pathways of synesthesia implies further functional distinction within &amp;amp;ldquo;conceptual synesthesia&amp;amp;rdquo;, which has been originally discussed as a unitary phenomenon. This distinction has been demonstrated by the differential time courses of synesthetic color activations, and suggested that a presumed, single type of synesthesia could involve multiple mechanisms.</p>

	<p>d Variability in the response of individuals to various non-invasive brain stimulation protocols is a major problem that limits their potential for clinical applications. Baseline motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude is the key predictor of an individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s response to transcranial magnetic stimulation protocols. However, the factors that predict MEP amplitude and its variability remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to identify the input&amp;amp;ndash;output curve (IOC) parameters that best predict MEP amplitude and its variability. We analysed IOC data from 75 subjects and built a general linear model (GLM) using the IOC parameters as regressors and MEP amplitude at 120% resting motor threshold (RMT) as the response variable. We bootstrapped the data to estimate variability of IOC parameters and included them in a GLM to identify the significant predictors of MEP amplitude variability. Peak slope, motor threshold, and maximum MEP amplitude of the IOC were significant predictors of MEP amplitude at 120% RMT and its variability was primarily driven by the variability of peak slope and maximum MEP amplitude. Recruitment gain and maximum corticospinal excitability are the key predictors of MEP amplitude and its variability. Inter-individual variability in motor output may be reduced by achieving a uniform IOC slope.</p>

	<p>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is one of the important comorbidities of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It is critical to find appropriate methods for early diagnosis and objective assessment of mild cognitive impairment patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM-MCI). Our study aimed to investigate potential early alterations in phase lag index (PLI) and determine whether it can distinguish between T2DM-MCI and normal controls with T2DM (T2DM-NC). EEG was recorded in 30 T2DM-MCI patients and 30 T2DM-NC patients. The phase lag index was computed and used in a logistic regression model to discriminate between groups. The correlation between the phase lag index and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score was assessed. The &amp;amp;alpha;-band phase lag index was significantly decreased in the T2DM-MCI group compared with the T2DM-NC group and showed a moderate degree of classification accuracy. The MoCA score was positively correlated with the &amp;amp;alpha;-band phase lag index (r = 0.4812, moderate association, p = 0.015). This work shows that the functional connectivity analysis of EEG may offer an effective way to track the cortical dysfunction linked to the cognitive deterioration of T2DM patients, and the &amp;amp;alpha;-band phase lag index may have a role in guiding the diagnosis of T2DM-MCI.</p>

	<p>Emotion regulation in old age was found to be more efficient; seniors seem to focus less on the negative aspects of experiences. Here, we ask, do older individuals regulate their emotions more efficiently or are they numb to the physiological changes that modulate these emotions? Interoception, the perception of physical feelings, influences a person&amp;amp;rsquo;s mood, emotions, and sense of well-being, and was hardly tested among older adults. We examined the awareness of physiological changes (physiological arousal&amp;amp;mdash;blood pressure and heart rate) of 47 older adults, compared to 18 young adults, and their subjective reports of emotional experiences while viewing emotional stimuli. Interoception was decreased in old age. Blood pressure medications had a partial role in this reduction. Moreover, interoception mediated emotional experience, such that low interoception led to lower experiences of changes in physiological arousal. These findings may account for the emotional changes in old age, suggesting a decline in sensitivity with age, which leads to a positive interpretation of information.</p>

	<p>Plaque rupture of the basilar artery is one of the leading causes of posterior circulation stroke. The present study aimed to investigate the role of fluid dynamics in the ruptured fibrous cap of basilar artery plaques. Patients with basilar artery plaques (50&amp;amp;ndash;99% stenosis) were screened. Integrity of the fibrous cap was assessed by high-resolution MRI. Computational fluid dynamics models were built based on MR angiography to obtain the wall shear stress and velocity. A total of 176 patients were included. High-resolution MRI identified 35 ruptured fibrous caps of basilar artery plaques. Ruptured fibrous cap was significantly associated with acute infarction (27/35 vs. 96/141, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) in the territory of the basilar artery. Proximal wall shear stress of stenosis was positively related with the ruptured fibrous cap (OR 1.564; 95% CI, 1.101&amp;amp;ndash;2.222; p = 0.013). The threshold of wall shear stress for the ruptured fibrous cap of basilar artery plaques was 4.84 Pa (Area under ROC 0.732, p = 0.008, 95%CI 0.565&amp;amp;ndash;0.899). The present study demonstrated that increased proximal wall shear stress of stenosis was associated with ruptured fibrous caps of basilar artery plaques.</p>

                Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of non-fatal global disease burden, with females being two-fold more likely than males to be diagnosed with the disorder. Despite this distinct sex-linked disparity of diagnosis, it is unclear what underlies the sex bias of MDD prevalence. Recent findings suggest a role for the gut in mediating affective disorders through the gut-brain-axis (GBA). However, few studies have included sex as a biological variable. For this study, cross-sex transfer of cecal microbiota was performed between male and female C57Bl/6 mice to elucidate the effects of sex and the gut microbiome on a standard battery of tests measuring depressive-like behaviours. Specifically, regardless of sex, recipients of male cecal content had a greater sucrose preference than controls and recipients of female cecum. Conversely, in the splash test, recipients of female cecum displayed a decrease in grooming behaviour compared to both controls and recipients of male cecum, suggestive of an increase in depressive-like behaviour. These results support a role for female-specific gut microbes in contributing to female vulnerability to depression, while male-specific gut microbes may protect in part against an anhedonia-like phenotype.

                Although some advancements concerning the arousal involved in mediating the delayed emergency from general anesthesia, which will lead to the serious complications, had been made, the role by arousal in modulating in delayed emergency still remains to be unclear. In our models, based on our previous working that activation of the 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) by optogenetics can significantly reduce the emergency time by activating arousal pathway, we further test whether the serotonergic neural circuit between the DRN and the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is implicated in modulating the arousal from the sevoflurane anesthesia and the emergency time of sevoflurane anesthesia by the pharmacological, optogenetics and fiber photometry. Our findings showed that whether the serotonergic neural circuit between the DRN and the basolateral amygdala (BLA) plays a key role in modulating the arousal from the sevoflurane anesthesia and the emergency time of sevoflurane anesthesia. Based on the serotonergic neural circuit, the 5-HT 1 A receptor is of great significance to mediate the arousal and the emergency time of the sevoflurane anesthesia.

                Dopaminergic cell loss due to the accumulation of -syn is a core feature of PD pathogenesis. Neuroinflammation specifically induced by -syn has been shown to exacerbate neurodegeneration, yet the role of CNS resident macrophages in this process remains unclear. We found that a specific subset of CNS resident macrophages, border-associated macrophages (BAMs), play an essential role in mediating -syn related neuroinflammation due to their unique role as the antigen presenting cells necessary to initiate a CD4 T cell response. Surprisingly, the loss of MHCII antigen presentation on microglia had no effect on neuroinflammation. Furthermore, -syn expression led to an expansion in BAM numbers and a unique damage-associated activation state. Through a combinatorial approach of single-cell RNA sequencing and depletion experiments, we found that BAMs played an essential role in immune cell recruitment, infiltration, and antigen presentation. Furthermore, BAMs were identified in post-mortem PD brain in close proximity to T cells. These results point to a critical role for BAMs in mediating PD pathogenesis through their essential role in the orchestration of the -syn-mediated neuroinflammatory response.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Network Segregation in Aging Females and Evaluation of the Impact of Sex Steroid Hormones</a></h4>

              
                Males and females show differential patterns in connectivity in resting-state networks (RSNs) during normal aging, from early adulthood to late middle age. Age-related differences in network integration (effectiveness of specialized communication at the global network level) and segregation (functional specialization at the local level of specific brain regions) may also differ by sex. These differences may be due at least in part to endogenous hormonal fluctuation, such as that which occurs in females during midlife with the transition to menopause when levels of estrogens and progesterone drop markedly. A limited number of studies that have investigated sex differences in the action of steroid hormones in brain networks. Here we investigated how sex steroid hormones relate to age-network relationships in both males and females, with a focus on network segregation. Females displayed a significant quadratic relationship between age and network segregation for the cerebellar-basal ganglia and salience networks. In both cases, segregation was still increasing through adulthood, highest in midlife, and with a downturn thereafter. However, there were no significant relationships between sex steroid hormone levels and network segregation levels in females, and they did not exhibit significant associations between progesterone or 17{beta}-estradiol and network segregation. Patterns of connectivity between the cerebellum and basal ganglia have been associated with cognitive performance and self-reported balance confidence in older adults. Together, these findings suggest that network segregation patterns with age in females vary by network, and that sex steroid hormones are not associated with this measure of connectivity in this cross-sectional analysis. Though this is a null effect, it remains critical for understanding the extent to which hormones relate to brain network architecture.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">IMPA1 dependent regulation of plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate turnover and calcium signalling by lithium</a></h4>

              
                Lithium (Li) is a widely used as a mood stabilizer in the clinical management of Bipolar Affective Disorder (BPAD). However, the molecular targets of Li in neural cells that underpin its therapeutic effect remain unresolved. Inositol monophosphatase (IMPA1), is an enzyme involved in the resynthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) following receptor-activated phospholipase C (PLC) signalling. In vitro, Li inhibits IMPA1, but the relevance of this inhibition within neural cells remains unknown. Here we report that in human cells, treatment with therapeutically relevant concentrations of Li reduces receptor activated calcium release from intracellular stores and also delays the resynthesis of PIP2 following receptor activated PLC signalling. Both these effects of Li are abrogated in cells where IMPA1 has been deleted. We also observed that in human forebrain cortical neurons, treatment with Li results in reduced neuronal excitability as well as reduced calcium signals following receptor activated PLC signalling. Following Li treatment of human forebrain cortical neurons, transcriptome analyses reveal downregulation of multiple components of the glutamate receptor signalling system. Glutamate is a key excitatory neurotransmitter in the human brain and thus our findings provide an insight into the mechanisms underlying the dampening of neuronal excitability following Li treatment. Collectively, our findings suggest that Li inhibits receptor activated PLC signalling leading to an altered transcriptional response and reduced neuronal excitability.

	<p>Background: The safety of the new vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have already been shown, although data on patients with polyneuropathy are still lacking. The aim of this study is to evaluate the adherence to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, as well as the reactogenicity to those vaccines in patients affected by neuropathy. Methods: A multicentric and web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among patients affected by neuropathy from part of South Italy. Results: Out of 285 responders, n = 268 were included in the final analysis and n = 258 of them (96.3%) were fully vaccinated. Adherence to vaccination was higher in patients with hereditary neuropathies compared to others, while it was lower in patients with anti-MAG neuropathy (all p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The overall prevalence of adverse events (AEs) was 61.2% and its occurrence was not associated with neuropathy type. Being female and of younger age were factors associated with higher risk of AEs, while having an inflammatory neuropathy and steroids assumption were associated with a lower risk (all p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Younger age, having had an AE, and COVID-19 before vaccination were factors associated with symptoms worsening after vaccination (all p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). (4) Conclusions: Patients with neuropathy showed a high level of adherence to COVID-19 vaccination. Safety of vaccines in patients with neuropathies was comparable to the general population and it was more favorable in those with inflammatory neuropathy.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Emerging approaches for decoding neuropeptide transmission</a></h4>

              
                Neuropeptides produce robust effects on behavior across species, and recent research has benefited from advances in high-resolution techniques to investigate peptidergic transmission and expression throughout the brain in model systems. Neuropeptides exhibit distinct characteristics which includes their post-translational processing, release from dense core vesicles, and ability to activate G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These complex properties have driven the need for development of specialized tools that can sense neuropeptide expression, cell activity, and release.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Removal of pomt1 in zebrafish leads to loss of α-dystroglycan glycosylation and dystroglycanopathy phenotypes</a></h4>

              
                Biallelic mutations in Protein O-mannosyltransferase 1 (POMT1) are among the most common causes of a severe group of congenital muscular dystrophies (CMDs) known as dystroglycanopathies. POMT1 is a glycosyltransferase responsible for the attachment of a functional glycan mediating interactions between the transmembrane glycoprotein dystroglycan and its binding partners in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Disruptions in these cell-ECM interactions lead to multiple developmental defects causing brain and eye malformations in addition to CMD. Removing Pomt1 in the mouse leads to early embryonic death due to the essential role of dystroglycan in embryo implantation in rodents. Here, we characterized and validated a model of pomt1 loss of function in the zebrafish showing that developmental defects found in individuals affected by dystroglycanopathies can be recapitulated in the fish. We also discovered that pomt1 mRNA provided by the mother in the oocyte supports dystroglycan glycosylation during the first few weeks of development. Muscle disease, retinal synapse formation deficits, and axon guidance defects can only be uncovered during the first week post-fertilization by generating knock-out embryos from knock-out mothers. Conversely, maternal pomt1 from heterozygous mothers was sufficient to sustain muscle, eye, and brain development only leading to detectable muscle disease and loss of photoreceptor synapses at 30 days post fertilization. Our findings show that it is important to define the contribution of maternal mRNA while developing zebrafish models of dystroglycanopathies and that offspring generated from heterozygous and knock-out mothers can be used to differentiate the role of dystroglycan glycosylation in tissue formation and maintenance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Building Transformers from Neurons and Astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Glial cells account for roughly 90% of all human brain cells, and serve a variety of important developmental, structural, and metabolic functions. Recent experimental efforts suggest that astrocytes, a type of glial cell, are also directly involved in core cognitive processes such as learning and memory. While it is well-established that astrocytes and neurons are connected to one another in feedback loops across many time scales and spatial scales, there is a gap in understanding the computational role of neuron-astrocyte interactions. To help bridge this gap, we draw on recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and astrocyte imaging technology. In particular, we show that neuron-astrocyte networks can naturally perform the core computation of a Transformer, a particularly successful type of AI architecture. In doing so, we provide a concrete and experimentally testable account of neuron-astrocyte communication. Because Transformers are so successful across a wide variety of task domains, such as language, vision, and audition, our analysis may help explain the ubiquity, flexibility, and power of the brain's neuron-astrocyte networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visual experience instructs the organization of cortical feedback inputs to primary visual cortex.</a></h4>

              
                Cortical feedback (FB) projections are thought to modulate lower-order activity depending on learned expectations. However, whether FB inputs become bound to specific lower-order neurons depending on experience is unknown. We measured the effects of dark rearing and manipulations of experienced visual statistics on the retinotopic specificity of projections from the lateromedial (LM) visual area to layer 1 of the mouse primary visual cortex (V1). LM inputs were, on average, retinotopically matched with V1 neurons irrespective of visual experience. While the orientation tuning of LM axons determined the retinotopic position of the V1 neurons they innervated, this organization was absent in dark-reared mice. Restricting visual experience to a narrow range of orientations revealed that visual experience exerts an instructive role in the retinotopic organization of LM inputs in V1. Our observations support theories of hierarchical computation proposing that inputs from higher-order neurons to lower-order ones reflect learned hierarchical associations.

	<p>The brain is susceptible to perturbations of redox balance, affecting neurogenesis and increasing the risks of psychiatric disorders. Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) is an endogenous inhibitor of the thioredoxin antioxidant system. Its deletion or inhibition suggests protection for a brain with ischemic stroke or Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. Combined with conditional knockout mice and schizophrenia samples, we aimed to investigate the function of TXNIP in healthy brain and psychiatric disorders, which are under-studied. We found TXNIP was remarkedly expressed in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during healthy mice&amp;amp;rsquo;s prenatal and early postnatal periods, whereas it rapidly decreased throughout adulthood. During early life, TXNIP was primarily distributed in inhibitory and excitatory neurons. Contrary to the protective effect, the embryonic deletion of TXNIP in GABAergic (gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic) neurons enhanced oxidative stress in PV+ interneurons of aging mice. The deleterious impact was brain region-specific. We also investigated the relationship between TXNIP and schizophrenia. TXNIP was significantly increased in the PFC of schizophrenia-like mice after MK801 administration, followed by oxidative stress. First episode and drug na&amp;amp;iuml;ve schizophrenia patients with a higher level of plasma TXNIP displayed severer psychiatric symptoms than patients with a low level. We indicated a bidirectional function of TXNIP in the brain, whose high expression in the early stage is protective for development but might be harmful in a later period, associated with mental disorders.</p>

	<p>Brain decoding is to predict the external stimulus information from the collected brain response activities, and visual information is one of the most important sources of external stimulus information. Decoding functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) based on visual stimulation is helpful in understanding the working mechanism of the brain visual function regions. Traditional brain decoding algorithms cannot accurately extract stimuli features from fMRI. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposed a brain decoding algorithm based on a graph convolution network (GCN). Firstly, 11 regions of interest (ROI) were selected according to the human brain visual function regions, which can avoid the noise interference of the non-visual regions of the human brain; then, a deep three-dimensional convolution neural network was specially designed to extract the features of these 11 regions; next, the GCN was used to extract the functional correlation features between the different human brain visual regions. Furthermore, to avoid the problem of gradient disappearance when there were too many layers of graph convolutional neural network, the residual connections were adopted in our algorithm, which helped to integrate different levels of features in order to improve the accuracy of the proposed GCN. The proposed algorithm was tested on the public dataset, and the recognition accuracy reached 98.67%. Compared with the other state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed algorithm performed the best.</p>

	<p>Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective therapy for many psychiatric illnesses. However, intracranial occupying lesions are a relative contraindication to ECT. Arachnoid cysts are benign, congenital, and space-occupying lesions. Our study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of ECT in psychiatric patients with arachnoid cysts. We retrospectively identified 62 psychiatric patients with arachnoid cysts; 43 of them underwent ECT and 19 did not. Their conditions were assessed by CGI-S and different scales depending on different diagnoses (PANSS for schizophrenia; HAMD for depression; YMRS for bipolar disorder). The side effect was assessed by TESS. Significant differences were shown in the reduced scores of the CGI-S between patients who underwent ECT and those who did not (p = 0.001), while, at the same time, there was no significant difference in their TESS score (p = 0.297). The current study found that ECT is an effective and tolerable therapy for psychiatric patients with arachnoid cysts.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modulation of signaling cross-talk between pJNK and pAKT generates optimal apoptotic response</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sharmila Biswas, Baishakhi Tikader, Sandip Kar, Ganesh A. Viswanathan</p>

Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) is a well-known modulator of apoptosis by maintaining a balance between proliferation and cell-death in normal cells. Cancer cells often evade apoptotic response following TNFα stimulation by altering signaling cross-talks. Thus, varying the extent of signaling cross-talk could enable optimal TNFα mediated apoptotic dynamics. Herein, we use an experimental data-driven mathematical modeling to quantitate the extent of synergistic signaling cross-talk between the intracellular entities phosphorylated JNK (pJNK) and phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) that orchestrate the phenotypic apoptosis level by modulating the activated Caspase3 dynamics. Our study reveals that this modulation is orchestrated by the distinct dynamic nature of the synergism at early and late phases. We show that this synergism in signal flow is governed by branches originating from either TNFα receptor and NFκB, which facilitates signaling through survival pathways. We demonstrate that the experimentally quantified apoptosis levels semi-quantitatively correlates with the model simulated Caspase3 transients. Interestingly, perturbing pJNK and pAKT transient dynamics fine-tunes this accumulated Caspase3 guided apoptotic response. Thus, our study offers useful insights for identifying potential targeted therapies for optimal apoptotic response.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A deep learning approach to real-time HIV outbreak detection using genetic data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michael D. Kupperman, Thomas Leitner, Ruian Ke</p>

Pathogen genomic sequence data are increasingly made available for epidemiological monitoring. A main interest is to identify and assess the potential of infectious disease outbreaks. While popular methods to analyze sequence data often involve phylogenetic tree inference, they are vulnerable to errors from recombination and impose a high computational cost, making it difficult to obtain real-time results when the number of sequences is in or above the thousands.
Here, we propose an alternative strategy to outbreak detection using genomic data based on deep learning methods developed for image classification. The key idea is to use a pairwise genetic distance matrix calculated from viral sequences as an image, and develop convolutional neutral network (CNN) models to classify areas of the images that show signatures of active outbreak, leading to identification of subsets of sequences taken from an active outbreak. We showed that our method is efficient in finding HIV-1 outbreaks with <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> ≥ 2.5, and overall a specificity exceeding 98% and sensitivity better than 92%. We validated our approach using data from HIV-1 CRF01 in Europe, containing both endemic sequences and a well-known dual outbreak in intravenous drug users. Our model accurately identified known outbreak sequences in the background of slower spreading HIV. Importantly, we detected both outbreaks early on, before they were over, implying that had this method been applied in real-time as data became available, one would have been able to intervene and possibly prevent the extent of these outbreaks. This approach is scalable to processing hundreds of thousands of sequences, making it useful for current and future real-time epidemiological investigations, including public health monitoring using large databases and especially for rapid outbreak identification.

     alt="Lifespan changes in cannabinoid 1 receptor mRNA expression in the female C57BL/6J mouse brain"/>
<p>The number of cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB<sub>1</sub>R) positive cell in the brain varies along life span of female C57BL/6J mice, whose patterns can be clustered into 9 catagories indicating possible correlation among the brain regions. The dynamics of CB<sub>1</sub>R positive cell number along life span may partially be responsible to disease suceptability in different ages in female.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Many brain functions that underlie behavior, cognition, and emotions vary with age, as does susceptibility to neuropsychological disorders. The expression of specific genes that are involved in these functions, such as the genes encoding for oxytocin, its receptors, and apolipoprotein D, varies with age across different brain regions. The cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB<sub>1</sub>R) is one of the most widely spread G-protein coupled receptors in the central nervous system and is increasingly recognized for its important contribution to various brain functions. Although changes in CB<sub>1</sub>R expression with age have been reported in the male mouse brain, they have not been well investigated in the female brain. Here, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization to target CB<sub>1</sub>R mRNA in the whole brains of female C57BL/6J mice aged 4, 6, 12, 52 (12 months) and 86 weeks (20 months), and quantified CB<sub>1</sub>R-positive cells in 36 brain regions across the whole brain. The results showed that CB<sub>1</sub>R-positive cells number changed with age. Specifically, CB<sub>1</sub>R expression increased with age in some subregions of the cortex, decreased with age in the lateral septal area, and reached its lowest level at 52 weeks in the thalamus, hypothalamus, and hindbrain subregions. Cluster analysis revealed that some brain regions shared similar temporal characteristics in CB<sub>1</sub>R-positive cell number across the lifespan. Our results provide evidence that investigation of the neural basis of age-related characteristics of female brain functions is not only warranted but required.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Amyloid‐Related Imaging Abnormalities in the DIAN‐TU‐001 Trial of Gantenerumab and Solanezumab: Lessons from a Trial in Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine the characteristics of participants with amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) in a trial of gantenerumab or solanezumab in dominantly inherited Alzheimer disease (DIAD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>142 DIAD mutation carriers received either gantenerumab SC (n = 52), solanezumab IV (n = 50), or placebo (n = 40). Participants underwent assessments with the Clinical Dementia Rating® (CDR®), neuropsychological testing, CSF biomarkers, β-amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to monitor ARIA. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses evaluated potential ARIA-related risk factors.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Eleven participants developed ARIA-E, including 3 with mild symptoms. No ARIA-E was reported under solanezumab while gantenerumab was associated with ARIA-E compared to placebo (odds ratio [OR] = 9.1, confidence interval [CI][1.2, 412.3]; <i>p</i> = 0.021). Under gantenerumab, <i>APOE-ɛ4</i> carriers were more likely to develop ARIA-E (OR = 5.0, CI[1.0, 30.4]; <i>p</i> = 0.055), as were individuals with microhemorrhage at baseline (OR = 13.7, CI[1.2, 163.2]; <i>p</i> = 0.039). No ARIA-E was observed at the initial 225 mg/month gantenerumab dose, and most cases were observed at doses &gt;675 mg. At first ARIA-E occurrence, all ARIA-E participants were amyloid-PET+, 60% were CDR &gt;0, 60% were past their estimated year to symptom onset, and 60% had also incident ARIA-H. Most ARIA-E radiologically resolved after dose adjustment and developing ARIA-E did not significantly increase odds of trial discontinuation. ARIA-E was more frequently observed in the occipital lobe (90%). ARIA-E severity was associated with age at time of ARIA-E.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In DIAD, solanezumab was not associated with ARIA. Gantenerumab dose over 225 mg increased ARIA-E risk, with additional risk for individuals <i>APOE-ɛ4(+)</i> or with microhemorrhage. ARIA-E was reversible on MRI in most cases, generally asymptomatic, without additional risk for trial discontinuation. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Neurodevelopmental patterns of early postnatal white matter maturation represent distinct underlying microstructure and histology</a></h4>

              
                Using high-resolution T2-/T1-weighted MR images from a large sample, Nazeri et al. identify reproducible patterns of coordinated white matter maturation during the early postnatal period that correspond to distinct developmental trajectories, microstructure, and histology. These results provide important context for understanding the complexities of white matter development in health and disease.

                Mammalian axonal development begins in embryonic stages and continues postnatally. After birth, axonal proteomic landscape changes rapidly, coordinated by transcription, protein turnover, and post-translational modifications. Comprehensive profiling of axonal proteomes across neurodevelopment is limited, with most studies lacking cell-type and neural circuit specificity, resulting in substantial information loss. We create a Cre-dependent APEX2 reporter mouse line and map cell-type specific proteome of corticostriatal projections across postnatal development. We synthesize analysis frameworks to define temporal patterns of axonal proteome and phosphoproteome, identifying co-regulated proteins and phosphorylations associated with genetic risk for human brain disorders. We discover proline-directed kinases as major developmental regulators. APEX2 transgenic reporter proximity labeling offers flexible strategies for subcellular proteomics with cell type specificity in early neurodevelopment, a critical period for neuropsychiatric disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Disrupted-in-schizophrenia-1 is required for normal pyramidal cell–interneuron communication and assembly dynamics in the prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                We interrogated prefrontal circuit function in mice lacking <i>Disrupted-in-schizophrenia-1</i> (Disc1-mutant mice), a risk factor for psychiatric disorders. Single-unit recordings in awake mice revealed reduced average firing rates of fast-spiking interneurons (INTs), including optogenetically identified parvalbumin-positive cells, and a lower proportion of INTs phase-coupled to ongoing gamma oscillations. Moreover, we observed decreased spike transmission efficacy at local pyramidal cell (PYR)-INT connections in vivo, suggesting a reduced excitatory effect of local glutamatergic inputs as a potential mechanism of lower INT rates. On the network level, impaired INT function resulted in altered activation of PYR assemblies: While assembly activations defined as coactivations within 25 ms were observed equally often, the expression strength of individual assembly patterns was significantly higher in Disc1-mutant mice. Our data, thus, reveal a role of Disc1 in shaping the properties of prefrontal assembly patterns by setting INT responsiveness to glutamatergic drive.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Anopheles homing suppression drive candidates exhibit unexpected performance differences in simulations with spatial structure</a></h4>

              
                Recent experiments have produced several <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> homing gene drives that disrupt female fertility genes, thereby eventually inducing population collapse. Such drives may be highly effective tools to combat malaria. One such homing drive, based on the <i>zpg</i> promoter driving CRISPR/Cas9, was able to eliminate a cage population of mosquitoes. A second version, purportedly improved upon the first by incorporating an X-shredder element (which biases inheritance towards male offspring), was similarly successful. Here, we analyze experimental data from each of these gene drives to extract their characteristics and performance parameters and compare these to previous interpretations of their experimental performance. We assess each suppression drive within an individual-based simulation framework that models mosquito population dynamics in continuous space. We find that the combined homing/X-shredder drive is actually less effective at population suppression within the context of our mosquito population model. In particular, the combined drive often fails to completely suppress the population, instead resulting in an unstable equilibrium between drive and wild-type alleles. By contrast, otherwise similar drives based on the <i>nos</i> promoter may prove to be more promising candidates for future development than originally thought.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Population spiking and bursting in next generation neural masses with spike-frequency adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Spike-frequency adaptation (SFA) is a fundamental neuronal mechanism taking into account the fatigue due to spike emissions and the consequent reduction of the firing activity. We have studied the effect of this adaptation mechanism on the macroscopic dynamics of excitatory and inhibitory networks of quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF) neurons coupled via exponentially decaying post-synaptic potentials. In particular, we have studied the population activities by employing an exact mean field reduction, which gives rise to next generation neural mass models. This low-dimensional reduction allows for the derivation of bifurcation diagrams and the identification of the possible macroscopic regimes emerging both in a single and in two identically coupled neural masses. In single popukations SFA favours the emergence of population bursts in excitatory networks, while it hinders tonic population spiking for inhibitory ones. The symmetric coupling of two neural masses, in absence of adaptation, leads to the emergence of macroscopic solutions with broken symmetry : namely, chimera-like solutions in the inhibitory case and anti-phase population spikes in the excitatory one. The addition of SFA leads to new collective dynamical regimes exhibiting cross-frequency coupling (CFC) among the fast synaptic time scale and the slow adaptation one, ranging from anti-phase slow-fast nested oscillations to symmetric and asymmetric bursting phenomena. The analysis of these CFC rhythms in the{theta} -{gamma} range has revealed that a reduction of SFA leads to an increase of the{theta} frequency joined to a decrease of the{gamma} one. This is analogous to what reported experimentally for the hippocampus and the olfactory cortex of rodents under cholinergic modulation, that is known to reduce SFA.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcriptomic diversity of cell types across the adult human brain</a></h4>

              
                The human brain directs a wide range of complex behaviors ranging from fine motor skills to abstract intelligence and emotion. However, the diversity of cell types that support these skills has not been fully described. Here we used high-throughput single-nucleus RNA sequencing to systematically survey cells across the entire adult human brain in three postmortem donors. We sampled over three million nuclei from approximately 100 dissections across the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. Our analysis identified 461 clusters and 3313 subclusters organized largely according to developmental origins. We found area-specific cortical neurons, as well as an unexpectedly high diversity of midbrain and hindbrain neurons. Astrocytes also exhibited regional diversity at multiple scales, comprising subtypes specific to the telencephalon and to more precise anatomical locations. Oligodendrocyte precursors comprised two distinct major types specific to the telencephalon and to the rest of the brain. Together, these findings demonstrate the unique cellular composition of the telencephalon with respect to all major brain cell types. As the first single-cell transcriptomic census of the entire human brain, we provide a resource for understanding the molecular diversity of the human brain in health and disease.

                The aim of this pilot study is to investigate the immediate effects of Automatic Self-Transcending (AST) meditation on the cognitive function, EEG activity and autonomic arousal (Study 1) and characterize the frontal EEG synchrony during resting state, cognitive activity and AST mental states in traditional and wireless EEG's (Study 2). We report the results of three healthy AST meditation volunteers in this case-report study (Case 1 - age = 26 years, meditative practice time = 2 months; Case 2 - age = 39 years, meditative practice time = 6 years; Case 3 - age = 59 years, meditative practice time = 40 years). In study 1, the volunteers performed a protocol with simultaneous recording of EEG and skin conductance while performing the Stroop test (T0), followed by 20 minutes of AST meditation and immediately the same protocol performed at T0 (T1). We analyzed P300 amplitude and latency, as well as test behavioral response and skin conductance activity before and immediately after a single session of AST. In study 2, the same volunteers performed three tasks with eyes closed on two EEG equipment (traditional and wireless): resting state, cognitive activity and one session of AST, each for 20 minutes. We measured the frontal interhemispheric coherence of alpha1 (8-10 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) for each condition and EEG type. Our main findings show that there is an immediate beneficial effect after AST meditation at the level of the same individual with different patterns of P300 and skin conductance activity and that AST meditation is marked by an overall increase in the frontal coherence of alpha1 and beta bands, when compared to other mental states. We conclude that 1) there is an immediate effect on cognition and executive control after AST meditation, 2) the frontal interhemispheric coherence of alpha1 and beta bands are increased during AST, and 3) wireless EEG exhibits the same characteristics observed in traditional EEG and therefore can be used to describe cortical dynamics during AST.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Emergence of the cortical encoding of phonetic features in the first year of life</a></h4>

              
                Even prior to producing their first words, infants are developing a sophisticated speech processing system, with robust word recognition present by 4-6 months of age. These emergent linguistic skills, observed with behavioural investigations, are likely to rely on increasingly sophisticated neural underpinnings. The infant brain is known to robustly track the speech envelope, however to date no cortical tracking study could investigate the emergence of phonetic feature encoding. Here we utilise temporal response functions computed from electrophysiological responses to nursery rhymes to investigate the cortical encoding of phonetic features in a longitudinal cohort of infants when aged 4, 7 and 11 months, as well as adults. The analyses reveal an increasingly detailed and acoustically-invariant phonetic encoding over the first year of life, providing the first direct evidence that the pre-verbal human cortex learns phonetic categories. By 11 months of age, however, infants still did not exhibit adult-like encoding.

                While the causes of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remain unclear, some studies have shown that serotonin-mediated effects on enteric nervous system (ENT) correlate with ASD-like behavioral phenotype in mice. Introduced here is a mathematical model of interactions between gut serotonin and its impact on ENT. The model was used to identify three key factors that affect ENT size, namely, serotonin production, its clearance, and its ability to act as a growth factor on ENT. The model was used to reproduce experimentally reported results from a mouse model by Margolis et al. (2016), which connected serotonin-mediated ENT hypoplasia to an ASD phenotype. The proposed mathematical model was used to scale the quantified relationship from mice to humans to show how the combination of these three factors can translate to a quantifiable metric that could potentially be correlated to ASD spectrum. A detailed discussion of how ENT hypoplasia could mechanistically affect CNS activity concludes this paper.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pre-saccadic neural enhancements in marmoset area MT mimic covert attention</a></h4>

              
                Each time we make a saccadic eye movement, attention moves before the eyes, resulting in a perceptual enhancement at the target of the movement (Kowler et al., 1995; Deubel & Schneider, 1996; Rolfs & Carrasco, 2012). Recent psychophysical studies suggest that this pre-saccadic attention may differ in important ways from covert attention when no eye movement is made (Li, Pan, & Carrasco, 2021a,b). One difference is that pre-saccadic attention involves an automatic enhancement concentrated around the features of the saccade target, such as its orientation, whereas spatial attention in covert attention enhances stimulus features uniformly (Li et al., 2016; Ohl et al., 2017). While previous neurophysiological studies have found that pre-saccadic attention enhances neural responses (Moore et al., 1998; Li & Basso, 2008; Moore & Chang, 2009; Steinmetz & Moore 2010; Merrikhi et al., 2021), no studies have tested for changes in tuning that would support a concentration of enhancement around target features. Here we examined pre-saccadic attention using a saccade foraging task developed for marmoset monkeys. We first establish that the marmoset monkey, like macaques, shows enhanced pre-saccadic neural responses in the middle temporal (MT) and middle temporal crescent (MTC) areas. To examine if changes in neural tuning might support feature enhancement, we fit an adjusted Von Mises function to the direction selective responses of neurons. Neurons exhibited diverse changes in tuning, but the predominant pattern was an additive and multiplicative increase in the tuning curve consistent with spatial gain. The changes in tuning predicted changes in neural sensitivity assessed by measures of mutual information with motion direction. Additive increases led to detriments in sensitivity while gain increases improved sensitivity. And although a subset of neurons did show a narrowing in tuning that could reflect feature-selection, there were equal number of neurons showing the opposite. Overall the modulation of neural responses during pre-saccadic attention appears highly consistent with previous studies of covert attention.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Macro-scale patterns in functional connectivity associated with ongoing thought patterns and dispositional traits</a></h4>

              
                Complex macro-scale patterns of brain activity that emerge during periods of wakeful rest provide insight into the organisation of neural function, how these differentiate individuals based on their traits, and the neural basis of different types of self-generated thoughts. Although brain activity during wakeful rest is valuable for understanding important features of human cognition, its unconstrained nature makes it difficult to disentangle neural features related to personality traits from those related to the thoughts occurring at rest. Our study builds on recent perspectives from work on ongoing conscious thought that highlight the interactions between three brain networks - ventral and dorsal attention networks, as well as the default mode network. We combined measures of personality with state-of-the-art indices of ongoing thoughts at rest and brain imaging analysis, and explored whether this  tri-partite view can provide a framework within which to understand the contribution of states and traits to observed patterns of neural activity at rest. To capture macro-scale relationships between different brain systems, we calculated cortical gradients to describe brain organisation in a low dimensional space. Our analysis established that for more introverted individuals, regions of the ventral attention network were functionally more aligned to regions of the somatomotor system and the default mode network. At the same time, a pattern of detailed self-generated thought was associated with a decoupling of regions of dorsal attention from regions in the default mode network. Our study, therefore, establishes interactions between attention systems and the default mode network are important influences on ongoing thought at rest and highlights the value of integrating contemporary perspectives on conscious experience when understanding patterns of brain activity at rest.

                Neuronal activity evokes a vascular response that is essential to sustain brain function. We show that neurovascular coupling (NVC) is mediated by long-range projecting GABAergic neurons that express Tacr1. Whisker stimulation elicited Tacr1 neuron activity in the barrel cortex through feed-forward excitatory pathways. Optogenetic activation of Tacr1 neurons elicited vasodilation, whereas inhibition significantly reduced whisker-evoked hemodynamic responses. Moreover, vasodilation was preceded by capillary pericyte activity, demonstrating a mechanism for NVC.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Resting-state functional connectivity predictors of subjective visual Gestalt experience</a></h4>

              
                Subjective perceptual experience is influenced not only by bottom-up sensory information and experience-based top-down processes, but also by an individual's current brain state. Specifically, a previous study found increased prestimulus insula and intraparietal sulcus (IPS) activity before participants perceived an illusory Gestalt (global) compared to the non-illusory (local) interpretation in a bistable stimulus. This study provided only a snapshot of the prestimulus brain state that favors an illusory interpretation. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that the neural machinery that biases perception towards the illusory interpretation immediately before the stimulus onset, is also predictive of an individual's general tendency to perceive it, which remains stable over time. We examined individual differences in task-free functional connectivity of insula and IPS and related it to differences in the individuals' duration of the two interpretations. We found stronger connectivity of the IPS with areas of the default mode and visual networks to predict shorter local perceptual phases, i.e., a faster switch to an illusory percept, but no equivalent results for the insula. Our findings suggest a crucial role of an IPS interaction with nodes of key intrinsic networks in forming a perceptual tendency towards illusory Gestalt perception.

                Despite impressive results from neuroscience research using rodent models, there is a paucity of successful translation from preclinical findings to effective pharmacological interventions for treatment of substance use disorder (SUD) in humans. One potential reason for lack of translation from animal models is difficulty in accurately replicating the lived experience of people who use drugs. Aspects of substance use in humans that are often not modeled in animal research include but are not limited to 1) voluntary timing and frequency of substance intake, 2) social environment during substance use, and 3) access to multiple substances and multiple concentrations of each substance. Critically, existing commercial equipment that allows for social housing and voluntary polysubstance use (e.g., home cage monitoring system) is prohibitively expensive and no open-source solutions exist. With these goals in mind, here we detail development of the Socially Integrated Polysubstance (SIP) system, an open-source and lower cost solution that allows for group housed rodents to self-administer multiple substances with continuous monitoring and measurement. In our current setup, each SIP cage contains four drinking stations, and each station is equipped with a RFID sensor and sipper tube connected to a unique fluid reservoir. Using this system, we can track which animal (implanted with unique RFID transponder) visits which drinking location and the amount they drink during each visit (in 20 ul increments). Using four flavors of Kool-Aid, here we demonstrate that the SIP system is reliable and accurate with high temporal resolution for long term monitoring of substance intake and behavior tracking in a social environment. The SIP cage system is a first step towards designing an accessible and flexible rodent model of substance use that more closely resembles the experience of people who use drugs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Thalamocortical networks involved in Pusher Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Indirect quantification of functional and structural disconnection increases the knowledge derived from focal brain lesions by inferring subsequent brain network damage from the respective lesion. We applied both measures to a sample of 124 stroke patients to investigate brain disconnection in pusher syndrome - a disorder characterized by a disturbed perception of one's own upright body posture. Our results suggest a hub-like function of the posterior and lateral portions of the thalamus in the perception of ones own postural upright and identified dysfunction in a thalamo-cortical network as one likely cause of pusher syndrome. Lesion network-symptom-mapping investigating functional disconnection indicated cortical diaschisis in cerebellar, frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal areas in patients with thalamic lesions suffering from pusher syndrome, but there was no evidence for functional diaschisis in cortical stroke and no evidence for the convergence of thalamic and cortical lesions onto a common functional network. Structural disconnectivity mapping identified several thalamo-cortical disconnections. Many of the thalamic and cortical regions disconnected by lesions that lead to pusher behavior correspond to previously reported lesion sites associated with pusher syndrome. Thus, while the presence of both, isolated thalamic and cortical lesions in context with pusher behavior has been reported previously and led to the conclusion that the correct estimation of one's own postural upright might depend on a thalamo-cortical network, our analyses offer the first evidence for a direct thalamo-cortical (or cortico-thalamic) interconnection and, more importantly, shed light on the location of the respective thalamo-cortical disconnections.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Personalized Functional Brain Network Topography Predicts Individual Differences in Youth Cognition</a></h4>

              
                Individual differences in cognition during childhood are associated with important social, physical, and mental health outcomes in adolescence and adulthood. Given that cortical surface arealization during development reflects the brain's functional prioritization, quantifying variation in the topography of functional brain networks across the developing cortex may provide insight regarding individual differences in cognition. We test this idea by defining personalized functional networks (PFNs) that account for interindividual heterogeneity in functional brain network topography in 9-10 year olds from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. Across matched discovery (n=3,525) and replication (n=3,447) samples, the total cortical representation of fronto-parietal PFNs positively correlated with general cognition. Cross-validated ridge regressions trained on PFN topography predicted cognition across domains, with prediction accuracy increasing along the cortex's sensorimotor-association organizational axis. These results establish that functional network topography heterogeneity is associated with individual differences in cognition before the critical transition into adolescence.

                A major pathological hallmark of Parkinsons Disease (PD) is the manifestation of Lewy bodies comprised of alpha-synuclein (a-syn). The accumulation of a-syn enriched protein aggregates is thought to arise from dysfunction in degradation systems within the brain. Recently, missense mutations of SYNJ1 encoding the SAC1 and 5-phosphatase domains have been found in families with hereditary early-onset Parkinsonism. Previous studies showed that Synj1 haploinsufficiency (Synj1+/-) leads to PD-like behavioral and pathological changes in mice, including the accumulation of the autophagy substrate p62 and pathological a-syn proteins in the midbrain (MB) and striatum. In this study, we aim to investigate the neuronal degradation pathway using the Synj1+/- MB culture as a model. Our data suggests that autophagy flux and cumulative autophagosome formation is unaltered at baseline in Synj1+/- MB neurons. However, lysosome number is reduced with a similar decrease in lysosomal proteins, including LAMP1, LAMP2, and LAMP2A. Lysosomes are hyperacidified with enhanced enzymatic activity in Synj1+/- MB neurons. Using a combination of light and electron microscopy, we show that lysosomal changes are primarily associated with a lack of SAC1 activity. Consistently, expressing the SYNJ1 R258Q mutant in N2a cells reduces the lysosome number. Interestingly, the lysosomal defects in Synj1+/- neurons does not impact the clearance of exogenously expressed wild-type a-syn; however, the clearance of a-syn A53T was impaired in the axons of Synj1+/- MB neurons. Taken together, our results suggest axonal vulnerability to lysosomal defects in Synj1 deficient MB neurons.

	<p>Healthy ageing is commonly accompanied by cognitive decline affecting several domains such as executive control, whereas certain verbal skills remain relatively preserved. Interestingly, recent scientific research has shown that some intellectual activities may be linked to beneficial effects, delaying or even alleviating cognitive decline in the elderly. Thirty young (age: M = 23) and thirty old (age: M = 66) adults were assessed in executive control (switching) and literacy experience (print exposure). First, we tried to confirm whether healthy ageing was generally associated with deficits in switching by looking at mixing cost effects, to then investigate if individual differences in print exposure explained variation in that age-related mixing costs. Both accuracy and reaction times mixing cost indexes demonstrated larger cost in old (but not in young) adults when switching from local to global information. More importantly, this cost effect was not present in old adults with higher print exposure (reaction times). Our findings suggest literacy experience accumulated across the life-span may act as a cognitive reserve proxy to prevent executive control decline.</p>

	<p>Recent reports suggest that results from imaging retinal microvascular changes with optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) in dementia patients reflect cerebral microcirculation changes that occur during dementia. Macula microvascular impairment has been shown in dementia patients compared to controls, but very little is known about its correlation with radiological visual rating scores associated with dementia. We aimed to explore the association between retinal microvasculature and radiological visual rating in early-onset dementia (EOD) patients. Methods: Swept-source OCTA (SS-OCTA) was used to image the retinal microvasculature of all EOD patients. Automated software in the OCTA tool segmented and measured the densities in the superficial vascular plexus (SVC) and deep vascular plexus (DVC) and foveal avascular zone (FAZ) areas. Radiological visual rating scores were evaluated on all MR images. Results: Medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) scores significantly correlated with FAZ area (p = 0.031) in EOD patients after adjusting for risk factors. PWMH correlated with SVC (p = 0.032) while DWMH significantly correlated with SVC (p = 0.007), DVC (p = 0.018) and FAZ (p = 0.001) in EOD patients. Discussion: FAZ changes correlated with MTA scores in EOD patients, while retinal microvasculature correlated with white matter hyperintensity. Our report suggests that microvascular changes in the retina may reflect cortical changes in the brain of EOD patients.</p>

	<p>A possible link between chemotherapy and cognitive impairment has been identified. In the literature, this condition is usually called chemobrain and can mostly affect some memory domain but can lead also to other cognitive impairments. Olfaction, which is known to be linked with cognitive domain and the nociception system, can also be affected by chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to investigate the main cognitive and olfactory abilities and the functional and nutritional state of a cohort of chemotherapy and immunotherapy onco-geriatric patients and control geriatrics subjects. Cognitive, olfactory, geriatric and nutritional assessments were performed through the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Sniffin&amp;amp;rsquo; Sticks Screening 12, G8 test and a questionnaire on the adherence of the Mediterranean diet, respectively. Our findings show a gender effect on the MMSE. Overall results indicate more pronounced impairments both at the cognitive and frailty level regardless of the type of therapy. On the other hand, the Sniffin&amp;amp;rsquo; Sticks performances highlight a significant decrease in olfactory perception ability of subjects following immunotherapy. Significant correlations between olfactory performance and MMSE and G8 scores were also found, as well as between MMSE and G8 measures.</p>

	<p>Background: Huntington&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease is an inherited autosomal dominant trait neuro-degenerative disorder caused by changes (mutations) of a gene called huntingtin (htt) that is located on the short arm (p) of chromosome 4, CAG expansion mutation. It is characterized by unusual movements, cognitive and psychiatric disorders. Objective: This review was undertaken to apprehend biological pathways of Huntington&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (HD) pathogenesis and its management by nature-derived products. Natural products can be lucrative for the management of HD as it shows protection against HD in pre-clinical trials. Advanced research is still required to assess the therapeutic effectiveness of the known organic products and their isolated compounds in HD experimental models. Summary: Degeneration of neurons in Huntington&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease is distinguished by progressive loss of motor coordination and muscle function. This is due to the expansion of CAG trinucleotide in the first exon of the htt gene responsible for neuronal death and neuronal network degeneration in the brain. It is believed that the factors such as molecular genetics, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroglia dysfunction, protein aggregation, and altered UPS leads to HD. The defensive effect of the natural product provides therapeutic efficacy against HD. Recent reports on natural drugs have enlightened the protective role against HD via antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, and neurofunctional regulation.</p>
