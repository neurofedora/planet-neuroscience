                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Much evidence has proved that excitotoxicity induced by excessive release of glutamate contributes largely to damage caused by ischemia. In view of the key role played by NMDA receptors in mediating excitotoxicity, compounds against NMDA receptors signaling pathways have become the most promising type of anti-stroke candidate compounds. However, the limited therapeutic time window for neuroprotection is a key factor preventing NMDA receptor-related compounds from showing efficacy in all clinical trials for ischemic stroke. In this perspective, the determination of therapeutic time windows of these kinds of compounds is useful in ensuring a therapeutic effect and accelerating clinical application. This mini-review discussed the therapeutic time windows of compounds against NMDA receptors signaling pathways, described related influence factors and the status of clinical studies. The purpose of this review is to look for compounds with wide therapeutic time windows and better clinical application prospect.</p>

	<p>Ecstatic epilepsy is a rare form of focal epilepsy in which the aura (beginning of the seizures) consists of a blissful state of mental clarity/feeling of certainty. Such a state has also been described as a “religious” or mystical experience. While this form of epilepsy has long been recognized as a temporal lobe epilepsy, we have accumulated evidence converging toward the location of the symptomatogenic zone in the dorsal anterior insula during the 10 last years. The neurocognitive hypothesis for the genesis of a mental clarity is the suppression of the interoceptive prediction errors and of the unexpected surprise associated with any incoming internal or external signal, usually processed by the dorsal anterior insula. This mimics a perfect prediction of the world and induces a feeling of certainty. The ecstatic epilepsy is thus an amazing model for the role of anterior insula in uncertainty and surprise.</p>

	<p>Background: Stroke is the leading cause of cortical deafness (CD), the most severe form of central hearing impairment. CD remains poorly characterized and perhaps underdiagnosed. We perform a systematic review to describe the clinical and radiological features of stroke-associated CD. Methods: PubMed and the Web of Science databases were used to identify relevant publications up to 30 June 2021 using the MeSH terms: “deafness” and “stroke”, or “hearing loss” and “stroke” or “auditory agnosia” and “stroke”. Results: We found 46 cases, caused by bilateral lesions within the central auditory pathway, mostly located within or surrounding the superior temporal lobe gyri and/or the Heschl’s gyri (30/81%). In five (13.51%) patients, CD was caused by the subcortical hemispheric and in two (0.05%) in brainstem lesions. Sensorineural hearing loss was universal. Occasionally, a misdiagnosis by peripheral or psychiatric disorders occurred. A few (20%) had clinical improvement, with a regained oral conversation or evolution to pure word deafness (36.6%). A persistent inability of oral communication occurred in 43.3%. A full recovery of conversation was restricted to patients with subcortical lesions. Conclusions: Stroke-associated CD is rare, severe and results from combinations of cortical and subcortical lesions within the central auditory pathway. The recovery of functional hearing occurs, essentially, when caused by subcortical lesions.</p>

	<p>Brain Sciences <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/11/11/1382">doi: 10.3390/brainsci11111382</a></p>

	<p>I have reviewed studies on neural responses to pictured actions in the action observation network (AON) and the cognitive functions of these responses. Based on this review, I have analyzed the specific representational characteristics of action photographs. There has been consensus that AON responses provide viewers with knowledge of observed or pictured actions, but there has been controversy about the properties of this knowledge. Is this knowledge causally provided by AON activities or is it dependent on conceptual processing? What elements of actions does it refer to, and how generalized or specific is it? The answers to these questions have come from studies that used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to stimulate motor or somatosensory cortices. In conjunction with electromyography (EMG), TMS allows researchers to examine changes of the excitability in the corticospinal tract and muscles of people viewing pictured actions. The timing of these changes and muscle specificity enable inferences to be drawn about the cognitive products of processing pictured actions in the AON. Based on a review of studies using TMS and other neuroscience methods, I have proposed a novel hypothetical account that describes the characteristics of action photographs that make them effective cues to social perception. This account includes predictions that can be tested experimentally.</p>

                Neutrophils sense and migrate through an enormous range of chemoattractant gradients through adaptation.

                <p>Detection of an unexpected, novel, or salient stimulus typically leads to an orienting response by which animals move the head, in concert with the sensors (e.g., eyes, pinna, whiskers), to evaluate the stimulus. The basal ganglia are known to control orienting movements through tonically active GABAergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) that project to the superior colliculus. Using optogenetics, we explored the ability of GABAergic SNr neurons on one side of the brain to generate orienting movements. In a strain of mice that express channelrhodopsin (ChR2) in both SNr GABAergic neurons and afferent fibers, we found that continuous blue light produced a robust sustained excitation of SNr neurons which generated ipsiversive orienting. Conversely, in the same animal, trains of blue light excited afferent fibers more effectively than continuous blue light, producing a robust sustained inhibition of SNr neurons which generated contraversive orienting. When ChR2 expression was restricted to either GABAergic SNr neurons or GABAergic afferent fibers from the striatum, blue light patterns in SNr produced only ipsiversive or contraversive orienting movements, respectively. Interestingly, whisker positioning and the reaction to an air-puff on the whiskers were incongruent between SNr-evoked ipsiversive and contraversive head movements, indicating that orienting driven by exciting or inhibiting SNr neurons have different behavioral significance. In conclusion, unilateral SNr neuron excitation and inhibition produce orienting movements in opposite directions and, apparently, with distinct behavioral significance.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Atypical sensory processing is currently included within the diagnostic criteria of autism. The cerebellum is known to integrate sensory inputs of different modalities through its connectivity to the cerebral cortex. Interestingly, cerebellar malformations are among the most replicated features found in postmortem brain of individuals with autism. We studied sensory processing in the cerebellum in a mouse model of autism, knock-out (KO) for the <I>Cntnap2</I> gene. <I>Cntnap2</I> is widely expressed in Purkinje cells (PCs) and has been recently reported to regulate their morphology. Further, individuals with <I>CNTNAP2</I> mutations display cerebellar malformations and CNTNAP2 antibodies are associated with a mild form of cerebellar ataxia. Previous studies in the <I>Cntnap2</I> mouse model show an altered cerebellar sensory learning. However, a physiological analysis of cerebellar function has not been performed yet. We studied sensory evoked potentials in cerebellar Crus I/II region on electrical stimulation of the whisker pad in alert mice and found striking differences between wild-type and <I>Cntnap2</I> KO mice. In addition, single-cell recordings identified alterations in both sensory-evoked and spontaneous firing patterns of PCs. These changes were accompanied by altered intrinsic properties and morphologic features of these neurons. Together, these results indicate that the <I>Cntnap2</I> mouse model could provide novel insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms of autism core sensory deficits.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence study of intermittent hormonal therapy of Prostate Cancer patients in Spain [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Although intermittent androgen deprivation therapy was introduced many years ago to improve patients’ quality of life with the same carcinologic efficiency as continuous hormonal therapy, recent data suggest that those patients could be overtreated. This study aims to estimate the prevalence of prostate cancer patients receiving intermittent androgen deprivation therapy in Spain. Methods: A retrospective, longitudinal study was conducted using electronic drug dispensation data from four Spanish autonomous communities, which encompass 17.23 million inhabitants (36.22% of the total population in Spain). We estimated intermittent androgen therapy use (%IAD) and the prevalence of patients under intermittent androgen therapy (PIAD) overall and stratified by region. Other outcome variables included the pharmaceutical forms dispensed and the total direct annual expenditure on androgen deprivation therapy‐associated medications. Results: A total of 863,005 dispensations corresponding to a total of 65,752 men were identified, treated with either luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogues (353,162) administered alone or in combination with anti‐androgens (509,843). Overall, the mean (±SD) age of the patients was 76.9 (±10.4) years. Results revealed that the mean annual PIAD along the study was 6.6% in the total population studied, and the overall %IAD during the five‐year study period was 5.6%. The mean cost of hormonal therapy per year was 25 million euros for LHRH analogues and 6.3 million euros for anti-androgens. Conclusions:  An important proportion of prostate cancer patients in Spain could benefit from intermittent androgen therapy during the study period while avoiding overtreatment harms associated with continuous hormonal therapy.

                <p>by Arjun Chandrasekhar, James A. R. Marshall, Cortnea Austin, Saket Navlakha, Deborah M. Gordon</p>

Creating a routing backbone is a fundamental problem in both biology and engineering. The routing backbone of the trail networks of arboreal turtle ants (<i>Cephalotes goniodontus</i>) connects many nests and food sources using trail pheromone deposited by ants as they walk. Unlike species that forage on the ground, the trail networks of arboreal ants are constrained by the vegetation. We examined what objectives the trail networks meet by comparing the observed ant trail networks with networks of random, hypothetical trail networks in the same surrounding vegetation and with trails optimized for four objectives: minimizing path length, minimizing average edge length, minimizing number of nodes, and minimizing opportunities to get lost. The ants’ trails minimized path length by minimizing the number of nodes traversed rather than choosing short edges. In addition, the ants’ trails reduced the opportunity for ants to get lost at each node, favoring nodes with 3D configurations most likely to be reinforced by pheromone. Thus, rather than finding the shortest edges, turtle ant trail networks take advantage of natural variation in the environment to favor coherence, keeping the ants together on the trails.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Estimation of regional polygenicity from GWAS provides insights into the genetic architecture of complex traits</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ruth Johnson, Kathryn S. Burch, Kangcheng Hou, Mario Paciuc, Bogdan Pasaniuc, Sriram Sankararaman</p>

The number of variants that have a non-zero effect on a trait (<i>i.e</i>. polygenicity) is a fundamental parameter in the study of the genetic architecture of a complex trait. Although many previous studies have investigated polygenicity at a genome-wide scale, a detailed understanding of how polygenicity varies across genomic regions is currently lacking. In this work, we propose an accurate and scalable statistical framework to estimate regional polygenicity for a complex trait. We show that our approach yields approximately unbiased estimates of regional polygenicity in simulations across a wide-range of various genetic architectures. We then partition the polygenicity of anthropometric and blood pressure traits across 6-Mb genomic regions (<i>N</i> = 290K, UK Biobank) and observe that all analyzed traits are highly polygenic: over one-third of regions harbor at least one causal variant for each of the traits analyzed. Additionally, we observe wide variation in regional polygenicity: on average across all traits, 48.9% of regions contain at least 5 causal SNPs, 5.44% of regions contain at least 50 causal SNPs. Finally, we find that heritability is proportional to polygenicity at the regional level, which is consistent with the hypothesis that heritability enrichments are largely driven by the variation in the number of causal SNPs.

The ever increasing applications of bioinformatics in providing effective interpretation of large and complex biological data require expertise in the use of sophisticated computational tools and advanced statistical tests, skills that are mostly lacking in the Sudanese research community. This can be attributed to paucity in the development and promotion of bioinformatics, lack of senior bioinformaticians, and the general status quo of inadequate research funding in Sudan. In this paper, we describe the challenges that have encountered the development of bioinformatics as a discipline in Sudan. Additionally, we highlight on specific actions that may help develop and promote its education and training. The paper takes the National University Biomedical Research Institute (NUBRI) as an example of an institute that has tackled many of these challenges and strives to drive powerful efforts in the development of bioinformatics in the country.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Comprehensive discovery of CRISPR-targeted terminally redundant sequences in the human gut metagenome: Viruses, plasmids, and more</a></h4>

Viruses are the most numerous biological entity, existing in all environments and infecting all cellular organisms. Compared with cellular life, the evolution and origin of viruses are poorly understood; viruses are enormously diverse, and most lack sequence similarity to cellular genes. To uncover viral sequences without relying on either reference viral sequences from databases or marker genes that characterize specific viral taxa, we developed an analysis pipeline for virus inference based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR). CRISPR is a prokaryotic nucleic acid restriction system that stores the memory of previous exposure. Our protocol can infer CRISPR-targeted sequences, including viruses, plasmids, and previously uncharacterized elements, and predict their hosts using unassembled short-read metagenomic sequencing data. By analyzing human gut metagenomic data, we extracted 11,391 terminally redundant CRISPR-targeted sequences, which are likely complete circular genomes. The sequences included 2,154 tailed-phage genomes, together with 257 complete crAssphage genomes, 11 genomes larger than 200 kilobases, 766 genomes of <i>Microviridae</i> species, 56 genomes of <i>Inoviridae</i> species, and 95 previously uncharacterized circular small genomes that have no reliably predicted protein-coding gene. We predicted the host(s) of approximately 70% of the discovered genomes at the taxonomic level of phylum by linking protospacers to taxonomically assigned CRISPR direct repeats. These results demonstrate that our protocol is efficient for <i>de novo</i> inference of CRISPR-targeted sequences and their host prediction.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Pinging the brain with visual impulses reveals electrically active, not activity-silent, working memories</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Joao Barbosa, Diego Lozano-Soldevilla, Albert Compte</p>

Persistently active neurons during mnemonic periods have been regarded as the mechanism underlying working memory maintenance. Alternatively, neuronal networks could instead store memories in fast synaptic changes, thus avoiding the biological cost of maintaining an active code through persistent neuronal firing. Such “activity-silent” codes have been proposed for specific conditions in which memories are maintained in a nonprioritized state, as for unattended but still relevant short-term memories. A hallmark of this “activity-silent” code is that these memories can be reactivated from silent, synaptic traces. Evidence for “activity-silent” working memory storage has come from human electroencephalography (EEG), in particular from the emergence of decodability (EEG reactivations) induced by visual impulses (termed pinging) during otherwise “silent” periods. Here, we reanalyze EEG data from such pinging studies. We find that the originally reported absence of memory decoding reflects weak statistical power, as decoding is possible based on more powered analyses or reanalysis using alpha power instead of raw voltage. This reveals that visual pinging EEG “reactivations” occur in the presence of an electrically active, not silent, code for unattended memories in these data. This crucial change in the evidence provided by this dataset prompts a reinterpretation of the mechanisms of EEG reactivations. We provide 2 possible explanations backed by computational models, and we discuss the relationship with TMS-induced EEG reactivations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The Plasmodium NOT1-G paralogue is an essential regulator of sexual stage maturation and parasite transmission</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kevin J. Hart, B. Joanne Power, Kelly T. Rios, Aswathy Sebastian, Scott E. Lindner</p>

Productive transmission of malaria parasites hinges upon the execution of key transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory events. While much is now known about how specific transcription factors activate or repress sexual commitment programs, far less is known about the production of a preferred mRNA homeostasis following commitment and through the host-to-vector transmission event. Here, we show that in <i>Plasmodium</i> parasites, the NOT1 scaffold protein of the CAF1/CCR4/Not complex is duplicated, and one paralogue is dedicated for essential transmission functions. Moreover, this NOT1-G paralogue is central to the sex-specific functions previously associated with its interacting partners, as deletion of <i>not1-g</i> in <i>Plasmodium yoelii</i> leads to a comparable or complete arrest phenotype for both male and female parasites. We show that, consistent with its role in other eukaryotes, PyNOT1-G localizes to cytosolic puncta throughout much of the <i>Plasmodium</i> life cycle. PyNOT1-G is essential to both the complete maturation of male gametes and to the continued development of the fertilized zygote originating from female parasites. Comparative transcriptomics of wild-type and <i>pynot1-g</i><sup>−</sup> parasites shows that loss of PyNOT1-G leads to transcript dysregulation preceding and during gametocytogenesis and shows that PyNOT1-G acts to preserve mRNAs that are critical to sexual and early mosquito stage development. Finally, we demonstrate that the tristetraprolin (TTP)-binding domain, which acts as the typical organization platform for RNA decay (TTP) and RNA preservation (ELAV/HuR) factors is dispensable for PyNOT1-G’s essential blood stage functions but impacts host-to-vector transmission. Together, we conclude that a NOT1-G paralogue in <i>Plasmodium</i> fulfills the complex transmission requirements of both male and female parasites.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">The structure of hippocampal circuitry relates to rapid category learning in humans</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Prior work suggests that complementary white matter pathways within the hippocampus (HPC) differentially support the learning of specific versus general information. In particular, while the trisynaptic pathway (TSP) rapidly forms memories for specific experiences, the monosynaptic pathway (MSP) slowly learns generalities. However, despite the theorized significance of such circuitry, characterizing how information flows within the HPC to support learning in humans remains a challenge. We leveraged diffusion-weighted imaging as a proxy for individual differences in white matter structure linking key regions along with TSP (HPC subfields CA<sub>3</sub> and CA<sub>1</sub>) and MSP (entorhinal cortex and CA<sub>1</sub>) and related these differences in hippocampal structure to category learning ability. We hypothesized that learning to categorize the “exception” items that deviated from category rules would benefit from TSP-supported mnemonic specificity. Participant-level estimates of TSP- and MSP-related integrity were constructed from HPC subfield connectomes of white matter streamline density. Consistent with theories of TSP-supported learning mechanisms, we found a specific association between the integrity of CA<sub>3</sub>–CA<sub>1</sub> white matter connections and exception learning. These results highlight the significant role of HPC circuitry in complex human learning.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">G protein‐coupled estrogen receptor‐1 enhances excitatory synaptic responses in the entorhinal cortex</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Activation of estrogen receptors is thought to modulate cognitive function in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and striatum by affecting both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission. The entorhinal cortex is a major source of cortical sensory and associational input to the hippocampus, but it is unclear whether either estrogens or progestogens may modulate cognitive function through effects on synaptic transmission in the entorhinal cortex. This study assessed the effects of the brief application of either 17-β estradiol (E2) or progesterone on excitatory glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the female rat entorhinal cortex in vitro. Rats were ovariectomized on postnatal day (PD) 63 and also received subdermal E2 implants to maintain constant low levels of circulating E2 on par with estrus. Electrophysiological recordings from brain slices were obtained between PD70 and PD86, and field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) reflecting the activation of the superficial layers of the entorhinal cortex were evoked by the stimulation of layer I afferents. The application of E2 (10 nM) for 20 min resulted in a small increase in the amplitude of fEPSPs that reversed during the 30-min washout period. The application of the ERα agonist propylpyrazoletriol (PPT) (100 nM) or the β agonist DPN (1 μM) did not significantly affect synaptic responses. However, the application of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor-1 (GPER1) agonist G1 (100 nM) induced a reversible increase in fEPSP amplitude similar to that induced by E2. Furthermore, the potentiation of responses induced by G1 was blocked by the GPER1 antagonist G15 (1 μM). Application of progesterone (100 nM) or its metabolite allopregnanolone (1 μM) did not significantly affect synaptic responses. The potentiation of synaptic transmission in the entorhinal cortex induced by the activation of GPER1 receptors may contribute to the modulation of cognitive function in female rats.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Hippocampal subfield volumes and memory discrimination in the developing brain</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The ability to keep distinct memories of similar events is underpinned by a type of neural computation called pattern separation (PS). Children typically report coarse-grained memories narratives lacking specificity and detail. This lack of memory specificity is illustrative of an immature or impaired PS. Despite its importance for the ontogeny of memory, data regarding the maturation of PS during childhood is still scarce. PS is known to rely on the hippocampus, particularly on hippocampal subfields DG and CA3. In this study, we used a memory discrimination task, a behavioral proxy for PS, and manually segmented hippocampal subfields volumes in the hippocampal body in a cohort of 26 children aged from 5 to 12 years. We examined the association between subfields volumes and memory discrimination performance. The main results were: (1) we showed age-related differences of memory discrimination suggesting a continuous increase of memory performance during early to late childhood. (2) We evidenced distinct associations between age and the volumes of hippocampal subfield, suggesting distinct developmental trajectories. (3) We showed a relationship between memory discrimination performance and the volumes of CA3 and subiculum. Our results further confirm the role of CA3 in memory discrimination, and suggest to scrutinize more closely the role of the subiculum. Overall, we showed that hippocampal subfields contribute distinctively to PS during development.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Direct synaptic excitation between hilar mossy cells revealed with a targeted voltage sensor</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The dentate gyrus not only gates the flow of information into the hippocampus, it also integrates and processes this information. Mossy cells (MCs) are a major type of excitatory neuron strategically located in the hilus of the dentate gyrus where they can contribute to this processing through networks of synapses with inhibitory neurons and dentate granule cells. Some prior work has suggested that MCs can form excitatory synapses with other MCs, but the role of these synapses in the network activity of the dentate gyrus has received little attention. Here, we investigated synaptic inputs to MCs in mouse hippocampal slices using a genetically encoded hybrid voltage sensor (hVOS) targeted to MCs by Cre-lox technology. This enabled optical recording of voltage changes from multiple MCs simultaneously. Stimulating granule cells and CA3 pyramidal cells activated well-established inputs to MCs and elicited synaptic responses as expected. However, the weak blockade of MC responses to granule cell layer stimulation by DCG-IV raised the possibility of another source of excitation. To evaluate synapses between MCs as this source, single MCs were stimulated focally. Stimulation of one MC above its action potential threshold evoked depolarizing responses in neighboring MCs that depended on glutamate receptors. Short latency responses of MCs to other MCs did not depend on release from granule cell axons. However, granule cells did contribute to the longer latency responses of MCs to stimulation of other MCs. Thus, MCs transmit their activity to other MCs both through direct synaptic coupling and through polysynaptic coupling with dentate granule cells. MC–MC synapses can redistribute information entering the dentate gyrus and thus shape and modulate the electrical activity underlying hippocampal functions such as navigation and memory, as well as excessive excitation during seizures.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Aberrant slow waves in the hippocampus during activation in mice with low cholinergic tone</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The effects of acetylcholine on cortical activation were studied in wild-type (WT) mice, compared to knockout (KO) mice depleted of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) gene in the basal forebrain, and knockdown (KD) mice with heterogeneous depletion of VAChT gene in the brain. Cortical activation was assessed by comparing power spectra of local field potentials (LFPs) during activated states of rapid-eye-movement sleep (REM) or walk (WLK), with those during non-activated states of slow-wave sleep (SWS) or awake-immobility (IMM). Activation-induced suppression of delta (1–4 Hz) and beta (13–30 Hz) power in the hippocampus, and delta power in frontal cortex, were reduced in KO and KD mice compared to WT mice. Mean theta frequency was higher in KD than KO mice during WLK and REM, but not different between WT and KO mice. Peak theta (4–12 Hz) and integrated gamma (30–150 Hz) power were not significantly different among mouse groups. However, theta-peak-frequency selected gamma2 (62–100 Hz) power was lower in KO than WT or KD mice during WLK, and theta-peak-frequency selected theta power during REM decreased faster with high theta frequency in KO than WT/ KD mice. Theta power increase during REM compared to WLK was lower in KO and KD mice compared to WT mice. Theta–gamma cross-frequency coherence, a measure of synchronization of gamma with theta phase, was not different among mouse groups. However, during REM, SWS, and IMM, delta-gamma coherence was significantly higher and proximal–distal delta coherence in CA1 was lower in KO than WT/KD mice. We conclude that a deficiency in basal forebrain acetylcholine release not only enhances slow waves and suppresses theta-associated gamma waves during activation, but also increases delta-gamma cross-frequency coherence during nonactivated states, with a possible effect of disrupting cognitive processing during any brain state.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">COVID-19 forecast for 13 Caribbean countries using ARIMA modeling for confirmed, death, and recovered cases [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The rapid spread of the Covid-19 virus in the Caribbean region has led to increased surveillance with an increasing trend of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 13 Caribbean countries. Our study aims to analyze the impact of Covid-19 (SARS nCoV-2) in 13 Caribbean countries in terms of the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered cases. Methods: The study uses the ARIMA model based on the time series pattern according to data retrieved from John Hopkins University. The data were analyzed using Stata 14 SE software for the period January 22, 2020, and August 16, 2021, and forecasted till December 31, 2021. All chosen models were compared with other models in terms of various factors like AIC/BIC, log-likelihood, p-value significance, coefficient < 1, and 5% significance. The ACF and PACF graphs were plotted to reduce bias and select the best-fitting model. Results: The results show the predicted trend in terms of confirmed, death, and recovered cases of COVID-19 for 13 Caribbean countries. The projected ARIMA model forecast for the period December 16, 2021, to December 31, 2021, shows 2470272 (95% CI 2438965 - 2501579) confirmed cases, 27220 (95% CI 26886 - 27555) deaths, and 818105 (95% CI 818085 - 818125) recovered cases related to Covid-19. The final ARIMA model chosen for confirmed COVID-19 cases, several deaths, and recovered cases are ARIMA (9,2,4), ARIMA (1,2,1), and ARIMA (1,2,1), respectively. Conclusions As per the results of the forecasted COVID-19 models, there is a steady rise in confirmed, death, and recovered cases during the period June 1, 2020, until November 30, 2020, and April 1, 2021, until June 15, 2021. It shows an increasing trend for confirmed and recovered COVID-19 cases and a slowing of the number of deaths.

                In a recent study, Tasdemir-Yilmaz and colleagues used single-cell RNA sequencing to reveal how diversity among peripheral glia changes with development and also identified unifying genetic profiles that are shared between mature glia. These data highlight new tools and pathways in which to understand peripheral glial development and function.

                Zhao et al. demonstrate that rapid plasticity in CA1 pyramidal cells creates cellular responses carrying information about position and choice-related factors during a cued, two-choice virtual navigation task. Prior learning is necessary to produce the upstream code for trial type, and subsequent plasticity enables flexible readout of the code.

                How does the human brain flexibly support a remarkably diverse repertoire of hand movements? Natraj et al. show that mesoscale activity, for movements ranging from grasps to finger individuation, lie within a common multi-area manifold spanning the “grasp network.” However, latent dynamics within this manifold were movement specific and compartmentalized into distinct behaviorally relevant submanifolds.

                It is widely believed that the brain represents prospective “cognitive maps” encoding statistical relationships in the world. Here, Namboodiri and Stuber discuss that cognitive maps can also be retrospective, thereby explaining numerous behavioral and neural findings in a unified framework.

                Pullen et al. characterize the functionality of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in maternal blood and breastmilk after SARS-CoV-2 infection. While infection elicits polyfunctional IgG in blood, breastmilk mostly contains neutralizing and neutrophil-activating IgA, IgM and IgG, suggesting a selection of specific, non-inflammatory antibody subsets in the breastmilk.

                Perception is causally linked to a calcium-dependent spiking mechanism that is built into the distal dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal tract neurons - the major output cell type of the cerebral cortex. It is yet unclear which circuits activate this cellular mechanism upon sensory stimulation. Here we found that the same thalamocortical axons that relay sensory signals to layer 4 also densely target the dendritic domain by which pyramidal tract neurons initiate calcium spikes. Distal dendritic inputs, which normally appear greatly attenuated at the cell body, thereby generate bursts of action potentials in cortical output during sensory processing. Our findings indicate that thalamus gates an active dendritic mechanism to facilitate the combination of sensory signals with top-down information streams into cortical output. Thus, in addition to being the central hub for sensory signals, thalamus is also likely to ensure that the signals it relays to cortex are perceived by the animal.

                Thyroid hormones clearly play a role in the seasonal regulation of reproduction, but any role they might play in song behavior and the associated seasonal neuroplasticity in songbirds remains to be elucidated. To pursue this question, we first established seasonal patterns in the expression of thyroid hormone regulating genes in male European starlings employing in situ hybridization methods. Thyroid hormone transporter LAT1 expression in the song nucleus HVC was elevated during the photosensitive phase, pointing towards an active role of thyroid hormones during this window of possible neuroplasticity. In contrast, DIO3 expression was high in HVC during the photostimulated phase, limiting the possible effect of thyroid hormones to maintain song stability during the breeding season. Next, we studied the effect of hypothyroidism on song behavior and neuroplasticity using in vivo MRI. Hypothyroidism inhibited the photostimulation-induced increase in testosterone, confirming the role of thyroid hormones in activating the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Surprisingly, apart from the myelination of several tracts during the photostimulated phase, most neuroplasticity related to song production was unaffected by hypothyroidism. Remarkably, T3 plasma concentrations were negatively correlated to the microstructural changes in several song control nuclei. Potentially, a global reduction of circulating thyroid hormones during the photosensitive period is necessary to lift the brake imposed by the photorefractory period, whereas local fine-tuning of thyroid hormone concentrations through LAT1 could activate underlying neuroplasticity mechanisms. Given the complexity of thyroid hormone effects, this study is a steppingstone to disentangle the influence of thyroid hormones on seasonal neuroplasticity.

                Pattern recognition is a major scientific topic. Strikingly, while machine learning algorithms are constantly refined, the human brain emerges as an ancestral biological example of such complex procedure. However, how it transforms sequences of single objects into meaningful temporal patterns remains elusive. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we discovered and mathematically modelled an inedited dual simultaneous processing responsible for pattern recognition in the brain. Indeed, while the objects of the temporal pattern were independently elaborated by a local, rapid brain processing, their combination into a meaningful superordinate pattern depended on a concurrent global, slower processing involving a widespread network of sequentially active brain areas. Expanding the established knowledge of neural information flow from low- to high-order brain areas, we revealed a novel brain mechanism based on simultaneous activity in different frequency bands within the same brain regions, highlighting its crucial role underlying complex cognitive functions.

                The genesis of broad neuronal classes from multipotential neural progenitor cells has been extensively studied, but less is known about the diversification of a single neuronal class into multiple types. We used single-cell RNA-seq to study how newly-born (postmitotic) mouse retinal ganglion cell (RGC) precursors diversify into ~45 discrete types. Computational analysis provides evidence that RGC type identity is not specified at mitotic exit, but acquired by gradual, asynchronous fate restriction of postmitotic multipotential precursors. Some types are not identifiable until a week after they are generated. Immature RGCs may be specified to project ipsilaterally or contralaterally to the rest of the brain before their type identity has been determined. Optimal transport inference identifies groups of RGC precursors with largely non-overlapping fates, distinguished by selectively expressed transcription factors that could act as fate determinants. Our study provides a framework for investigating the molecular diversification of discrete types within a neuronal class.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">BRCA1 and ELK-1 regulate Neural Progenitor Cell Fate in the Optic Tectum in response toVisual Experience in Xenopus laevis tadpoles</a></h4>

              
                In developing Xenopus tadpoles, the optic tectum begins to receive patterned visual input while visuomotor circuits are still undergoing neurogenesis and circuit assembly. This visual input regulates neural progenitor cell fate decisions such that maintaining tadpoles in the dark increases proliferation, expanding the progenitor pool, while visual stimulation promotes neuronal differentiation. To identify regulators of activity-dependent neural progenitor cell fate, we used RNA-Seq to profile the transcriptomes of proliferating neural progenitor cells and newly-differentiated immature neurons. Out of 1,130 differentially expressed (DE) transcripts, we identified six DE transcription factors which are predicted to regulate the majority of the other DE transcripts. Here we focused on Breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) and the ETS-family transcription factor, ELK-1. BRCA1 is known for its role in cancers, but relatively little is known about its potential role in regulating neural progenitor cell fate. ELK-1 is a multifunctional transcription factor which regulates immediate early gene expression. We investigated the effect of BRCA1 and ELK-1 on activity-regulated neurogenesis in the tadpole visual system using in vivo timelapse imaging to monitor the fate of turbo-GFP-expressing SOX2+ neural progenitor cells in the optic tectum. Our longitudinal in vivo imaging analysis shows that knockdown of either BRCA1 or ELK-1 altered the fates of neural progenitor cells, and furthermore that the effects of visual experience on neurogenesis depend on BRCA1 expression, while the effects of visual experience on neuronal differentiation depend on ELK-1 expression. These studies provide insight into the potential mechanisms by which neural activity affects neural progenitor cell fate.

                Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive ataxia and degeneration of specific neuronal populations, including Purkinje cells (PCs) in the cerebellum. Previous studies have demonstrated a critical role for various evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways in cerebellar patterning, such as the Wnt-{beta}-catenin pathway; however, the roles of these pathways in adult cerebellar function and cerebellar neurodegeneration are largely unknown. In this study, we found that Wnt-{beta}-catenin activity was progressively enhanced in multiple cell types in the adult SCA1 mouse cerebellum, and that activation of this signaling occurs in an ataxin-1 polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion-dependent manner. Genetic manipulation of the Wnt-{beta}-catenin signaling pathway in specific cerebellar cell populations revealed that activation of Wnt-{beta}-catenin signaling in PCs alone was not sufficient to induce SCA1-like phenotypes, while its activation in astrocytes including Bergmann glia (BG) resulted in gliosis and disrupted BG localization, which was replicated in SCA1 mouse models. Our studies identify a novel mechanism in which polyQ-expanded ataxin-1 positively regulates Wnt-{beta}-catenin signaling, and demonstrate that different cell types have distinct responses to the enhanced Wnt-{beta}-catenin signaling in the SCA1 cerebellum, underscoring an important role of BG in SCA1 pathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Plasticity of Neural Connections Underlying Oxytocin-mediated Parental Behaviors of Male Mice</a></h4>

              
                The adult brain can flexibly adapt behaviors to specific life-stage demands. For example, while sexually naive male mice are aggressive to the conspecific young, they start to provide caregiving to infants around the time when their own young are expected. How such behavioral plasticity is implemented at the level of neural connections remains poorly understood. Using viral-genetic approaches, here we establish hypothalamic oxytocin neurons as key regulators of parental caregiving behaviors of male mice. We then used rabies virus-mediated unbiased screen to identify excitatory neural connections originating from the lateral hypothalamus to the oxytocin neurons to be drastically strengthened when male mice become fathers. These connections are functionally relevant, as their activation suppresses pup-directed aggression in virgin males. These results demonstrate the life-stage associated, long-distance, and cell-type-specific plasticity of neural connections in the hypothalamus, the brain region classically assumed to be hard-wired.

                I demonstrate theoretically that calcium waves in astrocytes can compute anything neurons can. A foundational result in neural computation was proving the firing rate model of neurons defines a universal function approximator. In this work I show a similar proof extends to a model of calcium waves in astrocytes, which I confirm in a series of computer simulations. I argue the major limit in astrocyte computation is not their ability to find approximate solutions, but their computational complexity. I suggest some initial experiments that might be used to confirm these predictions.

                Here we introduce a fiber amplifier and a diamond Raman laser that output high powers (6.5 W, 1.3 W) at valuable wavelengths (1060 nm, 1250 nm) for multiphoton excitation of red-shifted fluorophores. These custom excitation sources are both simple to construct and cost-efficient in comparison to similar custom and commercial alternatives. Furthermore, they operate at a repetition rate (80 MHz) that allows fast image acquisition using resonant scanners. We demonstrate our system's compatibility with fast resonant scanning, the ability to acquire neuronal images, and the capability to image vasculature at deep locations (>1 mm) within the mouse cerebral cortex.

                Repeat expansions in C9orf72 cause Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) eliciting toxic effects through generation of RNA foci, dipeptide repeat proteins and/or loss of C9orf72 protein. Defects in nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) have been implicated as a pathogenic mechanism underlying repeat expansion toxicity. Here, we show that loss of C9orf72 causes neuronal specific phenotypes, disrupting the Ran-GTPase gradient both in vitro and in vivo. We describe compositionally different types of cytoplasmic Importin {beta}-1 granules that exhibit neuronal subtype-specific properties in vivo. We show that the abundance of Importin {beta}-1 granules is increased in the context of C9orf72 deficiency, disrupting interactions with nuclear pore complex proteins. These granules appear to bud from the nuclear envelope and are co-immunoreactive for G3BP1 and K63-ubiquitin. These findings link loss of C9orf72 protein to gain-of-function mechanisms and defects in NCT.

                The mechanisms underlying memory loss associated with Alzheimers disease and related dementias (ADRD) remain unclear, and no effective treatments exist. Fundamental studies have shown that a set of transcriptional regulatory proteins of the nuclear receptor 4a (Nr4a) family serve as molecular switches for long-term memory. Here, we show that Nr4a proteins regulate the transcription of a group of genes encoding chaperones that localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which function to traffic plasticity-related proteins to the cell surface during long lasting forms of synaptic plasticity and memory. Nr4a transcription factors and ER chaperones are linked to ADRD in human samples as well as mouse models, and overexpressing Nr4a1 or the ER chaperone Hspa5 ameliorates the long-term memory deficits in a tau-based mouse model of ADRD, pointing towards novel therapeutic approaches for treating memory loss. Thus, our findings establish protein folding in the ER as a novel molecular concept underlying long-term memory, providing new insights into the mechanistic basis of cognitive deficits in dementia.

                Recent evidence has suggested that the carotid bodies might act as immunological sensors, detecting pro-inflammatory mediators and signalling to the central nervous system, which, in turn, orchestrates autonomic responses. Here, we demonstrated that the TNF- receptor type I is expressed in the carotid bodies of rats. The systemic administration of TNF- increased carotid body afferent discharge and activated glutamatergic neurons in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) that project to the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), where the majority of pre-sympathetic neurons reside. The activation of these neurons was accompanied by generalized activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Carotid body ablation blunted the TNF--induced activation of RVLM-projecting NTS neurons and the increase in splanchnic sympathetic nerve activity. Finally, plasma and spleen levels of cytokines after TNF- administration were higher in rats subjected to either carotid body ablation or splanchnic sympathetic denervation. Collectively, our findings indicate that the carotid body detects circulating TNF- to activate a counteracting sympathetic anti-inflammatory mechanism.

                The human brain readily learns tasks in sequence without forgetting previous ones. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), on the other hand, need to be modified to achieve similar performance. While effective, many algorithms that accomplish this are based on weight importance methods that do not correspond to biological mechanisms. Here we introduce a simple, biologically plausible method for enabling effective continual learning in ANNs. We show that it is possible to learn a weight-dependent plasticity function that prevents catastrophic forgetting over multiple tasks. We highlight the effectiveness of our method by evaluating it on a set of MNIST classification tasks. We further find that the use of our method promotes synaptic multi-modality, similar to that seen in biology.

                Healthy neuronal networks rely on homeostatic plasticity to maintain stable firing rates despite changing synaptic drive. These mechanisms, however, can themselves be destabilizing if activated inappropriately or excessively. For example, prolonged activity deprivation can lead to rebound hyperactivity and seizures. While many forms of homeostasis have been described, whether and how the magnitude of homeostatic plasticity is constrained remains unknown. Here we uncover negative regulation of cortical network homeostasis by PAR bZIP family of transcription factors. In their absence the network response to prolonged activity withdrawal is too strong and this is driven by exaggerated upregulation of recurrent excitatory synaptic transmission. These data indicate that transcriptional activation is not only required for many forms of homeostatic plasticity but is also involved in restraint of the response to activity deprivation.

                In complex nervous systems, neurons must identify their correct partners to form synaptic connections. The prevailing model to ensure correct recognition posits that cell surface proteins (CSPs) in individual neurons act as identification tags. Thus, knowing what cells express which CSPs would provide insights into neural development, synaptic connectivity, and nervous system evolution. Here, we investigated expression of dprs and DIPs, two CSP subfamilies belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), in Drosophila larval motor neurons (MNs), sensory neurons (SNs), peripheral glia and muscles using a collection of GAL4 driver lines. We found that dprs are more broadly expressed than DIPs in MNs and SNs, and each examined neuron expresses a unique combination of dprs and DIPs. Interestingly, many dprs and DIPs are not robustly expressed, but instead, are found in gradient and temporal expression patterns. Hierarchical clustering showed a similar expression pattern of dprs and DIPs in neurons from the same type and with shared synaptic partners, suggesting these CSPs may facilitate synaptic wiring. In addition, the unique expression patterns of dprs and DIPs revealed three uncharacterized MNs - MN23-Ib, MN6-Ib (A2) and MN7-Ib (A2). This study sets the stage for exploring the functions of dprs and DIPs in Drosophila MNs and SNs and provides genetic access to subsets of neurons.

                Cells are not uniformly distributed in the human cerebral cortex. Rather, they are arranged in a regional and laminar fashion that span a range of scales. Here we demonstrate an innovative imaging and analysis pipeline to construct a reliable cell census across the human cerebral cortex. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to establish a macroscopic reference coordinate system of laminar and cytoarchitectural boundaries. Cell counting is obtained with both traditional immunohistochemistry, to provide a stereological gold-standard, and with a custom-made inverted confocal light-sheet fluorescence microscope (LSFM) for 3D imaging at cellular resolution. Finally, mesoscale optical coherence tomography (OCT) enables the registration of the distorted histological cell typing obtained with LSFM to the MRI-based atlas coordinate system.

                Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) provides symptomatic relief in a growing number of neurological indications, but local synaptic dynamics in response to electrical stimulation that may relate to its mechanism of action have not been fully characterized. Objective: The objectives of this study were to (1) study local synaptic dynamics during high frequency extracellular stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN), and (2) compare STN synaptic dynamics with those of the neighboring substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). Methods: Two microelectrodes were advanced into the STN and SNr of patients undergoing DBS surgery for PD. Neuronal firing and evoked field potentials (fEPs) were recorded with one microelectrode during stimulation from an adjacent microelectrode. Results: Excitatory and inhibitory fEPs could be discerned within the STN and their amplitudes predicted bidirectional effects on neuronal firing (p = .007). There were no differences between STN and SNr inhibitory fEP dynamics at low stimulation frequencies (p > .999). However, inhibitory neuronal responses were sustained over time in STN during high frequency stimulation, but not SNr (p < .001) where depression of inhibitory input was coupled with a return of neuronal firing (p = .003). Interpretation: Persistent inhibitory input to the STN suggests a local synaptic mechanism for the suppression of subthalamic firing during high frequency stimulation. Moreover, differences in the resiliency versus vulnerability of inhibitory inputs to the STN and SNr suggest a projection source- and frequency-specificity for this mechanism. The feasibility of targeting electrophysiologically-identified neural structures may provide insight into how DBS achieves frequency-specific modulation of neuronal projections.

                Reward-associated conditioned stimuli (CS) can acquire predictive value, evoking conditioned approach behaviors that prepare animals to engage with forthcoming rewards. Such CS can also acquire conditioned reinforcing value, becoming attractive and pursued. Through their predictive and conditioned reinforcing properties, CS can promote adaptive (e.g., locating food) but also maladaptive responses (e.g., drug use). Basolateral amygdala neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens core (BLA[-&gt;]NAc core neurons) mediate the response to appetitive CS, but the extent to which this involves effects on the predictive and/or conditioned reinforcing properties of CS is unclear. Thus, we examined the effects of optogenetic stimulation of BLA[-&gt;]NAc core neurons on conditioned approach behavior and on the instrumental pursuit of a CS, the latter a measure of conditioned reinforcement. Water-restricted, adult male rats learned that a light-tone compound cue (CS) predicts water delivery. Pairing optogenetic stimulation of BLA[-&gt;]NAc core neurons with CS presentation potentiated conditioned approach behavior, and did so even under extinction conditions, when water was omitted. This suggests that BLA[-&gt;]NAc core neurons promote cue-induced expectation of rewards. Rats also received instrumental conditioning sessions during which they could lever press for CS presentations, without water delivery. Optogenetic stimulation of BLA[-&gt;]NAc core neurons either during these instrumental test sessions or during prior CS-water conditioning did not influence lever responding for the CS. This suggests that BLA[-&gt;]NAc core neurons do not influence the conditioned reinforcing effects of CS. We conclude that BLA[-&gt;]NAc core neurons promote cue-induced control over behavior by increasing cue-triggered anticipation of rewards, without influencing cue 'wanting'.

                The main challenge in the clinical assessment of Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES) is the lack of an electroencephalographic marker in the electroencephalography (EEG) readout. Although decades of EEG studies have focused on detecting cortical brain function underlying PNES, the principle of PNES remains poorly understood. To address this problem, electric potentials generated by large populations of neurons were collected during the resting state to be processed after that by Power Spectrum Density (PSD) for possible analysis of PNES signatures. Additionally, the integration of distributed information of regular and synchronized multi-scale communication within and across inter-regional brain areas has been observed using functional connectivity tools like Phase Lag Index (PLI) and graph-derived metrics. A cohort study of 20 PNES and 19 Healthy Control subjects (HC) were enrolled. The major finding is that PNES patients exhibited significant differences in alpha-power spectrum in brain regions related to cognitive operations, attention, working memory, and movement regulation. Noticeably, we observed that there exists an altered oscillatory activity and a widespread inter-regional phase desynchronization. This indicates changes in global efficiency, node betweenness, shortest path length, and small worldness in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands. Finally, our findings look into new evidence of the intrinsic organization of functional brain networks that reflects a dysfunctional level of integration of local activity across brain regions, which can provide new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of PNES.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Combination of structural and functional connectivity explains unique variation in specific domains of cognitive function.</a></h4>

              
                The relationship between structural and functional brain networks has been characterised as complex: the two networks mirror each other and show mutual influence but they also diverge in their organisation. This work explored whether a combination of structural and functional connectivity can improve models of cognitive performance, and whether this differs by cognitive domain. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to cognitive data from the Human Connectome Project. Four components were obtained, reflecting Retention and Retrieval, Processing Speed, Self-regulation, and Encoding. The PCA-Regression approach was applied to predict cognitive performance using structural, functional and joint structural-functional components. Model quality was evaluated using model evidence, model fit and generalisability. Functional connectivity components produced the most effective models of Retention and Retrieval and Encoding, whereas joint structural-functional components produced most effective models of Processing Speed, and Self-regulation. The present study demonstrates that multimodal data fusion using structural and functional connectivity can help predict cognitive performance, but that the additional explanatory value (relative to overfitting) may depend on the specific selection of cognitive domain. We discuss the implications of these results for studies of the brain basis of cognition in health and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Abstract representations emerge naturally in neural networks trained to perform multiple tasks</a></h4>

              
                Humans and other animals demonstrate a remarkable ability to generalize knowledge across distinct contexts and objects during natural behavior. We posit that this ability depends on the geometry of the neural population representations of these objects and contexts. Specifically, abstract, or disentangled, neural representations -- in which neural population activity is a linear function of the variables important for making a decision -- are known to allow for this kind of generalization. Further, recent neurophysiological studies have shown that the brain has sufficiently abstract representations of some sensory and cognitive variables to enable generalization across distinct contexts. However, it is unknown how these abstract representations emerge. Here, using feedforward neural networks, we demonstrate a simple mechanism by which these abstract representations can be produced: The learning of multiple distinct classification tasks. We demonstrate that, despite heterogeneity in the task structure, abstract representations that enable reliable generalization can be produced from a variety of different inputs -- including standard nonlinearly mixed inputs, inputs that mimic putative representations from early sensory areas, and even simple image inputs from a standard machine learning data set. Thus, we conclude that abstract representations of sensory and cognitive variables emerge from the multiple behaviors that animals exhibit in the natural world, and may be pervasive in high-level brain regions. We make several specific predictions about which variables will be represented abstractly as well as show how these representations can be detected.

                We introduce a data-driven causal discovery method (Greedy Adjacencies and Non-Gaussian Orientations; GANGO) for calculating a "causal connectome" of directed connectivity from resting-state fMRI data and characterizing hubs of directed information transfer across the human cortex. Prominent hubs of the causal connectome were situated in attentional (dorsal attention) and executive (frontoparietal and cingulo-opercular) networks. These hub networks had distinctly different connectivity profiles. Attentional networks shared incoming connections with sensory regions and outgoing connections with higher cognitive networks, while executive networks primarily connected to other higher cognitive networks and had a high degree of bidirected connectivity. Virtual lesion analyses accentuated these findings, demonstrating that attentional and executive hubs are points of critical vulnerability in the human causal connectome. These data highlight the central role of attention and executive control networks in the human cortical connectome and set the stage for future applications of data-driven causal ("effective") connectivity analysis in psychiatry.

	<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a high-cost/high-burden problem. Early intervention may prevent development of the disorder, improving child outcomes and reducing long-term consequences. However, few studies have investigated the role of early intervention in children younger than two years. This study aims to examine the effect of early intervention in 18-month-old high-risk siblings of children with ASD (HR-ASD) with clinical signs of autism. The intervention is based on the principles of Applied Behavior Analysis and focuses on the development of early precursors to social and communicative competence (joint attention and imitation behaviors). After controlling for baseline differences, two comparison HR-ASD groups were included: 15 HR-ASD toddlers receiving behavioral intervention for 3 h per week for 5 months (INT+) and 15 HR-ASD toddlers who were only clinically monitored from age 18 months (INT−). Changes in social communication, restricted/repetitive behaviors, and language were assessed using standardized measures at pre- (T0) and post-intervention (T1). From T0 to T1, the INT+ group showed significant improvements in communication, social interaction, and language compared to INT− group. There was no effect on restricted/repetitive behaviors. Our findings highlighted the importance of early detection/intervention in autism and supported a positive impact of targeted interventions to improve outcomes in at-risk children.</p>

	<p>Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is prevalent in the general population, particularly among Hispanic adults. SCD increases the risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. While non-pharmacologic interventions are recommended to mitigate cognitive decline and preserve daily function in SCD and MCI, such interventions are not readily available for Spanish-speaking Hispanic adults with SCD. This pilot study, preregistered at clinicialtrials.gov, aimed to develop a linguistically and culturally appropriate adaptation of an existing memory compensation intervention, the Memory Support System (MSS), from English to Spanish, and to gather data to assess its impact in this population. Twenty Spanish-speaking Hispanic adults with SCD and 16 support partners were recruited. Measures of treatment adherence, daily function, self-efficacy for memory, quality of life, mood, anxiety, and caregiver burden were assessed at baseline, treatment end, and 8-week follow-up. By treatment end, participants with SCD improved their general functional status, daily activities requiring organizational skills, and depression and anxiety symptoms. Partners reported improvement in anxiety by treatment end and in caregiver burden at follow-up. The MSS was successfully translated into Spanish and readily learned by participants with SCD and their partners. The MSS in Spanish may help with daily functioning and aspects of patient and family well-being.</p>

	<p>To test the scaffolding theory when applied to the teaching and learning of writing English as a foreign language, this cross-sectional study was conducted to collect physiological data. A total of 53 participants were randomly assigned into two groups, and brain activity was investigated during a guided-writing task using storytelling pictures. The writing task was further divided into four parts using graded levels of difficulty. The experimental group performed tasks in sequence from easy to difficult, whereas the comparison group performed the tasks at random. Outcomes included handwriting assessments and fMRI measurements. Writing outcome assessments were analyzed using SPSS, and scanned images were analyzed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software. The results revealed a positive learning effect associated with scaffolding instruction. The experimental group performed better during the writing tasks, and the fMRI images showed less intense and weaker reactions in the language processing region than were observed in the comparison group. The fMRI results also presented the experimental group with reduced motor and cognitive functions when writing in English. This study provides insight regarding brain activity during writing tasks in humans and may have implications for English-language instruction.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to assess the effect of the auditory feedback gait training (AFGT) using smart insole on the gait variables, dynamic balance, and activities of daily living (ADL) of stroke patients. In this case, 45 chronic stroke patients who were diagnosed with a stroke before 6 months and could walk more than 10 m were included in this study. Participants were randomly allocated to the smart insole training group (n = 23), in which the AFGT system was used, or to the general gait training group (GGTG) (n = 22). Both groups completed conventional rehabilitation, including conventional physiotherapy and gait training, lasting 60 min per session, five times per week for 4 weeks. Instead of gait training, the smart insole training group received smart insole training twice per week for 4 weeks. Participants were assessed using the GAITRite for gait variables and Timed Up and Go test (TUG), Berg Balance Scale (BBS) for dynamic balance, and Modified Barthel Index (MBI) for ADL. The spatiotemporal gait parameters, symmetry of gait, TUG, BBS, and MBI in the smart insole training group were significantly improved compared to those in the GGTG (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The AFGT system approach is a helpful method for improving gait variables, dynamic balance, and ADL in chronic stroke patients.</p>

	<p>DNA methylation clocks are used as molecular estimators of epigenetic age, but with little evidence in mothers and none in neglectful mothering. We investigated differences in epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) and the role of empathy using the PhenoAge clock. We collected saliva samples from mothers with extreme disregard for their child’s needs (50 in the neglect group, NG) and mothers with non-neglectful caregiving (87 in the control group, CG). Mothers completed an empathy scale, along with questionnaires of their own childhood maltreatment, adverse life events and psychiatric disorders. Sociodemographic variables potentially affecting EAA were also measured. The ANCOVA solution showed a significant increase in EAA in the NG compared to the CG, after adjustment for maternal age, number of pregnancies, financial assistance, adverse events, childhood maltreatment and psychiatric disorder. The group interaction effects showed a reduction in EAA for greater empathic concern and for a higher education level both as positive factors, and an increment in EAA for mothers living in a two-parent family as a risk factor, all in the NG. Our findings open the search for protective factors of EAA associated with caregiver behavior to reduce health vulnerabilities and poor social functioning, especially for mothers at risk of maladaptive caregiving.</p>

<p>Characterization of early myelin ensheathment during Xenopus mid-larval development was performed by immunostaining for myelin basic protein and by third harmonic generation microscopy. Temporally patterned visual stimuli regulated the extent of myelination.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Myelination allows for the regulation of conduction velocity, affecting the precise timing of neuronal inputs important for the development and function of brain circuits. In turn, myelination may be altered by changes in experience, neuronal activity, and vesicular release, but the links between sensory experience, corresponding neuronal activity, and resulting alterations in myelination require further investigation. We thus studied the development of myelination in the <i>Xenopus laevis</i> tadpole, a classic model for studies of visual system development and function because it is translucent and visually responsive throughout the formation of its retinotectal system. We begin with a systematic characterization of the timecourse of early myelin ensheathment in the <i>Xenopus</i> retinotectal system using immunohistochemistry of myelin basic protein (MBP) along with third harmonic generation (THG) microscopy, a label-free structural imaging technique. Based on the mid-larval developmental progression of MBP expression in <i>Xenopus</i>, we identified an appropriate developmental window in which to assess the effects of early temporally patterned visual experience on myelin ensheathment. We used calcium imaging of axon terminals in vivo to characterize the responses of retinal ganglion cells over a range of stroboscopic stimulation frequencies. Strobe frequencies that reliably elicited robust versus dampened calcium responses were then presented to animals for 7 d, and differences in the amount of early myelin ensheathment at the optic chiasm were subsequently quantified. This study provides evidence that it is not just the presence but also to the specific temporal properties of sensory stimuli that are important for myelin plasticity.</p>

<p>This study characterizes the temporal and spatial expression pattern of genetically encoded reporters following Cre-mediated recombination from three Cre drivers selective for the nuclei of the dorsal thalamus: <i>Oligodendrocyte transcription factor 3</i> (<i>Olig3)-Cre</i>, <i>histidine decarboxylase (HDC)-Cre</i>, and <i>corticotropin-releasing hormone</i> (<i>CRH)-Cre</i>. Cre-dependent expression of tdTomato reveals that <i>Olig3-Cre</i> expresses broadly within the thalamus, including thalamocortical (TC) neurons and interneurons, while <i>HDC-Cre</i> and <i>CRH-Cre</i> each have unique patterns of expression restricted to TC neurons within and across the sensory relay nuclei of the dorsal thalamus.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Subpopulations of neurons and associated neural circuits can be targeted in mice with genetic tools in a highly selective manner for visualization and manipulation. However, there are not well-defined Cre “driver” lines that target the expression of Cre recombinase to thalamocortical (TC) neurons. Here, we characterize three Cre driver lines for the nuclei of the dorsal thalamus: <i>Oligodendrocyte transcription factor 3</i> (<i>Olig3)-Cre</i>, <i>histidine decarboxylase (HDC)-Cre</i>, and <i>corticotropin-releasing hormone</i> (<i>CRH)-Cre</i>. We examined the postnatal distribution of Cre expression for each of these lines with the Cre-dependent reporter <i>CAG-tdTomato</i> (<i>Ai9)</i>. Cre-dependent expression of tdTomato reveals that <i>Olig3-Cre</i> expresses broadly within the thalamus, including TC neurons and interneurons, while <i>HDC-Cre</i> and <i>CRH-Cre</i> each have unique patterns of expression restricted to TC neurons within and across the sensory relay nuclei of the dorsal thalamus. Cre expression is present by the time of natural birth in all three lines, underscoring their utility for developmental studies. To demonstrate the utility of these Cre drivers for studying sensory TC circuitry, we targeted the expression of channelrhodopsin-2 to thalamus from the <i>CAG-COP4*H134R/EYFP (Ai32)</i> allele with either <i>HDC-Cre</i> or <i>CRH-Cre</i>. Optogenetic activation of TC afferents in primary visual cortex was sufficient to measure frequency-dependent depression. Thus, these Cre drivers provide selective Cre-dependent gene expression in thalamus suitable for both anatomical and functional studies.</p>

     alt="Running exercise protects spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex of APP/PS1 transgenic mice"/>
<p>Using the unbiased stereological methods, we found that long-term, regular and moderate running exercise could delay the loss of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the mPFC of APP/PS1 mice. This finding might provide an important structural basis for exercise-induced improvements in the spatial learning and memory abilities of individuals with AD.

</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is thought to be closely associated with emotional processes, decision making, and memory. Previous studies have identified the prefrontal cortex as one of the most vulnerable brain regions in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Running exercise has widely been recognized as a simple and effective method of physical activity that enhances brain function and slows the progression of AD. However, the effect of exercise on the mPFC of AD is unclear. To address these issues, we investigated the effects of 4 months of exercise on the numbers of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the mPFC of 12-month-old APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic AD model mice using stereological methods. The spatial learning and memory abilities of mice were tested using the Morris water maze. Four months of running exercise delayed declines in spatial learning and memory abilities. The stereological results showed significantly lower numbers of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the mPFC of APP/PS1 mice than in the wild-type control group. The numbers of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the mPFC of running APP/PS1 mice were significantly greater than those in the APP/PS1 control mice. In addition, running-induced improvements in spatial learning and memory were significantly associated with running-induced increases in spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons numbers in the mPFC. Running exercise could delay the loss of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the mPFC of APP/PS1 mice. This finding might provide an important structural basis for exercise-induced improvements in the spatial learning and memory abilities of individuals with AD.</p>

<p>We investigated the comparative neuroanatomical distribution of neuropeptide F in the female prawn, <i>Macrobrachium rosenbergii</i> (MrNPF), and its expression levels in the entire CNS during the ovarian cycle. Interestingly, we found a correlation between changes in MrNPF neuroanatomical expression in various parts of the prawn CNS and different stages of the ovarian cycle. Our findings suggest that MrNPF may be a key coordinator that mediates sensory inputs, including photoreception, chemoreception, gustatory reception with feeding, and ovarian development in this female prawn.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuropeptide F (NPF) plays critical roles in controlling the feeding and reproduction of prawns. In the present study, we investigated changes in the expression levels of <i>Macrobrachium rosenbergii</i> neuropeptide F (MrNPF), and its neuroanatomical distribution in eyestalk (ES), brain (BR), subesophageal ganglion (SEG), thoracic ganglia (TG), and abdominal ganglia (AG), during the ovarian cycle of female prawn. By qRT-PCR, the amount of <i>MrNPF</i> transcripts exhibited a gradual increase in the ES, BR, and combined SEG and TG from stages I and II, to reach a maximum level at stage III, and slightly declined at stage IV, respectively. The highest to lowest expression levels were detected in combined SEG and TG, BR, ES, and AG, respectively. MrNPF immunolabeling was observed in several neuronal clusters, associated fibers, and neuropils of these central nervous system (CNS) tissues. MrNPF-ir was more intense in neurons and neuropils of SEG and TG than those found in other parts of the CNS. The number of MrNPF-ir neurons and intensity of MrNPF-ir were higher in the ES, BR, SEG, and TG at the late stages than those at the early stages of the ovarian cycle, while those in AG exhibited insignificant change. Taken together, there is a correlation between changes in the neuroanatomical distribution of MrNPF and stages of the ovarian cycle, implying that MrNPF may be an important neuropeptide that integrates sensory stimuli, including photo-, chemo-, and gustatory receptions, to control feeding and reproduction, particularly ovarian development, of this female prawn, <i>M. rosenbergii</i>.</p>

                Background: Nowadays, we are facing a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, known globally as COVID-19, which is considered a threat to global health due to its high contagiousness and rapid spread. Methods: Analytical cross-sectional study in 302 health professionals. An online questionnaire consisting of questions about knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19 was applied. Socio-demographic, occupational and comorbidities factors were explored. Simple and multiple logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with KAP. Results: Of the total, 25.2%, 31.5% and 37.4% had high levels of knowledge, preventive practices and risk perception attitudes respectively. Being married aOR=6.75 IC(1.46-31.2) p=0.014, having a master's degree aOR=0.4, IC(0.21-0.80) p=0.009, having a working day with less than ten hours ORa=0.49 IC(0.25-0.95) p=0.036 and obesity aOR=0.38 IC (0.15-0.95) p=0.039 were associated with a low level of knowledge of COVID-19. The variables associated with preventive practices were being over the age of 50 aOR=0.52 IC(0.27-0.98) p=0.007, working in the hospitalization area aOR=1.86 IC(1.08-3.18) p= 0.018 and having comorbidities such as arterial hypertension aOR=0.28 IC(0.081-0.99) p=0.02 and obesity aOR=0.35 IC(0.14-0.83) p=0.019. In relation to negative attitudes towards COVID-19, it was found that physical contact with patients with a confirmed diagnosis aOR=1.84 IC (1.14-2.97) p=0.006 and having asthma aOR=2.13 IC(1.081-4.22) p=0.029 were associated with these attitudes. Conclusion: Our study revealed that health professionals have an insufficient level of knowledge of COVID-19. This is why we recommend implementing strategies such as health literacy programs among health care workers. Thus, they can help develop positive attitudes towards the acquisition of self-care habits at work that, in turn, improve their confidence so that health care workers can provide adequate care for their patients and protect themselves.

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Toward an Anti-Racist Approach to Biomedical and Neuroscience Research</a></h4>

              
                <p>Racism is a threat to public health. Race is a sociopolitical construct that has been used for generations to create disparities in educational access, housing conditions, exposure to environmental contaminants, and access to health care. Collectively, these disparities have a negative impact on the health of non-white Americans. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) funds biomedical research, including basic neuroscience research, aimed at understanding the mechanisms and consequences of health and disease in Americans. NIH has recently acknowledged its own structural racism, the disadvantage this perpetuates in the biomedical research enterprise, and has announced its commitment to eliminating these disparities. Here, we discuss different rates of disease in U.S. citizens from different racial backgrounds. We next describe ways in which the biomedical research enterprise (1) has contributed to health disparities and (2) can contribute to the solving this problem. Based on our own scientific expertise, we use neuroscience in general and mental health/addiction disorders more specifically as examples of a broader issue. The NIH, including its neuroscience-focused Institutes, and NIH-funded scientists, including neuroscientists, should prioritize research topics that reflect the health conditions that affect all Americans, not just white Americans.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">C-Jun N-Terminal Kinase Post-Translational Regulation of Pain-Related Acid-Sensing Ion Channels 1b and 3</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuronal proton-gated acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) participate in the detection of tissue acidosis, a phenomenon often encountered in painful pathologic diseases. Such conditions often involve in parallel the activation of various signaling pathways such as mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) that ultimately leads to phenotype modifications of sensory neurons. Here, we identify one member of the MAPKs, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), as a new post-translational positive regulator of ASICs in rodent sensory neurons. Recombinant H<sup>+</sup>-induced ASIC currents in HEK293 cells are potently inhibited within minutes by the JNK inhibitor SP600125 in a subunit-dependent manner, targeting both rodent and human ASIC1b and ASIC3 subunits (except mouse ASIC3). The regulation by JNK of recombinant ASIC1b- and ASIC3-containing channels (homomers and heteromers) is lost on mutation of a putative phosphorylation site within the intracellular N- and the C-terminal domain of the ASIC1b and ASIC3 subunit, respectively. Moreover, short-term JNK activation regulates the activity of native ASIC1b- and ASIC3-containing channels in rodent sensory neurons and is involved in the rapid potentiation of ASIC activity by the proinflammatory cytokine TNF&alpha;. Local JNK activation <I>in vivo</I> in mice induces a short-term potentiation of the acid-induced cutaneous pain in inflammatory conditions that is partially blocked by the ASIC1-specific inhibitor mambalgin-1. Collectively, our data identify pain-related channels as novel physiological JNK substrates in nociceptive neurons and propose JNK-dependent phosphorylation as a fast post-translational mechanism of regulation of sensory-neuron-expressed ASIC1b- and ASIC3-containing channels that may contribute to peripheral sensitization and pain hypersensitivity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> ASICs are a class of excitatory cation channels critical for the detection of tissue acidosis, which is a hallmark of several painful diseases. Previous work in sensory neurons has shown that ASICs containing the ASIC3 or the ASIC1b subunit are important players in different pain models. We combine here functional and pharmacological <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I> approaches to demonstrate that the MAP Kinase JNK is a potent post-translational positive regulator, probably <I>via</I> direct phosphorylation, of rodent and human ASIC1b- and ASIC3-containing channels. This JNK-dependent, fast post-translational mechanism of regulation of sensory-neuron-expressed ASICs may contribute to peripheral sensitization and pain hypersensitivity. These data also identify pain-related channels as direct downstream effectors of JNK in nociceptors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">APOE4 Affects Basal and NMDAR-Mediated Protein Synthesis in Neurons by Perturbing Calcium Homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Apolipoprotein E (APOE), one of the primary lipoproteins in the brain has three isoforms in humans, APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4. APOE4 is the most well-established risk factor increasing the predisposition for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The presence of the APOE4 allele alone is shown to cause synaptic defects in neurons and recent studies have identified multiple pathways directly influenced by APOE4. However, the mechanisms underlying APOE4-induced synaptic dysfunction remain elusive. Here, we report that the acute exposure of primary cortical neurons or synaptoneurosomes to APOE4 leads to a significant decrease in global protein synthesis. Primary cortical neurons were derived from male and female embryos of Sprague Dawley (SD) rats or C57BL/6J mice. Synaptoneurosomes were prepared from P30 male SD rats. APOE4 treatment also abrogates the NMDA-mediated translation response indicating an alteration of synaptic signaling. Importantly, we demonstrate that both APOE3 and APOE4 generate a distinct translation response which is closely linked to their respective calcium signature. Acute exposure of neurons to APOE3 causes a short burst of calcium through NMDA receptors (NMDARs) leading to an initial decrease in protein synthesis which quickly recovers. Contrarily, APOE4 leads to a sustained increase in calcium levels by activating both NMDARs and L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (L-VGCCs), thereby causing sustained translation inhibition through eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 (eEF2) phosphorylation, which in turn disrupts the NMDAR response. Thus, we show that APOE4 affects basal and activity-mediated protein synthesis responses in neurons by affecting calcium homeostasis.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Defective protein synthesis has been shown as an early defect in familial Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, this has not been studied in the context of sporadic AD, which constitutes the majority of cases. In our study, we show that Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4), the predominant risk factor for AD, inhibits global protein synthesis in neurons. APOE4 also affects NMDA activity-mediated protein synthesis response, thus inhibiting synaptic translation. We also show that the defective protein synthesis mediated by APOE4 is closely linked to the perturbation of calcium homeostasis caused by APOE4 in neurons. Thus, we propose the dysregulation of protein synthesis as one of the possible molecular mechanisms to explain APOE4-mediated synaptic and cognitive defects. Hence, the study not only suggests an explanation for the APOE4-mediated predisposition to AD, it also bridges the gap in understanding APOE4-mediated pathology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Metabolic Control of Sensory Neuron Survival by the p75 Neurotrophin Receptor in Schwann Cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>We report that the neurotrophin receptor p75 contributes to sensory neuron survival through the regulation of cholesterol metabolism in Schwann cells. Selective deletion of p75 in mouse Schwann cells of either sex resulted in a 30% loss of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons and diminished thermal sensitivity. P75 regulates Schwann cell cholesterol biosynthesis in response to BDNF, forming a co-receptor complex with ErbB2 and activating ErbB2-mediated stimulation of sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP2), a master regulator of cholesterol synthesis. Schwann cells lacking p75 exhibited decreased activation of SREBP2 and a reduction in 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) reductase (DHCR7) expression, resulting in accumulation of the neurotoxic intermediate, 7-dehyrocholesterol in the sciatic nerve. Restoration of DHCR7 in p75 null Schwann cells in mice significantly attenuated DRG neuron loss. Together, these results reveal a mechanism by which the disruption of lipid metabolism in glial cells negatively influences sensory neuron survival, which has implications for a wide range of peripheral neuropathies.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Although expressed in Schwann cells, the role of p75 in myelination has remained unresolved in part because of its dual expression in sensory neurons that Schwann cells myelinate. When p75 was deleted selectively among Schwann cells, myelination was minimally affected, while sensory neuron survival was reduced by 30%. The phenotype is mainly due to dysregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis in p75-deficient Schwann cells, leading to an accumulation of neurotoxic cholesterol precursor, 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC). Mechanism-wise, we discovered that in response to BDNF, p75 recruits and activates ErbB2 independently of ErbB3, thereby stimulating the master regulator, sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP2). These results together highlight a novel role of p75 in Schwann cells in regulating DRG neuron survival by orchestrating proper cholesterol metabolism.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Role of Galanin in Cerebellar Granule Cell Migration in the Early Postnatal Mouse during Normal Development and after Injury</a></h4>

              
                <p>Galanin, one of the most inducible neuropeptides, is widely present in developing brains, and its expression is altered by pathologic events (e.g., epilepsy, ischemia, and axotomy). The roles of galanin in brain development under both normal and pathologic conditions have been hypothesized, but the question of how galanin is involved in fetal and early postnatal brain development remains largely unanswered. In this study, using granule cell migration in the cerebellum of early postnatal mice (both sexes) as a model system, we examined the role of galanin in neuronal cell migration during normal development and after brain injury. Here we show that, during normal development, endogenous galanin participates in accelerating granule cell migration via altering the Ca<sup>2+</sup> and cAMP signaling pathways. Upon brain injury induced by the application of cold insults, galanin levels decrease at the lesion sites, but increase in the surroundings of lesion sites. Granule cells exhibit the following corresponding changes in migration: (1) slowing down migration at the lesion sites; and (2) accelerating migration in the surroundings of lesion sites. Experimental manipulations of galanin signaling reduce the lesion site-specific changes in granule cell migration, indicating that galanin plays a role in such deficits in neuronal cell migration. The present study suggests that manipulating galanin signaling may be a potential therapeutic target for acutely injured brains during development.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Deficits in neuronal cell migration caused by brain injury result in abnormal development of cortical layers, but the underlying mechanisms remain to be determined. Here, we report that on brain injury, endogenous levels of galanin, a neuropeptide, are altered in a lesion site-specific manner, decreasing at the lesion sites but increasing in the surroundings of lesion sites. The changes in galanin levels positively correlate with the migration rate of immature neurons. Manipulations of galanin signaling ameliorate the effects of injury on neuronal migration and cortical layer development. These results shed a light on galanin as a potential therapeutic target for acutely injured brains during development.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Developmental Effects of Oxytocin Neurons on Social Affiliation and Processing of Social Information</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hormones regulate behavior either through activational effects that facilitate the acute expression of specific behaviors or through organizational effects that shape the development of the nervous system thereby altering adult behavior. Much research has implicated the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) in acute modulation of various aspects of social behaviors across vertebrate species, and OXT signaling is associated with the developmental social deficits observed in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs); however, little is known about the role of OXT in the neurodevelopment of the social brain. We show that perturbation of OXT neurons during early zebrafish development led to a loss of dopaminergic neurons, associated with visual processing and reward, and blunted the neuronal response to social stimuli in the adult brain. Ultimately, adult fish whose OXT neurons were ablated in early life, displayed altered functional connectivity within social decision-making brain nuclei both in naive state and in response to social stimulus and became less social. We propose that OXT neurons have an organizational role, namely, to shape forebrain neuroarchitecture during development and to acquire an affiliative response toward conspecifics.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Social behavior is developed over the lifetime of an organism and the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) modulates social behaviors across vertebrate species, and is associated with neuro-developmental social deficits such as autism. However, whether OXT plays a role in the developmental maturation of neural systems that are necessary for social behavior remains poorly explored. We show that proper behavioral and neural response to social stimuli depends on a developmental process orchestrated by OXT neurons. Animals whose OXT system is ablated in early life show blunted neuronal and behavioral responses to social stimuli as well as wide ranging disruptions in the functional connectivity of the social brain. We provide a window into the mechanisms underlying OXT-dependent developmental processes that implement adult sociality.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Reliable Sensory Processing in Mouse Visual Cortex through Cooperative Interactions between Somatostatin and Parvalbumin Interneurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Intrinsic neuronal variability significantly limits information encoding in the primary visual cortex (V1). However, under certain conditions, neurons can respond reliably with highly precise responses to the same visual stimuli from trial to trial. This suggests that there exists intrinsic neural circuit mechanisms that dynamically modulate the intertrial variability of visual cortical neurons. Here, we sought to elucidate the role of different inhibitory interneurons (INs) in reliable coding in mouse V1. To study the interactions between somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SST-INs) and parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV-INs), we used a dual-color calcium imaging technique that allowed us to simultaneously monitor these two neural ensembles while awake mice, of both sexes, passively viewed natural movies. SST neurons were more active during epochs of reliable pyramidal neuron firing, whereas PV neurons were more active during epochs of unreliable firing. SST neuron activity lagged that of PV neurons, consistent with a feedback inhibitory SST-&gt;PV circuit. To dissect the role of this circuit in pyramidal neuron activity, we used temporally limited optogenetic activation and inactivation of SST and PV interneurons during periods of reliable and unreliable pyramidal cell firing. Transient firing of SST neurons increased pyramidal neuron reliability by actively suppressing PV neurons, a proposal that was supported by a rate-based model of V1 neurons. These results identify a cooperative functional role for the SST-&gt;PV circuit in modulating the reliability of pyramidal neuron activity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Cortical neurons often respond to identical sensory stimuli with large variability. However, under certain conditions, the same neurons can also respond highly reliably. The circuit mechanisms that contribute to this modulation remain unknown. Here, we used novel dual-wavelength calcium imaging and temporally selective optical perturbation to identify an inhibitory neural circuit in visual cortex that can modulate the reliability of pyramidal neurons to naturalistic visual stimuli. Our results, supported by computational models, suggest that somatostatin interneurons increase pyramidal neuron reliability by suppressing parvalbumin interneurons via the inhibitory SST-&gt;PV circuit. These findings reveal a novel role of the SST-&gt;PV circuit in modulating the fidelity of neural coding critical for visual perception.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Differential Effects of Cerebellar Degeneration on Feedforward versus Feedback Control across Speech and Reaching Movements</a></h4>

              
                <p>Errors that result from a mismatch between predicted movement outcomes and sensory afference are used to correct ongoing movements through feedback control and to adapt feedforward control of future movements. The cerebellum has been identified as a critical part of the neural circuit underlying implicit adaptation across a wide variety of movements (reaching, gait, eye movements, and speech). The contribution of this structure to feedback control is less well understood. Although it has recently been shown in the speech domain that individuals with cerebellar degeneration produce larger online corrections for sensory perturbations than control participants, similar behavior has not been observed in other motor domains. Currently, comparisons across domains are limited by different population samples and potential ceiling effects in existing tasks. To assess the relationship between changes in feedforward and feedback control associated with cerebellar degeneration across motor domains, we evaluated adaptive (feedforward) and compensatory (feedback) responses to sensory perturbations in reaching and speech production in human participants of both sexes with cerebellar degeneration and neurobiologically healthy controls. As expected, the cerebellar group demonstrated impaired adaptation in both reaching and speech. In contrast, the groups did not differ in their compensatory response in either domain. Moreover, compensatory and adaptive responses in the cerebellar group were not correlated within or across motor domains. These results point to a general impairment in feedforward control with spared feedback control in cerebellar degeneration. However, the magnitude of feedforward impairments and potential changes in feedback-based control manifest in a domain-specific manner across individuals.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The cerebellum contributes to feedforward updating of movement in response to sensory errors, but its role in feedback control is less understood. Here, we tested individuals with cerebellar degeneration (CD), using sensory perturbations to assess adaptation of feedforward control and feedback gains during reaching and speech production tasks. The results confirmed that CD leads to reduced adaption in both domains. However, feedback gains were unaffected by CD in either domain. Interestingly, measures of feedforward and feedback control were not correlated across individuals within or across motor domains. Together, these results indicate a general impairment in feedforward control with spared feedback control in CD. However, the magnitude of feedforward impairments manifests in a domain-specific manner across individuals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Posterodorsal Medial Amygdala Regulation of Female Social Behavior: GABA versus Glutamate Projections</a></h4>

              
                <p>Social behaviors, including reproductive behaviors, often display sexual dimorphism. Lordosis, the measure of female sexual receptivity, is one of the most apparent sexually dimorphic reproductive behaviors. Lordosis is regulated by estrogen and progesterone (P4) acting within a hypothalamic-limbic circuit, consisting of the arcuate, medial preoptic, and ventromedial nuclei of the hypothalamus. Social cues are integrated into the circuit through the amygdala. The posterodorsal part of the medial amygdala (MeApd) is involved in sexually dimorphic social and reproductive behaviors, and sends projections to hypothalamic neuroendocrine regions. GABA from the MeApd appears to facilitate social behaviors, while glutamate may play the opposite role. To test these hypotheses, adult female vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT)-Cre and vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGluT2)-Cre mice were transfected with halorhodopsin (eNpHR)-expressing or channelrhodopsin-expressing adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), respectively, in the MeApd. The lordosis quotient (LQ) was measured following either photoinhibition of VGAT or photoexcitation of VGluT2 neurons, and brains were assessed for c-Fos immunohistochemistry (IHC). Photoinhibition of VGAT neurons in the MeApd decreased LQ, and decreased c-Fos expression within VGAT neurons, within the MeApd as a whole, and within the ventrolateral part of the ventromedial nucleus (VMHvl). Photoexcitation of VGluT2 neurons did not affect LQ, but did increase time spent self-grooming, and increased c-Fos expression within VGluT2 neurons in the MeApd. Neither condition altered c-Fos expression in the medial preoptic nucleus (MPN) or the arcuate nucleus (ARH). These data support a role for MeApd GABA in the facilitation of lordosis. Glutamate from the MeApd does not appear to be directly involved in the lordosis circuit, but appears to direct behavior away from social interactions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Lordosis, the measure of female sexual receptivity, is a sexually dimorphic behavior regulated within a hypothalamic-limbic circuit. Social cues are integrated through the amygdala, and the posterodorsal part of the medial amygdala (MeApd) is involved in sexually dimorphic social and reproductive behaviors. Photoinhibition of GABAergic neurons in the MeApd inhibited lordosis, while photoactivation of glutamate neurons had no effect on lordosis, but increased self-grooming. These data support a role for MeApd GABA in the facilitation of social behaviors and MeApd glutamate projections in anti-social interactions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Excessive Laughter-like Vocalizations, Microcephaly, and Translational Outcomes in the Ube3a Deletion Rat Model of Angelman Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                <p>Angelman syndrome (AS) is a rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disabilities, motor and balance deficits, impaired communication, and a happy, excitable demeanor with frequent laughter. We sought to elucidate a preclinical outcome measure in male and female rats that addressed communication abnormalities of AS and other neurodevelopmental disorders in which communication is atypical and/or lack of speech is a core feature. We discovered, and herein report for the first time, excessive laughter-like 50 kHz ultrasonic emissions in the <I>Ube3a</I><sup>mat&ndash;/pat+</sup> rat model of AS, which suggests an excitable, playful demeanor and elevated positive affect, similar to the demeanor of individuals with AS. Also in line with the AS phenotype, <I>Ube3a</I><sup>mat&ndash;/pat+</sup> rats demonstrated aberrant social interactions with a novel partner, distinctive gait abnormalities, impaired cognition, an underlying LTP deficit, and profound reductions in brain volume. These unique, robust phenotypes provide advantages compared with currently available mouse models and will be highly valuable as outcome measures in the evaluation of therapies for AS.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Angelman syndrome (AS) is a severe neurogenetic disorder for which there is no cure, despite decades of research using mouse models. This study used a recently developed rat model of AS to delineate disease-relevant outcome measures to facilitate therapeutic development. We found the rat to be a strong model of AS, offering several advantages over mouse models by exhibiting numerous AS-relevant phenotypes, including overabundant laughter-like vocalizations, reduced hippocampal LTP, and volumetric anomalies across the brain. These findings are unconfounded by detrimental motor abilities and background strain, issues plaguing mouse models. This rat model represents an important advancement in the field of AS, and the outcome metrics reported herein will be central to the therapeutic pipeline.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cognitive Control Promotes Either Honesty or Dishonesty, Depending on One's Moral Default</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cognitive control is crucially involved in making (dis)honest decisions. However, the precise nature of this role has been hotly debated. Is honesty an intuitive response, or is will power needed to override an intuitive inclination to cheat? A reconciliation of these conflicting views proposes that cognitive control enables dishonest participants to be honest, whereas it allows those who are generally honest to cheat. Thus, cognitive control does not promote (dis)honesty per se; it depends on one's moral default. In the present study, we tested this proposal using electroencephalograms in humans (males and females) in combination with an independent localizer (Stroop task) to mitigate the problem of reverse inference. Our analysis revealed that the neural signature evoked by cognitive control demands in the Stroop task can be used to estimate (dis)honest choices in an independent cheating task, providing converging evidence that cognitive control can indeed help honest participants to cheat, whereas it facilitates honesty for cheaters.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dishonesty causes enormous economic losses. To target dishonesty with interventions, a rigorous understanding of the underlying cognitive mechanisms is required. A recent study found that cognitive control enables honest participants to cheat, whereas it helps cheaters to be honest. However, it is evident that a single study does not suffice as support for a novel hypothesis. Therefore, we tested the replicability of this finding using a different modality (EEG instead of fMRI) together with an independent localizer task to avoid reverse inference. We find that the same neural signature evoked by cognitive control demands in the localizer task can be used to estimate (dis)honesty in an independent cheating task, establishing converging evidence that the effect of cognitive control indeed depends on a person's moral default.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Common and Unique Inhibitory Control Signatures of Action-Stopping and Attentional Capture Suggest That Actions Are Stopped in Two Stages</a></h4>

              
                <p>The ability to stop an already initiated action is paramount to adaptive behavior. Much scientific debate in the field of human action-stopping currently focuses on two interrelated questions. (1) Which cognitive and neural processes uniquely underpin the implementation of inhibitory control when actions are stopped after explicit stop signals, and which processes are instead commonly evoked by all salient signals, even those that do not require stopping? (2) Why do purported (neuro)physiological signatures of inhibition occur at two different latencies after stop signals? Here, we address both questions via two preregistered experiments that combined measurements of corticospinal excitability, EMG, and whole-scalp EEG. Adult human subjects performed a stop signal task that also contained "ignore" signals: equally salient signals that did not require stopping but rather completion of the Go response. We found that both stop- and ignore signals produced equal amounts of early-latency inhibition of corticospinal excitability and EMG, which took place ~150 ms following either signal. Multivariate pattern analysis of the whole-scalp EEG data further corroborated that this early processing stage was shared between stop- and ignore signals, as neural activity following the two signals could not be decoded from each other until a later time period. In this later period, unique activity related to stop signals emerged at frontocentral scalp sites, reflecting an increased stop signal P3. These findings suggest a two-step model of action-stopping, according to which an initial, universal inhibitory response to the saliency of the stop signal is followed by a slower process that is unique to outright stopping.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Humans often have to stop their ongoing actions when indicated by environmental stimuli (stop signals). Successful action-stopping requires both the ability to detect these salient stop signals and to subsequently inhibit ongoing motor programs. Because of this tight entanglement of attentional control and motor inhibition, identifying unique neurophysiological signatures of action-stopping is difficult. Indeed, we report that recently proposed early-latency signatures of motor inhibition during action-stopping are also found after salient signals that do not require stopping. However, using multivariate pattern analysis of scalp-recorded neural data, we also identified subsequent neural activity that uniquely distinguished action-stopping from saliency detection. These results suggest that actions are stopped in two stages: the first common to all salient events and the second unique to action-stopping.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Hippocampal Connectivity with Retrosplenial Cortex is Linked to Neocortical Tau Accumulation and Memory Function</a></h4>

              
                <p>The mechanisms underlying accumulation of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related tau pathology outside of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) in older adults are unknown but crucial to understanding cognitive decline. A growing body of evidence from human and animal studies strongly implicates neural connectivity in the propagation of tau in humans, but the pathways of neocortical tau spread and its consequences for cognitive function are not well understood. Using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and tau PET imaging from a sample of 97 male and female cognitively normal older adults, we examined MTL structures involved in medial parietal tau accumulation and associations with memory function. Functional connectivity between hippocampus (HC) and retrosplenial cortex (RsC), a key region of the medial parietal lobe, was associated with tau in medial parietal lobe. By contrast, connectivity between entorhinal cortex (EC) and RsC did not correlate with medial parietal lobe tau. Further, greater hippocampal-retrosplenial (HC-RsC) connectivity was associated with a stronger correlation between MTL and medial parietal lobe tau. Finally, an interaction between connectivity strength and medial parietal tau was associated with episodic memory performance, particularly in the visuospatial domain. This pattern of tau accumulation thus appears to reflect pathways of neural connectivity, and propagation of tau from EC to medial parietal lobe via the HC may represent a critical process in the evolution of cognitive dysfunction in aging and AD.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The accumulation of tau pathology in the neocortex is a fundamental process underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we use functional connectivity in cognitively normal older adults to track the accumulation of tau in the medial parietal lobe, a key region for memory processing that is affected early in the progression of AD. We show that the strength of connectivity between the hippocampus (HC) and retrosplenial cortex (RsC) is related to medial parietal tau burden, and that these tau and connectivity measures interact to associate with episodic memory performance. These findings establish the HC as the origin of medial parietal tau and implicate tau pathology in this region as a crucial marker of the beginnings of AD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Chemogenetic Activation of Cortical Parvalbumin-Positive Interneurons Reverses Noise-Induced Impairments in Gap Detection</a></h4>

              
                <p>Exposure to loud noises not only leads to trauma and loss of output from the ear but also alters downstream central auditory circuits. A perceptual consequence of noise-induced central auditory disruption is impairment in gap-induced prepulse inhibition, also known as gap detection. Recent studies have implicated cortical parvalbumin (PV)-positive inhibitory interneurons in gap detection and prepulse inhibition. Here, we show that exposure to loud noises specifically reduces the density of cortical PV but not somatostatin (SOM)-positive interneurons in the primary auditory cortex in mice (C57BL/6) of both sexes. Optogenetic activation of PV neurons produced less cortical inhibition in noise-exposed than sham-exposed animals, indicative of reduced PV neuron function. Activation of SOM neurons resulted in similar levels of cortical inhibition in noise- and sham-exposed groups. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation of PV neurons with the hM3-based designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs completely reversed the impairments in gap detection for noise-exposed animals. These results support the notions that cortical PV neurons encode gap in sound and that PV neuron dysfunction contributes to noise-induced impairment in gap detection.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Noise-induced hearing loss contributes to a range of central auditory processing deficits (CAPDs). The mechanisms underlying noise-induced CAPDs are still poorly understood. Here we show that exposure to loud noises results in dysfunction of PV-positive but not somatostatin-positive inhibitory interneurons in the primary auditory cortex. In addition, cortical PV inhibitory neurons in noise-exposed animals had reduced expression of glutamic acid decarboxylases and weakened inhibition on cortical activity. Noise exposure resulted in impaired gap detection, indicative of disrupted temporal sound processing and possibly tinnitus. We found that chemogenetic activation of cortical PV inhibitory interneurons alleviated the deficits in gap detection. These results implicate PV neuron dysfunction as a mechanism for noise-induced CAPDs.</p>

                Background: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by its progression of motor-related symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, slowness of movement, and difficulty with walking and balance. Comorbid conditions in PD individuals include insulin resistance (IR) and narcolepsy-like sleep patterns. The intersecting sleep symptoms of both conditions include excessive daytime sleepiness, hallucinations, insomnia, and falling into REM sleep more quickly than an average person. Understanding of the biological basis and relationship of these comorbid disorders with PD may help with early detection and intervention strategies to improve quality of life. Methods: In this study, an integrative genomics and systems biology approach was used to analyze gene expression patterns associated with PD, IR, and narcolepsy in order to identify genes and pathways that may shed light on how these disorders are interrelated. A correlation analysis with known genes associated with these disorders (LRRK2, HLA-DQB1, and HCRT) was used to query microarray data corresponding to brain regions known to be involved in PD and narcolepsy. This includes the hypothalamus, dorsal thalamus, pons, and subcoeruleus nucleus. Risk factor genes for PD, IR, and narcolepsy were also incorporated into the analysis. Results: The PD and narcolepsy signaling networks are connected through insulin and immune system pathways. Important genes and pathways that link PD, narcolepsy, and IR are CACNA1C, CAMK1D, BHLHE41, HMGB1, and AGE-RAGE. Conclusions: We have identified the genetic signatures that link PD with its comorbid disorders, narcolepsy and insulin resistance, from the convergence and intersection of dopaminergic, insulin, and immune system related signaling pathways. These findings may aid in the design of early intervention strategies and treatment regimes for non-motor symptoms in PD patients as well as individuals with diabetes and narcolepsy.

                Basal ganglia lesions showing an expansile high signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI are termed the lentiform fork sign. This specific finding is mainly observed in diabetic patients with uremic encephalopathy with metabolic acidosis, although there are also reports in patients with ketoacidosis, dialysis disequilibrium syndrome, intoxication, and following drug treatment (e.g., metformin). A 57-year-old Japanese man on chronic hemodialysis for 4 years because of diabetic nephropathy was admitted to our hospital for relatively rapid-onset gait disturbance, severe dysarthria, and consciousness disturbance. Brain T2-weighted MRI showed the lentiform fork sign. Hemodialysis was performed the day before admission, and laboratory tests showed mild metabolic (lactic) acidosis, but no uremia. Surprisingly, metformin, which is contraindicated for patients with end-stage kidney disease, had been prescribed for 6 months in his medication record, and his sluggish speaking and dysarthria appeared gradually after metformin treatment was started. Thus, the encephalopathy was considered to be related to metformin treatment. He received hemodialysis treatment for 6 consecutive days, and his consciousness disturbance and dysarthria improved in 1 week. At the 8-month follow-up, the size of the hyperintensity area on MRI had decreased, while the mild gait disturbance remained. Considering the rapid onset of gait and consciousness disturbance immediately before admission, diabetic uremic syndrome may also have occurred with metformin-related encephalopathy, and resulted in the lentiform fork sign, despite the patient showing no evidence of severe uremia on laboratory data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">How conformity can lead to polarised social behaviour</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Folco Panizza, Alexander Vostroknutov, Giorgio Coricelli</p>

Learning social behaviour of others strongly influences one’s own social attitudes. We compare several distinct explanations of this phenomenon, testing their predictions using computational modelling across four experimental conditions. In the experiment, participants chose repeatedly whether to pay for increasing (prosocial) or decreasing (antisocial) the earnings of an unknown other. Halfway through the task, participants predicted the choices of an extremely prosocial or antisocial agent (either a computer, a single participant, or a group of participants). Our analyses indicate that participants polarise their social attitude mainly due to normative expectations. Specifically, most participants conform to presumed demands by the authority (vertical influence), or because they learn that the observed human agents follow the norm very closely (horizontal influence).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Atorvastatin-mediated rescue of cancer-related cognitive changes in combined anticancer therapies</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Junho Lee, Jin Su Kim, Yangjin Kim</p>

Acute administration of trastuzumab (TZB) may induce various forms of cognitive impairment. These cancer-related cognitive changes (CRCC) are regulated by an adverse biological process involving cancer stem cells (CSCs) and IL-6. Recent studies have reported that atorvastatin (ATV) may change the dynamic of cognitive impairment in a combination (TZB+ATV) therapy. In this study, we investigate the mutual interactions between cancer stem cells and the tumor cells that facilitate cognitive impairment during long term TZB therapy by developing a mathematical model that involves IL-6 and the key apoptotic regulation. These include the densities of tumor cells and CSCs, and the concentrations of intracellular signaling molecules (NF<i>κ</i>B, Bcl-2, BAX). We apply the mathematical model to a single or combination (ATV+TZB) therapy used in the experiments to demonstrate that the CSCs can enhance CRCC by secreting IL-6 and ATV may interfere the whole regulation. We show that the model can both reproduce the major experimental observation on onset and prevention of CRCC, and suggest several important predictions to guide future experiments with the goal of the development of new anti-tumor and anti-CRCC strategies. Moreover, using this model, we investigate the fundamental mechanism of onset of cognitive impairment in TZB-treated patients and the impact of alternating therapies on the anti-tumor efficacy and intracellular response to different treatment schedules.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Extended graphical lasso for multiple interaction networks for high dimensional omics data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yang Xu, Hongmei Jiang, Wenxin Jiang</p>

There has been a spate of interest in association networks in biological and medical research, for example, genetic interaction networks. In this paper, we propose a novel method, the extended joint hub graphical lasso (EDOHA), to estimate multiple related interaction networks for high dimensional omics data across multiple distinct classes. To be specific, we construct a convex penalized log likelihood optimization problem and solve it with an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. The proposed method can also be adapted to estimate interaction networks for high dimensional compositional data such as microbial interaction networks. The performance of the proposed method in the simulated studies shows that EDOHA has remarkable advantages in recognizing class-specific hubs than the existing comparable methods. We also present three applications of real datasets. Biological interpretations of our results confirm those of previous studies and offer a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanism in disease.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Understanding degraded speech leads to perceptual gating of a brain stem reflex in human listeners</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Heivet Hernández-Pérez, Jason Mikiel-Hunter, David McAlpine, Sumitrajit Dhar, Sriram Boothalingam, Jessica J. M. Monaghan, Catherine M. McMahon</p>

The ability to navigate “cocktail party” situations by focusing on sounds of interest over irrelevant, background sounds is often considered in terms of cortical mechanisms. However, subcortical circuits such as the pathway underlying the medial olivocochlear (MOC) reflex modulate the activity of the inner ear itself, supporting the extraction of salient features from auditory scene prior to any cortical processing. To understand the contribution of auditory subcortical nuclei and the cochlea in complex listening tasks, we made physiological recordings along the auditory pathway while listeners engaged in detecting non(sense) words in lists of words. Both naturally spoken and intrinsically noisy, vocoded speech—filtering that mimics processing by a cochlear implant (CI)—significantly activated the MOC reflex, but this was not the case for speech in background noise, which more engaged midbrain and cortical resources. A model of the initial stages of auditory processing reproduced specific effects of each form of speech degradation, providing a rationale for goal-directed gating of the MOC reflex based on enhancing the representation of the energy envelope of the acoustic waveform. Our data reveal the coexistence of 2 strategies in the auditory system that may facilitate speech understanding in situations where the signal is either intrinsically degraded or masked by extrinsic acoustic energy. Whereas intrinsically degraded streams recruit the MOC reflex to improve representation of speech cues peripherally, extrinsically masked streams rely more on higher auditory centres to denoise signals.

Michaelis constants (Km) are essential to predict the catalytic rate of enzymes, but are not widely available. A new study in PLOS Biology uses artificial intelligence (AI) to accurately predict Km on a proteome-wide scale, paving the way for dynamic, genome-wide modeling of metabolism.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">RefPlantNLR is a comprehensive collection of experimentally validated plant disease resistance proteins from the NLR family</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jiorgos Kourelis, Toshiyuki Sakai, Hiroaki Adachi, Sophien Kamoun</p>

Reference datasets are critical in computational biology. They help define canonical biological features and are essential for benchmarking studies. Here, we describe a comprehensive reference dataset of experimentally validated plant nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) immune receptors. RefPlantNLR consists of 481 NLRs from 31 genera belonging to 11 orders of flowering plants. This reference dataset has several applications. We used RefPlantNLR to determine the canonical features of functionally validated plant NLRs and to benchmark 5 NLR annotation tools. This revealed that although NLR annotation tools tend to retrieve the majority of NLRs, they frequently produce domain architectures that are inconsistent with the RefPlantNLR annotation. Guided by this analysis, we developed a new pipeline, NLRtracker, which extracts and annotates NLRs from protein or transcript files based on the core features found in the RefPlantNLR dataset. The RefPlantNLR dataset should also prove useful for guiding comparative analyses of NLRs across the wide spectrum of plant diversity and identifying understudied taxa. We hope that the RefPlantNLR resource will contribute to moving the field beyond a uniform view of NLR structure and function.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The glucose-sensing transcription factor MLX balances metabolism and stress to suppress apoptosis and maintain spermatogenesis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Patrick A. Carroll, Brian W. Freie, Pei Feng Cheng, Sivakanthan Kasinathan, Haiwei Gu, Theresa Hedrich, James A. Dowdle, Vivek Venkataramani, Vijay Ramani, Xiaoying Wu, Daniel Raftery, Jay Shendure, Donald E. Ayer, Charles H. Muller, Robert N. Eisenman</p>

Male germ cell (GC) production is a metabolically driven and apoptosis-prone process. Here, we show that the glucose-sensing transcription factor (TF) MAX-Like protein X (MLX) and its binding partner MondoA are both required for male fertility in the mouse, as well as survival of human tumor cells derived from the male germ line. Loss of <i>Mlx</i> results in altered metabolism as well as activation of multiple stress pathways and GC apoptosis in the testes. This is concomitant with dysregulation of the expression of male-specific GC transcripts and proteins. Our genomic and functional analyses identify loci directly bound by MLX involved in these processes, including metabolic targets, obligate components of male-specific GC development, and apoptotic effectors. These in vivo and in vitro studies implicate MLX and other members of the proximal MYC network, such as MNT, in regulation of metabolism and differentiation, as well as in suppression of intrinsic and extrinsic death signaling pathways in both spermatogenesis and male germ cell tumors (MGCTs).

                Background: Malaysia is embarking on sustainable, resilient, and prosperous living conditions initiatives. Malaysian cities are embracing the smart city aspiration through their respective local authorities. However, they face challenges regarding  funding allocation for smart city implementation. Local authorities primarily operate on a conventional business model. Based on their current business model, they are unlikely to sustain their smart city initiatives. A more financially sustainable business model is required by these local authorities to embark on smart city initiatives. This study presents a systematic review concerning the business models adopted by local authorities to implement smart cities. This paper also explores the applicability of frugal innovation towards developing a smart city business model. Methods: This article undertakes a systematic review based on combination sets of eight main keywords: smart city, business model, frugal innovation, local authorities, performance, inclusivity, technology and success factor. The search strategy includes journal articles and conference proceedings from five major online databases: Emerald, ProQuest, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, and Springer Link between 2001-2021. The data is tabulated for clear expression of knowledge gaps. Results: A total of 17 articles from 300 articles on smart city business models matched the search on smart city business models for local authorities . The study revealed that hardly any in-depth research providing the crucial elements for a successful smart city business model for local authorities has been conducted. No research has linked frugal innovation to smart city business models. Conclusions: The study calls upon the research community to explore further, the possible linkage between frugal innovation and smart cities for local authorities.

                <p>In Parkinson's disease, both motor and neuropsychiatric complications unfold as a consequence of both incremental striatal dopaminergic denervation and intensifying long-term dopaminergic treatment. Together, this leads to ‘dopaminergic sensitization’ steadily increasing motor and behavioral responses to dopaminergic medication that result in the detrimental sequalae of long-term dopaminergic treatment. We review the clinical presentations of ‘dopaminergic sensitization’, including rebound off and dyskinesia in the motor domain, and neuropsychiatric fluctuations and behavioral addictions with impulse control disorders and dopamine dysregulation syndrome in the neuropsychiatric domain. We summarize state-of-the-art deep brain stimulation, and show that STN-DBS allows dopaminergic medication to be tapered, thus supporting dopaminergic desensitization. In this framework, we develop our integrated debatable viewpoint of “changing gears”, that is we suggest rethinking earlier use of subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation, when the first clinical signs of dopaminergic motor or neuropsychiatric complications emerge over the steadily progressive disease course. In this sense, subthalamic deep brain stimulation may help reduce longitudinal motor and neuropsychiatric symptom expression – importantly, not by neuroprotection but by supporting dopaminergic desensitization through postoperative medication reduction. Therefore, we suggest considering STN-DBS early enough before patients encounter potentially irreversible psychosocial consequences of dopaminergic complications, but importantly not before a patient shows first clinical signs of dopaminergic complications. We propose to consider neuropsychiatric dopaminergic complications as a new inclusion criterion in addition to established motor criteria, but this concept will require validation in future clinical trials.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is an uncommon form of stroke affecting mostly young individuals. Although genetic factors are thought to play a role in this cerebrovascular condition, its genetic etiology is not well understood.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A genome-wide association study was performed to identify genetic variants influencing susceptibility to CVT. A 2-stage genome-wide study was undertaken in 882 Europeans diagnosed with CVT and 1,205 ethnicity-matched control subjects divided into discovery and independent replication datasets.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the overall case–control cohort, we identified highly significant associations with 37 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the 9q34.2 region. The strongest association was with rs8176645 (combined <i>p</i> = 9.15 × 10<sup>−24</sup>; odds ratio [OR] = 2.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.76–2.31). The discovery set findings were validated across an independent European cohort. Genetic risk score for this 9q34.2 region increases CVT risk by a pooled estimate OR = 2.65 (95% CI = 2.21–3.20, <i>p</i> = 2.00 × 10<sup>−16</sup>). SNPs within this region were in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with coding regions of the <i>ABO</i> gene. The <i>ABO</i> blood group was determined using allele combination of SNPs rs8176746 and rs8176645. Blood groups A, B, or AB, were at 2.85 times (95% CI = 2.32–3.52, <i>p</i> = 2.00 × 10<sup>−16</sup>) increased risk of CVT compared with individuals with blood group O.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We present the first chromosomal region to robustly associate with a genetic susceptibility to CVT. This region more than doubles the likelihood of CVT, a risk greater than any previously identified thrombophilia genetic risk marker. That the identified variant is in strong LD with the coding region of the <i>ABO</i> gene with differences in blood group prevalence provides important new insights into the pathophysiology of CVT.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Neuronal TNFα, Not α‐Syn, Underlies PDD‐Like Disease Progression in IFNβ‐KO Mice</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Parkinson's disease (PD) manifests in motor dysfunction, non-motor symptoms, and eventual dementia (PDD). Neuropathological hallmarks include nigrostriatal neurodegeneration, Lewy body (LB) pathology, and neuroinflammation. Alpha-synuclein (α-syn), a primary component of LBs, is implicated in PD pathogenesis, accumulating, and aggregating in both familial and sporadic PD. However, as α-syn pathology is often comorbid with amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and phosphorylated tau (pTau) tangles in PDD, it is still unclear whether α-syn is the primary cause of neurodegeneration in sporadic PDD. We aimed to determine how the absence of α-syn would affect PDD manifestation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>IFN-β knockout (<i>Ifnb</i>
<sup>
   <i>−/−</i>
</sup>) mice spontaneously develop progressive behavior abnormalities and neuropathology resembling PDD, notably with α-syn<sup>+</sup> LBs. We generated <i>Ifnb/Snca</i> double knockout (DKO) mice and evaluated their behavior and neuropathology compared with wild-type (Wt), <i>Ifnb</i>
<sup>
   <i>−/−</i>
</sup>, and <i>Snca</i>
<sup>
   <i>−/−</i>
</sup> mice using immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, immunoblots, qPCR, and modification of neuronal signaling.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><i>Ifnb/Snca</i> DKO mice developed all clinical PDD-like behavioral manifestations induced by IFN-β loss. Independently of α-syn expression, lack of IFN-β alone induced Aβ plaques, pTau tangles, and LB-like Aβ<sup>+</sup>/pTau<sup>+</sup> inclusion bodies and neuroinflammation. IFN-β loss caused significant elevated glial and neuronal TNF-α and neuronal TNFR1, associated with neurodegeneration. Restoring neuronal IFN-β signaling or blocking TNFR1 rescued caspase 3/t-BID-mediated neuronal-death through upregulation of c-FLIP<sub>S</sub> and lowered intraneuronal Aβ and pTau accumulation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings increase our understanding of PD pathology and suggest that targeting α-syn alone is not sufficient to mitigate disease. Targeting specific aspects of neuroinflammation, such as aberrant neuronal TNF-α/TNFR1 or IFN-β/IFNAR signaling, may attenuate disease. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:789–807</p>

                <p>Patients with epilepsy report that sleep deprivation is a common trigger for breakthrough seizures. The basic mechanism of this phenomenon is unknown. In the Kv1.1<sup>−/−</sup> mouse model of epilepsy, daily sleep deprivation indeed exacerbated seizures though these effects were lost after the third day. Sleep deprivation also accelerated mortality in ~ 52% of Kv1.1<sup>−/−</sup> mice, not observed in controls. Voltage-clamp experiments on the day after recovery from sleep deprivation showed reductions in GABAergic tonic inhibition in dentate granule cells in epileptic Kv1.1<sup>−/−</sup> mice. Our results suggest that sleep deprivation is detrimental to seizures and survival, possibly due to reductions in GABAergic tonic inhibition. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:840–844</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors for acute symptomatic seizures and post-stroke epilepsy after acute ischemic stroke and evaluate the effects of reperfusion treatment.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We assessed the risk factors for post-stroke seizures using logistic or Cox regression in a multicenter study, including adults from 8 European referral centers with neuroimaging-confirmed ischemic stroke. We compared the risk of post-stroke seizures between participants with or without reperfusion treatment following propensity score matching to reduce confounding due to treatment selection.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the overall cohort of 4,229 participants (mean age 71 years, 57% men), a higher risk of acute symptomatic seizures was observed in those with more severe strokes, infarcts located in the posterior cerebral artery territory, and strokes caused by large-artery atherosclerosis. Strokes caused by small-vessel occlusion carried a small risk of acute symptomatic seizures. 6% developed post-stroke epilepsy. Risk factors for post-stroke epilepsy were acute symptomatic seizures, more severe strokes, infarcts involving the cerebral cortex, and strokes caused by large-artery atherosclerosis. Electroencephalography findings within 7 days of stroke onset were not independently associated with the risk of post-stroke epilepsy. There was no association between reperfusion treatments in general or only intravenous thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy with the time to post-stroke epilepsy or the risk of acute symptomatic seizures.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Post-stroke seizures are related to stroke severity, etiology, and location, whereas an early electroencephalogram was not predictive of epilepsy. We did not find an association of reperfusion treatment with risks of acute symptomatic seizures or post-stroke epilepsy. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:808–820</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Thalamic Influence on Slow Wave Slope Renormalization During Sleep</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Slow waves are thought to mediate an overall reduction in synaptic strength during sleep. The specific contribution of the thalamus to this so-called synaptic renormalization is unknown. Thalamic stroke is associated with daytime sleepiness, along with changes to sleep electroencephalography and cognition, making it a unique “experiment of nature” to assess the relationship between sleep rhythms, synaptic renormalization, and daytime functions.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Sleep was studied by polysomnography and high-density electroencephalography over 17 nights in patients with thalamic (n = 12) and 15 nights in patients with extrathalamic (n = 11) stroke. Sleep electroencephalographic overnight slow wave slope changes and their relationship with subjective daytime sleepiness, cognition, and other functional tests were assessed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Thalamic and extrathalamic patients did not differ in terms of age, sleep duration, or apnea–hypopnea index. Conversely, overnight slope changes were reduced in a large cluster of electrodes in thalamic compared to extrathalamic stroke patients. This reduction was related to increased daytime sleepiness. No significant differences were found in other functional tests between the 2 groups.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In patients with thalamic stroke, a reduction in overnight slow wave slope change and increased daytime sleepiness was found. Sleep- and wake-centered mechanisms for this relationship are discussed. Overall, this study suggests a central role of the thalamus in synaptic renormalization.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Relation of Pre‐Stroke Aspirin Use With Cerebral Infarct Volume and Functional Outcomes</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We investigated (1) the associations of pre-stroke aspirin use with thrombus burden, infarct volume, hemorrhagic transformation, early neurological deterioration (END), and functional outcome, and (2) whether stroke subtypes modify these associations in first-ever ischemic stroke.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This multicenter magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based study included 5,700 consecutive patients with acute first-ever ischemic stroke, who did not undergo intravenous thrombolysis or endovascular thrombectomy, from May 2011 through February 2014. Propensity score-based augmented inverse probability weighting was performed to estimate adjusted effects of pre-stroke aspirin use.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The mean age was 67 years (41% women), and 15.9% (n = 907) were taking aspirin before stroke. Pre-stroke aspirin use (vs nonuse) was significantly related to a reduced infarct volume (by 30%), particularly in large artery atherosclerosis stroke (by 45%). In cardioembolic stroke, pre-stroke aspirin use was associated with a ~50% lower incidence of END (adjusted difference = −5.4%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = −8.9 to −1.9). Thus, pre-stroke aspirin use was associated with ~30% higher likelihood of favorable outcome (3-month modified Rankin Scale score &lt; 3), particularly in large artery atherosclerosis stroke and cardioembolic stroke (adjusted difference = 7.2%, 95% CI = 1.8 to 12.5 and adjusted difference = 6.4%, 95% CI = 1.7 to 11.1, respectively). Pre-stroke aspirin use (vs nonuse) was associated with 85% less frequent cerebral thrombus-related susceptibility vessel sign (SVS) in large artery atherosclerosis stroke (adjusted difference = −1.4%, 95% CI = −2.1 to −0.8, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and was associated with ~40% lower SVS volumes, particularly in cardioembolic stroke (adjusted difference = −0.16 cm<sup>3</sup>, 95% CI = −0.29 to −0.02, <i>p</i> = 0.03). Moreover, pre-stroke aspirin use was not significantly associated with hemorrhagic transformation (adjusted difference = −1.1%, <i>p</i> = 0.09).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Pre-stroke aspirin use associates with improved functional independence in patients with first-ever ischemic large arterial stroke by reducing infarct volume and/or END, likely by decreasing thrombus burden, without increased risk of hemorrhagic transformation.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To describe the neuropathological features of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-encephalitis in an archival autopsy cohort.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We examined four autopsies from patients with NMDAR-encephalitis; two patients were untreated, three had comorbidities: small cell lung cancer, brain post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD), and overlapping demyelination.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The two untreated patients had inflammatory infiltrates predominantly composed of perivascular and parenchymal CD3<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>−</sup> T cells and CD79a<sup>+</sup> B cells/plasma cells in basal ganglia, amygdala, and hippocampus with surrounding white matter. The hippocampi showed a significant decrease of NMDAR-immunoreactivity that correlated with disease severity. The patient with NMDAR-encephalitis and immunosuppression for kidney transplantation developed a brain monomorphic PTLD. Inflammatory changes were compatible with NMDAR-encephalitis. Additionally, plasma cells accumulated in the vicinity of the necrotic tumor along with macrophages and activated microglia that strongly expressed pro-inflammatory activation markers HLA-DR, CD68, and IL18. The fourth patient developed demyelinating lesions in the setting of a relapse 4 years after NMDAR-encephalitis. These lesions exhibited the hallmarks of classic multiple sclerosis with radially expanding lesions and remyelinated shadow plaques without complement or immunoglobulin deposition, compatible with a pattern I demyelination.</p>

<p>The topographic distribution of inflammation in patients with NMDAR-encephalitis reflects the clinical symptoms of movement disorders, abnormal behavior, and memory dysfunction with inflammation dominantly observed in basal ganglia, amygdala, and hippocampus, and loss of NMDAR-immunoreactivity correlates with disease severity. Co-occurring pathologies influence the spatial distribution, composition, and intensity of inflammation, which may modify patients’ clinical presentation and outcome.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a highly heterogeneous neurologic disorder characterized by lower-extremity spasticity. Here, we set out to determine the genetic basis of an autosomal dominant, pure, and infantile-onset form of HSP in a cohort of 8 patients with a uniform clinical presentation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Trio whole-exome sequencing was used in 5 index patients with infantile-onset pure HSP to determine the genetic cause of disease. The functional impact of identified genetic variants was verified using bioinformatics and complementary cellular and biochemical assays.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Distinct heterozygous <i>KPNA3</i> missense variants were found to segregate with the clinical phenotype in 8 patients; in 4 of them <i>KPNA3</i> variants had occurred de novo. Mutant karyopherin-α3 proteins exhibited a variable pattern of altered expression level, subcellular distribution, and protein interaction.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our genetic findings implicate heterozygous variants in <i>KPNA3</i> as a novel cause for autosomal dominant, early-onset, and pure HSP. Mutant karyopherin-α3 proteins display varying deficits in molecular and cellular functions, thus, for the first time, implicating dysfunctional nucleocytoplasmic shuttling as a novel pathomechanism causing HSP.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Tau‐Atrophy Variability Reveals Phenotypic Heterogeneity in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Tau neurofibrillary tangles (T) are the primary driver of downstream neurodegeneration (N) and subsequent cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, there is substantial variability in the T-N relationship – manifested in higher or lower atrophy than expected for level of tau in a given brain region. The goal of this study was to determine if region-based quantitation of this variability allows for identification of underlying modulatory factors, including polypathology.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cortical thickness (N) and <sup>18</sup>F-Flortaucipir SUVR (T) were computed in 104 gray matter regions from a cohort of cognitively-impaired, amyloid-positive (A+) individuals. Region-specific residuals from a robust linear fit between SUVR and cortical thickness were computed as a surrogate for T-N mismatch. A summary T-N mismatch metric defined using residuals were correlated with demographic and imaging-based modulatory factors, and to partition the cohort into data-driven subgroups.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The summary T-N mismatch metric correlated with underlying factors such as age and burden of white matter hyperintensity lesions. Data-driven subgroups based on clustering of residuals appear to represent different biologically relevant phenotypes, with groups showing distinct spatial patterns of higher or lower atrophy than expected.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These data support the notion that a measure of deviation from a normative relationship between tau burden and neurodegeneration across brain regions in individuals on the AD continuum captures variability due to multiple underlying factors, and can reveal phenotypes, which if validated, may help identify possible contributors to neurodegeneration in addition to tau, which may ultimately be useful for cohort selection in clinical trials.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The majority of patients with a familial cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) referred for molecular screening do not show pathogenic variants in known genes. In this study, we aimed to identify novel CSVD causal genes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a gene-based collapsing test of rare protein-truncating variants identified in exome data of 258 unrelated CSVD patients of an ethnically matched control cohort and of 2 publicly available large-scale databases, gnomAD and TOPMed. Western blotting was used to investigate the functional consequences of variants. Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging features of mutated patients were characterized.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We showed that <i>LAMB1</i> truncating variants escaping nonsense-mediated messenger RNA decay are strongly overrepresented in CSVD patients, reaching genome-wide significance (<i>p</i> &lt; 5 × 10<sup>−8</sup>). Using 2 antibodies recognizing the N- and C-terminal parts of LAMB1, we showed that truncated forms of LAMB1 are expressed in the endogenous fibroblasts of patients and trapped in the cytosol. These variants are associated with a novel phenotype characterized by the association of a hippocampal type episodic memory defect and a diffuse vascular leukoencephalopathy.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings are important for diagnosis and clinical care, to avoid unnecessary and sometimes invasive investigations, and also from a mechanistic point of view to understand the role of extracellular matrix proteins in neuronal homeostasis. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Health status classification model for medical adherence system in retirement township [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Medical adherence and remote patient monitoring have gained huge attention from researchers recently, especially with the need to observe the patients’ health outside hospitals due to the ongoing pandemic. The main goal of this research work is to propose a health status classification model that provides a numerical indicator of the overall health condition of a patient via four major vital signs, which are body temperature, blood pressure, blood oxygen saturation level, and heart rate. A dataset has been prepared based on the data obtained from hospital records, with these four vital signs extracted for each patient. This dataset provides a label associating each patient to the number of medical diagnoses. Generally, the number of diagnoses correlates with the patient's medical condition, with no diagnoses indicating normal condition, one to two diagnoses suggest low risk, and more than that implies high risk. Thus, we propose a method to classify a patient’s health status into three classes, which are normal, low risk and high risk. This would provide guidance for healthcare workers on the patient's medical condition. By training the classification model using the prepared dataset, the seriousness of a patient's health condition can be predicted. This prediction is performed by classifying the patients based on their four vital signs. Our tests have yielded encouraging results using precision and recall as the evaluation metrics. The key outcome of this work is a trained classification model that quantifies a patient's health condition based on four vital signs. Nevertheless, the model can be further improved by considering more input features such as medical history. The results obtained from this research can assist medical personnel by providing a secondary advice regarding the health status for the patients who are located remotely from the medical facilities.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Profile of Autism Spectrum Disorder in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex: Results from a longitudinal, prospective, multi‐site study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is highly associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Objectives of the study were to characterize autistic features in young children with TSC.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants included 138 children followed from ages 3 to 36 months with TSC from the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Autism Center of Excellence Research Network (TACERN), a multicenter, prospective observational study aimed at understanding the underlying mechanisms of ASD in TSC. Developmental and autism-specific assessments were administered, and a clinical diagnosis of ASD was determined for all participants at 36 months. Further analyses were performed on 117 participants with valid autism assessments based on nonverbal mental age greater than 15 months.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Prevalence of clinical diagnosis of ASD at 36 months was 25%. Nearly all autistic behaviors on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 (ADOS-2) and Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) were more prevalent in children diagnosed with ASD; however, autism-specific behaviors were also observed in children without ASD. Overall quality of social overtures, facial expressions, and abnormal repetitive interests and behaviors were characteristics most likely to distinguish children with ASD from those without an ASD diagnosis. Participants meeting ADOS-2 criteria but not a clinical ASD diagnosis exhibited intermediate developmental and ADOS-2 scores compared to individuals with and without ASD.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>ASD is highly prevalent in TSC, and many additional individuals with TSC exhibit a broad range of sub-threshold autistic behaviors. Our findings reveal a broader autism phenotype that can be identified in young children with TSC, which provides opportunity for early targeted treatments.</p>

                The trafficking of protein aggregates through neural circuitries causes adverse outcomes, including propagation of pathology and toxicity in neurodegenerative diseases. In a recent issue of Cell, Scheiblich et al. (2021) describe an advantageous aggregate-sharing strategy in microglial networks that nurtures α-synuclein-loaded members back to health.

                In this issue of Neuron, Amin et al. (2021) generate genetic tools to titrate down levels of miR-218, a motor neuron-enriched microRNA, in vivo. Varying miR-218 dose alters target selection, results in distinct dose-response curves reflecting 3′ UTR features, and reveals a miR-218 threshold below which motor neuron deficits emerge.

                Are social brain responses domain specific, or do domain-general but socially prevalent cognitive processes drive activity in this network? In this issue of Neuron, Konovalov et al. (2021) address this by dissociating general sociality from reactivity, one defining feature of social interactions.

                Kamm, Boffi, et al. found that the ion channel TRPM2 mediates detection of warm temperatures in the mouse hypothalamus. Specifically, TRPM2 enhances the thermosensitivity of hypothalamic warm-sensitive neurons (WSNs) via a presynaptic mechanism. This study highlights the role of WSNs and TRPM2 in body temperature homeostasis under hot environments.

                Hirabayashi et al. demonstrate that chemogenetic silencing of macaque SI hand representation impairs grasping and enhances sensitivity to foot stimulation. These behavioral effects co-occur with decreased fMRI activation in the grasping-related network and enhanced foot representation. This study reveals how local inactivation affects the network operation within and across areas.

                The brain is much more than the sum of its parts because those parts interact in complex networks. Vezoli et al. show that at least 4 distinct interaction networks coexist, mediated by the neuronal synchronization of 4 brain rhythms. These rhythm-defined networks are differentially dependent on the strengths of anatomical projections.

                Measuring brain activity while manipulating breathing resistance, Harrison et al. demonstrate that activity in the anterior insula reflects breathing-related predictions and prediction errors. Furthermore, prediction-related brain activity is altered with anxiety, along with sensitivity of and insight into breathing perceptions. These findings elucidate the link between breathing perception and anxiety.
