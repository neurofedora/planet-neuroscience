	<p>The role of select pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators in driving microglial cell polarization into classically (M1), or alternatively, (M2) activated states, as well as the subsequent differential responses of these induced phenotypes, was examined. Expression of PD-L1, MHC-II, MHC-I, arginase 1 (Arg-1), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was assessed using multi-color flow cytometry. We observed that both pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators induced PD-L1 expression on non-polarized microglia. Moreover, IFN-γ stimulated significant MHC class I and II expression on these cells. Interestingly, we observed that only IL-4 treatment induced Arg-1 expression, indicating M2 polarization. These M2 cells were refractory to subsequent depolarization and maintained their alternatively activated state. Furthermore, PD-L1 expression was significantly induced on these M2-polarized microglia after treatment with pro-inflammatory mediators, but not anti-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, we observed that only LPS induced iNOS expression in microglial cells, indicating M1 polarization. Furthermore, IFN-γ significantly increased the percentage of M1-polarized microglia expressing iNOS. Surprisingly, when these M1-polarized microglia were treated with either IL-6 or other anti-inflammatory cytokines, they returned to their non-polarized state, as demonstrated by significantly reduced expression of iNOS. Taken together, these results demonstrate differential responses of microglial cells to mediators present in dissimilar microenvironments.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Frequency-Dependent Action of Neuromodulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>In oscillatory circuits, some actions of neuromodulators depend on the oscillation frequency. However, the mechanisms are poorly understood. We explored this problem by characterizing neuromodulation of the lateral pyloric (LP) neuron of the crab stomatogastric ganglion (STG). Many peptide modulators, including proctolin, activate the same ionic current (<I>I</I><SUB>MI</SUB>) in STG neurons. Because <I>I</I><SUB>MI</SUB> is fast and non-inactivating, its peak level does not depend on the temporal properties of neuronal activity. We found, however, that the amplitude and peak time of the proctolin-activated current in LP is frequency dependent. Because frequency affects the rate of voltage change, we measured these currents with voltage ramps of different slopes and found that proctolin activated two kinetically distinct ionic currents: the known <I>I</I><SUB>MI</SUB>, whose amplitude is independent of ramp slope or direction, and an inactivating current (<I>I</I><SUB>MI-T</SUB>), which was only activated by positive ramps and whose amplitude increased with increasing ramp slope. Using a conductance-based model we found that <I>I</I><SUB>MI</SUB> and <I>I</I><SUB>MI-T</SUB> make distinct contributions to the bursting activity, with <I>I</I><SUB>MI</SUB> increasing the excitability, and <I>I</I><SUB>MI-T</SUB> regulating the burst onset by modifying the postinhibitory rebound in a frequency-dependent manner. The voltage dependence and partial calcium permeability of <I>I</I><SUB>MI-T</SUB> is similar to other characterized neuromodulator-activated currents in this system, suggesting that these are isoforms of the same channel. Our computational model suggests that calcium permeability may allow this current to also activate the large calcium-dependent potassium current in LP, providing an additional mechanism to regulate burst termination. These results demonstrate a mechanism for frequency-dependent actions of neuromodulators.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Molecular Detection of Sapovirus in Children Under Five Years with Acute Gastroenteritis in Mansoura, Egypt between January 2019 and February 2020 [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Sapovirus has emerged as a viral cause of acute gastroenteritis. However, there is limited data on sapovirus in Egypt. . The present study aimed to evaluate the presence of sapovirus in children with acute gastroenteritis <5 years in Mansoura, Egypt from January 2019 to February 2020 by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Methods: The cross-sectional study enrolled a 100 children <5 years who presented with acute gastroenteritis at an outpatient clinic in Mansoura, Egypt between January 2019 and February 2020. Clinical data, demographic data and a stool sample was collected from each child. Stools were screened by microscopy for parasites and culture methods for bacteria and excluded from the study if positive for either. Specimens were also screened for rotavirus by enzyme immune assays (EIA) and sapovirus by reverse transcription PCR. Results: The most frequently detected virus was rotavirus by ELISA 25% (25/100). RT-PCR detected sapovirus in 7% (7/100) of the stool samples. The children with sapovirus were all from rural regions and presented mainly during the winter season in Egypt 42.9% (3/7). The main presenting symptoms were fever 71.4% (5/7) and vomiting 57.1% (4/7). None of the children with sapovirus had dehydration. Rotavirus was significantly associated with sapovirus infections in  five samples (5/7) , 71.4%, P=0.01. Conclusion: The present study highlights the emergence of sapovirus as a frequent pathogen associated with acute gastroenteritis in children. There is a need for a national survey program for the study of sapovirus among other pathogens associated with acute gastroenteritis for better management of such infection.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Blood pressure and 10-year all-cause mortality: Findings from the PERU MIGRANT Study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The long-term impact of elevated blood pressure on mortality outcomes has been recently revisited due to proposed changes in cut-offs for hypertension. This study aimed at assessing the association between high blood pressure levels and 10-year mortality using the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-7) and the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) 2017 blood pressure guidelines. Methods Data analysis of the PERU MIGRANT Study, a prospective ongoing cohort, was used. The outcome of interest was 10-year all-cause mortality, and exposures were blood pressure categories according to the JNC-7 and ACC/AHA 2017 guidelines. Log-rank test, Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models were used to assess the associations of interest controlling for confounders. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated. Results A total of 976 records, mean age of 60.4 (SD: 11.4), 513 (52.6%) women, were analyzed. Hypertension prevalence at baseline almost doubled from 16.0% (95% CI 13.7%–18.4%) to 31.3% (95% CI 28.4%–34.3%), using the JNC-7 and ACC/AHA 2017 definitions, respectively. Sixty three (6.4%) participants died during the 10-year follow-up, equating to a mortality rate of 3.6 (95% CI 2.4–4.7) per 1000 person-years. Using JNC-7, and compared to those with normal blood pressure, those with pre-hypertension and hypertension had 2.1-fold and 5.1-fold increased risk of death, respectively. Similar mortality effect sizes were estimated using ACC/AHA 2017 for stage-1 and stage-2 hypertension. Conclusions Blood pressure levels under two different definitions increased the risk of 10-year all-cause mortality. Hypertension prevalence doubled using ACC/AHA 2017 compared to JNC-7. The choice of blood pressure cut-offs to classify hypertension categories need to be balanced against the patients benefit and the capacities of the health system to adequately handle a large proportion of new patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Psychological distress and quality of life following provision of vascular imaging results of the coronary and carotid arteries to asymptomatic adults: a scoping review protocol [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Non-invasive screening for atherosclerosis or asymptomatic cardiovascular disease of the coronary and carotid arteries is commonly undertaken, and research has been focussed on how results from these screenings lead to behaviour change. However, no review has focused on the effects of these results on psychological distress and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This protocol will outline how a scoping review will be conducted to map all available evidence on psychological distress and/or HRQoL outcomes following the provision of vascular imaging results of the coronary and carotid arteries. Methods: Arksey and O’Malley’s (2005) framework subsequently enhanced by Levac et al. (2010)  and Peters et al (2015, 2017) will guide the scoping review. Databases such as MEDLINE (Clarivate), APA PsychINFO, EMBASE, Social Work Abstracts, Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Collection, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) will be searched using MeSH terms  such as "Coronary stenosis", "Carotid Stenosis", "Psychological Distress" and "Quality of Life" and related terms. Two investigators will screen title and abstract and all articles meeting inclusion criteria will be extracted.  Data on authors, publication year, country of origin, aims/purpose, methodology, intervention, outcome measures as well as key findings that relate to the scoping review questions will be extracted for each included study. The findings will be presented using tables and thematic narrative synthesis. The scoping review will not produce a pooled estimate of the impact of vascular imaging results on psychological distress and HRQoL but will present information from the included studies related to psychological distress and HRQoL. Conclusion:  The review will highlight and address gaps in knowledge and provide direction for future investigations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Implementation challenges from a prospective, interventional biopsy-based study of Environmental Enteropathy in rural Pakistan [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                The Study of Environmental Enteropathy (EE) and Malnutrition in Pakistan (SEEM) is a community intervention trial designed to understand the pathophysiology of EE and its associated clinical phenotypes in children less than two years of age. Undernutrition is the underlying cause of three million deaths worldwide annually, accounting for 45% of all deaths among children under five years of age. Linear growth stunting affects a further 165 million, especially in low- and middle-income countries. In Pakistan,  an estimated one in three children are underweight and nearly half are stunted. This manuscript summarizes the challenges faced by the field team and the solutions employed for achieving our research objectives at the rural Matiari field site. Our study design involved a longitudinal collection of field data and biological samples which required constant engagement of field staff with the participating families. Challenges faced in SEEM included: 1) quality assurance parameters of anthropometry data; 2) 24-hour food recall data collection; 3) clinical management of sick enrolled children; 4) obtaining informed consent for upper gastrointestinal (UGI)endoscopy (an invasive procedure); and 5) biological sample collection (blood, urine, stool) from enrolled children. We enrolled 350 malnourished children(Weight for Height Z (WHZ) score <-2) and 50 well-nourished children(WHZ score ≥ 0 and height-for-age Z (HAZ) score ≥ -1)   with more than 95% success rate of collecting blood, urine and stool specimens. We collected 72% microbiome stool samples within 30 minutes of the child passing stool. We conducted a UGI biopsy in 63 children.   Solutions to these challenges included good project governance, the establishment of credibility, and the development of a longitudinal bidirectional relationship embedded in trust and effective communication with the caretakers of the enrolled children.     Continuous monitoring, regular training of staff, and effective teamwork were key factors that led to the successful execution of our study.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Deciphering the molecular mechanism of the cancer formation by chromosome structural dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xiakun Chu, Jin Wang</p>

Cancer reflects the dysregulation of the underlying gene network, which is strongly related to the 3D genome organization. Numerous efforts have been spent on experimental characterizations of the structural alterations in cancer genomes. However, there is still a lack of genomic structural-level understanding of the temporal dynamics for cancer initiation and progression. Here, we use a landscape-switching model to investigate the chromosome structural transition during the cancerization and reversion processes. We find that the chromosome undergoes a non-monotonic structural shape-changing pathway with initial expansion followed by compaction during both of these processes. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the chromosome with a more expanding structure than those at both the normal and cancer cell during cancerization exhibits a sparse contact pattern, which shows significant structural similarity to the one at the embryonic stem cell in many aspects, including the trend of contact probability declining with the genomic distance, the global structural shape geometry and the spatial distribution of loci on the chromosome. In light of the intimate structure-function relationship at the chromosomal level, we further describe the cell state transition processes by the chromosome structural changes, suggesting an elevated cell stemness during the formation of the cancer cells. We show that cell cancerization and reversion are highly irreversible processes in terms of the chromosome structural transition pathways, spatial repositioning of chromosomal loci and hysteresis loop of contact evolution analysis. Our model draws a molecular-scale picture of cell cancerization from the chromosome structural perspective. The process contains initial reprogramming towards the stem cell followed by the differentiation towards the cancer cell, accompanied by an initial increase and subsequent decrease of the cell stemness.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Neural network features distinguish chemosensory stimuli in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Javier J. How, Saket Navlakha, Sreekanth H. Chalasani</p>

Nervous systems extract and process information from the environment to alter animal behavior and physiology. Despite progress in understanding how different stimuli are represented by changes in neuronal activity, less is known about how they affect broader neural network properties. We developed a framework for using graph-theoretic features of neural network activity to predict ecologically relevant stimulus properties, in particular stimulus identity. We used the transparent nematode, <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, with its small nervous system to define neural network features associated with various chemosensory stimuli. We first immobilized animals using a microfluidic device and exposed their noses to chemical stimuli while monitoring changes in neural activity of more than 50 neurons in the head region. We found that graph-theoretic features, which capture patterns of interactions between neurons, are modulated by stimulus identity. Further, we show that a simple machine learning classifier trained using graph-theoretic features alone, or in combination with neural activity features, can accurately predict salt stimulus. Moreover, by focusing on putative causal interactions between neurons, the graph-theoretic features were almost twice as predictive as the neural activity features. These results reveal that stimulus identity modulates the broad, network-level organization of the nervous system, and that graph theory can be used to characterize these changes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Repeated measures ASCA+ for analysis of longitudinal intervention studies with multivariate outcome data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Torfinn S. Madssen, Guro F. Giskeødegård, Age K. Smilde, Johan A. Westerhuis</p>

Longitudinal intervention studies with repeated measurements over time are an important type of experimental design in biomedical research. Due to the advent of “omics”-sciences (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics), longitudinal studies generate increasingly multivariate outcome data. Analysis of such data must take both the longitudinal intervention structure and multivariate nature of the data into account. The ASCA+-framework combines general linear models with principal component analysis and can be used to separate and visualize the multivariate effect of different experimental factors. However, this methodology has not yet been developed for the more complex designs often found in longitudinal intervention studies, which may be unbalanced, involve randomized interventions, and have substantial missing data. Here we describe a new methodology, repeated measures ASCA+ (RM-ASCA+), and show how it can be used to model metabolic changes over time, and compare metabolic changes between groups, in both randomized and non-randomized intervention studies. Tools for both visualization and model validation are discussed. This approach can facilitate easier interpretation of data from longitudinal clinical trials with multivariate outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Neurocomputational mechanism of controllability inference under a multi-agent setting</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jaejoong Kim, Sang Wan Lee, Seokho Yoon, Haeorm Park, Bumseok Jeong</p>

Controllability perception significantly influences motivated behavior and emotion and requires an estimation of one’s influence on an environment. Previous studies have shown that an agent can infer controllability by observing contingency between one’s own action and outcome if there are no other outcome-relevant agents in an environment. However, if there are multiple agents who can influence the outcome, estimation of one’s genuine controllability requires exclusion of other agents’ possible influence. Here, we first investigated a computational and neural mechanism of controllability inference in a multi-agent setting. Our novel multi-agent Bayesian controllability inference model showed that other people’s action-outcome contingency information is integrated with one’s own action-outcome contingency to infer controllability, which can be explained as a Bayesian inference. Model-based functional MRI analyses showed that multi-agent Bayesian controllability inference recruits the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and striatum. Then, this inferred controllability information was leveraged to increase motivated behavior in the vmPFC. These results generalize the previously known role of the striatum and vmPFC in single-agent controllability to multi-agent controllability, and this generalized role requires the TPJ in addition to the striatum of single-agent controllability to integrate both self- and other-related information. Finally, we identified an innate positive bias toward the self during the multi-agent controllability inference, which facilitated behavioral adaptation under volatile controllability. Furthermore, low positive bias and high negative bias were associated with increased daily feelings of guilt. Our results provide a mechanism of how our sense of controllability fluctuates due to other people in our lives, which might be related to social learned helplessness and depression.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Approximate distance correlation for selecting highly interrelated genes across datasets</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Qunlun Shen, Shihua Zhang</p>

With the rapid accumulation of biological omics datasets, decoding the underlying relationships of cross-dataset genes becomes an important issue. Previous studies have attempted to identify differentially expressed genes across datasets. However, it is hard for them to detect interrelated ones. Moreover, existing correlation-based algorithms can only measure the relationship between genes within a single dataset or two multi-modal datasets from the same samples. It is still unclear how to quantify the strength of association of the same gene across two biological datasets with different samples. To this end, we propose Approximate Distance Correlation (ADC) to select interrelated genes with statistical significance across two different biological datasets. ADC first obtains the <i>k</i> most correlated genes for each target gene as its approximate observations, and then calculates the distance correlation (DC) for the target gene across two datasets. ADC repeats this process for all genes and then performs the Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment to control the false discovery rate. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ADC with simulation data and four real applications to select highly interrelated genes across two datasets. These four applications including 21 cancer RNA-seq datasets of different tissues; six single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) datasets of mouse hematopoietic cells across six different cell types along the hematopoietic cell lineage; five scRNA-seq datasets of pancreatic islet cells across five different technologies; coupled single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) and scRNA-seq data of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Extensive results demonstrate that ADC is a powerful tool to uncover interrelated genes with strong biological implications and is scalable to large-scale datasets. Moreover, the number of such genes can serve as a metric to measure the similarity between two datasets, which could characterize the relative difference of diverse cell types and technologies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Identifying prognostic pairwise relationships among bacterial species in microbiome studies</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sean M. Devlin, Axel Martin, Irina Ostrovnaya</p>

In recent literature, the human microbiome has been shown to have a major influence on human health. To investigate this impact, scientists study the composition and abundance of bacterial species, commonly using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, among patients with and without a disease or condition. Methods for such investigations to date have focused on the association between individual bacterium and an outcome, and higher-order pairwise relationships or interactions among bacteria are often avoided due to the substantial increase in dimension and the potential for spurious correlations. However, overlooking such relationships ignores the environment of the microbiome, where there is dynamic cooperation and competition among bacteria. We present a method for identifying and ranking pairs of bacteria that have a differential dichotomized relationship across outcomes. Our approach, implemented in an R package PairSeek, uses the stability selection framework with data-driven dichotomized forms of the pairwise relationships. We illustrate the properties of the proposed method using a published oral cancer data set and a simulation study.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Evolution of phenotypic fluctuation under host-parasite interactions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Naoto Nishiura, Kunihiko Kaneko</p>

Robustness and plasticity are essential features that allow biological systems to cope with complex and variable environments. In a constant environment, robustness, i.e., insensitivity of phenotypes, is expected to increase, whereas plasticity, i.e., the changeability of phenotypes, tends to diminish. Under a variable environment, existence of plasticity will be relevant. The robustness and plasticity, on the other hand, are related to phenotypic variances. As phenotypic variances decrease with the increase in robustness to perturbations, they are expected to decrease through the evolution. However, in nature, phenotypic fluctuation is preserved to a certain degree. One possible cause for this is environmental variation, where one of the most important “environmental” factors will be inter-species interactions. As a first step toward investigating phenotypic fluctuation in response to an inter-species interaction, we present the study of a simple two-species system that comprises hosts and parasites. Hosts are expected to evolve to achieve a phenotype that optimizes fitness. Then, the robustness of the corresponding phenotype will be increased by reducing phenotypic fluctuations. Conversely, plasticity tends to evolve to avoid certain phenotypes that are attacked by parasites. By using a dynamic model of gene expression for the host, we investigate the evolution of the genotype-phenotype map and of phenotypic variances. If the host–parasite interaction is weak, the fittest phenotype of the host evolves to reduce phenotypic variances. In contrast, if there exists a sufficient degree of interaction, the phenotypic variances of hosts increase to escape parasite attacks. For the latter case, we found two strategies: if the noise in the stochastic gene expression is below a certain threshold, the phenotypic variance increases via genetic diversification, whereas above this threshold, it is increased mediated by noise-induced phenotypic fluctuation. We examine how the increase in the phenotypic variances caused by parasite interactions influences the growth rate of a single host, and observed a trade-off between the two. Our results help elucidate the roles played by noise and genetic mutations in the evolution of phenotypic fluctuation and robustness in response to host–parasite interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Diversity, taxonomy, and evolution of archaeal viruses of the class Caudoviricetes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ying Liu, Tatiana A. Demina, Simon Roux, Pakorn Aiewsakun, Darius Kazlauskas, Peter Simmonds, David Prangishvili, Hanna M. Oksanen, Mart Krupovic</p>

The archaeal tailed viruses (arTV), evolutionarily related to tailed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) bacteriophages of the class Caudoviricetes, represent the most common isolates infecting halophilic archaea. Only a handful of these viruses have been genomically characterized, limiting our appreciation of their ecological impacts and evolution. Here, we present 37 new genomes of haloarchaeal tailed virus isolates, more than doubling the current number of sequenced arTVs. Analysis of all 63 available complete genomes of arTVs, which we propose to classify into 14 new families and 3 orders, suggests ancient divergence of archaeal and bacterial tailed viruses and points to an extensive sharing of genes involved in DNA metabolism and counter defense mechanisms, illuminating common strategies of virus–host interactions with tailed bacteriophages. Coupling of the comparative genomics with the host range analysis on a broad panel of haloarchaeal species uncovered 4 distinct groups of viral tail fiber adhesins controlling the host range expansion. The survey of metagenomes using viral hallmark genes suggests that the global architecture of the arTV community is shaped through recurrent transfers between different biomes, including hypersaline, marine, and anoxic environments.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Exploring bacterial diversity via a curated and searchable snapshot of archived DNA sequences</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Grace A. Blackwell, Martin Hunt, Kerri M. Malone, Leandro Lima, Gal Horesh, Blaise T. F. Alako, Nicholas R. Thomson, Zamin Iqbal</p>

The open sharing of genomic data provides an incredibly rich resource for the study of bacterial evolution and function and even anthropogenic activities such as the widespread use of antimicrobials. However, these data consist of genomes assembled with different tools and levels of quality checking, and of large volumes of completely unprocessed raw sequence data. In both cases, considerable computational effort is required before biological questions can be addressed. Here, we assembled and characterised 661,405 bacterial genomes retrieved from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) in November of 2018 using a uniform standardised approach. Of these, 311,006 did not previously have an assembly. We produced a searchable COmpact Bit-sliced Signature (COBS) index, facilitating the easy interrogation of the entire dataset for a specific sequence (e.g., gene, mutation, or plasmid). Additional MinHash and pp-sketch indices support genome-wide comparisons and estimations of genomic distance. Combined, this resource will allow data to be easily subset and searched, phylogenetic relationships between genomes to be quickly elucidated, and hypotheses rapidly generated and tested. We believe that this combination of uniform processing and variety of search/filter functionalities will make this a resource of very wide utility. In terms of diversity within the data, a breakdown of the 639,981 high-quality genomes emphasised the uneven species composition of the ENA/public databases, with just 20 of the total 2,336 species making up 90% of the genomes. The overrepresented species tend to be acute/common human pathogens, aligning with research priorities at different levels from individual interests to funding bodies and national and global public health agencies.

                Background - Data analytics can support the external auditors’ judgements. However, little is known about the external auditors’ data analytics competency. Likewise, role of religiosity in enhancing the external auditors’ performance is also inadequately investigated. This study examined: 1) the effects of data analytics competency on the external auditors’ performance, and 2) the moderating effects of religiosity on data analytics competency and external auditors’ performance relationship. Methods – Survey was conducted on 201 external auditors. Data analytics competency dimensions, namely, personal capabilities, professional expertise, technical skills, technologies and tools expertise were examined. Religiosity was measured by level and dimension (faith, virtue and optional). Results – Data analytics competency (personal capabilities) has a positive significant effect on the Muslim external auditors’ performance. However, data analytics competency does not affect the performance of non-Muslim external auditors. Level of religiosity has significant moderating effect on the relationship between data analytics competency (technologies and tools expertise) and Muslim external auditors’ performance. Nonetheless, level of religiosity does not moderate the relationship between data analytics competency and the performance of non-Muslim external auditors. Religiosity (virtue) has significant moderating effect on the relationship between data analytics competency (personal capabilities) and Muslim external auditors’ performance. Meanwhile, religiosity (faith) has significant moderating effect on the relationship between data analytics competency (technologies and tools expertise) and non-Muslim external auditors’ performance. Conclusion – This study demonstrates that data analytics competency and religiosity can influence the external auditors’ performance.

                The prevalence of Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV2) is increasing at an alarming rate in the world. Most of the HSV2 cases are not diagnosed properly, although a range of molecular and serological diagnoses exist. Herein, we have reported a very rapid detection method specific for HSV2 using real-time PCR. The primers specific for HSV2 were designed using the Primer-BLAST tool and 120 base pairs of the polymerase gene were amplified using real-time PCR with SYBR Green dye. The designed primer pair was found highly efficient in detecting only HSV2 DNA, but not HSV1. The threshold cycle (Ct) value for HSV2 reactions by designed primers was found to be an average of 22.55 for a standard copy number of viral DNA that may denote the efficiency of the primers. The melting temperature (Tm) of the amplicon using designed primers (82.60C) was also higher than that using reference primers (about 780C), indicating the high GC content of the amplified template. The designed primer pair will help clinicians to detect the HSV2 DNA specifically and diagnose the associated disease rapidly.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">KnowMore: an automated knowledge discovery tool for the FAIR SPARC datasets [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This manuscript provides the methods and outcomes of KnowMore, the Grand Prize winning automated knowledge discovery tool developed by our team during the 2021 NIH SPARC FAIR Data Codeathon. The National Institutes of Health Stimulating Peripheral Activity to Relieve Conditions (NIH SPARC) program generates rich datasets from neuromodulation researches, curated according to the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) SPARC data standards. Currently, the process of simultaneously comparing and analyzing multiple SPARC datasets is tedious because it requires investigating each dataset of interest individually and downloading all of them to conduct cross-analyses. It is crucial to enhance this process to enable rapid discoveries across SPARC datasets. Methods: To fill this need, we created KnowMore, a tool integrated into the SPARC Portal that only requires the user to select their datasets of interest to launch an automated discovery process. KnowMore uses several SPARC resources (Pennsieve, o²S²PARC, SciCrunch, protocols.io, Biolucida), data science methods, and machine learning algorithms in the back end to generate various visualizations in the front end intended to help the user identify potential similarities, differences, and relations across the datasets. These visualizations can lead to a new discovery, new hypothesis, or simply guide the user to the next logical step in their discovery process. Results: The outcome of this project is a SPARC portal-ready code architecture that helps researchers to use SPARC datasets more efficiently and fully leverages their FAIR characteristics. The tool has been built and documented such that more data analysis methods and visualization items could be easily added. Conclusions: The potential for automated discoveries from SPARC datasets is huge given the unique SPARC data ecosystem promoting FAIR data practices, and KnowMore has only demonstrated a small highlight of what could be achieved to speed up discoveries from SPARC datasets.

     alt="Morphology of P2X3-immunoreactive basket-like afferent nerve endings surrounding serosal ganglia and close relationship with vesicular nucleotide transporter-immunoreactive nerve fibers in the rat gastric antrum"/>
<p>We discovered P2X3-immunoreactive basket-like nerve endings surrounding serosal ganglia in the rat antral lesser curvature by immunohistochemistry of whole-mount preparations with confocal scanning laser microscopy. The nerve endings were derived from large web-like structures of vagal subserosal mechanoreceptors, and wrapped around the whole serosal ganglia with pleomorphic terminal structures. The nerve endings may be specialized ending structures of vagal mechanoreceptors to increase the sensitivity during antral peristalsis.
</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We previously reported P2X3 purinoceptor (P2X3)-expressing vagal afferent nerve endings with large web-like structures in the subserosal tissue of the antral lesser curvature, suggesting that these nerve endings were one of the vagal mechanoreceptors. The present study investigated the morphological relationship between P2X3-immunoreactive nerve endings and serosal ganglia in the rat gastric antrum by immunohistochemistry of whole-mount preparations using confocal scanning laser microscopy. P2X3-immunoreactive basket-like subserosal nerve endings with new morphology were distributed laterally to the gastric sling muscles in the distal antrum of the lesser curvature. Parent axons ramified into numerous nerve fibers with pleomorphic flattened structures to form basket-like nerve endings, and the parent axons were originated from large net-like structures of vagal afferent nerve endings. Basket-like nerve endings wrapped around the whole serosal ganglia, which were characterized by neurofilament 200 kDa-immunoreactive neurons with or without neuronal nitric oxide synthase immunoreactivity and S100B-immunoreactive glial cells. Furthermore, basket-like nerve endings were localized in close apposition to dopamine beta-hydroxylase-immunoreactive sympathetic nerve fibers immunoreactive for vesicular nucleotide transporter. These results suggest that P2X3-immunoreactive basket-like nerve endings associated with serosal ganglia are the specialized ending structures of vagal subserosal mechanoreceptors in order to increase the sensitivity during antral peristalsis, and are activated by ATP from sympathetic nerve fibers and/or serosal ganglia for the regulation of mechanoreceptor function.</p>

<p><i>Cataglyphis</i> desert ants show impressive navigation capabilities during foraging. The reproductive caste faces other orientation challenges. Here, we compare brain structures involved in spatial orientation of <i>Cataglyphis nodus</i> males (♂), gynes (♀), and foragers (☿) by quantifying relative neuropil volumes, synaptic architecture, and numbers and volumes of antennal lobe olfactory glomeruli. Adaptations at both the neuropil and synaptic levels clearly reflect differences in sex-specific and caste-specific demands for sensory processing and behavioral plasticity underlying spatial orientation.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><i>Cataglyphis</i> desert ants are charismatic central place foragers. After long-ranging foraging trips, individual workers navigate back to their nest relying mostly on visual cues. The reproductive caste faces other orientation challenges, i.e. mate finding and colony foundation. Here we compare brain structures involved in spatial orientation of <i>Cataglyphis nodus</i> males, gynes, and foragers by quantifying relative neuropil volumes associated with two visual pathways, and numbers and volumes of antennal lobe (AL) olfactory glomeruli. Furthermore, we determined absolute numbers of synaptic complexes in visual and olfactory regions of the mushroom bodies (MB) and a major relay station of the sky-compass pathway to the central complex (CX). Both female castes possess enlarged brain centers for sensory integration, learning, and memory, reflected in voluminous MBs containing about twice the numbers of synaptic complexes compared with males. Overall, male brains are smaller compared with both female castes, but the relative volumes of the optic lobes and CX are enlarged indicating the importance of visual guidance during innate behaviors. Male ALs contain greatly enlarged glomeruli, presumably involved in sex-pheromone detection. Adaptations at both the neuropil and synaptic levels clearly reflect differences in sex-specific and caste-specific demands for sensory processing and behavioral plasticity underlying spatial orientation.</p>

     alt="Single axonal morphology reveals high heterogeneity in spinocerebellar axons originating from the lumbar spinal cord in the mouse"/>
<p>The authors reconstructed 26 single lumbar spinocerebellar axons in mice and mapped axon terminals with zebrin pattern of the cerebellar cortex. The lumbar spinocerebellar axons showed high variations in the pathway patterns (contralateral vs. ipsilateral, dorsal vs. ventral in the spinal cord, medullary vs. pontine in the cerebellar entry), branching, and termination (mainly in cerebellar lobules II, III–V, VIII–IXa–b, cerebellar nuclei, CN, nucleus X, NX, lateral reticular nucleus, LRN). The axons were classified into three major groups (magenta, orange, and green), confirming the conventional main types of the lumbar spinocerebellar projections to an extent. However, the results also indicated highly heterogeneous axonal populations beyond these groups.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Among the spinocerebellar projections vital for sensorimotor coordination of limbs and the trunk, the morphology of spinocerebellar axons originating from the lumbar cord has not been well characterized compared to those from thoracic and sacral cords. We reconstructed 26 single spinocerebellar axons labeled by biotinylated dextran injections into the gray matter of the lumbar spinal cord in mice. Axon terminals were mapped with the zebrin pattern of the cerebellar cortex. Reconstructed axons were primarily classified into ipsilaterally and contralaterally ascending axons, arising mainly from the dorsal and ventral horns, respectively. The majority of ipsilateral and contralateral axons took the dorsal-medullary and ventral-pontine pathways, respectively. The axons of both groups terminated mainly in the vermal and medial paravermal areas of lobules II–V and VIII–IXa, often bilaterally but predominantly ipsilateral to the axonal origin, with a weak preference to particular portions of zebrin stripes. The ipsilateral axons originating from the medial dorsal horn in the upper lumbar cord (<i>n</i> = 3) had abundant (43–147) mossy fiber terminals and no medullary collaterals. The ipsilateral axons originating from the lateral dorsal horn in the lower lumbar cord (<i>n</i> = 9) and the contralateral axons (<i>n</i> = 14) showed remarkable morphology variations. The number of their mossy fiber terminals varied from 2 to 172. Their collaterals, observed in 17 axons out of 23, terminated mainly in the medial cerebellar nucleus, nucleus X, and lateral reticular nucleus in various degrees. The results indicated that the lumbar spinocerebellar projection contains highly heterogeneous axonal populations regarding their pathway, branching, and termination patterns.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><i>Proa valdearinnoensis</i> is a relatively large-headed and stocky iguanodontian dinosaur from the latest Early Cretaceous of Spain. Its braincase is known from three specimens. Similar to that of other dinosaurs, it shows a mosaic ossification pattern in which most of the bones seem to have fused together indistinguishably while a few (frontoparietal, basioccipital) might have remained loosely attached. The endocasts of the three specimens are described based on CT data and digital reconstructions. They show unmistakable morphological similarities with the endocast of closely related taxa, such as <i>Sirindhorna khoratensis</i> (which is close in age but from Thailand). This supports a high conservatism of the endocranial cavity. The issue of volumetric correspondence between endocranial cavity and brain in dinosaurs is analyzed. Although a brain-to-endocranial cavity (BEC) index of 0.50 has been traditionally used, we employ instead 0.73. This is indeed the mid-value between the situation in adults of <i>Alligator mississippiensis</i> and <i>Gallus gallus</i>, which are members of the extant bracketing taxa of dinosaurs (Crocodilia and Aves). We thence gauge the level of encephalization of <i>P. valdearinnoensis</i> through the calculation of the encephalization quotient (EQ), which remains valuable as a metric for assessing the degree of cognitive function in extinct taxa, especially those with fully ossified braincases like dinosaurs and other archosaurs. The EQ obtained for <i>P. valdearinnoensis</i> (3.611) suggests that this species was significantly more encephalized than most if not all extant nonavian, nonmammalian amniotes. Our work adds to the growing body of data concerning theoretical cognitive capabilities in dinosaurs and supports the idea that an increasing encephalization was fostered not only in theropods but also in parallel in the shorter-lived lineage of ornithopods. <i>P. valdearinnoensis</i> was ill-equipped to respond to theropod dinosaurs and possibly lived in groups as a strategy to mitigate the risk of being predated upon. We hypothesize that group-living and protracted caring of juveniles in this and possibly many other iguanodontian ornithopods favored a degree of encephalization that was outstanding by reptile standards.</p>

     alt="A schizophrenia risk factor induces marked anatomical deficits at GABAergic-dopaminergic synapses in the rat ventral tegmental area: Essential evidence for new targeted therapies"/>
<p><i>Hypothesis</i>: Synaptic changes occur within a midbrain GABA-dopamine circuit of male rat offspring exposed to maternal immune activation (MIA), a schizophrenia risk factor. <i>Outcomes</i>: In the offspring of MIA dams, markedly smaller inhibitory synapses were observed for non-triadic (classic) and newly discovered triadic synapses. These changes could contribute to well-documented striatal hyperdopaminergia. The findings provide a new therapeutic target.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>To develop new therapies for schizophrenia, evidence accumulated over decades highlights the essential need to investigate the GABAergic synapses that presynaptically influence midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Since current technology restricts these studies to animals, and evidence accumulated in recent decades indicates a developmental origin of schizophrenia, we investigated synaptic changes in male rat offspring exposed to maternal immune activation (MIA), a schizophrenia risk factor. Using a novel combination of lentiviruses, peroxidase-immunogold double labeling, three-dimensional serial section transmission electron microscopy and stereology, we observed clear anatomical alterations in synaptic inputs on dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain posterior ventral tegmental area (pVTA). These changes relate directly to a characteristic feature of schizophrenia: increased dopamine release. In 3-month-old and 14-month-old MIA rats, we found a marked decrease in the volume of presynaptic GABAergic terminals from the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) and in the length of the synapses they made, when innervating pVTA dopaminergic neurons. In MIA rats in the long-term, we also discovered a decrease in the volume of the postsynaptic density (PSD) and in the maximum thickness of the PSD at the same synapses. These marked deficits were evident in conventional GABA-dopamine synapses and in synaptic triads that we discovered involving asymmetric synapses that innervated RMTg GABAergic presynaptic terminals, which in turn innervated pVTA dopaminergic neurons. In triads, the PSD thickness of asymmetric synapses was significantly decreased in MIA rats in the long-term cohort. The extensive anatomical deficits provide a potential basis for new therapies targeted at synaptic inputs on midbrain pVTA dopaminergic neurons, in contrast to current striatum-targeted antipsychotic drugs.</p>

     alt="Identification and characterization of rostral ventromedial medulla neurons synaptically connected to the urinary bladder afferents in female rats with or without neonatal cystitis"/>
<p>Talluri et al identified and characterized rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) neurons that are synaptically linked to the bladder and the colon and studied the effect of early life bladder inflammation on molecular expressions of these neurons. They demonstrated alterations of synaptic connectivity and GABAergic/serotonergic expressions in bladder-related RVM neurons in rats with neonatal cystitis.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The neurons in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) play a major role in pain modulation. We have previously shown that early-life noxious bladder stimuli in rats resulted in an overall spinal GABAergic disinhibition and a long-lasting bladder/colon sensitization when tested in adulthood. However, the neuromolecular alterations within RVM neurons in the pathophysiology of early life bladder inflammation have not been elucidated. In this study, we have identified and characterized RVM neurons that are synaptically linked to the bladder and colon and examined the effect of neonatal bladder inflammation on molecular expressions of these neurons. A transient bladder inflammation was induced by intravesicular instillation of protamine sulfate and zymosan during postnatal days 14 through 16 (P14–16) followed by pseudorabies virus PRV-152 and PRV-614 injections into the bladder and colon, respectively, on postnatal day P60. Tissues were examined 96 h postinoculation for serotonergic, GABAergic, and enkephalinergic expressions using in situ hybridization and/or immunohistochemistry techniques. The results revealed that &gt; 50% of RVM neurons that are synaptically connected to the bladder (i.e., PRV-152+) were GABAergic, 40% enkephalinergic, and about 14% expressing serotonergic marker tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TpH2). Neonatal cystitis resulted in a significant increase in converging neurons in RVM receiving dual synaptic inputs from the bladder and colon. In addition, neonatal cystitis significantly downregulated vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) with a concomitant increase in TpH2 expression in bladder-linked RVM neurons, suggesting an alteration in supraspinal signaling. These alterations of synaptic connectivity and GABAergic/serotonergic expressions in RVM neurons may contribute to bladder pain modulation and cross-organ visceral sensitivity.</p>

They show that depletion of TIAM1 or RAC1 inhibition leads to SCLC cell apoptosis through cytoplasmic translocation of the orphan nuclear receptor Nur77 and pro-apoptotic BCL2 conformational change.

                Carter et al. show that mice lacking the mitochondrial sulfide oxidation pathway enzyme TST have high systemic sulfide levels that invoke an alternative hepatic sulfide disposal strategy. Consequently, hepatic metabolism is dominantly skewed toward a diabetogenic profile despite peripheral insulin sensitization. This has implications for sulfide donor therapeutic agents.

                Yang et al. find that the mechanical force exerted by a bolus passing across the fly pharynx is detected by multisensory neurons and is relayed, together with gustatory information, to IN1 neurons in the brain. This circuit activates MIP neuropeptidergic neurons to control feeding.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/inpress.rss">Contribution of autophagy machinery factors to HCV and SARS-CoV-2 replication organelle formation</a></h4>

              
                Twu et al. investigate involvement of autophagy machinery components in HCV and SARS-CoV-2 replication. Conventional macroautophagy is dispensable for replication of either virus. However, factors involved in autophagosome biogenesis, including components of class III PI3-kinase complex, contribute to viral replication. Most likely they promote membranous replication organelle formation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Stage-specific control of oligodendrocyte survival and morphogenesis by TDP-43</a></h4>

              
                Generation of oligodendrocytes in the adult brain enables both adaptive changes in neural circuits and regeneration of myelin sheaths destroyed by injury, disease, and normal aging. This transformation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) into myelinating oligodendrocytes requires processing of distinct mRNAs at different stages of cell maturation. Although mislocalization and aggregation of the RNA binding protein TDP-43 occur in both neurons and glia in neurodegenerative diseases, the consequences of TDP-43 loss within different stages of the oligodendrocyte lineage are not well understood. By performing stage-specific genetic inactivation of Tardbp in vivo, we show that oligodendrocyte lineage cells are differentially sensitive to loss of TDP-43. While OPCs depend on TDP-43 for survival, with conditional deletion resulting in cascading cell loss followed by rapid regeneration to restore their density, oligodendrocytes become less sensitive to TDP-43 depletion as they mature. Deletion of TDP-43 early in the maturation process led to eventual oligodendrocyte degeneration, seizures and premature lethality, while oligodendrocytes that experienced late deletion survived and mice exhibited a normal lifespan. At both stages, TDP-43 deficient oligodendrocytes formed fewer and thinner myelin sheaths and extended new processes that inappropriately wrapped neuronal somata and blood vessels. Transcriptional analysis revealed that in the absence of TDP-43, key proteins involved in oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination were misspliced leading to aberrant incorporation of cryptic exons. Inducible deletion of TDP-43 from oligodendrocytes in the adult CNS induced the same progressive morphological changes and mice acquired profound hindlimb weakness, suggesting that loss of TDP-43 function in oligodendrocytes may contribute to neuronal dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Context-dependent inversion of the response in a single sensory neuron type reverses olfactory preference behavior</a></h4>

              
                The valence and salience of individual odorants are modulated by an animals innate preferences, learned associations, and internal state, as well as by the context of odorant presentation. The mechanisms underlying context-dependent flexibility in odor valence are not fully understood. Here we show that the behavioral response of C. elegans to bacterially-produced medium-chain alcohols switches from attraction to avoidance when presented in the background of a subset of additional attractive chemicals. This context-dependent reversal of odorant preference is driven by cell-autonomous inversion of the response to alcohols in the single AWC olfactory neuron pair. We find that while medium-chain alcohols inhibit the AWC olfactory neurons to drive attraction, these alcohols instead activate AWC to promote avoidance when presented in the background of a second AWC-sensed odorant. We show that these opposing responses are driven via engagement of different odorant-directed signal transduction pathways within AWC. Our results indicate that context-dependent recruitment of alternative intracellular signaling pathways within a single sensory neuron type conveys opposite hedonic valences, thereby providing a robust mechanism for odorant encoding and discrimination at the periphery.

                The S209F variant of Abelson Interactor Protein 3 (ABI3) increases risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but little is known about ABI3 function. RNAscope showed Abi3 is expressed in microglial and non-microglial cells, though its increased expression appears to be driven in plaque-associated microglia. Here, we evaluated Abi3-/- mice and document that both Abi3 and its overlapping gene, Gngt2, are disrupted in these mice. Expression of Abi3 and Gngt2 are tightly correlated, and elevated, in rodent models of AD. RNA-seq of the Abi3-Gngt2-/- mice revealed robust induction of an AD-associated neurodegenerative signature, including upregulation of Trem2, Plcg2 and Tyrobp. In APP mice, loss of Abi3-Gngt2 resulted in a gene dose- and age-dependent reduction in A? deposition. Additionally, in Abi3-Gngt2-/- mice, expression of a pro-aggregant form of human tau exacerbated tauopathy and astrocytosis. Further, the AD-associated S209F mutation alters the extent of ABI3 phosphorylation. These data provide an important experimental framework for understanding the role of Abi3-Gngt2 function in AD. Our studies also demonstrate that manipulation of glial function could have opposing effects on amyloid and tau pathology, highlighting the unpredictability of targeting such pathways in AD.

	<p>The diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) is challenging in the acute setting because the symptoms are nonspecific and often transient, or they develop with a delay. In these cases, the criteria for acute head imaging are frequently not fulfilled. This may lead to missed diagnoses in emergency care. There is a need for developing a rapid diagnostic test to verify the presence of TBI using body fluids. Blood, urine, and saliva samples from 11 adult patients (mean age 64 years, SD 24 years) with acute and clinically diagnosed TBI, and 12 healthy volunteers were collected at Turku University Hospital during a period of 5 months. The injuries necessitated hospitalization for at least one day. The TBIs were classified mild in nine cases and severe in two cases. The mean period between the trauma and the time for obtaining the samples was 27 h, SD 11 h. The samples were analyzed in an ISO-certified laboratory for the number of lectin-bound glycan molecules indicating destruction of nerve tissue. The screening was performed on several possible glycans for binding, and the measurement by degree of fluorescence. In the analysis, the group of patients with TBI was compared with healthy volunteers. The results showed a significant decrease (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05, Wilcoxon rank–sum two-sided test) in the level of two glycans in plasma, but no significant increase for any glycan; in saliva, one glycan showed a significant increase in the TBI group; in urine, three glycans were significantly different between the groups (one showed an increase, whereas two showed a decrease). The results support the idea of conducting more research on how diagnostic glycans could be detected in body fluids after TBI. As a proof-of-concept, significant changes in the concentration of five glycans were found in plasma, saliva, and urine between TBI patients and healthy controls. This may enable the development of a rapid body fluid-based point-of-care test to identify patients with TBI after a head injury.</p>

	<p>Even on pain free days, recurrent neck pain alters sensorimotor integration (SMI) measured via somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs). Neck muscle fatigue decreases upper limb proprioception, and thus may interfere with upper limb motor task acquisition and SMI. This study aimed to determine the effect of cervical extensor muscle (CEM) fatigue on upper limb motor acquisition and retention; and SMI, measured via early SEPs. Twenty-four healthy right-handed individuals were randomly assigned to control or CEM fatigue. Baseline SEPs were elicited via median nerve stimulation at the wrist. Participants then lay prone on a padded table. The fatigue group supported a 2 kg weight until they could no longer maintain the position. The control group rested their neck in neutral for 5 min. Participants completed pre- and post-motor skill acquisition while seated, SEPs were again collected. Task retention was measured 24 h later. Accuracy improved post acquisition and at retention for both groups (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), with controls outperforming the fatigue group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05).

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The imbalance between glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) results in the loss of synaptic strength leading to neurodegeneration. The dogma on the field considered neurons as the main players in this excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance. However, current strategies focusing only on neurons have failed to completely understand this condition, bringing up the importance of glia as an alternative modulator for neuroinflammation as glia alter the activity of neurons and is a source of both neurotrophic and neurotoxic factors. This review's primary goal is to illustrate the role of glia over E/I balance in the central nervous system and its interaction with neurons. Rather than focusing only on the neuronal targets, we take a deeper look at glial receptors and proteins that could also be explored as drug targets, as they are early responders to neurotoxic insults. This review summarizes the neuron–glia interaction concerning GABA and glutamate, possible targets, and its involvement in the E/I imbalance in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">A Model of the CA1 Field Rhythms</a></h4>

              
                <p>We propose a model of the main rhythms in the hippocampal CA1 field: theta rhythm; slow, middle, and fast gamma rhythms; and ripple oscillations. We have based this on data obtained from animals behaving freely. We have considered the modes of neuronal discharges and the occurrence of local field potential oscillations in the theta and non-theta states at different inputs from the CA3 field, the medial entorhinal cortex, and the medial septum. In our work, we tried to reproduce the main experimental phenomena about rhythms in the CA1 field: the coupling of neurons to the phase of rhythms, cross-rhythm phase&ndash;phase coupling, and phase&ndash;amplitude coupling. Using computational experiments, we have proved the hypothesis that the descending phase of the theta rhythm in the CA1 field is formed by the input from the CA3 field via the Shaffer collaterals, and the ascending phase of the theta rhythm is formed by the IPSPs from CCK basket cells. The slow gamma rhythm is coupled to the descending phase of the theta rhythm, since it also depends on the arrival of the signal via the Shaffer collaterals. The middle gamma rhythm is formed by the EPSPs of the principal neurons of the third layer of the entorhinal cortex, corresponds to experimental data. We were able to unite in a single mathematical model several theoretical ideas about the mechanisms of rhythmic processes in the CA1 field of the hippocampus.</p>

                Background: Employees are increasingly being recognised as a valuable source of information, especially in knowledge-based businesses.

Hence, employee turnover should be considered an essential part of human resource management. Furthermore, employees’ trust in management and human resource (HR) practices substantially impact organisational commitment (OC). Thus, anticipating employee commitment and turnover intentions is crucial, as people are the sole source for knowledge-based firms to maintain their competitive advantage. In the context of selected Tehran Renewable Energy (RE) firms, this study investigated the mediating impact of OC on the relationship between HR practices (recruitment and selection; training and development opportunities; performance appraisal and evaluation; teamwork; compensation and pay; and job security) and employee turnover intention. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study in Tehran that involved 90 experts and knowledgeable employees from four of Tehran's top RE businesses. A questionnaire was distributed to collect data which was later analysed with correlation, regression and bootstrapping analyses. Results: All six dimensions of HR practices were discovered to have an indirect impact on turnover intention and a direct impact on OC. OC among employees has an indirect effect on turnover intention. It was also revealed that the training and development opportunity has the most considerable effect on OC and turnover intention. OC was not found as a mediator between HR practices and turnover intention. Conclusions: The outcomes of this study showed that both training and development opportunities; and pay and compensation structure were found to be two significant components of HR practices in the relationship with OC. RE managers should employ appropriate HR strategies, particularly in these two dimensions, to improve an individual's degree of OC and reduce turnover intention.

                Background: Photodynamic therapy activity against different biological systems has been reported for porphyrins. Porphyrin modifications through peripheral groups and/or by metal insertion inside the ring are main alternatives for the improvement of its photo-physical properties. In this study, we synthesized and characterized 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-bromophenyl)porphyrin and the dicloro-5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-bromophenyl)porphyrinato Sn(IV). Methods: Metal-free porphyrin was synthesized using the Alder method, while the Sn(IV)-porphyrin complex was prepared by combining metal-free porphyrin with stannous chloride in DMF; the reaction yields were 47% and 64% respectively. Metal-free porphyrin was characterized by UV-Vis, FT-IR, ESI-mass spectrometry and 13C-NMR. Additionally, the Sn(IV) -porphyrin complex was characterized using UV-Vis and FT-IR. Cyclic voltammetry tests in four different solvents. The fluorescence quantum yield (Φf) was measured using fluorescein as a standard, the singlet oxygen quantum yield (ΦD) was estimated using the standard 5,10,15,20-(tetraphenyl)porphyrin (H2TPP) and the quencher of singlet oxygen 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF). Results: UV-Vis assay showed typical Q and Soret bands for porphyrin and its metallo-porphyrin complex. Compounds showed photoluminescence at the visible range of electromagnetic spectrum. The inclusion of the metal in the porphyrin core changed the Φf from 0.15 to 0.05 and the ΦD increased from 0.55 to 0.59. Finally, the effect of the compounds on the viability of L. panamensis was evaluated by means of the MTT test. The results showed that both compounds decreased the viability of the parasite; this inhibitory activity was greater under light irradiation; the porphyrin compound had IC50 of 16.5 μM and the Sn(IV)-porphyrin complex had IC50 of 19.2 μM. Conclusion: The compounds were synthesized efficiently, their characterization was carried out by different spectroscopy techniques and their own signals were evidenced for both structures, both compounds decreased the cell viability of L. panamensis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">ELIXIR and Toxicology: a community in development [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Toxicology has been an active research field for many decades, with academic, industrial and government involvement. Modern omics and computational approaches are changing the field, from merely disease-specific observational models into target-specific predictive models. Traditionally, toxicology has strong links with other fields such as biology, chemistry, pharmacology and medicine. With the rise of synthetic and new engineered materials, alongside ongoing prioritisation needs in chemical risk assessment for existing chemicals, early predictive evaluations are becoming of utmost importance to both scientific and regulatory purposes. ELIXIR is an intergovernmental organisation that brings together life science resources from across Europe. To coordinate the linkage of various life science efforts around modern predictive toxicology, the establishment of a new ELIXIR Community is seen as instrumental. In the past few years, joint efforts, building on incidental overlap, have been piloted in the context of ELIXIR. For example, the EU-ToxRisk, diXa, HeCaToS, transQST, and the nanotoxicology community have worked with the ELIXIR TeSS, Bioschemas, and Compute Platforms and activities. In 2018, a core group of interested parties wrote a proposal, outlining a sketch of what this new ELIXIR Toxicology Community would look like. A recent workshop (held September 30th to October 1st, 2020) extended this into an ELIXIR Toxicology roadmap and a shortlist of limited investment-high gain collaborations to give body to this new community. This Whitepaper outlines the results of these efforts and defines our vision of the ELIXIR Toxicology Community and how it complements other ELIXIR activities.

                Background: Biochar is a promising material in mitigating greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions from paddy fields due to its remarkable structural properties. Rice husk biochar (RhB) and melaleuca biochar (MB) are amendment materials that could be used to potentially reduce emissions in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD). However, their effects on CH4 and N2O emissions and soil under local water management and conventional rice cultivation have not been thoroughly investigated. Methods: We conducted a field experiment using biochar additions to the topsoil layer (0-20 cm). Five treatments comprising 0 t ha-1 (CT0); 5 t ha-1 (RhB5) and 10 t ha-1 (RhB10), and 5 t ha-1 (MB5) and 10 t ha-1 (MB10) were designed plot-by-plot (20 m2) in triplicates. Results: The results showed that biochar application from 5 to 10 t ha-1 significantly decreased cumulative CH4 (24.2 – 28.0%, RhB; 22.0 – 14.1%, MB) and N2O (25.6 – 41.0%, RhB; 38.4 – 56.4%, MB) fluxes without a reduction in grain yield. Increasing the biochar application rate further did not decrease significantly total CH4 and N2O fluxes but was seen to significantly reduce the global warming potential (GWP) and yield-scale GWP in the RhB treatments. Biochar application improved soil Eh but had no effects on soil pH. Whereas CH4 flux correlated negatively with soil Eh (P < 0.001; r2 = 0.552, RhB; P < 0.001; r2 = 0.502, MB). The soil physicochemical properties of bulk density, porosity, organic matter, and anaerobically mineralized N were significantly improved in biochar-amended treatments, while available P also slightly increased. Conclusions: Biochar supplementation significantly reduced CH4 and N2O fluxes and improved soil mineralization and physiochemical properties toward beneficial for rice plant. The results suggest that the optimal combination of biochar-application rates and effective water-irrigation techniques for soil types in the MD should be further studied in future works.

                We describe a web and standalone Shiny app for calculating the common, linear within-individual association for repeated assessments of paired measures with multiple individuals: repeated measures correlation (rmcorr). This tool makes rmcorr more widely accessible, providing a graphical interface for performing and visualizing the output of analysis with rmcorr. In contrast to rmcorr, most widely used correlation techniques assume paired data are independent. Incorrectly analyzing repeated measures data as independent will likely produce misleading results. Using aggregation or separate models to address the issue of independence may obscure meaningful patterns and will also tend to reduce statistical power. rmcorrShiny (repeated measures correlation Shiny) provides a simple and accessible solution for computing the repeated measures correlation. It is available at: https://lmarusich.shinyapps.io/shiny_rmcorr/.

                Background: A recent bioinformatics technique involves changing nucleotide sequences into 2D speckles. This technique produces speckles called GB-speckles (Gene Based speckles). All classical strategies of speckle-optics, namely speckle-interferometry, subtraction of speckle-images as well as speckle-correlometry have been inferred for processing of GB-speckles. This indicates the considerable improvement in the present tools of bioinformatics.   Methods: Colour s-LASCA imaging of virtual laser GB-speckles, a new method of high discrimination and typing of pathogenic viruses, has been developed. This method has been adapted to the detecting of natural mutations in nucleotide sequences, related to the spike glycoprotein (coding the gene «S») of SARS–CoV-2 gene as the molecular target.    Results: The rate of the colouring images of virtual laser GB-speckles generated by s-LASCA can be described by the specific value of R. If the nucleotide sequences compared utilizing this approach the relevant images are completely identical, then the three components of the resulting colour image will be identical, and therefore the value of R will be equal to zero. However, if there are at least minimal differences in the matched nucleotide sequences, then the value of R will be positive.    Conclusion: The high effectiveness of an application of the colour images of GB-speckles that were generated by s-LASCA- has been demonstrated for discrimination between different variants of the SARS–CoV-2 spike glycoprotein gene.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">An active human role is essential in big data-led decisions and data-intensive science [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Big data is transforming many sectors, with far-reaching consequences to how decisions are made and how knowledge is produced and shared. In the current move toward more data-led decisions and data-intensive science, we aim here to examine three issues that are changing the way data are read and used. First, there is a shift toward paradigms that involve a large amount of data. In such paradigms, the creation of complex data-led models becomes tractable and appealing to generate predictions and explanations. This necessitates for instance a rethinking of Occam's razor principle in the context of knowledge discovery. Second, there is a growing erosion of the human role in decision making and knowledge discovery processes. Human users’ involvement is decreasing at an alarming rate, with no say on how to read, process, and summarize data. This makes legal responsibility and accountability hard to define. Third, thanks to its increasing popularity, big data is gaining a seductive allure, where volume and complexity of big data can de facto confer more persuasion and significance to knowledge or decisions that result from big-data-based processes. These issues call for an active human role by creating opportunities to incorporate, in the most unbiased way, human expertise and prior knowledge in decision making and knowledge production. This also requires putting in place robust monitoring and appraisal mechanisms to ensure that relevant data is answering the right questions. As the proliferation of data continues to grow, we need to rethink the way we interact with data to serve human needs.

In this paper, we argue that such funding systems incentivize and even force researchers to violate five moral values, each of which is central to commonly used scientific codes of conduct. Our argument complements existing epistemic arguments against peer-review project funding systems and, accordingly, strengthens the mounting calls for reform of these systems.

                In molecular cell biology, reporter assays are frequently used to investigate gene expression levels. Reporter assays employ a gene that encodes a light-emitting protein, of which the luminescence is quantified as a proxy of gene expression. Commercial parties provide reporter assay kits that include protocols and specialized detection machinery. However, downstream analysis of the output data and their presentation are not standardized. We have developed plotXpress to fill this gap, providing a free, open-source platform for the semi-automated analysis and standardized visualisation of experimental gene reporter data. Users can upload raw luminescence data acquired from a reporter gene assay with an internal control. In plotXpress, the data is corrected for sample variation with the internal control and the average for each condition is calculated. When a reference condition is selected the fold change is calculated for all other conditions, based on the selected reference. The results are shown as dot plots with a statistical summary, which can be adjusted to create publication-grade plots without requiring coding skills. Altogether, plotXpress is an open-source, low-threshold, web-based tool, that promotes a standardized and reproducible analysis while providing an appealing visualization of reporter data. The webtool can be accessed at: https://huygens.science.uva.nl/PlotXpress/

                Background: In Indonesia, maternal health care services are widely available, aiming to improve health and survival among mothers. However, these services remain underutilised, and its determining factor was unknown. This study sought to identify determinant factors of maternal healthcare services utilisation among Indonesian mothers. Methods: This population-based cross-sectional study leveraged the 2017 Indonesia Demographic and Health Survey data. A total of 12,033 mothers aged from 15 to 49 years who had a live birth in the five years preceding the survey were included in the analysis. Multivariable logistic regressions were used to identify the determinant factors. Results: Approximately 93.44% of the mothers had adequate antenatal care, 83.73% had a delivery at the healthcare facility, and 71.46% received postnatal care. The mother’s age and household wealth index were the typical determinants of all maternal healthcare services. Determinants of antenatal care visits were husband’s occupational status, the number of children, and access to the healthcare facility. Next, factors that drive mothers’ delivery at the healthcare facility were the mother’s education level, husband’s educational level, and residential area. The use of postnatal care was determined by the mother’s occupational status, husband’s educational level, number of children, wealth index, access to the healthcare facility, and residential area. Conclusions: Although there were differences in the determinant factors of three key maternal healthcare services, the mother’s age and household wealth index were the typical determinants of all maternal healthcare services utilisation. Providing a tailored programme aligned with these determinant factors may ensure that mothers can access and adequately utilise maternal healthcare services.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The role of competition versus cooperation in microbial community coalescence</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Pablo Lechón-Alonso, Tom Clegg, Jacob Cook, Thomas P. Smith, Samraat Pawar</p>

New microbial communities often arise through the mixing of two or more separately assembled parent communities, a phenomenon that has been termed “community coalescence”. Understanding how the interaction structures of complex parent communities determine the outcomes of coalescence events is an important challenge. While recent work has begun to elucidate the role of competition in coalescence, that of cooperation, a key interaction type commonly seen in microbial communities, is still largely unknown. Here, using a general consumer-resource model, we study the combined effects of competitive and cooperative interactions on the outcomes of coalescence events. To do so, we simulate coalescence events between pairs of communities with different degrees of competition for shared carbon resources and cooperation through cross-feeding on leaked metabolic by-products (facilitation). We also study how structural and functional properties of post-coalescence communities evolve when they are subjected to repeated coalescence events. We find that in coalescence events, the less competitive and more cooperative parent communities contribute a higher proportion of species to the new community because this endows superior ability to deplete resources and resist invasions. Consequently, when a community is subjected to repeated coalescence events, it gradually evolves towards being less competitive and more cooperative, as well as more speciose, robust and efficient in resource use. Encounters between microbial communities are becoming increasingly frequent as a result of anthropogenic environmental change, and there is great interest in how the coalescence of microbial communities affects environmental and human health. Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms behind microbial community coalescence, and a framework to predict outcomes based on the interaction structures of parent communities.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">RESCRIPt: Reproducible sequence taxonomy reference database management</a></h4>

Nucleotide sequence and taxonomy reference databases are critical resources for widespread applications including marker-gene and metagenome sequencing for microbiome analysis, diet metabarcoding, and environmental DNA (eDNA) surveys. Reproducibly generating, managing, using, and evaluating nucleotide sequence and taxonomy reference databases creates a significant bottleneck for researchers aiming to generate custom sequence databases. Furthermore, database composition drastically influences results, and lack of standardization limits cross-study comparisons. To address these challenges, we developed RESCRIPt, a Python 3 software package and QIIME 2 plugin for reproducible generation and management of reference sequence taxonomy databases, including dedicated functions that streamline creating databases from popular sources, and functions for evaluating, comparing, and interactively exploring qualitative and quantitative characteristics across reference databases. To highlight the breadth and capabilities of RESCRIPt, we provide several examples for working with popular databases for microbiome profiling (SILVA, Greengenes, NCBI-RefSeq, GTDB), eDNA and diet metabarcoding surveys (BOLD, GenBank), as well as for genome comparison. We show that bigger is not always better, and reference databases with standardized taxonomies and those that focus on type strains have quantitative advantages, though may not be appropriate for all use cases. Most databases appear to benefit from some curation (quality filtering), though sequence clustering appears detrimental to database quality. Finally, we demonstrate the breadth and extensibility of RESCRIPt for reproducible workflows with a comparison of global hepatitis genomes. RESCRIPt provides tools to democratize the process of reference database acquisition and management, enabling researchers to reproducibly and transparently create reference materials for diverse research applications.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Programming cell growth into different cluster shapes using diffusible signals</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yipei Guo, Mor Nitzan, Michael P. Brenner</p>

Advances in genetic engineering technologies have allowed the construction of artificial genetic circuits, which have been used to generate spatial patterns of differential gene expression. However, the question of how cells can be programmed, and how complex the rules need to be, to achieve a desired tissue morphology has received less attention. Here, we address these questions by developing a mathematical model to study how cells can collectively grow into clusters with different structural morphologies by secreting diffusible signals that can influence cellular growth rates. We formulate how growth regulators can be used to control the formation of cellular protrusions and how the range of achievable structures scales with the number of distinct signals. We show that a single growth inhibitor is insufficient for the formation of multiple protrusions but may be achieved with multiple growth inhibitors, and that other types of signals can regulate the shape of protrusion tips. These examples illustrate how our approach could potentially be used to guide the design of regulatory circuits for achieving a desired target structure.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">More pests but less pesticide applications: Ambivalent effect of landscape complexity on conservation biological control</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Patrizia Zamberletti, Khadija Sabir, Thomas Opitz, Olivier Bonnefon, Edith Gabriel, Julien Papaïx</p>

In agricultural landscapes, the amount and organization of crops and semi-natural habitats (SNH) have the potential to promote a bundle of ecosystem services due to their influence on ecological community at multiple spatio-temporal scales. SNH are relatively undisturbed and are often source of complementary resources and refuges, therefore supporting more diverse and abundant natural pest enemies. However, the nexus of SNH proportion and organization with pest suppression is not trivial. It is thus crucial to understand how the behavior of pest and natural enemy species, the underlying landscape structure, and their interaction, may influence conservation biological control (CBC). Here, we develop a generative stochastic landscape model to simulate realistic agricultural landscape compositions and configurations of fields and linear elements. Generated landscapes are used as spatial support over which we simulate a spatially explicit predator-prey dynamic model. We find that increased SNH presence boosts predator populations by sustaining high predator density that regulates and keeps pest density below the pesticide application threshold. However, predator presence over all the landscape helps to stabilize the pest population by keeping it under this threshold, which tends to increase pest density at the landscape scale. In addition, the joint effect of SNH presence and predator dispersal ability among hedge and field interface results in a stronger pest regulation, which also limits pest growth. Considering properties of both fields and linear elements, such as local structure and geometric features, provides deeper insights for pest regulation; for example, hedge presence at crop field boundaries clearly strengthens CBC. Our results highlight that the integration of species behaviors and traits with landscape structure at multiple scales is necessary to provide useful insights for CBC.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Computational redesign of a fluorogen activating protein with Rosetta</a></h4>

The use of unnatural fluorogenic molecules widely expands the pallet of available genetically encoded fluorescent imaging tools through the design of fluorogen activating proteins (FAPs). While there is already a handful of such probes available, each of them went through laborious cycles of <i>in vitro</i> screening and selection. Computational modeling approaches are evolving incredibly fast right now and are demonstrating great results in many applications, including <i>de novo</i> protein design. It suggests that the easier task of fine-tuning the fluorogen-binding properties of an already functional protein <i>in silico</i> should be readily achievable. To test this hypothesis, we used Rosetta for computational ligand docking followed by protein binding pocket redesign to further improve the previously described FAP DiB1 that is capable of binding to a BODIPY-like dye M739. Despite an inaccurate initial docking of the chromophore, the incorporated mutations nevertheless improved multiple photophysical parameters as well as the overall performance of the tag. The designed protein, DiB-RM, shows higher brightness, localization precision, and apparent photostability in protein-PAINT super-resolution imaging compared to its parental variant DiB1. Moreover, DiB-RM can be cleaved to obtain an efficient split system with enhanced performance compared to a parental DiB-split system. The possible reasons for the inaccurate ligand binding pose prediction and its consequence on the outcome of the design experiment are further discussed.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">GPRuler: Metabolic gene-protein-reaction rules automatic reconstruction</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Marzia Di Filippo, Chiara Damiani, Dario Pescini</p>

Metabolic network models are increasingly being used in health care and industry. As a consequence, many tools have been released to automate their reconstruction process <i>de novo</i>. In order to enable gene deletion simulations and integration of gene expression data, these networks must include gene-protein-reaction (GPR) rules, which describe with a Boolean logic relationships between the gene products (e.g., enzyme isoforms or subunits) associated with the catalysis of a given reaction. Nevertheless, the reconstruction of GPRs still remains a largely manual and time consuming process. Aiming at fully automating the reconstruction process of GPRs for any organism, we propose the open-source python-based framework GPRuler. By mining text and data from 9 different biological databases, GPRuler can reconstruct GPRs starting either from just the name of the target organism or from an existing metabolic model. The performance of the developed tool is evaluated at small-scale level for a manually curated metabolic model, and at genome-scale level for three metabolic models related to <i>Homo sapiens</i> and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> organisms. By exploiting these models as benchmarks, the proposed tool shown its ability to reproduce the original GPR rules with a high level of accuracy. In all the tested scenarios, after a manual investigation of the mismatches between the rules proposed by GPRuler and the original ones, the proposed approach revealed to be in many cases more accurate than the original models. By complementing existing tools for metabolic network reconstruction with the possibility to reconstruct GPRs quickly and with a few resources, GPRuler paves the way to the study of context-specific metabolic networks, representing the active portion of the complete network in given conditions, for organisms of industrial or biomedical interest that have not been characterized metabolically yet.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The Impact of the HydroxyMethylCytosine epigenetic signature on DNA structure and function</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Federica Battistini, Pablo D. Dans, Montserrat Terrazas, Chiara L. Castellazzi, Guillem Portella, Mireia Labrador, Núria Villegas, Isabelle Brun-Heath, Carlos González, Modesto Orozco</p>

We present a comprehensive, experimental and theoretical study of the impact of 5-hydroxymethylation of DNA cytosine. Using molecular dynamics, biophysical experiments and NMR spectroscopy, we found that Ten-Eleven translocation (TET) dioxygenases generate an epigenetic variant with structural and physical properties similar to those of 5-methylcytosine. Experiments and simulations demonstrate that 5-methylcytosine (mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC) generally lead to stiffer DNA than normal cytosine, with poorer circularization efficiencies and lower ability to form nucleosomes. In particular, we can rule out the hypothesis that hydroxymethylation reverts to unmodified cytosine physical properties, as hmC is even more rigid than mC. Thus, we do not expect dramatic changes in the chromatin structure induced by differences in physical properties between d(mCpG) and d(hmCpG). Conversely, our simulations suggest that methylated-DNA binding domains (MBDs), associated with repression activities, are sensitive to the substitution d(mCpG) ➔ d(hmCpG), while MBD3 which has a dual activation/repression activity is not sensitive to the d(mCpG) d(hmCpG) change. Overall, while gene activity changes due to cytosine methylation are the result of the combination of stiffness-related chromatin reorganization and MBD binding, those associated to 5-hydroxylation of methylcytosine could be explained by a change in the balance of repression/activation pathways related to differential MBD binding.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Atypically larger variability of resource allocation accounts for visual working memory deficits in schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yi-Jie Zhao, Tianye Ma, Li Zhang, Xuemei Ran, Ru-Yuan Zhang, Yixuan Ku</p>

Working memory (WM) deficits have been widely documented in schizophrenia (SZ), and almost all existing studies attributed the deficits to decreased capacity as compared to healthy control (HC) subjects. Recent developments in WM research suggest that other components, such as precision, also mediate behavioral performance. It remains unclear how different WM components jointly contribute to deficits in schizophrenia. We measured the performance of 60 SZ (31 females) and 61 HC (29 females) in a classical delay-estimation visual working memory (VWM) task and evaluated several influential computational models proposed in basic science of VWM to disentangle the effect of various memory components. We show that the model assuming variable precision (VP) across items and trials is the best model to explain the performance of both groups. According to the VP model, SZ exhibited abnormally larger variability of allocating memory resources rather than resources or capacity <i>per se</i>. Finally, individual differences in the resource allocation variability predicted variation of symptom severity in PSZ, highlighting its functional relevance to schizophrenic pathology. This finding was further verified using distinct visual features and subject cohorts. These results provide an alternative view instead of the widely accepted decreased-capacity theory and highlight the key role of elevated resource allocation variability in generating atypical VWM behavior in schizophrenia. Our findings also shed new light on the utility of Bayesian observer models to characterize mechanisms of mental deficits in clinical neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Comparison of metabolic states using genome-scale metabolic models</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chaitra Sarathy, Marian Breuer, Martina Kutmon, Michiel E. Adriaens, Chris T. Evelo, Ilja C. W. Arts</p>

Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) are comprehensive knowledge bases of cellular metabolism and serve as mathematical tools for studying biological phenotypes and metabolic states or conditions in various organisms and cell types. Given the sheer size and complexity of human metabolism, selecting parameters for existing analysis methods such as metabolic objective functions and model constraints is not straightforward in human GEMs. In particular, comparing several conditions in large GEMs to identify condition- or disease-specific metabolic features is challenging. In this study, we showcase a scalable, model-driven approach for an in-depth investigation and comparison of metabolic states in large GEMs which enables identifying the underlying functional differences. Using a combination of flux space sampling and network analysis, our approach enables extraction and visualisation of metabolically distinct network modules. Importantly, it does not rely on known or assumed objective functions. We apply this novel approach to extract the biochemical differences in adipocytes arising due to unlimited vs blocked uptake of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs, considered as biomarkers in obesity) using a human adipocyte GEM (iAdipocytes1809). The biological significance of our approach is corroborated by literature reports confirming our identified metabolic processes (TCA cycle and Fatty acid metabolism) to be functionally related to BCAA metabolism. Additionally, our analysis predicts a specific altered uptake and secretion profile indicating a compensation for the unavailability of BCAAs. Taken together, our approach facilitates determining functional differences between any metabolic conditions of interest by offering a versatile platform for analysing and comparing flux spaces of large metabolic networks.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Self-organization of a doubly asynchronous irregular network state for spikes and bursts</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Filip Vercruysse, Richard Naud, Henning Sprekeler</p>

Cortical pyramidal cells (PCs) have a specialized dendritic mechanism for the generation of bursts, suggesting that these events play a special role in cortical information processing. <i>In vivo</i>, bursts occur at a low, but consistent rate. Theory suggests that this network state increases the amount of information they convey. However, because burst activity relies on a threshold mechanism, it is rather sensitive to dendritic input levels. In spiking network models, network states in which bursts occur rarely are therefore typically not robust, but require fine-tuning. Here, we show that this issue can be solved by a homeostatic inhibitory plasticity rule in dendrite-targeting interneurons that is consistent with experimental data. The suggested learning rule can be combined with other forms of inhibitory plasticity to self-organize a network state in which both spikes and bursts occur asynchronously and irregularly at low rate. Finally, we show that this network state creates the network conditions for a recently suggested multiplexed code and thereby indeed increases the amount of information encoded in bursts.

Several studies have revealed a correlation between chronic inflammation and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) metabolism, but the precise mechanism involved is unknown. Here, we report that the genetic and pharmacological inhibition of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt), the rate-limiting enzyme in the salvage pathway of NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis, reduced oxidative stress, inflammation, and keratinocyte DNA damage, hyperproliferation, and cell death in zebrafish models of chronic skin inflammation, while all these effects were reversed by NAD<sup>+</sup> supplementation. Similarly, genetic and pharmacological inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymerase 1 (Parp1), overexpression of PAR glycohydrolase, inhibition of apoptosis-inducing factor 1, inhibition of NADPH oxidases, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging all phenocopied the effects of Nampt inhibition. Pharmacological inhibition of NADPH oxidases/NAMPT/PARP/AIFM1 axis decreased the expression of pathology-associated genes in human organotypic 3D skin models of psoriasis. Consistently, an aberrant induction of NAMPT and PARP activity, together with AIFM1 nuclear translocation, was observed in lesional skin from psoriasis patients. In conclusion, hyperactivation of PARP1 in response to ROS-induced DNA damage, fueled by NAMPT-derived NAD<sup>+</sup>, mediates skin inflammation through parthanatos cell death.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Adult medial habenula neurons require GDNF receptor GFRα1 for synaptic stability and function</a></h4>

The medial habenula (mHb) is an understudied small brain nucleus linking forebrain and midbrain structures controlling anxiety and fear behaviors. The mechanisms that maintain the structural and functional integrity of mHb neurons and their synapses remain unknown. Using spatiotemporally controlled Cre-mediated recombination in adult mice, we found that the glial cell–derived neurotrophic factor receptor alpha 1 (GFRα1) is required in adult mHb neurons for synaptic stability and function. mHb neurons express some of the highest levels of GFRα1 in the mouse brain, and acute ablation of GFRα1 results in loss of septohabenular and habenulointerpeduncular glutamatergic synapses, with the remaining synapses displaying reduced numbers of presynaptic vesicles. Chemo- and optogenetic studies in mice lacking GFRα1 revealed impaired circuit connectivity, reduced AMPA receptor postsynaptic currents, and abnormally low rectification index (R.I.) of AMPARs, suggesting reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability. Further biochemical and proximity ligation assay (PLA) studies defined the presence of GluA1/GluA2 (Ca<sup>2+</sup> impermeable) as well as GluA1/GluA4 (Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeable) AMPAR complexes in mHb neurons, as well as clear differences in the levels and association of AMPAR subunits with mHb neurons lacking GFRα1. Finally, acute loss of GFRα1 in adult mHb neurons reduced anxiety-like behavior and potentiated context-based fear responses, phenocopying the effects of lesions to septal projections to the mHb. These results uncover an unexpected function for GFRα1 in the maintenance and function of adult glutamatergic synapses and reveal a potential new mechanism for regulating synaptic plasticity in the septohabenulointerpeduncular pathway and attuning of anxiety and fear behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Predicting novel candidate human obesity genes and their site of action by systematic functional screening in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Neha Agrawal, Katherine Lawler, Catherine M. Davidson, Julia M. Keogh, Robert Legg, INTERVAL , Inês Barroso, I. Sadaf Farooqi, Andrea H. Brand</p>

The discovery of human obesity-associated genes can reveal new mechanisms to target for weight loss therapy. Genetic studies of obese individuals and the analysis of rare genetic variants can identify novel obesity-associated genes. However, establishing a functional relationship between these candidate genes and adiposity remains a significant challenge. We uncovered a large number of rare homozygous gene variants by exome sequencing of severely obese children, including those from consanguineous families. By assessing the function of these genes in vivo in <i>Drosophila</i>, we identified 4 genes, not previously linked to human obesity, that regulate adiposity (<i>itpr</i>, <i>dachsous</i>, <i>calpA</i>, and <i>sdk</i>). Dachsous is a transmembrane protein upstream of the Hippo signalling pathway. We found that 3 further members of the Hippo pathway, fat, four-jointed, and hippo, also regulate adiposity and that they act in neurons, rather than in adipose tissue (fat body). Screening Hippo pathway genes in larger human cohorts revealed rare variants in <i>TAOK2</i> associated with human obesity. Knockdown of <i>Drosophila tao</i> increased adiposity in vivo demonstrating the strength of our approach in predicting novel human obesity genes and signalling pathways and their site of action.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The impact of virtual learning on Multimedia University student performance: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The Covid-19 pandemic has imposed adaption to virtual learning for students and educators across all levels of education in the world. The effectiveness of virtual learning varies amongst age groups. It has been suggested that the adoption of virtual learning will continue to be implemented even after pandemic, particularly in higher education. Therefore, it is crucial to validate the effectiveness of a virtual learning approach among university students to ensure a smooth transition from a conventional education model to a hybrid education model. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the impact of virtual learning on students’ performance in a virtual classroom. Methods: We analysed survey data collected from undergraduate students at Multimedia University, Malaysia. Convenience sampling and self-administered online surveys were used to understand the impact of virtual learning. Multiple regression analysis was performed using SPSS software Results: A total of 210 first and second year degree and diploma students responded to the online surveys. Factors affecting virtual learning were segregated into three categories: virtual teaching techniques, technology issues, and environment distraction. Respondents stated that the critical factor that affect the effectiveness of virtual learning and impacts on students’ performance was the virtual teaching techniques employed by educators. Conclusions: This study concluded that virtual teaching techniques have significant impact on students’ performance whereas technology issues and environment distraction do not significantly influence students’ performance during virtual learning. Although this study is limited to students from Multimedia University, it lays the groundwork for future research to involve students from other universities or other countries. A future study can address more factors that affect virtual learning and students’ performance, such as students’ attitude and motivation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Driver perceptions of advanced driver assistance systems: A case study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Automobile manufacturers need to have an insight and understand how consumers, specifically drivers, respond to the advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) technology in their manufactured vehicles. This study reveals drivers’ perceptions of Malaysia’s advanced driver assistance systems, which is currently lacking in the literature. So far, other studies have focused on countries that are unlike Malaysia’s multi-culture environment. Methods: A survey was designed and distributed using convenience sampling to obtain responses from licensed drivers. Questions included demographic and driving questions, the perceptions of benefits and obstacles relevant to ADAS use, vehicle decision-making, and technology use. Data were collected from 818 respondents who were licensed drivers in Malaysia. Results were then analysed using statistical approaches. Results: The findings indicated that 76.8% of drivers have a positive attitude towards ADAS technology, particularly safety applications when they are available. Regardless of the accuracy of these systems, acceptance of the technology may shift upon viewing or hearing messages of possible problems with ADAS. Conclusions: It can be concluded that the safety advantages of ADAS technology are less valued by drivers who do not have experience of road traffic accidents. Furthermore, acceptance of the technology could be undermined by assuming that the safety applications could be compromised.

<p>Male (M) and female (F) mice null for the cystine/glutamate antiporter, system x<sub>c</sub>
<sup>−</sup>, have neuronal structural alterations including enhanced dendritic complexity (M), decreased soma size (F), and alterations in spine head widths (M,F). These cellular morphological alterations may explain the reduction in convulsive seizure threshold demonstrated in both sexes. </p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>System x<sub>c</sub>
<sup>−</sup> (Sx<sub>c</sub>
<sup>−</sup>) is a heteromeric antiporter (L-cystine/L-glutamate exchanger) expressed predominately on astrocytes in the central nervous system. Its activity contributes importantly to the maintenance of the ambient extracellular glutamate levels, as well as, to cellular redox homeostasis. Since alterations in glutamate levels and redox modifications could cause structural changes, we analyzed gross regional morphology of thionin-stained brain sections and cellular and subcellular morphology of Golgi–Cox stained layer V pyramidal neurons in the primary motor cortex (PM1) of mice naturally null for <i>SLC7A11</i> (<i>SLC7A11<sup>sut/sut</sup>
</i>)—the gene that encodes the substrate specific light chain (xCT) for Sx<sub>c</sub>
<sup>−</sup>. Intriguingly, in comparison to age- and sex-matched wild-type (<i>SLC7A11<sup>+/+</sup>
</i>) littermate controls, we found morphologic changes—including increased dendritic complexity and mushroom spine area in males and reduced corpus callosum and soma size in females—that have previously been described, in each case, as morphological correlates of excitability. Consistent with this, we found that both male and female <i>SLC7A11<sup>sut/sut</sup>
</i> mice had lower convulsive seizure thresholds and greater seizure severity than their sex-matched wild-type (<i>SLC7A11<sup>+/+</sup>
</i>) littermates after acute challenge with two pharmacologically distinct chemoconvulsants: the Glu receptor agonist, kainic acid (KA), or the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist, pentylenetetrazole (PTZ). These results suggest that the loss of Sx<sub>c</sub>
<sup>−</sup> signaling in males and females perturbs excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance <i>in vivo</i>, potentially through its regulation of cellular and subcellular morphology.</p>

     alt="The dopamine membrane transporter plays an active modulatory role in synaptic dopamine homeostasis"/>
<p>The pH-sensitive fluorescent sensor remains OFF inside neurotransmitter vesicles due to low pH. Upon fusion of the vesicle with the synaptic membrane, the sensor is exposed to the neutral extra-cellular pH which switches it to the ON configuration. Fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching imaging of vesicle fusion dynamics reveals an active role for the dopamine membrane transporter in synaptic dopamine homeostasis.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Modulatory mechanisms of neurotransmitter release and clearance are highly controlled processes whose finely tuned regulation is critical for functioning of the nervous system. Dysregulation of the monoamine neurotransmitter dopamine can lead to several neuropathies. Synaptic modulation of dopamine is known to involve pre-synaptic D2 auto-receptors and acid sensing ion channels. In addition, the dopamine membrane transporter (DAT), which is responsible for clearance of dopamine from the synaptic cleft, is suspected to play an active role in modulating release of dopamine. Using functional imaging on the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> model system, we show that DAT-1 acts as a negative feedback modulator to neurotransmitter vesicle fusion. Results from our fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching (FRAP) based experiments were followed up with and reaffirmed using swimming-induced paralysis behavioral assays. Utilizing our numerical FRAP data we have developed a mechanistic model to dissect the dynamics of synaptic vesicle fusion, and compare the feedback effects of DAT-1 with the dopamine auto-receptor. Our experimental results and the mechanistic model are of potential broader significance, as similar dynamics are likely to be used by other synaptic modulators including membrane transporters for other neurotransmitters across species.</p>

                Background: Giant gourami (Osphronemus goramy Lacepede, 1801) has become popular aquaculture in Indonesia. However, information on the feed used is minimal. This study analyzed the change in feeding nutrition, fish growth, feed efficiency, and body-carcass using product formulated from water coconut, palm sap sugar, and fungus. Methods: A total of 2,000 ml coconut water and 1,000 ml of palm sap sugar solution were formulated. Each product formulated was added with 6 g of Aspergillus niger (called product P1), 6 g of Rhizopus oligosporus (called product P2), and 6 g of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (called product P3). Commercial feeds supplemented with P1, P2, and P3 products are designated P1, P2, and P3 diets. Commercial feed added to freshwater is called the P4 diet (placebo). Their dosage is 300 ml/kg of feed. Gurami sago juveniles (initial weight 50±2.5 g and length 13.2±0.4 cm) were stocked in triplicate nets (2×1×1 m) in a freshwater concrete pond with a stocking density of 30 fish/net, an initial feeding rate of 3% per day until study termination. Results: Our results support our hypothesis that different product formulations have a significant effect (p<0.05) on growth performance and feed efficiency. At the same time, supplementing commercial feed with varying formula products has a significant impact (p<0.05) on the fatty acid composition of the diets and carcass body of gurami sago. Conclusion: Diet P2 contains a higher concentration of fatty acids to increase body weight, feed efficiency, and the best carcass fatty acid composition than other experiments for sago gurami reared in freshwater concrete ponds.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">New onset asthma during pregnancy: two case reports [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction:  Asthma is the most common chronic respiratory disease during pregnancy. However, reports of new onset asthma during pregnancy are lacking. We report two cases of new onset asthma during pregnancy following respiratory tract infection, subsequently one case with M. pneumoniae infection and the other case with a combined infection with respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus.   Case presentation:   Both patients presented with the clinical features of an acute asthma exacerbation during pregnancy without a medical history of asthma. During follow up the diagnosis of asthma was supported by spirometry showing significant reversibility and elevated fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO). Patients were hospitalized and received supplemental oxygen, treatment for an acute asthma exacerbation with systemic corticosteroids, high dose inhalation therapy. These therapeutic interventions subsequently led to a good outcome for the mother and newborn in both cases.   Conclusions:  New onset asthma should be part of the differential diagnosis in pregnant patients with respiratory symptoms, particularly in case of mycoplasma infection.  Diagnosing asthma during pregnancy can be challenging. In these circumstances, additional diagnostic tests (like inflammatory biomarkers FeNO and blood eosinophils) can be helpful to support the diagnosis.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Oral anticoagulants in the oldest old with recent stroke and atrial fibrillation</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate the safety and effectiveness of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) versus vitamin-K-antagonists (VKA) after recent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) aged ≥85 years.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Individual patient data analysis from 7 prospective stroke cohorts. We compared DOAC versus VKA treatment among patients with AF and recent stroke (&lt;3 months) aged ≥85 versus &lt;85 years. Primary outcome was the composite of recurrent stroke, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and all-cause death. We used simple, adjusted and weighted Cox regression to account for confounders. We calculated the net benefit of DOAC versus VKA by balancing stroke reduction against the weighted ICH risk.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In total, 5,984 of 6,267 (95.5%) patients were eligible for analysis. Of those, 1,380 (23%) were aged ≥85 years and 3,688 (62%) received a DOAC. During 6,874 patient-years follow-up, the impact of anticoagulant type (DOAC versus VKA) on the hazard for the composite outcome did not differ between patients aged ≥85 (HR<sub>≥85y</sub>=0.65, 95%-CI [0.52, 0.81]) and &lt;85 years (HR<sub>&lt;85y</sub>=0.79, 95%-CI [0.66, 0.95]) in simple (p<sub>interaction</sub>=0.129), adjusted (p<sub>interaction</sub>=0.094) or weighted (p<sub>interaction</sub>=0.512) models. Analyses on recurrent stroke, ICH and death separately were consistent with the primary analysis, as were sensitivity analyses using age dichotomized at 90 years and as a continuous variable. DOAC had a similar net clinical benefit in patients aged ≥85 (+1.73 to +2.66) and &lt;85 years (+1.90 to +3.36 events/100 patient-years for ICH-weights 1.5 to 3.1).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The favorable profile of DOAC over VKA in patients with AF and recent stroke was maintained in the oldest old.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Including a pen and/or cover letter, containing social incentive text, had no effect on questionnaire response rate: a factorial randomised controlled Study within a Trial [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Postal questionnaires are frequently used in randomised controlled trials to collect outcome data on participants; however, poor response can introduce bias, affect generalisability and validity, and reduce statistical power. The objective of this study was to assess whether a pen and/or social incentive text cover letter sent with a postal follow-up questionnaire increased response rates in a trial. Method: A two-by-two factorial randomised controlled trial was embedded within the OTIS host trial. Participants due their 12-month (final) follow-up questionnaire were randomised to be sent: a pen; a social incentive text cover letter; both; or neither. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of participants in each group who returned the questionnaire. Secondary outcomes were: time to return, completeness of the questionnaire, necessity of a reminder letter, and the cost effectiveness. Results: The overall 12-month questionnaire response rate was 721 out of 755 (95.5%). Neither the pen nor social incentive cover letter had a statistically significant effect on response rate: pen 95.2% vs. no pen 95.8%, adjusted OR 0.90 (95% CI 0.45 to 1.80; p=0.77); social incentive cover letter 95.2% vs. no social incentive cover letter 95.8%, adjusted OR 0.84 (95% CI 0.42 to 1.69, p=0.63). No statistically significant differences were observed between either of the intervention groups on time to response, need for a reminder or completeness. Therefore, neither intervention was cost-effective. Conclusions: We found no evidence of a difference in response rates associated with the inclusion of a pen and/or social incentive cover letter with the final follow-up postal questionnaire of the host trial. However, when these results are combined with previous SWATs, the meta-analysis evidence remains that including a pen increases response rates. The social incentive cover letter warrants further investigation to determine effectiveness. Trial registration: ISRCTN22202133 (21st June 2020).

<p>A human high-grade glioma (VIPI) positive for the stem cell marker nestin implanted in the brain of an immunodeficient mouse is irradiated with total 10.0 Gy split in 4 × 2.5 Gy fractions (hypofractionated radiotherapy) or 30 × 0.25 + 20 × 0.125 Gy fractions (ultra-hyper-fractionated radiotherapy). Mice treated with the latter survive significantly longer.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>High-grade gliomas (HGGs; WHO grades III and IV) are invariably lethal brain tumors. Low-dose hyper-radiosensitivity (HRS) of HGG is a well-established phenomenon <i>in vitro</i>. However, possibly linked to the unavailability of accurate animal models of the diseases, this therapeutic effect could not be consistently translated to the animal setting, thus impairing its subsequent clinical development. The purpose of this study was to develop radiotherapeutic (RT) schedules permitting to significantly improve the overall survival of faithful animal models of HGG that have been recently made available. We used primary glioma initiating cell (GIC)-driven orthotopic animal models that accurately recapitulate the heterogeneity and growth patterns of the patients' tumors, to investigate the therapeutic effects of low radiation doses toward HGG. With the same total dose, RT fractions ≤0.5 Gy twice per week [ultra-hyper-fractionation (ultra-hyper-FRT)] started at early stages of tumor progression (a condition that in the clinical setting often occurs at the end of the guidelines treatment) improved the effectiveness of RT and the animal survival in comparison to standard fractions. For the same cumulative dose, the use of fractions ≤0.5 Gy may permit to escape one or more tumor resistance mechanisms thus increasing the effectiveness of RT and the overall animal survival. These findings suggest investigating in the clinical setting the therapeutic effect of an ultra-hyper-FRT schedule promptly extending the conventional RT component of the current guideline (“Stupp”) therapeutic protocol.</p>

     alt="Is there a relationship between EEG and sTMS neurophysiological markers of the putative human mirror neuron system?"/>
<p>In a large sample of healthy adults, we assessed whether two predominantly used measures of the human mirror neuron system (MNS) are related. Results revealed strong evidence against an association, indicating that future researchers must carefully select their measures and embrace more versatile multi-methodological approaches to indexing the MNS.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The mirror neuron system (MNS) has been theorized to play a neurobiological role in a number of social cognitive abilities and is commonly indexed putatively in humans via interpersonal motor resonance (IMR) and mu suppression. Although both indices are thought to measure similar neuronal populations (i.e., “mirror neurons”), it has been suggested that these methods are unrelated, and therefore, incompatible. However, prior studies reporting no relationships were typically conducted in small and underpowered samples. Thus, we aimed to investigate this potential association in a large sample of neurotypical adults (<i>N</i> = 116; 72 females). Participants underwent transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), electromyography (EMG), and electroencephalography (EEG) during the observation of videos of actors performing grasping actions in order to index IMR and mu suppression (in beta, lower alpha, and upper alpha bandwidths). A series of linear regressions revealed no associations between IMR and each of the mu suppression bandwidths. Supplementary Bayesian analyses provided further evidence in favor of the null (B<sub>01</sub> = 8.85–8.93), providing further support for no association between the two indices of MNS activity. Our findings suggest that these two measures may indeed be unrelated indices that perhaps assess different neurophysiological aspects of the MNS. These results have important implications for future studies examining the MNS.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Synchronized cluster firing, a distinct form of sensory neuron activation, drives spontaneous pain</a></h4>

              
                Spontaneous pain, a primary complaint of individuals with neuropathic pain, is poorly understood. Zheng et al. describe a new form of sensory neuron activity: spatially clustered sensory neurons sporadically firing together, which mediates spontaneous pain in mouse models of neuropathic pain. Sympathetic fibers abnormally sprouting into sensory ganglia underlie this cluster firing.

This paper presents a deep learning framework to decode gaze position from the magnetic resonance signal of the eyeballs, which enables eye tracking in fMRI data without a camera.

                It is well recognized that population heterogeneity plays an important role in the spread of epidemics. While individual variations in social activity are often assumed to be persistent, i.e. constant in time, here we discuss the consequences of dynamic heterogeneity. By integrating the stochastic dynamics of social activity into traditional epidemiological models we demonstrate the emergence of a new long timescale governing the epidemic, in broad agreement with empirical data. Our Stochastic Social Activity model captures multiple features of real-life epidemics such as COVID-19, including prolonged plateaus and multiple waves, which are transiently suppressed due to the dynamic nature of social activity. The existence of a long timescale due to the interplay between epidemic and social dynamics provides a unifying picture of how a fast-paced epidemic typically will transition to an endemic state.

                Shotgun metagenomic sequencing is a powerful approach to study microbiomes in an unbiased manner and of increasing relevance for identifying novel enzymatic functions. However, the potential of metagenomics to relate from microbiome composition to function has thus far been underutilized. Here, we introduce the Metagenomics Genome-Phenome Association (MetaGPA) study framework, which allows linking genetic information in metagenomes with a dedicated functional phenotype. We applied MetaGPA to identify enzymes associated with cytosine modifications in environmental samples. From the 2365 genes that met our significance criteria, we confirm known pathways for cytosine modifications and proposed novel cytosine-modifying mechanisms. Specifically, we characterized and identified a novel nucleic acid modifying enzyme, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine carbamoyltransferase, that catalyzes the formation of a previously unknown cytosine modification, 5-carbamoyloxymethylcytosine, in DNA and RNA. Our work introduces MetaGPA as a novel and versatile tool for advancing functional metagenomics.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Rapid and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection using quantitative peptide enrichment LC-MS analysis</a></h4>

              
                Reliable, robust, large-scale molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 is essential for monitoring the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. We have developed a scalable analytical approach to detect viral proteins based on peptide immunoaffinity enrichment combined with liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry (LC-MS). This is a multiplexed strategy, based on targeted proteomics analysis and read-out by LC-MS, capable of precisely quantifying and confirming the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in PBS swab media from combined throat/nasopharynx/saliva samples.&lt;br /&gt;The results reveal that the levels of SARS-CoV-2 measured by LC-MS correlate well with their corresponding RT-PCR readout (r=0.79). The analytical workflow shows similar turnaround times as regular RT-PCR instrumentation with a quantitative readout of viral proteins corresponding to cycle thresholds (Ct) equivalents ranging from 21 to 34. Using RT-PCR as a reference, we demonstrate that the LC-MS-based method has 100% negative percent agreement (estimated specificity) and 95% positive percent agreement (estimated sensitivity) when analyzing clinical samples collected from asymptomatic individuals with a Ct within the limit of detection of the mass spectrometer (Ct ≤30). These results suggest that a scalable analytical method based on LC-MS has a place in future pandemic preparedness centers to complement current virus detection technologies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Early evolution of beetles regulated by the end-Permian deforestation</a></h4>

              
                The end-Permian mass extinction (EPME) led to a severe terrestrial ecosystem collapse. However, the ecological response of insects—the most diverse group of organisms on Earth—to the EPME remains poorly understood. Here, we analyse beetle evolutionary history based on taxonomic diversity, morphological disparity, phylogeny, and ecological shifts from the Early Permian to Middle Triassic, using a comprehensive new data set. Permian beetles were dominated by xylophagous stem groups with high diversity and disparity, which probably played an underappreciated role in the Permian carbon cycle. Our suite of analyses shows that Permian xylophagous beetles suffered a severe extinction during the EPME largely due to the collapse of forest ecosystems, resulting in an Early Triassic gap of xylophagous beetles. New xylophagous beetles appeared widely in the early Middle Triassic, which is consistent with the restoration of forest ecosystems. Our results highlight the ecological significance of insects in deep-time terrestrial ecosystems.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Sumoylation of the human histone H4 tail inhibits p300-mediated transcription by RNA polymerase II in cellular extracts</a></h4>

              
                The post-translational modification of histones by the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) protein has been associated with gene regulation, centromeric localization and double-strand break repair in eukaryotes. Although sumoylation of histone H4 was specifically associated with gene repression, this could not be proven due to the challenge of site-specifically sumoylating H4 in cells. Biochemical crosstalk between SUMO and other histone modifications, such as H4 acetylation and H3 methylation, that are associated with active genes also remains unclear. We addressed these challenges in mechanistic studies using an H4 chemically modified at Lys12 by SUMO-3 (H4K12su) and incorporated into mononucleosomes and chromatinized plasmids for functional studies. Mononucleosome-based assays revealed that H4K12su inhibits transcription-activating H4 tail acetylation by the histone acetyltransferase p300, as well as transcription-associated H3K4 methylation by the extended catalytic module of the Set1/COMPASS histone methyltransferase complex. Activator- and p300-dependent <i>in vitro</i> transcription assays with chromatinized plasmids revealed that H4K12su inhibits both H4 tail acetylation and RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription. Finally, cell-based assays with a SUMO-H4 fusion that mimics H4 tail sumoylation confirmed the negative crosstalk between histone sumoylation and acetylation/methylation. Thus, our studies establish the key role for histone sumoylation in gene silencing and its negative biochemical crosstalk with active transcription-associated marks in human cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The role of TAp63γ and P53 point mutations in regulating DNA repair, mutational susceptibility and invasion of bladder cancer cells</a></h4>

              
                It has long been recognized that non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) has a low propensity (20%) of becoming muscle-invasive (MIBC), and that MIBC carry many more p53 point mutations (p53m) than NMIBC (50% vs 10%). MIBC also has a higher mutation burden than NMIBC. These results suggest that DNA repair capacities, mutational susceptibility and p53m are crucial for MIBC development. We found MIBC cells are hypermutable, deficient in DNA repair and have markedly downregulated DNA repair genes, XPC, hOGG1/2 and Ref1, and the tumor suppressor, TAp63γ. In contrast, NMIBC cells are hyperactive in DNA repair and exhibit upregulated DNA repair genes and TAp63γ. A parallel exists in human tumors, as MIBC tissues have markedly lower DNA repair activity, and lower expression of DNA repair genes and TAp63γ compared to NMIBC tissues. Forced TAp63γ expression in MIBC significantly mitigates DNA repair deficiencies and reduces mutational susceptibility. Knockdown of TAp63γ in NMIBC greatly reduces DNA repair capacity and enhances mutational susceptibility. Manipulated TAp63γ expression or knockdown of p53m reduce the invasion of MIBC by 40–60%. However, the combination of p53m knockdown with forced TAp63γ expression reduce the invasion ability to nil suggesting that p53m contributes to invasion phenotype independent from TAp63γ. These results indicate that in BC, TAp63γ regulates DNA repair capacities, mutational susceptibility and invasion, and that p53m contribute to the invasion phenotype. We conclude that concurrent TAp63γ suppression and acquisition of p53m are a major cause for MIBC development.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A genetic screen in macrophages identifies new regulators of IFNγ-inducible MHCII that contribute to T cell activation</a></h4>

              
                Cytokine-mediated activation of host immunity is central to the control of pathogens. Interferon-gamma (IFNγ) is a key cytokine in protective immunity that induces major histocompatibility complex class II molecules (MHCII) to amplify CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation and effector function. Despite its central role, the dynamic regulation of IFNg-induced MHCII is not well understood. Using a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen in murine macrophages we identified genes that control MHCII surface expression. Mechanistic studies uncovered two parallel pathways of IFNg-mediated MHCII control that require the multifunctional glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) or the mediator complex subunit MED16. Both pathways control distinct aspects of the IFNg response and are necessary for IFNg-mediated induction of the MHCII transactivator <i>Ciita</i>, MHCII expression, and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation. Our results define previously unappreciated regulation of MHCII expression that is required to control CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses.

                Calcium imaging with protein-based indicators is widely used to follow neural activity in intact nervous systems. The popular GCaMP indicators are based on the calcium-binding protein calmodulin and the RS20 peptide. These sensors report neural activity at timescales much slower than electrical signaling, limited by their biophysical properties and trade-offs between sensitivity and speed. We used large-scale screening and structure-guided mutagenesis to develop and optimize several fast and sensitive GCaMP-type indicators. The resulting jGCaMP8 sensors, based on calmodulin and a fragment of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, have ultra-fast kinetics (rise times, 2 ms) and still feature the highest sensitivity for neural activity reported for any protein-based sensor. jGCaMP8 sensors will allow tracking of larger populations of neurons on timescales relevant to neural computation.

                Duplication of the gene encoding the myelin protein PMP22 causes the hereditary neuropathy Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 1A (CMT1A), characterized by hypomyelination of medium to large peripheral axons. Conversely, haplo-insufficiency of PMP22 leads to focal myelin overgrowth in hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP). However, the molecular mechanisms of myelin growth regulation by PMP22 remain obscure. Here, we found that the major inhibitor of the myelin growth signaling pathway PI3K/Akt/mTOR, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is increased in abundance in CMT1A and decreased in HNPP rodent models. Indeed, treatment of DRG co-cultures from HNPP mice with PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway inhibitors reduced focal hypermyelination and, importantly, treatment of HNPP mice with the mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin improved motor behavior, increased compound muscle amplitudes (CMAP) and reduced tomacula formation in the peripheral nerve. In Pmp22tg CMT1A mice, we uncovered that the differentiation defect of Schwann cells is independent from PI3K/Akt/mTOR activity, rendering the pathway insufficient as a therapy target on its own. Thus, while CMT1A pathogenesis is governed by dys-differentiation uncoupled from PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling, targeting the pathway provides novel proof-of-principle for a therapeutic approach to HNPP.
