     alt="Sexual Dimorphism of Spinal Neural Circuits Controlling the Mouse External Urethral Sphincter With and Without Spinal Cord Injury"/>
<p>Spinal neuronal pool innervating external urethral sphincter (EUS) in female mice has less motoneurons and interneurons compared to males. Spinal cord injury caused the reduction of EUS-related neuronal pool in males but not in females. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Spinal cord injury (SCI) disrupts coordination between the bladder and the external urinary sphincter (EUS), leading to transient or permanent voiding impairment, which is more severe in males. Male versus female differences in spinal circuits related to the EUS as well as post-SCI rewiring are essential for understanding of sex-/gender-specific impairments and possible recovery mechanisms. To quantitatively assess differences between EUS circuits in males versus females and in spinal intact (SI) versus SCI animals, we retrogradely traced and counted EUS-related neurons. In transgenic ChAT-GFP mice, motoneurons (MNs), interneurons (INs), and propriospinal neurons (PPNs) were retrogradely trans-synaptically traced with PRV614-red fluorescent protein (RFP) injected into EUS. EUS-MNs in dorsolateral nucleus (DLN) were separated from other GFP<sup>+</sup> MNs by tracing them with FluoroGold (FG). We found two morphologically distinct cell types in DLN: FG<sup>+</sup> spindle-shaped bipolar (SB-MNs) and FG<sup>−</sup> rounded multipolar (RM-MNs) cholinergic cells. Number of MNs of both types in males was twice as large as in females. SCI caused a partial loss of MNs in all spinal nuclei. After SCI, males showed a fourfold rise in the number of RFP-labeled cells in retro-DLN (RDLN) innervating hind limbs. This suggests (a) an existence of direct synaptic interactions between spinal nuclei and (b) a post-SCI increase of non-specific inputs to EUS-MNs from other motor nuclei. Number of INs and PPNs deferred between males and females: In SI males, the numbers of INs and PPNs were ∼10 times larger than in SI females. SCI caused a twofold decrease of INs and PPNs in males but not in females.</p>

     alt="Early Development of the Thalamo-Pallial Stage of the Tectofugal Visual Pathway in the Chicken (Gallus gallus)"/>
<p>We studied in chicken embryos the development of the thalamo-pallial-intrapallial stages of the tectofugal visual system by means of immunohistochemical assays and ex vivo injections of neural tracers. We found that the layered organization of the visual DVR as well as the system of columnar reciprocal connections between vDVR layers (blue axons) were present as early as E8. A highly organized thalamo-vDVR projection (light blue axons) was also present at this stage. Immunohistochemical assays suggest that both systems of projections emerge simultaneously even earlier. Combined with previous findings, these results reveal that, in striking contrast with mammals, the peripheral and central stages of the avian tectofugal pathway develop along different timelines, with a tecto-thalamo-intrapallial organization (green, light blue, and blue axons) arising before and possibly independently of the retino-isthmo-tectal circuit (black and yellow axons; green soma).

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The tectofugal pathway is a highly conserved visual pathway in all amniotes. In birds and mammals, retinorecipient neurons located in the midbrain roof (optic tectum/superior colliculus) are the source of ascending projections to thalamic relays (nucleus rotundus/caudal pulvinar), which in turn project to specific pallial regions (visual dorsal ventricular ridge [vDVR]/temporal cortex) organized according to a columnar recurrent arrangement of interlaminar circuits. Whether or to which extent these striking hodological correspondences arise from comparable developmental processes is at present an open question, mainly due to the scarcity of data about the ontogeny of the avian tectofugal system. Most of the previous developmental studies of this system in birds have focused on the establishment of the retino-tecto-thalamic connectivity, overlooking the development of the thalamo-pallial-intrapallial circuit. In this work, we studied the latter in chicken embryos by means of immunohistochemical assays and precise ex vivo crystalline injections of biocytin and DiI. We found that the layered organization of the vDVR as well as the system of homotopic reciprocal connections between vDVR layers were present as early as E8. A highly organized thalamo-vDVR projection was also present at this stage. Our immunohistochemical assays suggest that both systems of projections emerge simultaneously even earlier. Combined with previous findings, these results reveal that, in striking contrast with mammals, the peripheral and central stages of the avian tectofugal pathway develop along different timelines, with a tecto-thalamo-intrapallial organization arising before and possibly independently of the retino-isthmo-tectal circuit.</p>

                <p>Dysregulation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) recruitment and oligodendrocyte differentiation contribute to failure of remyelination in human demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Deletion of muscarinic receptor enhances OPC differentiation and remyelination. However, the role of ligand-dependent signaling versus constitutive receptor activation is unknown. We hypothesized that dysregulated acetylcholine (ACh) release upon demyelination contributes to ligand-mediated activation hindering myelin repair. Following chronic cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelination (male and female mice), we observed a 2.5-fold increase in ACh concentration. This increase in ACh concentration could be attributed to increased ACh synthesis or decreased acetylcholinesterase-/butyrylcholinesterase (BChE)-mediated degradation. Using choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) reporter mice, we identified increased ChAT-GFP expression following both lysolecithin and CPZ demyelination. ChAT-GFP expression was upregulated in a subset of injured and uninjured axons following intraspinal lysolecithin-induced demyelination. In CPZ-demyelinated corpus callosum, ChAT-GFP was observed in Gfap<sup>+</sup> astrocytes and axons indicating the potential for neuronal and astrocytic ACh release. <I>BChE</I> expression was significantly decreased in the corpus callosum following CPZ demyelination. This decrease was due to the loss of myelinating oligodendrocytes which were the primary source of BChE. To determine the role of ligand-mediated muscarinic signaling following lysolecithin injection, we administered neostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, to artificially raise ACh. We identified a dose-dependent decrease in mature oligodendrocyte density with no effect on OPC recruitment. Together, these results support a functional role of ligand-mediated activation of muscarinic receptors following demyelination and suggest that dysregulation of ACh homeostasis directly contributes to failure of remyelination in MS.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/28/e0060242024?rss=1">Trying Harder: How Cognitive Effort Sculpts Neural Representations during Working Memory</a></h4>

              
                <p>While the exertion of mental effort improves performance on cognitive tasks, the neural mechanisms by which motivational factors impact cognition remain unknown. Here, we used fMRI to test how changes in cognitive effort, induced by changes in task difficulty, impact neural representations of working memory (WM). Participants (both sexes) were precued whether WM difficulty would be hard or easy. We hypothesized that hard trials demanded more effort as a later decision required finer mnemonic precision. Behaviorally, pupil size was larger and response times were slower on hard compared with easy trials suggesting our manipulation of effort succeeded. Neurally, we observed robust persistent activity during delay periods in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), especially during hard trials. Yet, details of the memoranda could not be decoded from patterns in prefrontal activity. In the patterns of activity in the visual cortex, however, we found strong decoding of memorized targets, where accuracy was higher on hard trials. To potentially link these across-region effects, we hypothesized that effort, carried by persistent activity in the PFC, impacts the quality of WM representations encoded in the visual cortex. Indeed, we found that the amplitude of delay period activity in the frontal cortex predicted decoded accuracy in the visual cortex on a trial-wise basis. These results indicate that effort-related feedback signals sculpt population activity in the visual cortex, improving mnemonic fidelity.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/28/e0222242024?rss=1">Obesity Alters POMC and Kisspeptin Neuron Cross Talk Leading to Reduced Luteinizing Hormone in Male Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Obesity is associated with hypogonadism in males, characterized by low testosterone and sperm number. Previous studies determined that these stem from dysregulation of hypothalamic circuitry that regulates reproduction, by unknown mechanisms. Herein, we used mice fed chronic high-fat diet, which mimics human obesity, to determine mechanisms of impairment at the level of the hypothalamus, in particular gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons that regulate luteinizing hormone (LH), which then regulates testosterone. Consistent with obese humans, we demonstrated lower LH, and lower pulse frequency of LH secretion, but unchanged pituitary responsiveness to GnRH. LH pulse frequency is regulated by pulsatile GnRH secretion, which is controlled by kisspeptin. Peripheral and central kisspeptin injections, and DREADD-mediated activation of kisspeptin neurons, demonstrated that kisspeptin neurons were suppressed in obese mice. Thus, we investigated regulators of kisspeptin secretion. We determined that the LH response to NMDA was lower in obese mice, corresponding to fewer glutamate receptors in kisspeptin neurons, which may be critical for kisspeptin synchronization. Given that kisspeptin neurons also interact with anorexigenic POMC neurons, which are affected by obesity, we examined their cross talk, and determined that the LH response to either DREADD-mediated activation of POMC neurons or central injection of &alpha;MSH, a product of POMC, is abolished in obese mice. This was accompanied by diminished levels of &alpha;MSH receptor, MC4R, in kisspeptin neurons. Together, our studies determined that obesity leads to the downregulation of receptors that regulate kisspeptin neurons, which is associated with lower LH pulse frequency, leading to lower LH and hypogonadism.</p>

                <p>Interspecies comparisons are key to deriving an understanding of the behavioral and neural correlates of human cognition from animal models. We perform a detailed comparison of the strategies of female macaque monkeys to male and female humans on a variant of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), a widely studied and applied task that provides a multiattribute measure of cognitive function and depends on the frontal lobe. WCST performance requires the inference of a rule change given ambiguous feedback. We found that well-trained monkeys infer new rules three times more slowly than minimally instructed humans. Input-dependent hidden Markov model&ndash;generalized linear models were fit to their choices, revealing hidden states akin to feature-based attention in both species. Decision processes resembled a win&ndash;stay, lose&ndash;shift strategy with interspecies similarities as well as key differences. Monkeys and humans both test multiple rule hypotheses over a series of rule-search trials and perform inference-like computations to exclude candidate choice options. We quantitatively show that perseveration, random exploration, and poor sensitivity to negative feedback account for the slower task-switching performance in monkeys.</p>

                <p>SLURP1 and SLURP2 are both small secreted members of the Ly6/u-PAR family of proteins and are highly expressed in keratinocytes. Loss-of-function mutations in SLURP1 lead to a rare autosomal recessive palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK), Mal de Meleda (MdM), which is characterized by diffuse, yellowish palmoplantar hyperkeratosis. Some individuals with MdM experience pain in conjunction with the hyperkeratosis that has been attributed to fissures or microbial superinfection within the affected skin. By comparison, other hereditary PPKs such as pachyonychia congenita and Olmsted syndrome show prevalent pain in PPK lesions. Two mouse models of MdM, Slurp1 knock-out and Slurp2X knock-out, exhibit robust PPK in all four paws. However, whether the sensory experience of these animals includes augmented pain sensitivity remains unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that both models exhibit hypersensitivity to mechanical and thermal stimuli as well as spontaneous pain behaviors in males and females. Anatomical analysis revealed slightly reduced glabrous skin epidermal innervation and substantial alterations in palmoplantar skin immune composition in Slurp2X knock-out mice. Primary sensory neurons innervating hindpaw glabrous skin from Slurp2X knock-out mice exhibit increased incidence of spontaneous activity and mechanical hypersensitivity both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, Slurp knock-out mice exhibit polymodal PPK-associated pain that is associated with both immune alterations and neuronal hyperexcitability and might therefore be useful for the identification of therapeutic targets to treat PPK-associated pain.</p>

                <p>Shank3 is a synaptic scaffolding protein that assists in tethering and organizing structural proteins and glutamatergic receptors in the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses. The localization of Shank3 at excitatory synapses and the formation of stable Shank3 complexes is regulated by the binding of zinc to the C-terminal sterile-alpha-motif (SAM) domain of Shank3. Mutations in the SAM domain of Shank3 result in altered synaptic function and morphology, and disruption of zinc in synapses that express Shank3 leads to a reduction of postsynaptic proteins important for synaptic structure and function. This suggests that zinc supports the localization of postsynaptic proteins via Shank3. Many regions of the brain are highly enriched with free zinc inside glutamatergic vesicles at presynaptic terminals. At these synapses, zinc transporter 3 (ZnT3) moves zinc into vesicles where it is co-released with glutamate. Alterations in ZnT3 are implicated in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders, and ZnT3 knock-out (KO) mice&mdash;which lack synaptic zinc&mdash;show behavioral deficits associated with autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. Here we show that male and female ZnT3 KO mice have smaller dendritic spines and miniature excitatory postsynaptic current amplitudes than wildtype (WT) mice in the auditory cortex. Additionally, spine size deficits in ZnT3 KO mice are restricted to synapses that express Shank3. In WT mice, synapses that express both Shank3 and ZnT3 have larger spines compared to synapses that express Shank3 but not ZnT3. Together these findings suggest a mechanism whereby presynaptic ZnT3-dependent zinc supports postsynaptic structure and function via Shank3 in a synapse-specific manner.</p>

                <p>Temporal prediction assists language comprehension. In a series of recent behavioral studies, we have shown that listeners specifically employ rhythmic modulations of prosody to estimate the duration of upcoming sentences, thereby speeding up comprehension. In the current human magnetoencephalography (MEG) study on participants of either sex, we show that the human brain achieves this function through a mechanism termed entrainment. Through entrainment, electrophysiological brain activity maintains and continues contextual rhythms beyond their offset. Our experiment combined exposure to repetitive prosodic contours with the subsequent presentation of visual sentences that either matched or mismatched the duration of the preceding contour. During exposure to prosodic contours, we observed MEG coherence with the contours, which was source-localized to right-hemispheric auditory areas. During the processing of the visual targets, activity at the frequency of the preceding contour was still detectable in the MEG; yet sources shifted to the (left) frontal cortex, in line with a functional inheritance of the rhythmic acoustic context for prediction. Strikingly, when the target sentence was shorter than expected from the preceding contour, an omission response appeared in the evoked potential record. We conclude that prosodic entrainment is a functional mechanism of temporal prediction in language comprehension. In general, acoustic rhythms appear to endow language for employing the brain's electrophysiological mechanisms of temporal prediction.</p>

                <p>Tau pathologies are detected in the brains of some of the most common neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Lewy body dementia (LBD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Tau proteins are expressed in six isoforms with either three or four microtubule-binding repeats (3R tau or 4R tau) due to alternative RNA splicing. AD, LBD, and CTE brains contain pathological deposits of both 3R and 4R tau. FTD patients can exhibit either 4R tau pathologies in most cases or 3R tau pathologies less commonly in Pick's disease, which is a subfamily of FTD. Here, we report the isoform-specific roles of tau in FTD. The P301L mutation, linked to familial 4R tau FTD, induces mislocalization of 4R tau to dendritic spines in primary hippocampal cultures that were prepared from neonatal rat pups of both sexes. Contrastingly, the G272V mutation, linked to familial Pick's disease, induces phosphorylation-dependent mislocalization of 3R tau but not 4R tau proteins to dendritic spines. The overexpression of G272V 3R tau but not 4R tau proteins leads to the reduction of dendritic spine density and suppression of mEPSCs in 5-week-old primary rat hippocampal cultures. The decrease in mEPSC amplitude caused by G272V 3R tau is dynamin-dependent whereas that caused by P301L 4R tau is dynamin-independent, indicating that the two tau isoforms activate different signaling pathways responsible for excitatory synaptic dysfunction. Our 3R and 4R tau studies here will shed new light on diverse mechanisms underlying FTD, AD, LBD, and CTE.</p>

                <p>The vagal ganglia, comprised of the superior (jugular) and inferior (nodose) ganglia of the vagus nerve, receive somatosensory information from the head and neck or viscerosensory information from the inner organs, respectively. Developmentally, the cranial neural crest gives rise to all vagal glial cells and to neurons of the jugular ganglia, while the epibranchial placode gives rise to neurons of the nodose ganglia. Crest-derived nodose glial progenitors can additionally generate autonomic neurons in the peripheral nervous system, but how these progenitors generate neurons is unknown. Here, we found that some Sox10+ neural crest-derived cells in, and surrounding, the nodose ganglion transiently expressed Phox2b, a master regulator of autonomic nervous system development, during early embryonic life. Our genetic lineage-tracing analysis in mice of either sex revealed that despite their common developmental origin and extreme spatial proximity, a substantial proportion of glial cells in the nodose, but not in the neighboring jugular ganglia, have a history of Phox2b expression. We used single-cell RNA&ndash;sequencing to demonstrate that these progenitors give rise to all major glial subtypes in the nodose ganglia, including Schwann cells, satellite glia, and glial precursors, and mapped their spatial distribution by in situ hybridization. Lastly, integration analysis revealed transcriptomic similarities between nodose and dorsal root ganglia glial subtypes and revealed immature nodose glial subtypes. Our work demonstrates that these crest-derived nodose glial progenitors transiently express Phox2b, give rise to the entire complement of nodose glial cells, and display a transcriptional program that may underlie their bipotent nature.</p>

                <p>NMDA receptors (NMDARs) may be crucial to working memory (WM). Computational models predict that they sustain neural firing and produce associative memory, which may underpin maintaining and binding information, respectively. We test this in patients with antibodies to NMDAR (<I>n</I> = 10, female) and compare them with healthy control participants (<I>n</I> = 55, 20 male, 35 female). Patients were tested after recovery with a task that separates two aspects of WM: sustaining attention and feature binding. Participants had to remember two colored arrows. Then attention was directed to one of them. After a variable delay, they reported the direction of either the same arrow (congruent cue) or of the other arrow (incongruent cue). We asked how congruency affected recall precision and measured types of error. Patients had difficulty in both sustaining attention to an item over time and feature binding. Controls were less precise after longer delays and incongruent cues. In contrast, patients did not benefit from congruent cues at longer delays [group <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> congruency (long condition); <I>p</I> = 0.041], indicating they could not sustain attention. Additionally, patients reported the wrong item (misbinding errors) more than controls after congruent cues [group <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> delay (congruent condition), main effect of group; <I>p </I>&le; 0.001]. Our results suggest NMDARs are critical for both maintaining attention and feature binding.</p>

                <p>Congenital single-sided deafness (SSD) leads to an aural preference syndrome that is characterized by overrepresentation of the hearing ear in the auditory system. Cochlear implantation (CI) of the deaf ear is an effective treatment for SSD. However, the newly introduced auditory input in congenital SSD often does not reach expectations in late-implanted CI recipients with respect to binaural hearing and speech perception. In a previous study, a reduction of the interaural time difference (ITD) sensitivity has been shown in unilaterally congenitally deaf cats (uCDCs). In the present study, we focused on the interaural level difference (ILD) processing in the primary auditory cortex. The uCDC group was compared with hearing cats (HCs) and bilaterally congenitally deaf cats (CDCs). The ILD representation was reorganized, replacing the preference for the contralateral ear with a preference for the hearing ear, regardless of the cortical hemisphere. In accordance with the previous study, uCDCs were less sensitive to interaural time differences than HCs, resulting in unmodulated ITD responses, thus lacking directional information. Such incongruent ITDs and ILDs cannot be integrated for binaural sound source localization. In normal hearing, the predominant effect of each ear is excitation of the auditory cortex in the contralateral cortical hemisphere and inhibition in the ipsilateral hemisphere. In SSD, however, auditory pathways reorganized such that the hearing ear produced greater excitation in both cortical hemispheres and the deaf ear produced weaker excitation and preserved inhibition in both cortical hemispheres.</p>

                <p>Chronic sleep disruption (CSD), from insufficient or fragmented sleep and is an important risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Underlying mechanisms are not understood. CSD in mice results in degeneration of locus ceruleus neurons (LCn) and CA1 hippocampal neurons and increases hippocampal amyloid-&beta;<SUB>42</SUB> (A&beta;<SUB>42</SUB>), entorhinal cortex (EC) tau phosphorylation (p-tau), and glial reactivity. LCn injury is increasingly implicated in AD pathogenesis. CSD increases NE turnover in LCn, and LCn norepinephrine (NE) metabolism activates asparagine endopeptidase (AEP), an enzyme known to cleave amyloid precursor protein (APP) and tau into neurotoxic fragments. We hypothesized that CSD would activate LCn AEP in an NE-dependent manner to induce LCn and hippocampal injury. Here, we studied LCn, hippocampal, and EC responses to CSD in mice deficient in NE [dopamine &beta;-hydroxylase (<I>Dbh</I>)<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>] and control male and female mice, using a model of chronic fragmentation of sleep (CFS). Sleep was equally fragmented in <I>Dbh</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> and control male and female mice, yet only <I>Dbh</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice conferred resistance to CFS loss of LCn, LCn p-tau, and LCn AEP upregulation and activation as evidenced by an increase in AEP-cleaved APP and tau fragments. Absence of NE also prevented a CFS increase in hippocampal AEP-APP and A&beta;<SUB>42</SUB> but did not prevent CFS-increased AEP-tau and p-tau in the EC. Collectively, this work demonstrates AEP activation by CFS, establishes key roles for NE in both CFS degeneration of LCn neurons and CFS promotion of forebrain A&beta; accumulation, and, thereby, identifies a key molecular link between CSD and specific AD neural injuries.</p>

                <p>The zebrafish, a widely used model in neurobiology, relies on hearing in aquatic environments. Unfortunately, its auditory pathways have mainly been studied in larvae. In this study, we examined the involvement of the anterior tuberal nucleus (AT) in auditory processing in adult zebrafish. Our tract-tracing experiments revealed that the dorsal subdivision of AT is strongly bidirectionally connected to the central nucleus of the torus semicircularis (TSc), a major auditory nucleus in fishes. Immunohistochemical visualization of the ribosomal protein S6 (pS6) phosphorylation to map neural activity in response to auditory stimulation substantiated this finding: the dorsal but not the ventral part of AT responded strongly to auditory stimulation. A similar response to auditory stimulation was present in the TSc but not in the nucleus isthmi, a visual region, which we used as a control for testing if the pS6 activation was specific to the auditory stimulation. We also measured the time course of pS6 phosphorylation, which was previously unreported in teleost fish. After auditory stimulation, we found that pS6 phosphorylation peaked between 100 and 130&nbsp;min and returned to baseline levels after 190&nbsp;min. This information will be valuable for the design of future pS6 experiments. Our results suggest an anatomical and functional subdivision of AT, where only the dorsal part connects to the auditory network and processes auditory information.</p>

                <p>Epilepsy is often comorbid with psychiatric illnesses, including anxiety and depression. Despite the high incidence of psychiatric comorbidities in people with epilepsy, few studies address the underlying mechanisms. Stress can trigger epilepsy and depression. Evidence from human and animal studies supports that hypothalamic&ndash;pituitary&ndash;adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction may contribute to both disorders and their comorbidity (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B16">Kanner, 2003</cross-ref>). Here, we investigate if HPA axis dysfunction may influence epilepsy outcomes and psychiatric comorbidities. We generated a novel mouse model (<I>Kcc2</I>/<I>Crh</I> KO mice) lacking the K<sup>+</sup>/Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> cotransporter, KCC2, in corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons, which exhibit stress- and seizure-induced HPA axis hyperactivation (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B25">Melon et al., 2018</cross-ref>). We used the <I>Kcc2</I>/<I>Crh</I> KO mice to examine the impact on epilepsy outcomes, including seizure frequency/burden, comorbid behavioral deficits, and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) risk. We found sex differences in HPA axis dysfunction&rsquo;s effect on chronically epileptic KCC2/Crh KO mice seizure burden, vulnerability to comorbid behavioral deficits, and SUDEP. Suppressing HPA axis hyperexcitability in this model using pharmacological or chemogenetic approaches decreased SUDEP incidence, suggesting that HPA axis dysfunction may contribute to SUDEP. Altered neuroendocrine markers were present in SUDEP cases compared with people with epilepsy or individuals without epilepsy. Together, these findings implicate HPA axis dysfunction in the pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to psychiatric comorbidities in epilepsy and SUDEP.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-788/v1?src=rss">Cheating and plagiarism in higher education institutions (HEIs): A literature review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Cheating and plagiarism have become serious problems in higher education institutions (HEIs). It affects educational quality as well as the reputation of higher education. The purpose of this study is to identify the most prevalent types of cheating and plagiarism, as well as the elements that contribute to cheating and plagiarism, and to present solutions to this recurring problem. This paper systematically reviews 45 articles published from 2018, to 2022, aligned with the PRISMA guidelines in the selection, filtering, and reporting of the papers. This review shows that factors such as increased pressure on students, poor academic integrity awareness, lack of up-to-date academic honor codes, and the unethical application of AI tools are prime contributing factors to cheating and plagiarism in HEIs. In a broader sense, all these factors are classified as individual, social, cultural, institutional, and technological factors that are responsible for this problem. This problem can be reduced by establishing ethical and moral development tutorials as well as formulating up-to-date honor codes considering AI tools. Furthermore, higher education institutions must develop anti-plagiarism detection software in order to detect plagiarism and aid students in improving academic writing and paraphrasing approaches. The findings of this systematic literature review provide useful insights for educators and policymakers to solve the complicated issue of cheating and plagiarism in higher education institutions.

Dimension reduction tools preserving similarity and graph structure such as <i>t</i>-SNE and UMAP can capture complex biological patterns in high-dimensional data. However, these tools typically are not designed to separate effects of interest from unwanted effects due to confounders. We introduce the partial embedding (PARE) framework, which enables removal of confounders from any distance-based dimension reduction method. We then develop partial <i>t</i>-SNE and partial UMAP and apply these methods to genomic and neuroimaging data. For lower-dimensional visualization, our results show that the PARE framework can remove batch effects in single-cell sequencing data as well as separate clinical and technical variability in neuroimaging measures. We demonstrate that the PARE framework extends dimension reduction methods to highlight biological patterns of interest while effectively removing confounding effects.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012240">Jointly efficient encoding and decoding in neural populations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Simone Blanco Malerba, Aurora Micheli, Michael Woodford, Rava Azeredo da Silveira</p>

The efficient coding approach proposes that neural systems represent as much sensory information as biological constraints allow. It aims at formalizing encoding as a constrained optimal process. A different approach, that aims at formalizing decoding, proposes that neural systems instantiate a generative model of the sensory world. Here, we put forth a normative framework that characterizes neural systems as jointly optimizing encoding and decoding. It takes the form of a variational autoencoder: sensory stimuli are encoded in the noisy activity of neurons to be interpreted by a flexible decoder; encoding must allow for an accurate stimulus reconstruction from neural activity. Jointly, neural activity is required to represent the statistics of latent features which are mapped by the decoder into distributions over sensory stimuli; decoding correspondingly optimizes the accuracy of the generative model. This framework yields in a family of encoding-decoding models, which result in equally accurate generative models, indexed by a measure of the stimulus-induced deviation of neural activity from the marginal distribution over neural activity. Each member of this family predicts a specific relation between properties of the sensory neurons—such as the arrangement of the tuning curve means (preferred stimuli) and widths (degrees of selectivity) in the population—as a function of the statistics of the sensory world. Our approach thus generalizes the efficient coding approach. Notably, here, the form of the constraint on the optimization derives from the requirement of an accurate generative model, while it is arbitrary in efficient coding models. Moreover, solutions do not require the knowledge of the stimulus distribution, but are learned on the basis of data samples; the constraint further acts as regularizer, allowing the model to generalize beyond the training data. Finally, we characterize the family of models we obtain through alternate measures of performance, such as the error in stimulus reconstruction. We find that a range of models admits comparable performance; in particular, a population of sensory neurons with broad tuning curves as observed experimentally yields both low reconstruction stimulus error and an accurate generative model that generalizes robustly to unseen data.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002655">A molecularly defined subpopulation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells controls the generation of myelinating oligodendrocytes during postnatal development</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shayan Moghimyfiroozabad, Maela A. Paul, Lea Bellenger, Fekrije Selimi</p>

Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are a class of glial cells that uniformly tiles the entire central nervous system (CNS). They play several key functions across the brain including the generation of oligodendrocytes and the control of myelination. Whether the functional diversity of OPCs is the result of genetically defined subpopulations or of their regulation by external factors has not been definitely established. We discovered that a subpopulation of OPCs found across the brain is defined by the expression of <i>C1ql1</i>, a gene previously described for its synaptic function in neurons. This subpopulation starts to appear during the first postnatal week in the mouse cortex. Ablation of <i>C1ql1</i>-expressing OPCs in the mouse leads to a massive lack of oligodendrocytes and myelination in many brain regions. This deficit cannot be rescued, even though some OPCs escape <i>Sox10</i>-driven ablation and end up partially compensating the OPC loss in the adult. Therefore, <i>C1ql1</i> is a molecular marker of a functionally non-redundant subpopulation of OPCs, which controls the generation of myelinating oligodendrocytes.

                Introduction Getting acceptable cosmetic results in the soft tissues of the face serves as the foundation for orthodontic treatment planning. Also, in order to achieve healthy static and dynamic occlusal interactions, the teeth must be positioned within the basal bone at the correct position, angle, and inclination. To avoid periodontal issues, provide stability, and achieve a functional occlusion, it is essential to ascertain the individual’s dental arch form before starting of treatment and thus to utilise the mechanics that follow throughout the treatment. Objectives To evaluate and compare variation in Curve of Spee and Curve of Wilson in Class II Div.-1, Class II-Div-2 and Class-III as against Class I malocclusion in central India population. Methodology Irreversible hydrocolloid impression will be taken with perforated metal stock trays and stone cast will be poured. This will be scanned using CAD CAM machine and curve of Spee and Wilson will be measured using reverse engineering. Expected Result It will assist us in treatment planning for preventing periodontal issues, assuring stability, and achieving functional occlusion by evaluating and comparing the Spee and Wilson curves in Class II Divison-1, Class II Divison-2, and Class-III malocclusion with Class-I malocclusion. Conclusion Every single patient receiving orthodontic treatment has the COS, which is crucial to achieving a stable occlusion. Almost every patient who receives orthodontic treatment eventually experiences the Spee Curve. Since there aren’t many studies examining the relationship between the Curves of Spee and Wilson, their impact on dentoskeletal morphology, and their role in occlusal stability.

                Background: The phylogenetic bootstrap, first proposed by Felsenstein in 1985, is a critically important statistical method in assessing the robusticity of phylogenetic datasets. Core to its concept was the use of pseudo sampling - assessing the data by generating new replicates derived from the initial dataset that was used to generate the phylogeny. In this way, phylogenetic support metrics could overcome the lack of perfect, infinite data. With infinite data, however, it is possible to sample smaller replicates directly from the data to obtain both the phylogeny and its statistical robusticity in the same analysis. Due to the growth of whole genome sequencing, the depth and breadth of our datasets have greatly expanded and are set to only expand further. With genome-scale datasets comprising thousands of genes, we can now obtain a proxy for infinite data. Accordingly, we can potentially abandon the notion of pseudo sampling and instead randomly sample small subsets of genes from the thousands of genes in our analyses. Methods: We introduce Scoutknife, a jackknife-style subsampling implementation that generates 100 datasets by randomly sampling a small number of genes from an initial large-gene dataset to jointly establish both a phylogenetic hypothesis and assess its robusticity. We assess its effectiveness by using 18 previously published datasets and 100 simulation studies. Results: We show that Scoutknife is conservative and informative as to conflicts and incongruence across the whole genome, without the need for subsampling based on traditional model selection criteria. Conclusions: Scoutknife reliably achieves comparable results to selecting the best genes on both real and simulation datasets, while being resistant to the potential biases caused by selecting for model fit. As the amount of genome data grows, it becomes an even more exciting option to assess the robusticity of phylogenetic hypotheses.

                Sequestosome-1, encoded by the gene SQSTM1, functions as a bridge between ubiquitinated proteins and the proteasome or autophagosome, thereby regulating protein degradation pathways. Loss of Sequestosome-1 is hypothesized to enhance neurodegeneration progression in several diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal disorders (FTD). Sequestosome-1 reproducible research would be facilitated with the availability of well-characterized anti-Sequestosome-1 antibodies. In this study, we characterized seventeen Sequestosome-1 commercial antibodies for Western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. We identified many high-performing antibodies and encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibody for their specific needs.

                Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by SARS-CoV-2 that has infected more than 600 million people and killed more than 6 million people worldwide. This infection affects mainly certain groups of people that have high susceptibility to present severe COVID-19 due to comorbidities. Moreover, the long-COVID-19 comprises a series of symptoms that may remain in some patients for months after infection that further compromises their health. Thus, since this pandemic is profoundly affecting health, economy, and social life of societies, a deeper understanding of viral replication cycle could help to envisage novel therapeutic alternatives that limit or stop COVID-19. Several findings have unexpectedly discovered that mitochondria play a critical role in SARS-CoV-2 cell infection. Indeed, it has been suggested that this organelle could be the origin of its replication niches, the double membrane vesicles (DMV). In this regard, mitochondria derived vesicles (MDV), involved in mitochondria quality control, discovered almost 15 years ago, comprise a subpopulation characterized by a double membrane. MDV shedding is induced by mitochondrial stress, and it has a fast assembly dynamic, reason that perhaps has precluded their identification in electron microscopy or tomography studies. These and other features of MDV together with recent SARS-CoV-2 protein interactome and other findings link SARS-CoV-2 to mitochondria and support that these vesicles are the precursors of SARS-CoV-2 induced DMV. In this work, the morphological, biochemical, molecular, and cellular evidence that supports this hypothesis is reviewed and integrated into the current model of SARS-CoV-2 cell infection. In this scheme, some relevant questions are raised as pending topics for research that would help in the near future to test this hypothesis. The intention of this work is to provide a novel framework that could open new possibilities to tackle SARS-CoV-2 pandemic through mitochondria and DMV targeted therapies.

                Background One of the largest hazards to human health is obesity, which is intimately related to sedentarism and physical inactivity. Understanding the perspectives and attitudes of adults with overweight or obesity towards their lifestyle choices related to sedentary behavior and physical activity is essential for mitigating associated health risks. Objective This systematic review aims to collate the extent of qualitative research on the perception of sedentary behavior and physical activity among adults with overweight and obesity. Methods A comprehensive search of Scopus, PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science, databases was conducted, which yielded 2,881 articles. A total of 2591 abstracts were screened, and 45 full-text articles were examined. A total of nine qualitative studies involving adults with overweight or obesity (BMI > 25 kg/m2) were included in this systematic review. Data extraction utilized Rayyan.qcri.org software, and studies were critically appraised using Joanna Briggs’s Institute checklist for qualitative research. Results The included studies revealed a diverse array of themes, wherein a few perceived factors reported towards sedentary behavior were lack of awareness about the hazards, mode of relaxation, family commitment, technology use, motivation deficits, and fatigue. Barriers to physical activity encompassed social, cultural, and environmental factors. In contrast, peer support, fitness facility access, accountability, mental health awareness, well-being, and weight management facilitate physical activity involvement. Conclusion Perceptions in overweight and obese adults on sedentary living and exercise are intricate and multifaceted. This review provides valuable insights that can inform clinicians and researchers in promoting regular physical activity for adults with overweight and obesity.

                Background Postoperative cardiac surgery patients often experience appetite loss. Although nutritional status is known to be associated with time of recovery, functional status, and length of stay, less is known about factors related to patient’s loss of appetite after cardiac surgery. This review aimed to identify and understand factors related to loss of appetite in postoperative cardiac surgery patients, systematic review with narrative summary design was applied. Data sources including CINAHL, SCOPUS, PubMed, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, ThaiLIS, ThaiJo, and E-Thesis were searched without restriction on publication year through August 2020. Methods We conducted the review following the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology, using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) checklist to categorize methodological quality and the PRISMA flow diagram to record the studies’ factors. Results Six studies reported one or more of 16 factors related to loss of appetite: older age, sex (female), illiteracy, history of chronic disease, not knowing someone in health field, pain score ≥ 7, pain medications containing codeine, constipation, depression, heart-lung machine ≥ 120 minutes, preoperative serum creatinine levels ≥ 179 µmol/L, emergency surgery, perfusion pressure ≤ 40 mmHg, low cardiac output syndrome, mechanical ventilation ≥ 96 hours, and a New York Heart Association class III and IV. Conclusion The small number of publications restrict our conclusions. Future research should focus on multiple factors related to appetite loss in postoperative cardiac surgery patients. Additional research will provide a foundation for evidence-based interventions to reduce appetite loss and improve patient nutritional status after cardiac surgery. Nurses and other health professionals should assess postoperative cardiac surgery patients for the presence of the 16 significant factors. To promote patients’ nutritional status, there should be evidence-based practice guidelines on the management of postoperative symptoms such as pain management, treatment of constipation, and reduction of emotional stress and depression.

Their findings suggest that strategies focusing on inhibiting NUAK1, either alone or combined with chemotherapy, could represent an approach for gastric cancer treatment.

                Yu et al. show that cysteine availability is key for melanoma cells to maintain their melanocytic identity, lysosomal functions, defend against an iron-dependent cell death termed ferroptosis, and prevent metastatic spread. This study highlights how melanoma cells rely on cysteine to allow epigenetic control of the differentiated melanocytic fate.

Carbohydrates and arginine are indispensable for oral tolerance induction. Prior food intake and nutritional signals are critical for maintaining immune homeostasis by inducing tolerance to ingested food antigens.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94094">Hemodynamics regulate spatiotemporal artery muscularization in the developing circle of Willis</a></h4>

              
                Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) envelop vertebrate brain arteries and play a crucial role in regulating cerebral blood flow and neurovascular coupling. The dedifferentiation of VSMCs is implicated in cerebrovascular disease and neurodegeneration. Despite its importance, the process of VSMC differentiation on brain arteries during development remains inadequately characterized. Understanding this process could aid in reprogramming and regenerating dedifferentiated VSMCs in cerebrovascular diseases. In this study, we investigated VSMC differentiation on zebrafish circle of Willis (CoW), comprising major arteries that supply blood to the vertebrate brain. We observed that arterial specification of CoW endothelial cells (ECs) occurs after their migration from cranial venous plexus to form CoW arteries. Subsequently, <i>acta2</i>+ VSMCs differentiate from <i>pdgfrb</i>+ mural cell progenitors after they were recruited to CoW arteries. The progression of VSMC differentiation exhibits a spatiotemporal pattern, advancing from anterior to posterior CoW arteries. Analysis of blood flow suggests that earlier VSMC differentiation in anterior CoW arteries correlates with higher red blood cell velocity and wall shear stress. Furthermore, pulsatile flow induces differentiation of human brain PDGFRB+ mural cells into VSMCs, and blood flow is required for VSMC differentiation on zebrafish CoW arteries. Consistently, flow-responsive transcription factor <i>klf2a</i> is activated in ECs of CoW arteries prior to VSMC differentiation, and <i>klf2a</i> knockdown delays VSMC differentiation on anterior CoW arteries. In summary, our findings highlight blood flow activation of endothelial <i>klf2a</i> as a mechanism regulating initial VSMC differentiation on vertebrate brain arteries.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93450">Adipokinetic hormone signaling mediates the enhanced fecundity of Diaphorina citri infected by ‘Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus’</a></h4>

              
                <i>Diaphorina citri</i> serves as the primary vector for ‘<i>Candidatus</i> Liberibacter asiaticus (<i>C</i>Las),’ the bacterium associated with the severe Asian form of huanglongbing. <i>C</i>Las-positive <i>D. citri</i> are more fecund than their <i>C</i>Las-negative counterparts and require extra energy expenditure. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms linking metabolism and reproduction is of particular importance. In this study, we found adipokinetic hormone (<i>DcAKH</i>) and its receptor (<i>DcAKHR</i>) were essential for increasing lipid metabolism and fecundity in response to <i>C</i>Las infection in <i>D. citri</i>. Knockdown of <i>DcAKH</i> and <i>DcAKHR</i> not only resulted in the accumulation of triacylglycerol and a decline of glycogen, but also significantly decreased fecundity and <i>C</i>Las titer in ovaries. Combined in vivo and in vitro experiments showed that miR-34 suppresses <i>DcAKHR</i> expression by binding to its 3’ untranslated region, whilst overexpression of miR-34 resulted in a decline of <i>DcAKHR</i> expression and <i>C</i>Las titer in ovaries and caused defects that mimicked <i>DcAKHR</i> knockdown phenotypes. Additionally, knockdown of <i>DcAKH</i> and <i>DcAKHR</i> significantly reduced juvenile hormone (JH) titer and JH signaling pathway genes in fat bodies and ovaries, including the JH receptor, <i>methoprene-tolerant</i> (<i>DcMet</i>), and the transcription factor, <i>Krüppel homolog 1 (DcKr-h1</i>), that acts downstream of it, as well as the egg development related genes <i>vitellogenin 1-like</i> (<i>DcVg-1-like</i>), <i>vitellogenin A1-like</i> (<i>DcVg-A1-like</i>) and the vitellogenin receptor (<i>DcVgR</i>). As a result, <i>C</i>Las hijacks AKH/AKHR-miR-34-JH signaling to improve <i>D. citri</i> lipid metabolism and fecundity, while simultaneously increasing the replication of <i>C</i>Las, suggesting a mutualistic interaction between <i>C</i>Las and <i>D. citri</i> ovaries.

                Despite long-running efforts to increase gender diversity among tenured and tenure-track faculty in the U.S., women remain underrepresented in most academic fields, sometimes dramatically so. Here, we quantify the relative importance of faculty hiring and faculty attrition for both past and future faculty gender diversity using comprehensive data on the training and employment of 268,769 tenured and tenure-track faculty rostered at 12,112U.S. PhD-granting departments, spanning 111 academic fields between 2011 and 2020. Over this time, we find that hiring had a far greater impact on women’s representation among faculty than attrition in the majority (90.1%) of academic fields, even as academia loses a higher share of women faculty relative to men at every career stage. Finally, we model the impact of five specific policy interventions on women’s representation, and project that eliminating attrition differences between women and men only leads to a marginal increase in women’s overall representation—in most fields, successful interventions will need to make substantial and sustained changes to hiring in order to reach gender parity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91122">Plasticity of the proteasome-targeting signal Fat10 enhances substrate degradation</a></h4>

              
                The proteasome controls levels of most cellular proteins, and its activity is regulated under stress, quiescence, and inflammation. However, factors determining the proteasomal degradation rate remain poorly understood. Proteasome substrates are conjugated with small proteins (tags) like ubiquitin and Fat10 to target them to the proteasome. It is unclear if the structural plasticity of proteasome-targeting tags can influence substrate degradation. Fat10 is upregulated during inflammation, and its substrates undergo rapid proteasomal degradation. We report that the degradation rate of Fat10 substrates critically depends on the structural plasticity of Fat10. While the ubiquitin tag is recycled at the proteasome, Fat10 is degraded with the substrate. Our results suggest significantly lower thermodynamic stability and faster mechanical unfolding in Fat10 compared to ubiquitin. Long-range salt bridges are absent in the Fat10 structure, creating a plastic protein with partially unstructured regions suitable for proteasome engagement. Fat10 plasticity destabilizes substrates significantly and creates partially unstructured regions in the substrate to enhance degradation. NMR-relaxation-derived order parameters and temperature dependence of chemical shifts identify the Fat10-induced partially unstructured regions in the substrate, which correlated excellently to Fat10-substrate contacts, suggesting that the tag-substrate collision destabilizes the substrate. These results highlight a strong dependence of proteasomal degradation on the structural plasticity and thermodynamic properties of the proteasome-targeting tags.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90634">Statistical learning shapes pain perception and prediction independently of external cues</a></h4>

              
                The placebo and nocebo effects highlight the importance of expectations in modulating pain perception, but in everyday life we don’t need an external source of information to form expectations about pain. The brain can learn to predict pain in a more fundamental way, simply by experiencing ﬂuctuating, non-random streams of noxious inputs, and extracting their temporal regularities. This process is called statistical learning. Here, we address a key open question: does statistical learning modulate pain perception? We asked 27 participants to both rate and predict pain intensity levels in sequences of ﬂuctuating heat pain. Using a computational approach, we show that probabilistic expectations and confidence were used to weigh pain perception and prediction. As such, this study goes beyond well-established conditioning paradigms associating non-pain cues with pain outcomes, and shows that statistical learning itself shapes pain experience. This finding opens a new path of research into the brain mechanisms of pain regulation, with relevance to chronic pain where it may be dysfunctional.

                Accurate tracking of the same neurons across multiple days is crucial for studying changes in neuronal activity during learning and adaptation. Advances in high-density extracellular electrophysiology recording probes, such as Neuropixels, provide a promising avenue to accomplish this goal. Identifying the same neurons in multiple recordings is, however, complicated by non-rigid movement of the tissue relative to the recording sites (drift) and loss of signal from some neurons. Here, we propose a neuron tracking method that can identify the same cells independent of firing statistics, that are used by most existing methods. Our method is based on between-day non-rigid alignment of spike-sorted clusters. We verified the same cell identity in mice using measured visual receptive fields. This method succeeds on datasets separated from 1 to 47 days, with an 84% average recovery rate.

">Golgi cells regulate timing and variability of information transfer in a cerebellar-behavioural loop</a></h4>

              
                Golgi cells are inhibitory interneurons residing in the input layer of the cerebellar cortex. These neurons sit in a key position to govern the transformation of incoming information from extracerebellar regions and influence downstream cerebellar processing. Here, we examine the contribution of Golgi cells to network dynamics in Crus 1 of mouse lateral cerebellar cortex during free whisking. We recorded neuronal population activity using NeuroPixels probes before and after chemogenetic downregulation of Golgi cell activity. Under resting conditions, cerebellar population activity reliably encoded whisker movements. Reductions in Golgi cell activity produced mild increases in neural activity which did not significantly impair these sensorimotor representations. However, reduced Golgi cell inhibition did increase the temporal alignment of local population network activity at the initiation of movement. These network alterations had variable impacts on behaviour, producing both increases and decreases in whisking velocity. Our results suggest that Golgi cell inhibition primarily governs the temporal patterning of population activity, which in turn is required to support downstream cerebellar dynamics and behavioural coordination.

">Cerebellar contribution to cognitive deficits and prefrontal cortex dysfunction in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1 (SCA1)</a></h4>

              
                The cerebellum role in cognition and its functional bi-directional connectivity with prefrontal cortex (PFC) is well recognized. However, how chronic cerebellar dysfunction affects PFC function and cognition remains less understood. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), is an inherited, fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by an abnormal expansion of glutamine (Q) encoding CAG repeats in the gene Ataxin-1 (ATXN1) and characterized by severe loss of Purkinje cells (PCs) in the cerebellum. Patients with SCA1 suffer from movement and balance deficits, cognitive decline and premature lethality. Cognitive deficits significantly impact patients quality of life, yet how exactly cerebellar degeneration contributes to cognitive deficits and PFC dysfunction in SCA1 is unknown. We have previously demonstrated that expression of mutant ATXN1 only in cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) is sufficient to cause cognitive deficits in a transgenic ATXN1[82Q] mouse line. To understand how cerebellar dysfunction impacts the PFC, we examined neuronal activity, synaptic density, and gene expression changes in the PFC of ATXN1[82Q] mice. Remarkably, we found decreased neuronal activity, reduced synaptic density, and altered expression of immediate early genes and pathways involved in glucose metabolism, inflammation and amphetamine in the PFC of ATXN1[82Q] mice. Furthermore, we characterized cellular and molecular PFC dysfunction in a novel conditional knock-in SCA1 line, f-ATXN1146Q mice, expressing floxed human expanded ATXN1 throughout the brain. Intriguingly, we found an increased number of neurons, increased synaptic density and large gene expression alterations in the PFC of f-ATXN1146Q mice. Finally, to precisely determine the role of cerebellar dysfunction in cognitive deficits and PFC dysfunction in SCA1, we crossed f-ATXN1146Q mice with Pcp2-Cre mice expressing Cre recombinase in PCs to delete expanded ATXN1 only in PCs. Surprisingly, we have found that deleting expanded ATXN1 in PCs exacerbated cognitive deficits and PFC dysfunction in these mice. Our findings demonstrate that circumscribed cerebellar dysfunction is sufficient to impact PFC activity and synaptic connectivity impairing cognition. However, when multiple brain regions are impacted in disease, cerebellar dysfunction may ameliorate PFC pathology and cognitive performance.

">Striatal endocannabinoid-long-term potentiation mediates one-shot learning</a></h4>

              
                The ability to learn and adapt its behavior from salient events encountered only once is crucial for survival. Few action potentials may be elicited during such one-shot learning, challenging usual learning frameworks. While the striatum is classically associated with incremental learning, some activity changes have been detected during the initial learning phase, but following several and/or long trials. Hence, the striatal engram for one-shot learning per se remains to be elucidated. Here, we show in a novel one-shot behavioral test in mice, the sticky tape avoidance test, that in vivo striatal long-term potentiation (LTP) emerges after a single, spontaneous and brief contact with an uncomfortable stimulus, and is associated with its subsequent avoidance that can last more than a month. We found that the non-classical endocannabinoid-mediated LTP, shown to occur in vitro after a small number of action potentials, is engaged during one-shot learning, even for brief exposures to the stimulus, and that paired cortico-striatal network activity shows behaviorally-correlated changes in activity consistent with endocannabinoid-mediated LTP induction during contact. Furthermore, we found impairments of one-shot learning in conditional knock-out mice affecting endocannabinoid-mediated LTP. Our results thus reveal new functional relevance of endocannabinoids in activity-dependent boundaries delineating synaptic plasticity expression in one-shot learning. This opens new avenues for understanding the effects of endo- and phyto-cannabinoids, including endocannabinoid-based medicinal drugs, on learning and memory.

">Functional ultrasound imaging and neuronal activity: how accurate is the spatiotemporal match?</a></h4>

              
                Over the last decade, functional ultrasound (fUS) has risen as a critical tool in functional neuroimaging, leveraging hemodynamic changes to infer neural activity indirectly. Recent studies have established a strong correlation between neural spike rates (SR) and functional ultrasound signals. However, understanding their spatial distribution and variability across different brain areas is required to thoroughly interpret fUS signals. In this regard, we conducted simultaneous fUS imaging and Neuropixels recordings during stimulus-evoked activity in awake mice within three regions the visual pathway. Our findings indicate that the temporal dynamics of fUS and SR signals are linearly correlated, though the correlation coefficients vary among visual regions. Conversely, the spatial correlation between the two signals remains consistent across all regions with a spread of approximately 300 micrometers. Finally, we introduce a model that integrates the spatial and temporal components of the fUS signal, allowing for a more accurate interpretation of fUS images.

">Neuronal Hyperactivity in Neurons Derived from Individuals with Grey Matter Heterotopia</a></h4>

              
                Periventricular heterotopia (PH), a common form of grey matter heterotopia associated with developmental delay and drug-resistant seizures, poses a challenge in understanding its neurophysiological basis. Human cerebral organoids (hCOs) derived from patients with causative mutations in FAT4 or DCHS1 mimic PH features. However, neuronal activity in these 3D models has not yet been investigated. Here, silicon probe recordings revealed exaggerated spontaneous spike activity in FAT4 and DCHS1 hCOs, suggesting functional changes in neuronal networks. Transcriptome and proteome analyses identified changes in gene ontology terms associated with neuronal morphology and synaptic function. Furthermore, patch-clamp recordings revealed a decreased spike threshold specifically in DCHS1 neurons, likely due to increased somatic voltage-gated sodium channels. Morphological reconstructions and immunostainings revealed greater morphological complexity of PH neurons and synaptic alterations contributing to hyperactivity, with morphological rescue observed in DCHS1 neurons by wild-type DCHS1 expression. Overall, we provide new comprehensive insights into the cellular changes underlying symptoms of grey matter heterotopia.

">Developmental dynamics of the prefrontal cortical SST and PV interneuron networks: Insights from the monkey highlight human-specific features</a></h4>

              
                The primate prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a quintessential hub of cognitive functions. Amidst its intricate neural architecture, the interplay of distinct neuronal subtypes, notably parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SST) interneurons (INs), emerge as a cornerstone in sculpting cortical circuitry and governing cognitive processes. While considerable strides have been made in elucidating the developmental trajectory of these neurons in rodent models, our understanding of their postmigration developmental dynamics in primates still needs to be studied. Disruptions to this developmental trajectory can compromise IN function, impairing signal gating and circuit modulation within cortical networks. This study examined the expression patterns of PV and SST, ion transporter KCC2, and ion channel subtypes Kv3.1b, and Nav1.1 - associated with morphophysiological stages of development in the postnatal marmoset monkey in different frontal cortical regions (granular areas 8aD, 8aV, 9, 46; agranular areas 11, 47L). Our results demonstrate that the maturation of PV+ INs extends into adolescence, characterized by discrete epochs associated with specific expression dynamics of ion channel subtypes. Interestingly, we observed a postnatal decrease in SST interneurons, contrasting with studies in rodents. This endeavor broadens our comprehension of primate cortical development and furnishes invaluable insights into the etiology and pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by perturbations in PV and SST IN function.

">Transcriptome signatures of the medial prefrontal cortex underlying GABAergic control of resilience to chronic stress exposure</a></h4>

              
                Analyses of postmortem human brains and preclinical studies of rodents have identified somatostatin (SST)-positive interneurons as key elements that regulate the vulnerability to stress-related psychiatric disorders. Conversely, genetically induced disinhibition of SST neurons or brain region-specific chemogenetic activation of SST neurons in mice results in stress resilience. Here, we used RNA sequencing of mice with disinhibited SST neurons to characterize the transcriptome changes underlying GABAergic control of stress resilience. We found that stress resilience of male but not female mice with disinhibited SST neurons is characterized by resilience to chronic stress-induced transcriptome changes in the medial prefrontal cortex. Interestingly, the transcriptome of non-stressed stress-resilient male mice resembled the transcriptome of chronic stress-exposed stress-vulnerable mice. However, the behavior and the serum corticosterone levels of non-stressed stress-resilient mice showed no signs of physiological stress. Most strikingly, chronic stress exposure of stress-resilient mice was associated with an almost complete reversal of their chronic stress-like transcriptome signature, along with pathway changes indicating stress-induced enhancement of mRNA translation. Behaviorally, the mice with disinhibited SST neurons were not only resilient to chronic stress-induced anhedonia -- they also showed an inversed anxiolytic-like response to chronic stress exposure that mirrored the chronic stress-induced reversal of the chronic stress-like transcriptome signature. We conclude that GABAergic dendritic inhibition by SST neurons exerts bidirectional control over behavioral vulnerability and resilience to chronic stress exposure that is mirrored in bidirectional changes in expression of putative stress resilience genes, through a sex-specific brain substrate.

">Neural correlates of phenomenological attitude toward perceptual experience</a></h4>

              
                Phenomenology is one of the most promising approaches to study conscious experience. It holds that a rigorous study of conscious experience requires a transition in the subject from the "natural attitude" (NA) to the "phenomenological attitude" (PA). NA describes our ordinary stance, in which our attention is directed at external objects and events. PA is a distinctive, reflective stance in which our attention is directed at our conscious experience itself. Despite its theoretical importance in philosophy and science of consciousness, the neural mechanisms underlying PA remain unknown. To clarify this point, we developed a novel behavioral task in which participants alternate between NA and PA in relation to their stimulus-evoked subjective experiences. Participants are presented with two sentences and requested to identify the one that best captures their experience. These sentences are designed to induce either NA or PA. We found that participants had lower error rates but slower reaction times in the PA condition compared to the NA condition, suggesting a difference beyond task difficulty. Using fMRI, we also found that multivoxel activation patterns in the premotor cortex, posterior parietal cortex, supplementary motor area, and cerebellum successfully classified the task conditions. Furthermore, the activation strength in these regions was lower in the PA condition, indicating that PA depends on neural processes that suppress action-related information. These findings provide the first evidence for the neural signature of PA, contributing to a better understanding of phenomenological method and its underlying neural mechanisms.

">Xenon and nitrous oxide induced changes in resting EEG activity can be explained by systematic increases in the relaxation rates of stochastically driven alpha band oscillatory activity</a></h4>

              
                Resting electroencephalographic activity is typically indistinguishable from a filtered linear random process across a diverse range of behavioural and pharmacological states, suggesting that the power spectral density of the resting electroencephalogram (EEG) can be modelled as the superposition of multiple, stochastically driven and independent, alpha band (8 - 13 Hz) relaxation oscillators. This simple model can account for variations in alpha band power and `1/f scaling' in eyes-open/eyes-closed conditions in terms of alterations in the distribution of the alpha band oscillatory relaxation rates. As changes in alpha band power and `1/f scaling' have been reported in anaesthesia we hypothesise that such changes may also be accounted for by alterations in alpha band relaxation oscillatory rate distributions. On this basis we choose to study the EEG activity of xenon and nitrous oxide, gaseous anaesthetic agents that have been reported to produce different EEG effects, notable given they are both regarded as principally acting via N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonism. By recording high density EEG from participants receiving equilibrated step-level increases in inhaled concentrations of xenon (n = 24) and nitrous oxide (n = 20), alpha band relaxation rate (damping) distributions were estimated by solving an inhomogeneous integral equation describing the linear superposition of multiple alpha-band relaxation oscillators having a continuous distribution of dampings. For both agents, level-dependent reductions in alpha band power and spectral slope exponent (15-40 Hz) were observed, that were accountable by increases in mean alpha band damping. These shared increases suggest that, consistent with their identified molecular targets of action, xenon and nitrous oxide are mechanistically similar, a conclusion further supported by neuronal population modelling in which NMDA antagonism is associated with increases in damping and reductions in peak alpha frequency. Alpha band damping may provide an important link between experiment and theories of consciousness, such as the global neuronal network theory, where the likelihood of a globally excited state (`conscious percept'), is inversely related to mean damping.

                Objective: To investigate the effect of dihydromyricetin on hypoxia-induced neurons to understand the effect of dihydromyricetin on hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Methods: Cortical neurons were isolated from C57BL/6j mice (24 hour-year old), cultured, and subjected to 4h hypoxia and 20h reoxygenation to mimic the neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. After dihydromyricetin (20 umol/L) treatment of hypoxia-induced neurons for 2h, CCK-8 assay was used to analyze the neuronal viability, Hoechst33342/PI double staining assay was used to analyze the neuronal death, Western blotting was used to analyze the expression of Poly ADP-ribose (PAR) polymer protein and gammaH2AX, comet assay was used to detect DNA damage, immunofluorescence staining was used to observe the nuclear translocation of apoptosis inducing factor, and 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate was used to detect the expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Results: Compared with the control groups, hypoxia-treated neurons exhibited significantly lower activity, higher neuronal death rate and the high expressions of PAR and {gamma}H2AX, hypoxia could also induce AIF nuclear translocation, increase tail DNA content and tail length, increase the expression of ROS in neurons; after dihydromyricetin treatment, neuronal activity were significantly increased, neuronal death rate, ROS levels, and the expressions of PAR and gammaH2AX were also decreased, AIF nuclear translocation was inhibited, the tail DNA content and tail length were also decreased. Conclusion: Dihydromyricetin could alleviate the damage of hypoxia-induced neurons through decreasing the levels of ROS and inhibiting the expressions of PAR and gammaH2AX, suggesting that dihydromyricetin may have the protective effect on HIE.

">Sexually dimorphic auditory representation in Aedes aegypti brains</a></h4>

              
                Male attraction to female flight sounds is a vital, reproducible component of courtship in many species of mosquitoes; however, female acoustic behaviours have proven challenging to define. To investigate sexual dimorphisms in acoustic behaviours, previous reports have largely focused on differences in mosquito peripheral ear anatomy and function. Whilst molecular investigations have recently begun on the auditory periphery, sexual dimorphisms in central processing of acoustic information have not yet been explored. Here we used a combination of neurotracing, calcium imaging and molecular analyses to examine sexual dimorphisms in auditory processing in the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti. We identified shared and dimorphic neurons connecting male and female ears to the primary auditory processing centre in the brain, and defined multiple distinct neuronal clusters based on responses to auditory stimulation. We finally used transcriptomic and proteomic analyses to investigate the molecular factors underlying these differences, with motile ciliary-related terms significantly enriched in males.

">Hair Cells Loss Estimation from Audiograms</a></h4>

              
                Age-related hearing loss is characterized by a progressive loss of threshold sensitivity, especially at high frequencies. There is increasing evidence that the loss of cilia in the inner and outer hair cells is the dominant cause of hearing loss. We present a framework for calculating the human auditory threshold based on a non-linear time-domain cochlear model that incorporates hair cell damage along the cochlear partition. We successfully predicted the audiogram measured prior to death by substituting the postmortem percentage of surviving hair cells, using data from Wu et al. (2020). We also present an algorithm for estimating the percentage of hair cells from a measured audiogram. Comparison with the data from Wu et al. revealed that the algorithm accurately predicted the surviving inner hair cells along the entire cochlear partition and the outer hair cells at the basal part of the cochlea.

">Decoding the Epigenetic Landscape: Insights into 5mC and 5hmC Patterns in Mouse Cortical Cell Types</a></h4>

              
                The DNA modifications, 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), represent powerful epigenetic regulators of temporal and spatial gene expression. Yet, how the cooperation of these genome-wide, epigenetic marks determine unique transcriptional signatures across different brain cell populations is unclear. Here we applied Nanopore sequencing of native DNA to obtain a complete, genome-wide, single-base resolution atlas of 5mC and 5hmC modifications in neurons, astrocytes and microglia in the mouse cortex (99% genome coverage, 40 million CpG sites). In tandem with RNA sequencing, analysis of 5mC and 5hmC patterns across cell types reveals astrocytes drive uniquely high brain 5hmC levels and support two decades of research regarding methylation patterns, gene expression and alternative splicing, benchmarking this resource. As such, we provide the most comprehensive DNA methylation data in mouse brain as an interactive, online tool (NAM-Me, https://olsenlab.shinyapps.io/NAMME/) to serve as a resource dataset for those interested in the methylome landscape.

">Mouse parasubthalamic Crh neurons drive alcohol drinking escalation and behavioral disinhibition</a></h4>

              
                Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF, encoded by Crh) signaling is thought to play a critical role in the development of excessive alcohol drinking and the emotional and physical pain associated with alcohol withdrawal. Here, we investigated the parasubthalamic nucleus (PSTN) as a potential source of CRF relevant to the control of alcohol consumption, affect, and nociception in mice. We identified PSTN Crh neurons as a neuronal subpopulation that exerts a potent and unique influence on behavior by promoting not only alcohol but also saccharin drinking, while PSTN neurons are otherwise known to suppress consummatory behaviors. Furthermore, PSTN Crh neurons are causally implicated in the escalation of alcohol and saccharin intake produced by chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) vapor inhalation, a mouse model of alcohol use disorder. In contrast to our predictions, the ability of PSTN Crh neurons to increase alcohol drinking is not mediated by CRF1 signaling. Moreover, the pattern of behavioral disinhibition and reduced nociception driven by their activation does not support a role of negative reinforcement as a motivational basis for the concomitant increase in alcohol drinking. Finally, silencing Crh expression in the PSTN slowed down the escalation of alcohol intake in mice exposed to CIE and accelerated their recovery from withdrawal-induced mechanical hyperalgesia. Altogether, our results suggest that PSTN Crh neurons may represent an important node in the brain circuitry linking alcohol use disorder with sweet liking and novelty seeking.

">Experience-dependent sex differences in the role of dorsal striatal dopamine D1 receptor activity in methamphetamine self-administration revealed by a novel TREND model.</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND: The role of dorsal striatal dopamine D1 receptor systems in the mechanism of methamphetamine self-administration (METH SA), and sex differences in this role, are unclear. We hypothesized that this role would be sex and METH experience-dependent. Because prior experience regulates subsequent effects of drugs, we developed a novel model to account for this interaction, termed the TREND model (Time-Related-Experience-Normalized-Dynamics) for drug SA analysis. We tested our hypothesis by comparing results from the new TREND model and the current model. METHODS: For model validation, we reanalyzed previous data (Job et al., 2020) with the aim of determining which model (current or TREND) was more effective as an analytical tool. We compared variables from each model with the effect of Clozapine-N-Oxide (CNO, chemogenetic ligand) on METH SA. We employed regression analysis, median split, ANOVA to see which could reveal sex and experience dependency of dorsal striatal dopamine D1 receptor system. RESULTS: The current model variables were unrelated to CNO effect, with no sex differences in these relationships. TREND model revealed new variables that were unrelated to current variables but related to CNO effect on METH in males and females, with sex differences in these relationships. TREND, but not the current model, detected sex differences when comparing males and females with prior high, but not low, behavioral response variables. CONCLUSIONS: TREND model is more sensitive than the current model for detecting experience-dependent sex differences in the role of the dorsal striatal dopamine D1 receptor systems in the mechanism of METH SA.

">Main Sequence of Human Luminance-Evoked Pupil Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Pupil responses are commonly used to provide insight into visual perception, autonomic control, cognition, and various brain disorders. However, making inferences from pupil data can be complicated by nonlinearities in pupil dynamics and variability within and across individuals, which challenge the assumptions of linearity or group level homogeneity required for common analysis methods. In this study, we evaluated luminance evoked pupil dynamics in young healthy adults (N=10, 5:5 M:F, ages 19-25) by identifying nonlinearities, variability, and conserved relationships across individuals to improve the ability to make inferences from pupil data. We found a nonlinear relationship between final pupil diameter and luminance, linearized by considering the logarithm of luminance. Peak diameter change and peak velocity were nonlinear functions of log-luminance for constriction but not dilation responses. Across participants, curve fit parameters characterizing pupil responses as a function of luminance were highly variable, yet there was an across-participant linear correlation between overall pupil size and pupil gain (i.e. diameter change per unit log-luminance change). In terms of within-participant trial-by-trial variability, participants showed greater variability in final pupil size compared to constriction peak diameter change as a function of log-luminance. Despite the variability in stimulus-response metrics within and across participants, we found that all participants showed a highly stereotyped main sequence relationship between peak diameter change and peak velocity (independent of luminance). The main sequence relationship can be used to inform models of the neural control of pupil dynamics and as an empirical analysis tool to evaluate variability and abnormalities in pupil behaviour.

">Chemogenetic control of GABAergic activity within the interpeduncular nucleus reveals dissociable behavioral components of the nicotine withdrawal phenotype</a></h4>

              
                Chronic exposure to nicotine results in the development of a dependent state such that a withdrawal syndrome is elicited upon cessation of nicotine. The habenulo-interpeduncular (Hb-IPN) circuit contains a high concentration of nAChRs and has been identified as a main circuit involved in nicotine withdrawal. Here we investigated the contribution of two distinct subpopulations of IPN GABAergic neurons to nicotine withdrawal behaviors. Using a chenogenetic approach to specifically target Amigo1-expressing or Epyc-expressing neurons within the IPN, we found that activity of the Amigo1 and not the Epyc subpopulation of GABAergic neuron is critical for anxiety-like behaviors both in naive mice and in those undergoing nicotine withdrawal. Moreover, data revealed that stimulation of Amigo1 neurons in nicotine-naive mice elicits opposite effects on affective and somatic signs of withdrawal. Taken together, these results suggest that somatic and affective behaviors constitute dissociable components of the nicotine withdrawal phenotype and are likely supported by distinct subpopulations of neurons within the IPN.

">Optimization and model averaging of histogram-based place cell firing rate maps using the point process framework</a></h4>

              
                Background: The firing rate of hippocampal place cells depends on the spatial position of the organism in an environment. This position dependence is often quantified by constructing spike-in-location and time-in-location histograms, the ratio of which yields a firing rate map. New Method: The purpose of this study is to present a new method for optimizing the spatial resolution of histogram-based firing rate maps. Results: It is pointed out that histogram-based firing rate maps are conditional intensity functions of inhomogeneous Poisson process models of neural spike trains, and, as such, they can be optimized through model selection within the point process framework. Results: The point process framework is used here for optimizing the size and the aspect ratio of the histogram bins using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). It is also used for model averaging using Akaike weights, when maps of various bin sizes provide comparable fits. Application of the method is illustrated on data from real rat hippocampal place cells. Comparison with existing methods: Existing methods do not optimize the number of bins used in each dimension of the firing rate map. Conclusion: The proposed approach allows for the construction of the AIC-best histogram-based firing rate map for each individual place cell.

                Nonergodicity and Simpson's paradox pose significant and underappreciated challenges for neuroscience. Using stop signal task data from over 4,000 children and a Bayesian computational model of cognitive dynamics, we investigated brain-behavior relationships underlying inhibitory control at both between-subjects and within-subjects levels. Strikingly, between-subjects associations of inhibitory control activations with stop signal reaction times, probabilities of proactivity, and proactive delays were reversed within subjects, revealing the nonergodic nature of these processes. Nonergodicity was observed throughout the brain but was most pronounced in the salience network. Furthermore, within-subjects analysis revealed dissociated brain representations of reactive and proactive processing, and distinct brain-behavior associations for subjects who adaptively and who maladaptively regulated inhibitory control. This work advances our knowledge of the dynamic neural mechanisms of inhibitory control during a critical developmental period and has implications for personalized interventions in cognitive disorders. Embracing nonergodicity is crucial for understanding brain-behavior relationships and developing effective interventions.

">Deep-diffeomorphic networks for conditional brain templates</a></h4>

              
                Deformable brain templates are an important tool in many neuroimaging analyses. Conditional templates have advantages over single population templates by enabling improved registration accuracy and capturing common processes in brain development and degeneration. Conventional methods require large, evenly-spread cohorts to develop conditional templates, limiting their ability to create templates that could reflect richer combinations of clinical and demographic variables. More recent deep-learning methods, which can infer relationships in very high dimensional spaces, open up the possibility of producing conditional templates that are jointly optimised for these richer sets of conditioning parameters. We have built on recent deep-learning template generation approaches using a diffeomorphic framework to create a purely geometric method of conditional template construction that learns diffeomorphisms between: (i) a global or group template and conditional templates, and (ii) conditional templates and individual brain scans. We evaluated our method, as well as other recent deep-learning approaches, on a dataset of cognitively normal participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), using age as the conditioning parameter of interest. We assessed the effectiveness of these networks at capturing age-dependent anatomical differences. Our results demonstrate that while the assessed deep-learning methods have a number of strengths, they require further refinement to capture morphological changes in ageing brains with an acceptable degree of accuracy. The volumetric output of our method, and other recent deep-learning approaches, across four brain structures (grey matter, white matter, the lateral ventricles and the hippocampus), was measured and showed that although each of the methods captured some changes well, each method was unable to accurately track changes in all of the volumes. However, our method was able to produce T1-weighted conditional templates with high spatial fidelity and with consistent topology as age varies, making these conditional templates advantageous for spatial registrations. The use of diffeomorphisms in these deep-learning methods represents an important strength of these approaches, as it produces conditional templates that can be explicitly linked across age as well as to fixed, unconditional templates or brain atlases. The use of deep-learning in conditional template generation provides a framework for creating templates for more complex conditioning parameters, such as pathologies and demographic variables, in order to facilitate a broader application of conditional brain templates in neuroimaging studies.

                Homozygous DNAJC12 c.79-2A>G (p. V27Wfs*14) loss-of-function mutations were first reported as a cause of young-onset Parkinson's disease. However, bi-allelic autosomal recessive pathogenic variants in DNAJC12 may lead to an alternative constellation of neurological features including infantile dystonia, developmental delay, intellectual disability and neuropsychiatric disorders. DNAJC12 is understood to co-chaperone aromatic amino acid hydroxylases to enhance the synthesis of biogenic amines. In vitro, we confirm overexpressed DNAJC12 forms a complex with tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine (DA) synthesis. Now we describe a conditional knockout mouse (cDKO) in which loxP sites flanking Dnajc12 exon 2 enable its excision by cre-recombinase to create a constitutive Dnajc12 knock out (DKO). At three months of age, DKO animals exhibit reduced locomotion and exploratory behavior in automated open-field testing. DKO mice also manifest increased plasma phenylalanine levels, a cardinal feature of patients with DNAJC12 pathogenic variants. In striatal tissue, total DA and serotonin, and their metabolites, are reduced. Biochemical alterations in synaptic proteins and tyrosine hydroxylase are also apparent, with enhanced phosphorylation of pSer31 and pSer40 sites that may reflect biological compensation. Electrically-evoked striatal DA is reduced. Most immediately, cDKO and DKO mice present models to develop and refined therapeutic approaches for the treatment of DNAJC12 dystonia and parkinsonism. These models may also enable the pleiotropic functions of biogenic amines (including DA) to be individually investigated in the brain and periphery.

	<p>Non-invasive transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) has attracted increasing interest as a neurostimulation tool with potential applications in modulating cognitive processes such as attention and memory, possibly through the modulation of the locus&amp;amp;ndash;coeruleus noradrenaline system. Studies examining the P300 brain-related component as a correlate of noradrenergic activity, however, have yielded inconsistent findings, possibly due to differences in stimulation parameters, thus necessitating further investigation. In this event-related potential study involving 61 participants, therefore, we examined how changes in taVNS parameters, specifically stimulation type (interval vs. continuous stimulation) and duration, influence P300 amplitudes during a visual novelty oddball task. Although no effects of stimulation were found over the whole cluster and time window of the P300, cluster-based permutation tests revealed a distinct impact of taVNS on the P300 response for a small electrode cluster, characterized by larger amplitudes observed for easy targets (i.e., stimuli that are easily discernible from standards) following taVNS compared to sham stimulation. Notably, our findings suggested that the type of stimulation significantly modulated taVNS effects on the P300, with continuous stimulation showing larger P300 differences (taVNS vs. sham) for hard targets and standards compared to interval stimulation. We observed no interaction effects of stimulation duration on the target-related P300. While our findings align with previous research, further investigation is warranted to fully elucidate the influence of taVNS on the P300 component and its potential utility as a reliable marker for neuromodulation in this field.</p>

	<p>The Communicative Effectiveness Index (CETI) is an informant rating scale designed to measure changes in functional communication in people with aphasia (PWA) from the carer&amp;amp;rsquo;s perspective. It offers a comprehensive view of aphasia&amp;amp;rsquo;s impact on everyday communication situations, aiding clinicians in designing personalized intervention plans. The aim of this study was to translate and adapt the CETI into Greek (CETI-GR) and validate its psychometric properties. The CETI-GR was translated into Greek using back-translation. A pilot and a content validity study ensured its acceptability. The study involved 30 people with aphasia and 30 carers. The CETI-GR&amp;amp;rsquo;s psychometric properties were evaluated, including internal consistency, test&amp;amp;ndash;retest reliability, inter-rater reliability, and validity measures. The CETI-GR demonstrated excellent internal consistency (Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s &amp;amp;alpha; &amp;amp;gt; 0.95) and excellent inter-rater reliability (ICC &amp;amp;ge; 0.93). Excellent consistency was revealed when testing the CETI responses given only by PWA (&amp;amp;alpha; = 0.91) versus their carers (&amp;amp;alpha; = 0.97). Test&amp;amp;ndash;retest reliability was high (ICC = 0.88). Significant correlations between the CETI-GR and measures of language severity, functional communication, and quality of life supported convergent validity. The CETI-GR is a reliable tool for assessing functional communication in chronic aphasia. Its Greek adaptation enhances aphasia rehabilitation, enabling person-centered care and improving the quality of life for people with aphasia and carers.</p>

	<p>Deep learning (DL) has been demonstrated to be a valuable tool for classifying state of disorders of consciousness (DOC) using EEG signals. However, the performance of the DL-based DOC state classification is often challenged by the limited size of EEG datasets. To overcome this issue, we introduce multiple open-source EEG datasets to increase data volume and train a novel multi-task pre-training Transformer model named MutaPT. Furthermore, we propose a cross-distribution self-supervised (CDS) pre-training strategy to enhance the model&amp;amp;rsquo;s generalization ability, addressing data distribution shifts across multiple datasets. An EEG dataset of DOC patients is used to validate the effectiveness of our methods for the task of classifying DOC states. Experimental results show the superiority of our MutaPT over several DL models for EEG classification.</p>

                Cholinergic urticaria (CholU) is a rare condition characterized by itchy hives in the form of 1-4 mm small, raised wheals on skin, which are short-lived for duration of 15 to 20 minutes; they are caused by stimuli associated with sweating such as from physical exercise. CholU is also known as cholinergic angioedema urticaria. Hereby, we present a case report of a 42-year-old male with ChoIU who presented with systemic manifestation in the form of recurrent attacks of syncope. Diagnosis was made after a detailed history taking and all cardiac and neurological evaluations done that were normal, and widespread literature research was done to rule out other causes of syncope as systemic symptoms are rarely seen in ChoIU. His IgE antibodies levels were highly increased. He was managed with nonsedating antihistamines and health education regarding the rare condition.

                <p>-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult brain which mediates its rapid effects on neuronal excitability via ionotropic GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors. GABA levels in the brain are critically dependent upon GABA-aminotransferase (GABA-AT) which promotes its degradation. Vigabatrin, a low-affinity GABA-AT inhibitor, exhibits anticonvulsant efficacy, but its use is limited due to cumulative ocular toxicity. OV329 is a rationally designed, next-generation GABA-AT inhibitor with enhanced potency. We demonstrate that sustained exposure to OV329 in mice reduces GABA-AT activity and subsequently elevates GABA levels in the brain. Parallel increases in the efficacy of GABAergic inhibition were evident, together with elevations in electroencephalographic delta power. Consistent with this, OV329 exposure reduced the severity of status epilepticus and the development of benzodiazepine refractory seizures. Thus, OV329 may be of utility in treating seizure disorders and associated pathologies that result from neuronal hyperexcitability.</p>

                <p>Persistent activity in excitatory pyramidal cells (PYRs) is a putative mechanism for maintaining memory traces during working memory. We have recently demonstrated persistent interruption of firing in fast-spiking parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV-INs), a phenomenon that could serve as a substrate for persistent activity in PYRs through disinhibition lasting hundreds of milliseconds. Here, we find that hippocampal CA1 PV-INs exhibit type 2 excitability, like striatal and neocortical PV-INs. Modeling and mathematical analysis showed that the slowly inactivating potassium current K<SUB>V</SUB>1 contributes to type 2 excitability, enables the multiple firing regimes observed experimentally in PV-INs, and provides a mechanism for robust persistent interruption of firing. Using a fast/slow separation of times scales approach with the K<SUB>V</SUB>1 inactivation variable as a bifurcation parameter shows that the initial inhibitory stimulus stops repetitive firing by moving the membrane potential trajectory onto a coexisting stable fixed point corresponding to a nonspiking quiescent state. As K<SUB>V</SUB>1 inactivation decays, the trajectory follows the branch of stable fixed points until it crosses a subcritical Hopf bifurcation (HB) and then spirals out into repetitive firing. In a model describing entorhinal cortical PV-INs without K<SUB>V</SUB>1, interruption of firing could be achieved by taking advantage of the bistability inherent in type 2 excitability based on a subcritical HB, but the interruption was not robust to noise. Persistent interruption of firing is therefore broadly applicable to PV-INs in different brain regions but is only made robust to noise in the presence of a slow variable, K<SUB>V</SUB>1 inactivation.</p>

                <p>Layer 6 corticothalamic (L6 CT) neurons provide massive input to the thalamus, and these feedback connections enable the cortex to influence its own sensory input by modulating thalamic excitability. However, the functional role(s) feedback serves during sensory processing is unclear. One hypothesis is that CT feedback is under the control of extrasensory signals originating from higher-order cortical areas, yet we know nothing about the mechanisms of such control. It is also unclear whether such regulation is specific to CT neurons with distinct thalamic connectivity. Using mice (either sex) combined with in vitro electrophysiology techniques, optogenetics, and retrograde labeling, we describe studies of vibrissal primary motor cortex (vM1) influences on different CT neurons in the vibrissal primary somatosensory cortex (vS1) with distinct intrathalamic axonal projections. We found that vM1 inputs are highly selective, evoking stronger postsynaptic responses in CT neurons projecting to the dual ventral posterior medial nucleus (VPm) and posterior medial nucleus (POm) located in lower L6a than VPm-only&ndash;projecting CT cells in upper L6a. A targeted analysis of the specific cells and synapses involved revealed that the greater responsiveness of Dual CT neurons was due to their distinctive intrinsic membrane properties and synaptic mechanisms. These data demonstrate that vS1 has at least two discrete L6 CT subcircuits distinguished by their thalamic projection patterns, intrinsic physiology, and functional connectivity with vM1. Our results also provide insights into how a distinct CT subcircuit may serve specialized roles specific to contextual modulation of tactile-related sensory signals in the somatosensory thalamus during active vibrissa movements.</p>

                <p>Microglia carry out important functions as the resident macrophages of the brain. To study their role in health and disease, the research community needs tools to genetically modify them with maximum completeness in a manner that distinguishes them from closely related cell types, such as monocytes. While currently available tamoxifen-inducible CreERT2 lines can achieve the differentiation from other cells, the field needs improved and publicly available constitutively active Cre lines, especially ones with favorable efficiency and specificity profiles for studies where high recombination efficiency is imperative and where tamoxifen administration is contraindicated. Here, we leverage the microglia-specific <I>Fcrls</I> gene to generate mice expressing Cre. Using genomic methods, we show correct positioning of the transgene and intact microglia homeostasis in <I>Fcrls-2A-Cre</I> mice. Crossing <I>Fcrls-2A-Cre</I> mice to four different reporters, we demonstrate highly efficient recombination in microglia across differentially sensitive loxP alleles in different genomic contexts, indicating robust applicability of the line. Further, we show that microglia recombine a loxP reporter during early embryonic development, supporting the use of the line for developmental studies. Finally, using immunofluorescence and flow cytometry, we reveal that most border-associated macrophages are also targeted whereas only few liver and spleen macrophages and virtually no white blood cell subsets exhibit Cre activity, distinguishing this line from another publicly available Cre line, <I>Cx3cr1-Cre<sup>M</sup></I>. <I>Fcrls-2A-Cre</I> mice are immediately available (JAX #036591) and serve as a valuable addition to the community's microglia toolbox by providing highly efficient constitutive Cre activity with excellent specificity, particularly for studies where tamoxifen administration is undesirable.</p>

                Background Patients with Metastatic Bone Disease (MBD) often present with complaints of pain and multiple osteolytic lesions findings. Remarkably, 30% of these cases exhibit an undetected primary lesion. Hence, categorizing them as MBD of unknown origin. The diagnostic processes of patients with MBD of unknown origin typically takes up to four months, rendering it as a catastrophic disease with the second-highest financial burden. Given its urgency, it is necessary to develop a evidence-based consensus for managing cases of MBD with an unknown origin. Purpose This study aimed to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of treating patients with MBD of unknown origin through the application of the INA-MBD algorithm. Research method A quasi-experimental study with a pretest and post-test design was conducted with a total of 128 patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The patients were consecutively enrolled and categorized into two groups: the intervention group with the INA-MBD algorithm and the non-intervention group without the INA-MBD algorithm. The primary outcomes were the cost and time to diagnose MBD of unknown origin. The proposed measuring tool was the INA-MBD algorithm. Furthermore, for the cost-to-diagnosis variable, an extra measurement tool was used, which were summaries of the patient’s medical bill including hospital stays and medical procedures. The analysis of data related to the time-to-diagnosis variable was conducted using the Log Rank regression test, and cost-to-diagnosis variable was carried out using co-variance test.

                Protein phosphatase 2A is a serine/threonine phosphatase with activity dependent on an associated regulatory subunit, serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A 56 kDa regulatory subunit delta (δ) isoform (PPP2R5D). PPP2R5D is the δ isoform in the B56 family of regulatory subunits. Abundantly expressed in the brain and involved in a broad range of cellular processes, PPP2R5D plays an essential role in modulating key neuronal pathways and signalling. Pathogenic mutations in the PPP2R5D gene are linked to clinical symptoms characterized by neurodevelopmental delay, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorders. The etiology of these genetic disorders remains unknown, which can partly be due to the lack of independently characterized antibodies. Here we have characterized six PPP2R5D commercial antibodies for Western Blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-782/v1?src=rss">The comparison study on accuracy of peak expiratory flow rate measurement by PRAAN, spirometry, and the mini-Wright peak flow meterÂ Â [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background PRAAN, a digital peak flow meter, was developed to measure peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) for asthma monitoring. This study aimed to compare PRAAN’s accuracy to that of spirometry and the mini-Wright peak flow meter for PEFR measurement. Methods Two cross-sectional studies were conducted in 106 healthy adult participants. Study A (n=56) compared PRAAN with spirometry, while study B (n=50) compared PRAAN with the mini-Wright peak flow meter. PEFR values were collected using crossover studies. Pearson’s correlation and Bland-Altman plots were used to report the relationship and agreement between two measurements, respectively. Results In study A, 51.8% were female, mean age was 24.3±5.6 years, and PEFR was 480.3±86.8 L/min. PEFR measured by PRAAN had very strongly positive correlation with spirometry (r=0.980, P<0.001). Bland-Altman analysis showed that there was good agreement between them, with a low mean difference of -7.07 liters/minute (95% CI: -40.58 to 26.44 liters/minute) and 92.9%, which were within the limit of agreement (LOA). In study B, 54.0% were female, mean age was 23.5±2.4 years, and PEFR was 495.1±82.7 L/min. PEFR measured by PRAAN and by the mini-Wright peak flow meter showed very strongly positive correlation (r=0.971, P<0.001). Bland-Altman comparison of PEFR between these two measurements showed that there was a very good agreement between them, with a low mean difference of 0.84 liters/minute (95% CI: -38.68 to 40.38 liters/minute) and 94.0%, which were within LOA. Conclusions The accuracy of PRAAN is in the agreement with spirometry and the mini-Wright peak flow meter. The clinical application of PRAAN may potentially lead to a monitoring strategy that healthcare providers can use to improve the management of asthma.

                <p>by Kanishk Chauhan, Alexander B. Neiman, Peter A. Tass</p>

Abnormally strong neural synchronization may impair brain function, as observed in several brain disorders. We computationally study how neuronal dynamics, synaptic weights, and network structure co-emerge, in particular, during (de)synchronization processes and how they are affected by external perturbation. To investigate the impact of different types of plasticity mechanisms, we combine a network of excitatory integrate-and-fire neurons with different synaptic weight and/or structural plasticity mechanisms: (i) only spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), (ii) only homeostatic structural plasticity (hSP), i.e., without weight-dependent pruning and without STDP, (iii) a combination of STDP and hSP, i.e., without weight-dependent pruning, and (iv) a combination of STDP and structural plasticity (SP) that includes hSP and weight-dependent pruning. To accommodate the diverse time scales of neuronal firing, STDP, and SP, we introduce a simple stochastic SP model, enabling detailed numerical analyses. With tools from network theory, we reveal that structural reorganization may remarkably enhance the network’s level of synchrony. When weaker contacts are preferentially eliminated by weight-dependent pruning, synchrony is achieved with significantly sparser connections than in randomly structured networks in the STDP-only model. In particular, the strengthening of contacts from neurons with higher natural firing rates to those with lower rates and the weakening of contacts in the opposite direction, followed by selective removal of weak contacts, allows for strong synchrony with fewer connections. This activity-led network reorganization results in the emergence of degree-frequency, degree-degree correlations, and a mixture of degree assortativity. We compare the stimulation-induced desynchronization of synchronized states in the STDP-only model (i) with the desynchronization of models (iii) and (iv). The latter require stimuli of significantly higher intensity to achieve long-term desynchronization. These findings may inform future pre-clinical and clinical studies with invasive or non-invasive stimulus modalities aiming at inducing long-lasting relief of symptoms, e.g., in Parkinson’s disease.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-324/v2?src=rss">A scoping review on what constitutes a good research culture [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background The crisis in research culture is well documented, covering issues such as a tendency for quantity over quality, unhealthy competitive environments, and assessment based on publications, journal prestige and funding. In response, research institutions need to assess their own practices to promote and advocate for change in the current research ecosystem. The purpose of the scoping review was to explore ‘What does the evidence say about the ‘problem’ with ‘poor’ research culture, what are the benefits of ‘good’ research culture, and what does ‘good’ look like?’ Aims To examine the peer-reviewed and grey literature to explore the interplay between research culture, open research, career paths, recognition and rewards, and equality, diversity, and inclusion, as part of a larger programme of activity for a research institution. Methods A scoping review was undertaken. Six databases were searched along with grey literature. Eligible literature had relevance to academic research institutions, addressed research culture, and were published between January 2017 to May 2022. Evidence was mapped and themed to specific categories. The search strategy, screening and analysis took place between April-May 2022. Results 1666 titles and abstracts, and 924 full text articles were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 253 articles met the eligibility criteria for inclusion. A purposive sampling of relevant websites was drawn from to complement the review, resulting in 102 records included in the review. Key areas for consideration were identified across the four themes of job security, wellbeing and equality of opportunity, teamwork and interdisciplinary, and research quality and accountability. Conclusions There are opportunities for research institutions to improve their own practice, however institutional solutions cannot act in isolation. Research institutions and research funders need to work together to build a more sustainable and inclusive research culture that is diverse in nature and supports individuals’ well-being, career progression and performance.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The flower-spray nerve endings are afferent nerve terminals in the carotid sinus that arise from carotid sinus nerve of glossopharyngeal nerve. However, the three-dimensional ultrastructural characteristics of flower-spray nerve endings and spatial relationships between the terminal parts and other cellular elements have not been fully understood. To elucidate their detailed relationship, backscattered electron imaging of serial sections was performed with a scanning electron microscope to produce a three-dimensional reconstruction of the flower-spray endings. The terminal parts of flower-spray endings were distributed horizontally approximately 5 µm outside the external elastic membrane in the tunica adventitia of the internal carotid artery. The three-dimensional reconstruction showed that the terminal parts of flower-spray endings were flat with irregular contours and were partially covered by the thin cytoplasmic processes of Schwann cells. The complex consisting of the nerve terminals and associated Schwann cells was surrounded by a multilayered basement membrane. The terminal parts of the endings were also surrounded by fibroblasts with elastic fibers and collagen fibrils. Secretory vesicles without an electron-dense core were observed in the terminal parts of the endings. The accumulation of vesicles just below the axonal membrane was observed in terminal parts not covered by Schwann cell cytoplasmic processes on both the luminal and basal sides. Swollen mitochondria, concentric membranous structures, and glycogen granule-like electron-dense materials were often noted in some of the terminal parts of the endings and the parent axon. Collectively, the present results suggest that flower-spray endings are baroreceptors because their morphology was similar to other mechanoreceptors. Furthermore, flower-spray endings may be affected by glutamate secreted in an autocrine manner.</p>

<p>We compared transcriptomic profiles and functionality of ABC and SLC transporters in marsupial <i>Monodelphis domestica</i> brain and eutherian rat brain and placenta.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>This study used a marsupial <i>Monodelphis domestica</i>, which is born very immature and most of its development is postnatal without placental protection. RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) was used to identify the expression of influx and efflux transporters (ATP-binding cassettes [ABCs] and solute carriers [SLCs]) and metabolizing enzymes in brains of newborn to juvenile <i>Monodelphis</i>. Results were compared to published data in the developing eutherian rat. To test the functionality of these transporters at similar ages, the entry of paracetamol (acetaminophen) into the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was measured using liquid scintillation counting following a single administration of the drug along with its radiolabelled tracer [<sup>3</sup>H]. Drug permeability studies found that in <i>Monodelphis</i>, brain entry of paracetamol was already restricted at P5; it decreased further in the first week of life and then remained stable until the oldest age group tested (P110). Transcriptomic analysis of <i>Monodelphis</i> brain showed that expression of transporters and their metabolizing enzymes in early postnatal (P) pups (P0, P5, and P8) was relatively similar, but by P109, many more transcripts were identified. When transcriptomes of newborn <i>Monodelphis</i> brain and E19 rat brain and placenta were compared, several transporters present in the rat placenta were also found in the newborn <i>Monodelphis</i> brain. These were absent from E19 rat brain but were present in the adult rat brain. These data indicate that despite its extreme immaturity, the newborn <i>Monodelphis</i> brain may compensate for the lack of placental protection during early brain development by upregulating protective mechanisms, which in eutherian animals are instead present in the placenta.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Some recent publications have used the term “vagal–adrenal axis” to account for mechanisms involved in the regulation of inflammation by electroacupuncture. This concept proposes that efferent parasympathetic nerve fibers in the vagus directly innervate the adrenal glands to influence catecholamine secretion. Here, we discuss evidence for anatomical and functional links between the vagi and adrenal glands that may be relevant in the context of inflammation and its neural control by factors, including acupuncture. First, we find that evidence for any direct vagal parasympathetic efferent innervation of the adrenal glands is weak and likely artifactual. Second, we find good evidence that vagal afferent fibers directly innervate the adrenal gland, although their function is uncertain. Third, we highlight a wealth of evidence for indirect pathways, whereby vagal afferent signals act via the central nervous system to modify adrenal-dependent anti-inflammatory responses. Vagal afferents, not efferents, are thus the likely key to these phenomena.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-780/v1?src=rss">Evaluating the dynamics of fee-free higher education in South Africa: a causal loop diagram approach  [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This research investigated the dynamics of fee-free higher education in South Africa, aiming to elucidate the complexities surrounding its implementation and impact. By employing a causal loop diagram approach, the study examined the interplay of socioeconomic, political, and institutional factors influencing the provision of fee-free higher education. Method A participatory approach to developing the CLD was used. Through an extensive literature review, the research contextualised fee-free higher education enabling a preliminary CLD to be developed. Discussions were held to improve the preliminary model based on stakeholder and expert opinion. The model was then validated by stakeholders and experts. Results The CLD has explicitly mapped out the causal relationships which play a fundamental role in fee-free higher education in South Africa. Key findings revealed that fee-free higher education initiatives, such as managing funding constraints and administrative complexities, hold promise for fostering inclusivity and socioeconomic development but are hindered by bureaucratic policy establishments and inefficiencies. These challenges underscore the gap between policy formulation and implementation, highlighting the need for comprehensive reforms to streamline administrative processes and enhance financial sustainability within the higher education sector. Conclusion This research thoroughly examined the dynamics of fee-free higher education in South Africa, highlighting both the challenges and opportunities in its implementation. The study emphasized the need for systemic reforms to improve accessibility and effectiveness, while also underscoring the potential of such initiatives to promote social mobility and economic empowerment, aligning with global goals like the SDGs and the African Agenda 2063.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Most paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) cases are hereditary, yet approximately 60% of patients remain genetically undiagnosed. We undertook the present study to uncover the genetic basis for undiagnosed PKD patients.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole-exome sequencing was performed for 106 <i>PRRT2</i>-negative PKD probands. The functional impact of the genetic variants was investigated in HEK293T cells and <i>Drosophila</i>.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Heterozygous variants in <i>KCNJ10</i> were identified in 11 individuals from 8 unrelated families, which accounted for 7.5% (8/106) of the <i>PRRT2</i>-negative probands. Both co-segregation of the identified variants and the significantly higher frequency of rare <i>KCNJ10</i> variants in PKD cases supported impacts from the detected <i>KCNJ10</i> heterozygous variants on PKD pathogenesis. Moreover, a <i>KCNJ10</i> mutation-carrying father from a typical EAST/SeSAME family was identified as a PKD patient. All patients manifested dystonia attacks triggered by sudden movement with a short episodic duration. Patch-clamp recordings in HEK293T cells revealed apparent reductions in K<sup>+</sup> currents of the patient-derived variants, indicating a loss-of-function. In <i>Drosophila</i>, milder hyperexcitability phenotypes were observed in heterozygous <i>Irk2</i> knock-in flies compared to homozygotes, supporting haploinsufficiency as the mechanism for the detected heterozygous variants. Electrophysiological recordings showed that excitatory neurons in <i>Irk2</i> haploinsufficiency flies exhibited increased excitability, and glia-specific complementation with human Kir4.1 rescued the <i>Irk2</i> mutant phenotypes.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study established haploinsufficiency resulting from heterozygous variants in <i>KCNJ10</i> can be understood as a previously unrecognized genetic cause for PKD and provided evidence of glial involvement in the pathophysiology of PKD. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-446/v2?src=rss">An Insight into developmental changes in reasoning skills among Indian Preschoolers: A cross-sectional study using a story-based approach [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Considering the importance of exploring the development of reasoning skills during preschool period and the suitability of using a culturally linguistically relevant story-based approach for the same, the present research intended to profile the reasoning skills in typically developing Indian preschool children between 36 and 72 months using a story-based approach. The specific objectives were to develop explanation, prediction, and inference based reasoning tasks around a story and assess the reasoning skills in typically developing Indian preschool children using the same. Method: Reasoning tasks across explanation, prediction, and inference domains were developed based on a story and evaluated for its psychometric properties. The developed tasks were then administered to 63 typically developing Indian preschool children attending English medium schools in Mangalore. The preschoolers were equally divided into three age groups, and the responses obtained across the age groups were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. Results: The developed tasks were confirmed to have good psychometric properties like content validity and reliability. The age comparisons of reasoning abilities using one-way ANOVA suggested an increase in reasoning abilities with age during the preschool period. The qualitative analysis further suggested that with increasing age, the nature of reasoning changed from content-based reasoning to reasoning based on prior knowledge which was integrated with the story content. Conclusion: The study describes reasoning skill development using a story-based task in Indian preschoolers. The study findings further provide clinical and educational implications to assess and foster reasoning abilities among preschoolers.

                Background: Mycobacterial pathogens are among the top causes of diseases in humans. In Kenya, incidences of Non-Tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) species have steadily been on the increase. Most NTMare resistant to first line treatment of tuberculosis and have a challenge in timely and accurate diagnosis. Misdiagnosis has led to prescribing anti-tuberculosis regimens to patients suffering from NTM. We aimed to determine the most prevalent Non-Tuberculous Mycobacterium in Kenya. Methods: We reviewed records from the National Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory(NTRL ) Laboratory information management system (LIMS) between January 2018 and December 2019 for the patients on surveillance. All isolates were cultured in Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tubes (MGIT) and incubated for detection using BACTEC™ MGIT™ system. Those with negative acid-fast bacilli (AFB) growth and negative for Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Complex Species (MTBC) protein-MPT64 were suggestive of NTM infections, which were sub-cultured in MGIT and characterized using Line Probe Assay (LPA) GenoType® MTBDR CM/AS. Descriptive and bivariate analysis was done. Results: Of the total 24,549 records reviewed, 167(0.7%) were NTM isolates. Males comprised of 74.2% (124/167), and the mean age was 42 years (SD±16), age group 35-44 years had the highest NTM at 26.3% (44/167). Nairobi had 12.6% (21/167), Mombasa 10.8% (18/167), Kilifi and Meru each had 7.8% (13/167). Eleven isolated species comprised of Mycobacterium intracellulare 35.3% (65/167), M. fortuitum at 27% (48/167), and M. scrofulaceum at 10.2% (17/167). Previously treated patients had higher NTM [63.5% (106/167)] than Drug-resistant follow-up patients [26.9% (45/167)]. Coinfection with HIV was at 27.5% (46/167). Conclusion: Previously treated patients should have an additional screening of NTMS, and drug susceptibility testing should be done before initiation of treatment.

                Background The topic of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) in civil and commercial contexts presents a contemporary legal challenge aimed at fostering equitable solutions. Among ADR methods, mediation stands out for its ability to reduce time, costs, and litigation duration. This study explores the conceptual framework, essential conditions, and procedural aspects of mediation. It evaluates the sufficiency, regulation, and effectiveness of mediation principles in conflict resolution and risk mitigation. Methods This study is conducted through a comprehensive review of current literature on Alternative Dispute Resolution methods, with a particular focus on mediation as an alternative to dispute settlement. The study utilizes qualitative analysis techniques to examine the effectiveness of mediation principles and their application in resolving civil and commercial disputes. Comparative analyses are also conducted to extract useful insights from various legal systems and authorities. Results The study provides an analysis that illustrates the effectiveness of mediation in resolving disputes, emphasizing its potential benefits in terms of time and cost savings, as well as its srole in facilitating amicable resolutions. The results of this study shall contribute to the current body of knowledge on mediation and provide practical recommendations for its application in diverse legal contexts. Conclusion In conclusion, the study proposes strategies to enhance mediation practices, promote a culture of its adoption, and integrate it more closely into the judicial system. Additionally, it anticipates the future effectiveness of mediation in jurisdictions lacking comprehensive legislation, drawing from successful Western experiences to guide potential developments in Arab legal frameworks.

                Background: Acute sub-massive pulmonary embolism is a common clinical condition, and it is associated with high mortality and morbidity. This condition is commonly associated with various co-morbidities and clinical circumstances. Methods: This is a case report series of 4 patients, wherein the thrombolysis and balloon angioplasty was performed simultaneously using a Cordis 6F diagnostic catheter and later exchanged with a 6F guide catheter in the respective pulmonary artery when a larger balloon was required. Results: All these four patients achieved successful revascularization of the respective pulmonary artery. One patient expired 30 hours after the procedure with a significant reduction in the symptoms suddenly, which was likely a second episode of pulmonary embolism. No bleeding manifestations were observed in any of the patients. The other three patients are on follow-up. Conclusion: Simultaneous coronary balloon dilatation and thrombolysis is a useful method in the treatment of high risk submassive acute pulmonary embolism. If needed, higher caliber balloons can be used for the same technique using guide catheters.

                Background Funding committees, comprising members with a range of knowledge, skills, and experience, are considered integral to the decision-making process of funding organisations for recommending or allocating research funding. However, there is limited research investigating the decision-making processes, the role of members and their social interactions during funding committee meetings conducted both virtually and face-to-face. Methods Using a mixed-methods design and following netnography principles, the study observed nine National Institute for Health and Care Research programmes funding committee meetings conducted virtually during October 2020 to December 2021; complemented by interviews with committee chairs and members (18 interviews) and NIHR staff (12 interviews); an online survey (50 responses); and documentary analysis. Personal reflections through immersive journals also formed part of the analysis. Results Three main themes were identified from the observations, interviews, and online survey: efficiency of virtual committee meetings (importance of preparation, and the role of formality, process, and structure); understanding the effect of virtual committee meetings on well-being (effects of fatigue and apprehension, and the importance of work life balance); understanding social interactions and engagement (levels of engagement, contribution and inclusivity, awareness of unconscious bias and the value of social networking). Conclusions Examining the decision-making practices of one funding organisation across several research programmes, across multiple committee meetings over one year has generated new insights around funding committee practices that previous studies have not been able to explore or investigate. Overall, it was observed that fair and transparent funding recommendations and outcomes can be achieved through virtual funding committees. However, whilst virtual funding committees have many benefits and opportunities, such as the potential to increase membership diversity and inclusivity, and be more environmentally sustainable, more evidence is needed to evaluate their effectiveness, with particular focus on issues of fatigue, engagement, and committee cohesion, especially when new committee members join.

                Introduction Carriers of variant alleles of genes that encode liver CYP450 and UGT enzymes may experience abnormal plasma levels of antipsychotics and, consequently, worse efficacy or tolerability. Although pharmacogenomics is a rapidly developing field, current guidelines often rely on limited, underpowered evidence. We have previously demonstrated that meta-analysis is a viable strategy for overcoming this problem. Here, we propose a project that will expand our previous work and create a living systematic review and meta-analysis of drug plasma level differences between carriers and non-carriers of variant genotype-predicted phenotypes for every pharmacokinetic drug-gene interaction relevant to commonly used antipsychotic drugs. Protocol First, a baseline systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted by searching for observational pharmacogenomics-pharmacokinetic studies. Data on dose-adjusted drug plasma levels will be extracted, and participants will be grouped based on their genotype for each drug-gene pair separately. Differences in plasma drug levels between different phenotypes will be compared using a random-effect ratio-of-means meta-analysis. The risk of bias will be assessed using ROBINS-I, and the certainty of evidence will be assessed using GRADE. Following the establishment of baseline results, the literature search will be re-run at least once every six months, and the baseline data will be updated and re-evaluated as new evidence is published. A freely available website will be designated to present up-to-date results and conclusions. Discussion This systematic review will provide evidence-based results that are continuously updated with evidence as it emerges in the rapidly developing field of pharmacogenomics. These results may help psychiatrists in their decision-making, as clinicians are becoming increasingly aware of the patients’ genetic data as testing becomes more widespread and cheaper. In addition, the results may serve as a scientific basis for the development of evidence-based pharmacogenomics algorithms for personalized dosing of antipsychotics to mitigate potentially harmful drug-gene interactions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-439/v2?src=rss">Paying reviewers and regulating the number of papers may help fix the peer-review process [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The exponential increase in the number of submissions, further accelerated by generative AI, and the decline in the availability of experts are burdening the peer review process. This has led to high unethical desk rejection rates, a growing appeal for the publication of unreviewed preprints, and a worrying proliferation of predatory journals. The idea of monetarily compensating peer reviewers has been around for many years; maybe, it is time to take it seriously as one way to save the peer review process. Here, I argue that paying reviewers, when done in a fair and transparent way, is a viable solution. Like the case of professional language editors, part-time or full-time professional reviewers, managed by universities or for-profit companies, can be an integral part of modern peer review. Being a professional reviewer could be financially attractive to retired senior researchers and to researchers who enjoy evaluating papers but are not motivated to do so for free. Moreover, not all produced research needs to go through peer review, and thus persuading researchers to limit submissions to their most novel and useful research could also help bring submission volumes to manageable levels. Overall, this paper reckons that the problem is not the peer review process per se but rather its function within an academic ecosystem dominated by an unhealthy culture of ‘publish or perish’. Instead of reforming the peer review process, academia has to look for better science dissemination schemes that promote collaboration over competition, engagement over judgement, and research quality and sustainability over quantity.

Miq as a potential antiviral agent for Newcastle disease [version 7; peer review: 2 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Recent evidence suggests that some flavonoid compounds obtained from crude methanol extract of mistletoe leaves (Dendrophthoe pentandra L. Miq), also known as Benalu Duku (BD), have antimicrobial effects. Thus, the plant has the potential to eliminate viruses that may cause outbreaks in chicken farms. This study aimed to prove the in vitro ability of flavonoid compounds, namely quercetin-like compounds (QLCs), to eliminate field viruses, specifically the Newcastle disease virus (NDV). Methods This research was performed in two stages. An in vitro test was used with a post-test of the control groups designed at a significance of 0.05. BD leaves (5 kg) were extracted using a maceration method with methanol and then separated into hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and methanol fractions. The final extracted products were separated using semi-preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to obtain QLCs. The QLCs were identified and compared with quercetin using HPLC, proton and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The activity of QLCs was tested in vitro against the NDV at a virulence titter of 10−5 Tissue Culture Infectious Dose 50% (TCID50) in chicken kidney cell culture. Results Solutions of 0.05% (w/v) QLCs were discovered to have antiviral activity against NDVs, with an average cytopathogenic effect antigenicity at a 10−5 dilution (p<0.05). Conclusions QLCs from flavonoids from the leaves of BD have in vitro antiviral bioactivity against NDV at a virulence titter of 10-5 Tissue Culture Infectious Dose 50% (TCID50) in chicken kidney cell culture. QLCs may have the potential to be developed as medicinal compounds for the treatment of other human or animal viral infections.

                Background Primiparous mothers face diverse challenges during pregnancy and post-childbirth. There is a lack of comprehensive educational programs for primiparous mothers on maternal functioning and newborn care. This study aimed to explore the efficacy of a developed educational program on the attitude of primiparous mothers towards newborn communication, general health, feeding and swallowing.

Methods Ninety-eight primiparous mothers without any obstetric history, proficient in English or Kannada, and delivering healthy newborns were recruited for the study. Phase 1 involved the development and validation of AQ, the parent education program [Newborn Communication, Health, Feeding and Swallowing Education Program (N-CHFSEP)], and FQ; while Phase 2 comprised of administering them on the mothers. Both quantitative (descriptive statistics, paired t-test, and chi-square test) and qualitative analysis were done on the parameters of interest. Results The results of the study demonstrated a notable increase in the number of mothers (not all) reporting heightened confidence levels following receiving the N-CHFSEP (which was observed in all the domains). This observed change (pre and post) was statistically significant as per paired t-test analysis (p <0.05) indicating a significant increase in confidence levels post-N-CHFSEP intervention, as well as recognizing warning signs related to the same. Sociodemographic factors such as age, education, occupation, and family type were reported to have a significant effect (p <0.05) on maternal confidence levels before and after N-CHFSEP administration. Feedback from participants highlighted the effectiveness of the program in enhancing knowledge and awareness, while also suggesting areas for improvement. Conclusions This study demonstrates the effectiveness of N-CHFSEP in enhancing primiparous mothers' confidence in newborn care, thereby improving maternal and infant health.

                A 74-year-old Japanese woman who underwent Mann’s procedure with fibular sesamoidectomy for left hallux valgus 21 years ago complained of left hallucis pain. She was diagnosed with iatrogenic hallux varus and hammer toe deformities. Metatarsophalangeal joint arthrodesis and shortening oblique osteotomy were performed. After surgery, the hallux valgus angle improved from -28° to 0°, and the intermetatarsal angle between the first and the second metatarsus improved from 0° to 6°. The Japanese Society for Surgery of the Foot RA foot and ankle scale improved from 73 to 81 points. She could walk without pain and sustained no deformity at 4 years after the surgery.

In addition, distinct structural domains of nematode TMC-1 mediate mechanosensation and alkaline sensing. These domains are segregated between mammalian mTMC1 and mTMC3, and mTMC1 supports mechanosensation in nematodes, while mTMC3 supports alkaline sensing.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87316">Uremic toxin indoxyl sulfate induces trained immunity via the AhR-dependent arachidonic acid pathway in end-stage renal disease (ESRD)</a></h4>

              
                Trained immunity is the long-term functional reprogramming of innate immune cells, which results in altered responses toward a secondary challenge. Despite indoxyl sulfate (IS) being a potent stimulus associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD)-related inflammation, its impact on trained immunity has not been explored. Here, we demonstrate that IS induces trained immunity in monocytes via epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming, resulting in augmented cytokine production. Mechanistically, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) contributes to IS-trained immunity by enhancing the expression of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism-related genes such as arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5) and ALOX5 activating protein (ALOX5AP). Inhibition of AhR during IS training suppresses the induction of IS-trained immunity. Monocytes from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients have increased ALOX5 expression and after 6 days training, they exhibit enhanced TNF-α and IL-6 production to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Furthermore, healthy control-derived monocytes trained with uremic sera from ESRD patients exhibit increased production of TNF-α and IL-6. Consistently, IS-trained mice and their splenic myeloid cells had increased production of TNF-α after in vivo and ex vivo LPS stimulation compared to that of control mice. These results provide insight into the role of IS in the induction of trained immunity, which is critical during inflammatory immune responses in CKD patients.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92679">Differential regulation by CD47 and thrombospondin-1 of extramedullary erythropoiesis in mouse spleen</a></h4>

              
                Extramedullary erythropoiesis is not expected in healthy adult mice, but erythropoietic gene expression was elevated in lineage-depleted spleen cells from <i>Cd47<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice. Expression of several genes associated with early stages of erythropoiesis was elevated in mice lacking CD47 or its signaling ligand thrombospondin-1, consistent with previous evidence that this signaling pathway inhibits expression of multipotent stem cell transcription factors in spleen. In contrast, cells expressing markers of committed erythroid progenitors were more abundant in <i>Cd47<sup>−/−</sup></i> spleens but significantly depleted in <i>Thbs1<sup>−/−</sup></i> spleens. Single-cell transcriptome and flow cytometry analyses indicated that loss of CD47 is associated with accumulation and increased proliferation in spleen of Ter119<sup>−</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup> progenitors and Ter119<sup>+</sup>CD34<sup>−</sup> committed erythroid progenitors with elevated mRNA expression of Kit, Ermap, and Tfrc. Induction of committed erythroid precursors is consistent with the known function of CD47 to limit the phagocytic removal of aged erythrocytes. Conversely, loss of thrombospondin-1 delays the turnover of aged red blood cells, which may account for the suppression of committed erythroid precursors in <i>Thbs1<sup>−/−</sup></i> spleens relative to basal levels in wild-type mice. In addition to defining a role for CD47 to limit extramedullary erythropoiesis, these studies reveal a thrombospondin-1-dependent basal level of extramedullary erythropoiesis in adult mouse spleen.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96386">Selective recruitment of the cerebellum evidenced by task-dependent gating of inputs</a></h4>

              
                Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have documented cerebellar activity across a wide array of tasks. However, the functional contribution of the cerebellum within these task domains remains unclear because cerebellar activity is often studied in isolation. This is problematic, as cerebellar fMRI activity may simply reflect the transmission of neocortical activity through fixed connections. Here, we present a new approach that addresses this problem. Rather than focus on task-dependent activity changes in the cerebellum alone, we ask if neocortical inputs to the cerebellum are gated in a task-dependent manner. We hypothesize that input is upregulated when the cerebellum functionally contributes to a task. We first validated this approach using a finger movement task, where the integrity of the cerebellum has been shown to be essential for the coordination of rapid alternating movements but not for force generation. While both neocortical and cerebellar activity increased with increasing speed and force, the speed-related changes in the cerebellum were larger than predicted by an optimized cortico-cerebellar connectivity model. We then applied the same approach in a cognitive domain, assessing how the cerebellum supports working memory. Enhanced gating was associated with the encoding of items in working memory, but not with the manipulation or retrieval of the items. Focusing on task-dependent gating of neocortical inputs to the cerebellum offers a promising approach for using fMRI to understand the specific contributions of the cerebellum to cognitive function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92621">Comparative transcriptomics reveal a novel tardigrade-specific DNA-binding protein induced in response to ionizing radiation</a></h4>

              
                Tardigrades are microscopic animals renowned for their ability to withstand extreme conditions, including high doses of ionizing radiation (IR). To better understand their radio-resistance, we first characterized induction and repair of DNA double- and single-strand breaks after exposure to IR in the model species <i>Hypsibius exemplaris</i>. Importantly, we found that the rate of single-strand breaks induced was roughly equivalent to that in human cells, suggesting that DNA repair plays a predominant role in tardigrades’ radio-resistance. To identify novel tardigrade-specific genes involved, we next conducted a comparative transcriptomics analysis across three different species. In all three species, many DNA repair genes were among the most strongly overexpressed genes alongside a novel tardigrade-specific gene, which we named <i>Tardigrade DNA damage Response 1</i> (<i>TDR1</i>). We found that TDR1 protein interacts with DNA and forms aggregates at high concentration suggesting it may condensate DNA and preserve chromosome organization until DNA repair is accomplished. Remarkably, when expressed in human cells, TDR1 improved resistance to Bleomycin, a radiomimetic drug. Based on these findings, we propose that TDR1 is a novel tardigrade-specific gene conferring resistance to IR. Our study sheds light on mechanisms of DNA repair helping cope with high levels of DNA damage inflicted by IR.

">Age-dependent predictors of effective reinforcement motor learning across childhood</a></h4>

              
                Across development, children must learn motor skills such as eating with a spoon and drawing with a crayon. Reinforcement learning, driven by success and failure, is fundamental to such sensorimotor learning. It typically requires a child to explore movement options along a continuum (grip location on a crayon) and learn from probabilistic rewards (whether the crayon draws or breaks). Here, we studied the development of reinforcement motor learning using online motor tasks to engage children aged 3 to 17 and adults (cross-sectional sample, N=385). Participants moved a cartoon penguin across a scene and were rewarded (animated cartoon clip) based on their final movement position. Learning followed a clear developmental trajectory when participants could choose to move anywhere along a continuum and the reward probability depended on final movement position. Learning was incomplete or absent in 3 to 8-year-olds and gradually improved to adult-like levels by adolescence. A reinforcement learning model fit to each participant identified three age-dependent factors underlying improvement: amount of exploration after a failed movement, learning rate, and level of motor noise. We predicted, and confirmed, that switching to discrete targets and deterministic reward would improve 3 to 8-year-olds' learning to adult-like levels by increasing exploration after failed movements. Overall, we show a robust developmental trajectory of reinforcement motor learning abilities under ecologically relevant conditions i.e., continuous movement options mapped to probabilistic reward. This learning appears to be limited by immature spatial processing and probabilistic reasoning abilities in young children and can be rescued by reducing the demands in these domains.

">Sex-specific GABAergic microcircuits that switch vulnerability into resilience to stress and reverse the effects of chronic stress exposure</a></h4>

              
                Clinical and preclinical studies have identified somatostatin (SST)-positive interneurons as key elements that regulate the vulnerability to stress-related psychiatric disorders. Conversely, disinhibition of SST neurons in mice results in resilience to the behavioral effects of chronic stress. Here we established a low-dose chronic chemogenetic protocol to map these changes in positively and negatively motivated behaviors to specific brain regions. AAV-hM3Dq mediated chronic activation of SST neurons in the prelimbic cortex (PLC) had antidepressant drug-like effects on anxiety- and anhedonia-like motivated behaviors in male but not female mice. Analogous manipulation of the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) had such effects in female but not male mice. Moreover, activation of SST neurons in the PLC of male and the vHPC of female mice resulted in stress resilience. Activation of SST neurons in the PLC reversed prior chronic stress-induced defects in motivated behavior in males but was ineffective in females. Conversely, activation of SST neurons in the vHPC reversed chronic stress-induced behavioral alterations in females but not males. Quantitation of c-Fos+ and FosB+ neurons in chronic stress-exposed mice revealed that chronic activation of SST neurons leads to a paradoxical increase in pyramidal cell activity. Collectively, these data demonstrate that GABAergic microcircuits driven by dendrite targeting interneurons enable sex- and brain-region-specific neural plasticity that promotes stress resilience and reverses stress-induced anxiety- and anhedonia-like motivated behavior. Our studies provide a mechanistic rationale for antidepressant efficacy of dendrite-targeting, low-potency GABAA receptor agonists, independent of sex and despite striking sex differences in the relevant brain substrates.

">A dendritic substrate for temporal diversity of cortical inhibition</a></h4>

              
                In the mammalian neocortex, GABAergic interneurons (INs) inhibit cortical networks in profoundly different ways. The extent to which this depends on how different INs process excitatory signals along their dendrites is poorly understood. Here, we reveal that the functional specialization of two major populations of cortical INs is determined by the unique association of different dendritic integration modes with distinct synaptic organization motifs. We found that somatostatin (SST)-INs exhibit NMDAR-dependent dendritic integration and uniform synapse density along the dendritic tree. In contrast, dendrites of parvalbumin (PV)-INs exhibit passive synaptic integration coupled with proximally enriched synaptic distributions. Theoretical analysis shows that these two dendritic configurations result in different strategies to optimize synaptic efficacy in thin dendritic structures. Yet, the two configurations lead to distinct temporal engagement of each IN during network activity. We confirmed these predictions with in vivo recordings of IN activity in the visual cortex of awake mice, revealing a rapid and linear recruitment of PV-INs as opposed to a long-lasting integrative activation of SST-INs. Our work reveals the existence of distinct dendritic strategies that confer distinct temporal representations for the two major classes of neocortical INs and thus dynamics of inhibition.

">A Systematic Review of the Neuroprotective Role and Biomarker Potential of GDF15 in Neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegeneration is characteristically multifaceted, with limited therapeutic options. One of the chief pathophysiological mechanisms driving these conditions is neuroinflammation, prompting increasing clinical interest in immunomodulatory agents. Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15; previously also called macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 or MIC-1), an anti-inflammatory cytokine with established neurotrophic properties, has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent in recent decades. However, methodological challenges and the delayed identification of its specific receptor GFRAL have hindered research progress. This review systematically examines literature about GDF15 in neurodegenerative diseases and neurotrauma. The evidence collated in this review indicates that GDF15 expression is upregulated in response to neurodegenerative pathophysiology and increasing its levels in preclinical models typically improves outcomes. Key knowledge gaps are addressed for future investigations to foster a more comprehensive understanding of the neuroprotective effects elicited by GDF15.

">Advancing Thalamic Nuclei Segmentation: The Impact of Compressed Sensing and FastSurfer on MRI Processing</a></h4>

              
                The thalamus is a collection of gray matter nuclei that play a crucial role in sensorimotor processing and modulation of cortical activity. Characterizing thalamic nuclei is particularly relevant for patient populations with Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, dementia, and schizophrenia. However, severe head motion in these populations poses a significant challenge for in vivo mapping of thalamic nuclei. Recent advancements have leveraged the compressed sensing (CS) framework to accelerate acquisition times in MPRAGE sequence variants, while fast segmentation tools like FastSurfer have reduced processing times in MRI research. In this study, we evaluated thalamic nuclei segmentations derived from six different MPRAGE variants with varying degrees of CS acceleration (from about 9 to about 1 minute acquisitions), using both FreeSurfer and FastSurfer for segmentation. Our findings show minimal sequence effects with no systematic bias, and low volume variability across sequences for the whole thalamus and major thalamic nuclei. Notably, CS-accelerated sequences produced less variable volumes compared to non-CS sequences. Additionally, segmentations of thalamic nuclei by FreeSurfer and FastSurfer were highly comparable. We provide first evidence supporting that a good segmentation quality of thalamic nuclei with compressed sensing T1-weighted image acceleration in a clinical 3T MRI system is possible. Our findings encourage future applications of fast T1-weighted MRI to study deep gray matter. CS-accelerated sequences and rapid segmentation methods are promising tools for future studies aiming to characterize thalamic nuclei in vivo at 3T in both healthy individuals and clinical populations.

">Probing tau citrullination in Alzheimer's disease brains and mouse models of tauopathy</a></h4>

              
                Tauopathies, which include Alzheimers disease (AD) share a common defining factor, namely misfolded tau protein. However, the "upstream" etiology and downstream clinical manifestations of tauopathies are quite diverse. Tau deposition elicits different pathological phenotypes and outcomes depending on the tau strain and regional susceptibility. Posttranslational modifications (PTM) can alter tau structure, function, networks, and its pathological sequalae. We uncovered a novel PTM of tau, named citrullination, caused by peptidyl arginine deiminase (PAD) enzymes. PAD induced citrullination irreversibly converts arginine residues to citrulline, producing net loss of positive charge, elimination of pi-pi interactions, and increased hydrophobicity. We observed increased PAD2 and PAD4 in Alzheimers disease (AD) brain and that they both can citrullinate tau. Tau can become citrullinated by PADs at all 14 arginine residues throughout the N-terminal domain (N-term), proline-rich domain (PR), microtubule binding repeat domain (MBR), and C-terminal domain (C-term) on full length tau (2N4R). Citrullination of tau impacts fibrillization and oligomerization rates in aggregation assays. Utilizing a panel of novel citrullinated tau (citR tau) antibodies, we identified citrullination of tau in vitro, several animal models of tauopathies, and Alzheimers disease (AD). CitR tau increased with Braak stage and was enriched in AD brains with higher phospho-tau burden. This work provides a new area of tau biology that signifies further consideration in the emerging spectrum of tauopathies and its clinical understanding.

                INTRODUCTION: We investigated the effects of multiple cerebrovascular disease (CeVD) neuroimaging markers on brain functional connectivity (FC), and how such CeVD-related FC changes interact with plasma p-tau181 (Alzheimer's disease (AD) marker) to influence downstream neurodegeneration and cognitive changes. METHODS: Multivariate associations between four CeVD markers and whole-brain FC in 529 participants across the dementia spectrum were examined using partial least squares correlation. Interactive effects of CeVD-related FC patterns and p-tau181 on longitudinal grey matter volume and cognitive changes were investigated using linear mixed-effects models. RESULTS: We identified a brain FC phenotype associated with high CeVD burden across all markers. Further, expression of this general CeVD-related FC phenotype and p-tau181 contributed additively, but not synergistically, to baseline and longitudinal grey matter volumes and cognitive changes. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that CeVD exerts global effects on the brain connectome and highlight the additive nature of AD and CeVD on neurodegeneration and cognition.

">Representation of visual uniformity in the lateral prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Visual illusions tend to have early visual cortical correlates. However, this general trend may not apply to our subjective impression of a detailed and uniform visual world, which may be considered illusory given the paucity of peripheral processing. Using a psychophysically calibrated visual illusion, we assessed the patterns of hemodynamic activity in the human brain that distinguished between the illusory percept of uniformity in the periphery (i.e., Gabor patches having identical orientations) from the accurate perception of incoherence. We identified voxel patterns in the lateral prefrontal cortex that predicted perceived uniformity, which could also generalize to scene uniformity in naturalistic movies. Because similar representations of visual uniformity can also be found in the intermediate and late layers of a feedforward convolutional neural network, the perception of uniformity may involve high-level coding of abstract properties of the entire scene as a whole, that is distinct from the filling-in of specific details in early visual areas.

">GPT-3 reveals selective insensitivity to global vs. local linguistic context in speech produced by treatment-naive patients with positive thought disorder</a></h4>

              
                Background: Early psychopathologists proposed that certain features of positive thought disorder, the disorganized language output produced by some people with schizophrenia, suggest an insensitivity to global, relative to local, discourse context. This idea has received support from carefully controlled psycholinguistic studies in language comprehension. In language production, researchers have so far remained reliant on subjective qualitative rating scales to assess and understand speech disorganization. Now, however, recent advances in large language models mean that it is possible to quantify sensitivity to global and local context objectively by probing lexical probability (the predictability of a word given its preceding context) during natural language production. Methods: For each word in speech produced by 60 first-episode psychosis patients and 35 healthy, demographically-matched controls, we extracted lexical probabilities from GPT-3 based on contexts that ranged from very local--a single preceding word: P(Wn | Wn-1)--to global--up to 50 preceding words: P(Wn|Wn-50, Wn-49, ..., Wn-1). Results: We show, for the first time, that disorganized speech is characterized by disproportionate insensitivity to global, versus local, linguistic context. Critically, this global-versus-local insensitivity selectively predicted clinical ratings of positive thought disorder, above and beyond overall symptom severity. There was no evidence of a relationship with negative thought disorder (impoverishment). Conclusions: We provide an automated, interpretable measure that can potentially be used to quantify speech disorganization in schizophrenia. Our findings directly link the clinical phenomenology of thought disorder to neurocognitive constructs that are grounded in psycholinguistic theory and neurobiology.

	<p>Glioblastoma is the most common and malignant primary brain tumor, with high morbidity and mortality. Despite an aggressive, multimodal treatment regimen, including surgical resection followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the prognosis of glioblastoma patients remains poor. One formidable challenge to advancing glioblastoma therapy is the complexity of the tumor microenvironment. The tumor microenvironment of glioblastoma is a highly dynamic and heterogeneous system that consists of not only cancerous cells but also various resident or infiltrating inflammatory cells. These inflammatory cells not only provide a unique tumor environment for glioblastoma cells to develop and grow but also play important roles in regulating tumor aggressiveness and treatment resistance. Targeting the tumor microenvironment, especially neuroinflammation, has increasingly been recognized as a novel therapeutic approach in glioblastoma. In this review, we discuss the components of the tumor microenvironment in glioblastoma, focusing on neuroinflammation. We discuss the interactions between different tumor microenvironment components as well as their functions in regulating glioblastoma pathogenesis and progression. We will also discuss the anti-tumor microenvironment interventions that can be employed as potential therapeutic targets.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to identify when and how eye movements change across the human lifespan to benchmark developmental biomarkers. The sample size comprised 45,696 participants, ranging in age from 6 to 80 years old (M = 30.39; SD = 17.46). Participants completed six eye movement tests: Circular Smooth Pursuit, Horizontal Smooth Pursuit, Vertical Smooth Pursuit, Horizontal Saccades, Vertical Saccades, and Fixation Stability. These tests examined all four major eye movements (fixations, saccades, pursuits, and vergence) using 89 eye-tracking algorithms. A semi-supervised, self-training, machine learning classifier was used to group the data into age ranges. This classifier resulted in 12 age groups: 6&amp;amp;ndash;7, 8&amp;amp;ndash;11, 12&amp;amp;ndash;14, 15&amp;amp;ndash;25, 26&amp;amp;ndash;31, 32&amp;amp;ndash;38, 39&amp;amp;ndash;45, 46&amp;amp;ndash;53, 54&amp;amp;ndash;60, 61&amp;amp;ndash;68, 69&amp;amp;ndash;76, and 77&amp;amp;ndash;80 years. To provide a descriptive indication of the strength of the self-training classifier, a series of multiple analyses of variance (MANOVA) were conducted on the multivariate effect of the age groups by test set. Each MANOVA revealed a significant multivariate effect on age groups (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Developmental changes in eye movements across age categories were identified. Specifically, similarities were observed between very young and elderly individuals. Middle-aged individuals (30s) generally showed the best eye movement metrics. Clinicians and researchers may use the findings from this study to inform decision-making on patients&amp;amp;rsquo; health and wellness and guide effective research methodologies.</p>

                Introduction Biofeedback is a non-pharmacological treatment option valued for its minimal risk of adverse events and offers a safe alternative for individuals seeking preventive care for migraine. Despite level A evidence for migraine prevention, biofeedback treatment is still unavailable to most patients. We developed a novel medical device (Cerebri) for multimodal biofeedback treatment that omits the need for healthcare personnel involvement. Cerebri consists of a smartphone application (app) and two wireless sensors. Unique in its approach, the Cerebri app seamlessly integrates three biofeedback modalities – heart rate variability, temperature, and electromyography – making it a comprehensive, therapist-independent solution for non-pharmacological migraine management. Methods Biofeedback therapy using Cerebri for the prevention of migraine attacks in adults with episodic migraine (The BioCer study) was an open-label, randomized, waitlist-controlled, multicenter trial. This study investigated the safety and efficacy of daily home-based biofeedback sessions using the Cerebri device. A total of 286 participants will be randomized to either a 12-week intervention arm or waitlist control arm. The primary outcome was the change in the mean number of migraine days from baseline to the last 28-day period during the treatment phase in the treatment group compared with the control group. The primary outcome variable was prospectively collected through daily eDiary entries. Ethics and Dissemination Approval from the ethics committee and competent authorities was obtained prior to study initiation. Participation was voluntary and informed and written consent was obtained prior to inclusion. The results of this trial will be published in peer-reviewed international medical journals and communicated to patients and healthcare personnel through the relevant channels.

                Background Digital technologies proliferate in many people’s lives around the world with over 65% of these technology users being online. Children and youth are among the most prominent adopters of digital technologies in forms such as video gaming, social media, and online shopping. Problematic use of digital technologies can lead to poorer school/work performance, neglect of self-care skills, and comorbidities with other mental health issues. However, when used non-problematically, digital technology can also contribute to improving health and well-being. With the abundance of literature published, many reviews have sought to collate literature on treatment and interventions for children and youth with varying results. Thus, our proposed systematic review aims to synthesize current systematic reviews and meta-analyses on interventions and treatment of problematic digital technology use in children and youth (up to 25 years old). Methods As part of a three-paper series, a systematic search was completed in PsycINFO, Web of Science, and PubMed databases. Grey literature databases of the World Health Organization (IRIS database) and ClinicalTrials.gov were also searched. Furthermore, hand-searching of reference lists was also conducted. Title and abstract screening, followed by full-text screening, were completed by at least two independent reviewers. For this review, the extractions and the quality of selected reviews will be assessed using AMSTAR 2.0 by two authors independently and reviewed by two additional authors. Results Results will be presented in narrative and tabular form. The results of this study are expected to offer insights into the populations of children and youth studied, treatments/interventions provided, outcomes, results, limitations, and conclusions of literature from the past five years. Feasibility and generalizability of the reviews will also be discussed. Conclusions Methodological strengths and weaknesses of reviewed studies will point to gaps in knowledge and can be used to inform future areas of policy and research.

                <p>Measuring the dynamic relationship between neuromodulators, such as dopamine, and neuronal action potentials is imperative to understand how these fundamental modes of neural signaling interact to mediate behavior. We developed methods to measure concurrently dopamine and extracellular action potentials (i.e., spikes) in monkeys. Standard fast-scan cyclic voltammetric (FSCV) electrochemical (EChem) and electrophysiological (EPhys) recording systems are combined and used to collect spike and dopamine signals, respectively, from an array of carbon fiber (CF) sensors implanted in the monkey striatum. FSCV requires the application of small voltages at the implanted sensors to measure redox currents generated from target molecules, such as dopamine. These applied voltages create artifacts at neighboring EPhys measurement sensors which may lead to misclassification of these signals as physiological spikes. Therefore, simple automated temporal interpolation algorithms were designed to remove these artifacts and enable accurate spike extraction. We validated these methods using simulated artifacts and demonstrated an average spike recovery rate of 84.5%. We identified and discriminated cell type-specific units in the monkey striatum that were shown to correlate to specific behavioral task parameters related to reward size and eye movement direction. Synchronously recorded spike and dopamine signals displayed contrasting relations to the task variables, suggesting a complex relationship between these two modes of neural signaling. Future application of our methods will help advance our understanding of the interactions between neuromodulator signaling and neuronal activity, to elucidate more detailed mechanisms of neural circuitry and plasticity mediating behaviors in health and in disease.</p>

                <p>Preparing acute brain slices produces trauma that mimics severe penetrating brain injury. In neonatal acute brain slices, the spatiotemporal characteristics of trauma-induced calcium dynamics in neurons and its effect on network activity are relatively unknown. Using multiphoton laser scanning microscopy of the somatosensory neocortex in acute neonatal mouse brain slices (P8&ndash;12), we simultaneously imaged neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics (GCaMP6s) and cytotoxicity (propidium iodide or PI) to determine the relationship between cytotoxic Ca<sup>2+</sup> loaded neurons (GCaMP-filled) and cell viability at different depths and incubation times. PI<sup>+</sup> cells and GCaMP-filled neurons were abundant at the surface of the slices, with an exponential decrease with depth. Regions with high PI<sup>+</sup> cells correlated with elevated neuronal and neuropil Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The number of PI<sup>+</sup> cells and GCaMP-filled neurons increased with prolonged incubation. GCaMP-filled neurons did not participate in stimulus-evoked or seizure-evoked network activity. Significantly, the superficial tissue, with a higher degree of trauma-induced injury, showed attenuated seizure-related neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses. Calpain inhibition prevented the increase in PI<sup>+</sup> cells and GCaMP-filled neurons in the deep tissue and during prolonged incubation times. Isoform-specific pharmacological inhibition implicated calpain-2 as a significant contributor to trauma-induced injury in acute slices. Our results show a calpain-mediated spatiotemporal relationship between cell death and aberrant neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> load in acute neonatal brain slices. Also, we demonstrate that neurons in acute brain slices exhibit altered physiology depending on the degree of trauma-induced injury. Blocking calpains may be a therapeutic option to prevent acute neuronal death during traumatic brain injury in the young brain.</p>

                Background The discovery of an ideal and effective therapy is urgently required for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. The main pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease that appear before the clinical symptoms are neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid plaques, brain inflammation, and neuronal atrophy throughout the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. GSK-3β (Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3β) is regarded as the most important and promising target for therapeutic use because GSK-3β expression levels increase with age and are the most abundant and hyperactive in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease. Methods We used Maestro, which is Schrodinger, for our computational simulation studies. In the present work, we have used different modules that were used in previous studies with a little modification, the modules such as Protein Preparation with the help of Protein Preparation Wizard, Ligand Preparation with the help of LigPrep, for ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion) prediction we used Qikprop, Docking studies we used Glide module, Binding energy prediction we used Prime and Molecular dynamic simulation studies by Desmond Results Our focus is mainly on an in-silico approach, focusing on library generation; we first drew an imidazo [1,5-a]pyridine-3-carboxamide (IMID 2) scaffold structure at Enamine and subjected it to a substructure search to target the receptor grid region (ATP-competitive site) of 6Y9R. They were then subjected to various screening processes. Finally, we selected nine compounds and subjected them to molecular dynamic simulation studies. Conclusions Nine compounds showed good results with the most stable interactions. Further experiments and studies are required to confirm these results.

                Photobiomodulation (PBM) has demonstrated positive effects on bone healing after fracture. This case report describes a skateboard-related shoulder anterior dislocation with Bankart and Hill-Sachs lesions. After a non-invasive reduction, the patient received conservative treatment with PBM. PBM was started on the accident day and continued daily for 30 days, followed by bi-weekly irradiation for 33 months. In the initial 30 days, the patient’s pain decreased, and the shoulder function was recovered with no pain, swelling, or bruising. On day 28, there was a reduction in edema compared to the initial injury and a full shoulder recovery for daily and sports activities. Physical examinations confirmed shoulder joint stability and the images at 33 months demonstrated Hill-Sachs lesion healing and significant Bankart lesion repair. In conclusion, PBM can induce recovery, alleviate pain, and facilitate functional rehabilitation. Additional clinical trials are required to validate the efficacy of this complementary therapy.

                Background Determinant and characteristic polynomials are important concepts related to square matrices. Due to the absence of additive inverse in max-plus algebra, the determinant of a matrix over max-plus algebra can be represented by a permanent. In addition, there are several types of square matrices over max-plus algebra, including triangular and diagonal strictly double ℝ -astic matrices. A special formula has been devised to determine the permanent and characteristic max-polynomial of those matrices. Another algebraic structure that is isomorphic with max-plus algebra is min-plus algebra. Methods Min-plus algebra is the algebraic structure of triple ( ℝ ε ′ , ⊕ ′ , ⊗ ) . Furthermore, square matrices over min plus algebra are defined by the set of matrices sized n × n , the entries of which are the elements of ℝ ε ′ . Because these two algebraic structures are isomorphic, the permanent and characteristic min-polynomial can also be determined for each square matrix over min-plus algebra, as well as the types of matrices. Results In this paper, we find out the special formulas for determining the permanent and characteristic min-polynomial of the triangular matrix and the diagonal strictly double ℝ -astic matrix. Conclusions We show that the formula for determining the characteristic min-polynomial of the two matrices is the same, for each triangular matrix and strictly double ℝ -astic matrix A , χ A ( x ) = ⨁ r = 0 , 1 , … , n ′ δ n − r ⊗ n r .

                Background Because of its close relationship with vessels that supply the thyroid gland, it is necessary to understand and document the course of the laryngeal nerves to prevent accidental damage. Otherwise it can lead to weakness in vocal cord function if ligated along with the arteries during thyroidectomy or other surgical procedures. The aim of our study was to examine and document the origin, relationship, and branching patterns of the laryngeal nerves on the side of the neck. Method The present cross sectional anatomical study was conducted on 64 dissected necks of formalin-fixed cadavers that were utilized for undergraduate teaching purposes. Different parameters were measured in the neck along with the relationship between the laryngeal nerves and their accompanying arteries. Results We observed usual and unusual course of laryngeal nerves along with some variations. Some of the novel findings were an internal laryngeal nerve piercing the thyroid cartilage lamina and an external laryngeal nerve communicating with the superior cervical ganglion. Conclusion The present study observed anatomical variations in the course of the laryngeal nerves, which are relevant for clinical practice. The potential risks of damage to these laryngeal nerves during various surgical procedures make it necessary to review and compile its relationship with the surrounding structures.

                Background Cardiac amyloidosis, characterized by the deposition of amyloid proteins in the heart tissue, presents in two main types: transthyretin (ATTR) and light-chain (AL) amyloidosis. The hemodynamic response to exercise and the relationship with pulmonary hypertension (PH) in these patients is not well understood. Methods This retrospective study analyzed 100 patients diagnosed with either ATTR or AL amyloidosis. We assessed the prevalence of PH at rest and its induction during exercise stress tests. Hemodynamic parameters were measured to identify differences in the cardiac response to exercise between the two subtypes. Results A higher prevalence of PH was noted in the ATTR group compared to the AL group. Exercise stress tests induced significant PH, particularly in the ATTR subgroup. Subtle yet clinically relevant hemodynamic differences were observed between the amyloidosis subtypes. Conclusions Our findings suggest that the amyloidosis subtype is an important factor in the management of PH. There is a need for tailored clinical approaches to address the distinct pathophysiological mechanisms in ATTR and AL amyloidosis. This study contributes to a better understanding of the hemodynamic changes during exercise in cardiac amyloidosis and underscores the importance of subtype-specific management strategies.

                Background The Liver is a vital organ in the human body, which plays a crucial role in various physiological processes. Oxidative stress is a critical factor in the pathogenesis and progression of various liver diseases, contributing to cellular damage and dysfunction. The Liver is particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of reactive oxygen species when the balance between their production and the body’s antioxidant defense mechanisms is disrupted. The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for liver diseases due to its pivotal role in cellular defense against oxidative stress and inflammation. Plants have always been a source of drugs which has been used to treat various pharmacological disorders and most of its activity is due to its potential as an antioxidant. However, the specific mechanisms by which they interact with the NRF2 pathway and confer protection against liver diseases remain inadequately elucidated. Therefore, this scoping review aims to identify and analyze the existing literature pertaining to the relationship between Phytomolecules, which can modulate NRF2 and protect against liver diseases. Methods The proposed scoping review will follow the steps given by “Arksey and O’Malley and Levac et al”. Electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, etc.) will be searched for recent relevant studies. A predefined criterion for the inclusion and exclusion of studies will be independently adopted by two reviewers. The review will be presented as per the “Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Extension for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR)” guidelines. Conclusion The scoping review finding is expected to help understanding the role of Phytomolecules in preventing liver diseases by modulating the NRF2 pathway. Ultimately, this review will serve as a foundational step toward developing targeted interventions to improve liver health outcomes and reduce the global burden of liver diseases.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The degree of intratumoral lipiodol staining after conventional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE) has the potential to predict tumor responses and disease prognosis. This study is aimed at evaluating the correlation between the lipiodol retention of the tumor with a complete response after cTACE and tumor recurrence by quantitative assessment. Methods From January 2013 to September 2023, every patient receiving cTACE for HCC was recognized. Inclusion criteria were patients with ≤6 HCCs and sizes 1-6 cm, with at least one tumor obtaining a complete response after cTACE, and available baseline and follow-up CT studies. Tumoral, cTACE procedural, and lipiodol staining parameters were analyzed. Using univariate and multivariate analysis, significant factors associated with tumor recurrence were identified. ROC curve analysis was used to identify the optimal cutoff point for the statistically significant factors, predicting tumor recurrence. Results The final population included 39 patients with 63 HCCs. Tumor recurrence was detected in 18/63 (28.6%) at a mean of 27.8 months. On univariate analysis, the incidence of tumor recurrence significantly increased with increased tumor size (p = 0.007), an inhomogeneous lipiodol staining pattern (p<0.001), a low minimum lipiodol radiodensity (p = 0.012), and a high lipiodol washout rate (p = 0.046). On multivariate analysis, an inhomogeneous lipiodol staining pattern (p<0.001) and a high lipiodol washout rate (p = 0.012) were significant predictors for tumor recurrence. On ROC analysis, a lipiodol washout rate of greater than 6.44 HU/month was related to tumor recurrence (sensitivity 83%, specificity 51%). Conclusions Inhomogeneous lipiodol staining pattern and lipiodol washout rate of >6.44 HU/month were predictors for recurrence of HCC after a complete response after cTACE. These correlations may provide useful guidance for subsequent imaging surveillance and treatment approaches.

                Background Education of ‘108' ambulance personnel involved in transporting neonates may improve outcomes. We assessed i) perceptions/practices of ‘108’ ambulance personnel for transporting neonates, ii) clinical parameters of transported neonates at arrival, and iii) outcomes such as survival/mortality and NICU stay (before and after skill-based educational intervention). Methods We conducted a single-arm intervention study (pre-and post) over 18 months. We assessed the perceptions and practices of 77 ambulance personnel on neonatal transport pre- versus post-intervention. Checklists assessed ambulance equipment availability/usage in both phases. We compared clinical parameters and outcomes of transported neonates between the pre-intervention (n=62) and post-intervention (n=53) phases. We analyzed data using SPSS version 25. Results Post-intervention, there was a significant reduction in the levels of hypothermia (p < 0.001), hypoglycemia (p=0.010), and prolonged capillary refill time (p=0.042), along with improvement in the use of intravenous fluids (p <0.001), a reduction in the positivity of umbilical swab growth (p=0.002) and in the duration of NICU stay (p = 0.001), significant improvement (p < 0.001) in the perceptions/practices of ambulance personnel towards neonatal transport. There was an improvement in the ambulance equipment availability/usage post-intervention. Conclusions The perceptions and practices of the ‘108’ ambulance towards transporting neonates had significantly improved post-educational intervention. Further, a significant decrease in hypothermia, hypoglycemia, and duration of NICU stay was seen in neonates transported post-intervention.

                Background and aim Hypertension (HTN) is a significant public health concern worldwide, affecting approximately a third of people during their lifetimes. There are many factors that influence people with HTN to develop cardiovascular disease, such as lifestyle, genetics, economics, overall health, and medications; the authors did not find any previous study employing Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) analysis using machine learning. There is a sense of urgency to understand the characteristics of HTN patients in Pakistan; by using MAUT to analyze and evaluate different factors related to developing HTN, we can gain valuable insights into the characteristics of HTN and cardiovascular HTN (HTN-CVD) patients in Pakistan. Methods and results This study utilized a cross-sectional survey with 98 participants diagnosed with HTN and HTN-CVD. The questionnaire included sociodemographic items, symptoms, heredity factors, and dietary habits. The study was approved by the Research Ethical Committees of Pir Mehr Ali Shah Arid Agriculture University Rawalpindi (PMAS-AAUR), Pakistan. The result shows that there is a wide difference between HTN and HTN-CVD patients’ scores for symptoms (37% vs. 63%) and economic status (39% vs. 61%) (respectively). Other than these, the attribute proportions of scores for HTN and HTN-CVD are almost the same. The highest MAUT scores were higher for patients with HTN-CVD (373) than for those with HTN alone (270), and the mean age of HTN patients is higher than HTN-CVD; almost all attributes’ groups of the 10 highest MAUT scores of HTN-CVD higher than HTN patients except for attribute of medication status. Conclusion Patients with HTN-CVD complications have higher MAUT scores for lifestyle, social status, health status, and economic status. This emphasizes the importance of educating patients (and indeed the general public) about risks, symptoms, and adopting healthy behaviors.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-136/v2?src=rss">Diagnosis and Molecular Characterization of Dermatophytosis: An Observational Study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Dermatophytes are the keratinophilic fungi which infect humans and is the most recurring type of disease. The high level of transmissibility creates an epidemiological risk and emphasises the significance of these illnesses. However, a growing number of reports describing dermatophytes can cause deep infections in diabetic and immunocompromised patients, by invading deep layers like the dermis and hypodermis. Despite the prevalence and significance of dermatophytes in clinical mycology, it is not always possible to accurately diagnose this specific infection due to its overlapping structures among species of dermatophytes. Since it is difficult to identify species that exhibit weak characteristics in the morphological highlights, identification of the dermatophyte is often relied on its morphological analysis, which is a laborious process and demands skill. The massive shift in genetic variation, the source of infection, and epidemiological research can be discovered using molecular approaches. Therefore, the development of an accurate laboratory test for dermatophyte species identification is essential for the prevention and efficient management of dermatophytoses. One such methodology allows use of PCR technology which has many methods for molecular level characterization which is rapid, efficient, and capable of producing DNA polymorphisms specific to various dermatophyte species based on distinctive band patterns seen by agarose gel electrophoresis. The RAPD-PCR approach will be used in this study protocol to molecularly characterize the dermatophytes for precise speciation of the sample. In addition to improving knowledge of fungal biology and pathology with a focus on adaptive mechanisms to combat difficult conditions from host counteractions, there is a need to improve awareness of the importance of these diseases through accurate epidemiological data. The advantages of molecular approaches for characterizing objects over traditional methods are their sensitivity and specificity.

                Abstract* This report details a rare case of corneal infection caused by Medicopsis romeroi, highlighting clinical presentation, diagnostic methods, treatment, and outcome. An early adolescence male, after recent corneal tear repair, presented acute eye pain, redness, and decreased vision for 1 day. He underwent corneal tear repair elsewhere post vegetative matter-related swimming injury. Ophthalmic examination revealed a 2.5*3.3mm ulcer around sutures. Corneal scrapings enabled microscopy and culture. With lesion worsening, tissue adhesive (TA) and bandage contact lens (BCL) were applied. Fungal culture identified Medicopsis romeroi. Patient's history, clinical course, and treatment were documented. Microscopy unveiled fungal hyphae, later confirmed as Medicopsis romeroi. Treatment included topical/systemic antifungals. Post-TA + BCL, significant improvement followed, with re-epithelialization, scarring. This report underscores the importance of considering rare fungal pathogens like Medicopsis romeroi in cases of corneal ulcers, especially in individuals with unusual risk factors. Timely diagnosis through microscopy and fungal culture, coupled with tailored antifungal treatment led to successful management and favorable patient outcomes. This case also emphasizes the significance of vigilant clinical observation, precise laboratory analysis, and multidisciplinary collaboration between ophthalmologists and microbiologists in managing atypical ocular infections.

                Background COVID-19 has heavily impacted the financial and economic well-being of the world’s population. Various national relief programs and initiatives have been carried out to address society’s financial difficulties, especially the issue of poverty among the vulnerable, like refugees and immigrants. Consequently, being one of the main elements in Islamic social finance, waqf has been emphasised and proven throughout Islamic history as one of the practical tools for poverty reduction. However, recent waqf initiatives towards poverty reduction focused more on aiding the micro and small entrepreneurs, whilst limited waqf initiatives were available to help low-income households, refugees, and immigrants during this critical time in Malaysia. Methods This study introduces a novel waqf model, specifically designed to contribute to poverty reduction in society. It is tailored for low-income households, refugees, and immigrants, aiming to sustain their financial independence. By combining the elements of waqf and crowdfunding, this model proposes an innovative agriculture-based microfinance programme. It utilizes undeveloped waqf lands and equity-based crowdfunding to reach its objective of poverty reduction. This study has adopted a secondary research approach using the existing scholarly literature. Results This paper also discusses the potential of the proposed model to deliver more than its primary objective, as the framework illustrates that waqf institutions will have a continuous inflow of funds that will allow them to initiate other waqf-based projects, job creation through the microfinance programmes, and financial return for the investor of equity-based crowdfunding projects. Conclusion This study not only underscores the sustainability of the proposed model, but also its alignment with the increasing awareness of value-based and social impact objectives. It further explores the potential of waqf to be integrated with other financing instruments during the pandemic to help the vulnerable, specifically refugees and immigrants. This research thus contributes to the true purpose of Islamic social finance, highlighting the significance of its findings.

                Background The improper management of hazardous solid waste in dental care offices poses significant risks to public health and the environment. Dental offices generate hazardous waste, including biological and chemical contaminants, which can lead to infections, pollution, and harm if not managed properly. Effective waste management practices are crucial, yet compliance varies significantly across regions, especially in Latin America, due to limited resources, inadequate training, and insufficient infrastructure. This study compares hazardous waste management practices in dental offices in Talara, Peru, and Machala, Ecuador, to provide actionable recommendations for improvement. Policy and Implications In Peru, hazardous waste management involves critical steps such as conditioning, segregation, transport, storage, treatment, and disposal. Compliance minimizes exposure risks and environmental contamination. Ecuador emphasizes administrative and operational aspects, including policies, records, training, and procedures. Improving practices in both countries can model enhanced waste management across Latin America. Recommendations To address challenges in Talara and similar Latin American cities, it is essential to strengthen administrative systems, increase budget allocations for waste management, and develop comprehensive training programs. Waste management should be prioritized within public policy agendas with clear guidelines and accountability measures. Both cities need improved resource allocation, modern waste treatment facilities, and centralized storage solutions. Continuous education and certification programs are crucial. Implementing integrated policies, regular reviews, and robust compliance mechanisms based on Machala’s practices can benefit other regions. Public awareness campaigns and regional collaboration through workshops and research initiatives are also recommended. Conclusions Significant disparities in hazardous waste management exist between Talara and Machala. Talara requires strengthened systems and improved infrastructure, while Machala’s practices serve as a model. Tailored interventions can enhance public health and environmental outcomes across Latin America. Regular monitoring, evaluation, and collaboration are essential for sustained improvements.

                Lymphomas of the oral and oropharyngeal regions are rather uncommon, and diagnosis can be challenging and confusing due to the multiple histological subgroups. Lymphomas are the third most common type of tumor in the head and neck region and are brought on by the lymphoreticular system. The two forms of lymphoma are Hodgkin’s lymphoma and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). Herein, we present a case report of oropharyngeal lymphoma. The female patient reported with a complaint of swelling over the palatal region for two to three months. An ulceroproliferative lesion was evident over the posterior palatal region. We diagnosed reactive lymphadenitis based on an incisional biopsy. To confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions, a punch biopsy followed by immunohistochemical studies were done. Features suggestive of activated B-cell-diffuse large B-cell lymphoma were confirmed. Among malignant lymphomas, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most prevalent variety. Much progress has been made in recent years in understanding the molecular pathophysiology of this disease. In this case report, we aim to correlate the clinical presentation, histology features and immunohistochemical significance in order to promote early discovery, diagnosis, and treatment for a better prognosis of the patient.

                <p>by Yingjun Ma, Yuanyuan Ma</p>

Identifying the association and corresponding types of miRNAs and diseases is crucial for studying the molecular mechanisms of disease-related miRNAs. Compared to traditional biological experiments, computational models can not only save time and reduce costs, but also discover potential associations on a large scale. Although some computational models based on tensor decomposition have been proposed, these models usually require manual specification of numerous hyperparameters, leading to a decrease in computational efficiency and generalization ability. Additionally, these linear models struggle to analyze complex, higher-order nonlinear relationships. Based on this, we propose a novel framework, KBLTDARD, to identify potential multiple types of miRNA–disease associations. Firstly, KBLTDARD extracts information from biological networks and high-order association network, and then fuses them to obtain more precise similarities of miRNAs (diseases). Secondly, we combine logistic tensor decomposition and Bayesian methods to achieve automatic hyperparameter search by introducing sparse-induced priors of multiple latent variables, and incorporate auxiliary information to improve prediction capabilities. Finally, an efficient deterministic Bayesian inference algorithm is developed to ensure computational efficiency. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that KBLTDARD has better Top-1 precision, Top-1 recall, and Top-1 F1 for new type predictions, and higher AUPR, AUC, and F1 values for new triplet predictions, compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, case studies demonstrate the efficiency of KBLTDARD in predicting multiple types of miRNA-disease associations.

T-even bacteriophages are known to employ lysis inhibition (LIN), where the lysis of an infected host is delayed in response to secondary adsorptions. Upon the eventual burst of the host, significantly more phage progenies are released. Here, we analysed the competitive advantage of LIN using a mathematical model. In batch culture, LIN provides a bigger phage yield at the end of the growth where all the hosts are infected due to an exceeding number of phage particles and, in addition, gives a competitive advantage against LIN mutants with rapid lysis by letting them adsorb to already infected hosts in the LIN state. By simulating plaque formation in a spatially structured environment, we show that, while LIN phages will produce a smaller zone of clearance, the area over which the phages spread is actually comparable to those without LIN. The analysis suggests that LIN induced by secondary adsorption is favourable in terms of competition, both in spatially homogeneous and inhomogeneous environments.

                <p>by Haocheng Zhu, Ulrik Beierholm, Ladan Shams</p>

Psychological and neuroscientific research over the past two decades has shown that the Bayesian causal inference (BCI) is a potential unifying theory that can account for a wide range of perceptual and sensorimotor processes in humans. Therefore, we introduce the BCI Toolbox, a statistical and analytical tool in Python, enabling researchers to conveniently perform quantitative modeling and analysis of behavioral data. Additionally, we describe the algorithm of the BCI model and test its stability and reliability via parameter recovery. The present BCI toolbox offers a robust platform for BCI model implementation as well as a hands-on tool for learning and understanding the model, facilitating its widespread use and enabling researchers to delve into the data to uncover underlying cognitive mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011696">Phenotypic memory in quorum sensing</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ghazaleh Ostovar, James Q. Boedicker</p>

Quorum sensing (QS) is a regulatory mechanism used by bacteria to coordinate group behavior in response to high cell densities. During QS, cells monitor the concentration of external signals, known as autoinducers, as a proxy for cell density. QS often involves positive feedback loops, leading to the upregulation of genes associated with QS signal production and detection. This results in distinct steady-state concentrations of QS-related molecules in QS-ON and QS-OFF states. Due to the slow decay rates of biomolecules such as proteins, even after removal of the initial stimuli, cells can retain elevated levels of QS-associated biomolecules for extended periods of time. This persistence of biomolecules after the removal of the initial stimuli has the potential to impact the response to future stimuli, indicating a memory of past exposure. This phenomenon, which is a consequence of the carry-over of biomolecules rather than genetic inheritance, is known as "phenotypic" memory. This theoretical study aims to investigate the presence of phenotypic memory in QS and the conditions that influence this memory. Numerical simulations based on ordinary differential equations and analytical modeling were used to study gene expression in response to sudden changes in cell density and extracellular signal concentrations. The model examined the effect of various cellular parameters on the strength of QS memory and the impact on gene regulatory dynamics. The findings revealed that QS memory has a transient effect on the expression of QS-responsive genes. These consequences of QS memory depend strongly on how cell density was perturbed, as well as various cellular parameters, including the Fold Change in the expression of QS-regulated genes, the autoinducer synthesis rate, the autoinducer threshold required for activation, and the cell growth rate.

                <p>by Gustavo Magaña-López, Laurence Calzone, Andrei Zinovyev, Loïc Paulevé</p>

Boolean networks are largely employed to model the qualitative dynamics of cell fate processes by describing the change of binary activation states of genes and transcription factors with time. Being able to bridge such qualitative states with quantitative measurements of gene expressions in cells, as scRNA-seq, is a cornerstone for data-driven model construction and validation. On one hand, scRNA-seq binarisation is a key step for inferring and validating Boolean models. On the other hand, the generation of synthetic scRNA-seq data from baseline Boolean models provides an important asset to benchmark inference methods. However, linking characteristics of scRNA-seq datasets, including dropout events, with Boolean states is a challenging task.
We present scBoolSeq, a method for the bidirectional linking of scRNA-seq data and Boolean activation state of genes. Given a reference scRNA-seq dataset, scBoolSeq computes statistical criteria to classify the empirical gene pseudocount distributions as either unimodal, bimodal, or zero-inflated, and fit a probabilistic model of dropouts, with gene-dependent parameters. From these learnt distributions, scBoolSeq can perform both binarisation of scRNA-seq datasets, and generate synthetic scRNA-seq datasets from Boolean traces, as issued from Boolean networks, using biased sampling and dropout simulation. We present a case study demonstrating the application of scBoolSeq’s binarisation scheme in data-driven model inference. Furthermore, we compare synthetic scRNA-seq data generated by scBoolSeq with BoolODE’s, data for the same Boolean Network model. The comparison shows that our method better reproduces the statistics of real scRNA-seq datasets, such as the mean-variance and mean-dropout relationships while exhibiting clearly defined trajectories in two-dimensional projections of the data.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011421">Elucidating the complex membrane binding of a protein with multiple anchoring domains using extHMMM</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jesper J. Madsen, Y. Zenmei Ohkubo</p>

Membrane binding is a crucial mechanism for many proteins, but understanding the specific interactions between proteins and membranes remains a challenging endeavor. Coagulation factor Va (FVa) is a large protein whose membrane interactions are complicated due to the presence of multiple anchoring domains that individually can bind to lipid membranes. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the membrane binding of FVa and identify the key mechanisms that govern its interaction with membranes. Our results reveal that FVa can either adopt an upright or a tilted molecular orientation upon membrane binding. We further find that the domain organization of FVa deviates (sometimes significantly) from its crystallographic reference structure, and that the molecular orientation of the protein matches with domain reorganization to align the C2 domain toward its favored membrane-normal orientation. We identify specific amino acid residues that exhibit contact preference with phosphatidylserine lipids over phosphatidylcholine lipids, and we observe that mostly electrostatic effects contribute to this preference. The observed lipid-binding process and characteristics, specific to FVa or common among other membrane proteins, in concert with domain reorganization and molecular tilt, elucidate the complex membrane binding dynamics of FVa and provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms of protein-membrane interactions. An updated version of the HMMM model, termed extHMMM, is successfully employed for efficiently observing membrane bindings of systems containing the whole FVa molecule.

                <p>by Mason A. McCool, Carson J. Bryant, Laura Abriola, Yulia V. Surovtseva, Susan J. Baserga</p>

Cancer initiates as a consequence of genomic mutations and its subsequent progression relies in part on increased production of ribosomes to maintain high levels of protein synthesis for unchecked cell growth. Recently, cytidine deaminases have been uncovered as sources of mutagenesis in cancer. In an attempt to form a connection between these 2 cancer driving processes, we interrogated the cytidine deaminase family of proteins for potential roles in human ribosome biogenesis. We identified and validated APOBEC3A and APOBEC4 as novel ribosome biogenesis factors through our laboratory’s established screening platform for the discovery of regulators of nucleolar function in MCF10A cells. Through siRNA depletion experiments, we highlight APOBEC3A’s requirement in making ribosomes and specific role within the processing and maturation steps that form the large subunit 5.8S and 28S ribosomal (r)RNAs. We demonstrate that a subset of APOBEC3A resides within the nucleolus and associates with critical ribosome biogenesis factors. Mechanistic insight was revealed by transient overexpression of both wild-type and a catalytically dead mutated APOBEC3A, which both increase cell growth and protein synthesis. Through an innovative nuclear RNA sequencing methodology, we identify only modest predicted APOBEC3A C-to-U target sites on the pre-rRNA and pre-mRNAs. Our work reveals a potential direct role for APOBEC3A in ribosome biogenesis likely independent of its editing function. More broadly, we found an additional function of APOBEC3A in cancer pathology through its function in ribosome biogenesis, expanding its relevance as a target for cancer therapeutics.

                <p>by Omer Sharon, Eti Ben Simon, Vyoma D. Shah, Tenzin Desel, Matthew P. Walker</p>

In the past 20 years, more remarkable revelations about sleep and its varied functions have arguably been made than in the previous 200. Building on this swell of recent findings, this essay provides a broad sampling of selected research highlights across genetic, molecular, cellular, and physiological systems within the body, networks within the brain, and large-scale social dynamics. Based on this raft of exciting new discoveries, we have come to realize that sleep, in this moment of its evolution, is very much polyfunctional (rather than monofunctional), yet polyfunctional for reasons we had never previously considered. Moreover, these new polyfunctional insights powerfully reaffirm sleep as a critical biological, and thus health-sustaining, requisite. Indeed, perhaps the only thing more impressive than the unanticipated nature of these newly emerging sleep functions is their striking divergence, from operations of molecular mechanisms inside cells to entire group societal dynamics.

                Fibroblasts are mesenchymal cells that are responsible for creating and maintaining tissue architecture through the production of extracellular matrix. These cells also play critical roles in processes such as wound repair and immune modulation in normal tissues and various disease states including fibrosis, autoimmunity, and cancer. Fibroblasts have a complex repertoire of functions that vary by organ, inflammatory state, and the developmental stage of an organism. How fibroblasts manage so many functions in such a context-dependent manner represents a gap in our understanding of these cells. One possibility is that a tissue-resident precursor cell state exists that provides the fibroblast lineage with flexibility during growth, inflammation, or other contexts that require dynamic tissue changes. Recent work has suggested that a precursor fibroblast cell state is marked by expression of Peptidase inhibitor 16 (Pi16). This review aims to concatenate and compare studies on fibroblasts that express Pi16 to clarify the roles of this cell state in fibroblast lineage development and other functions.
