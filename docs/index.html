<p>The architecture of a neural network constrains the potential dynamics that
can emerge. Some architectures may only allow for a single dynamic regime,
while others display a great deal of flexibility with qualitatively different
dynamics that can be reached by modulating connection strengths. In this work,
we develop novel mathematical techniques to study the dynamic constraints
imposed by different network architectures in the context of competitive
threshold-linear networks (TLNs). Any given TLN is naturally characterized by a
hyperplane arrangement in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and the combinatorial properties of
this arrangement determine the pattern of fixed points of the dynamics. This
observation enables us to recast the question of network flexibility in the
language of oriented matroids, allowing us to employ tools and results from
this theory in order to characterize the different dynamic regimes a given
architecture can support. In particular, fixed points of a TLN correspond to
cocircuits of an associated oriented matroid; and mutations of the matroid
correspond to bifurcations in the collection of fixed points. As an
application, we provide a complete characterization of all possible sets of
fixed points that can arise in networks through size $n=3$, together with
descriptions of how to modulate synaptic strengths of the network in order to
access the different dynamic regimes. These results provide a framework for
studying the possible computational roles of various motifs observed in real
neural networks.

<p>It is frequently assumed that the fundamental purpose of vision is to extract
information from light and process it in the brain in order to gain knowledge
about environmental objects. Treating vision as an information-driven process
has been fruitful for many areas of vision science. But this approach has
inherent limitations and may not be sufficient to explain at the most
fundamental level why and how we see. Energy is a prime mover in the evolution
and operation of all biological systems, including vision, and early
researchers in physiological optics and experimental psychology regarded vision
as an energy-driven process. Yet to date there has been little attempt to
analyze the fundamentals of vision in energetic terms. This paper is a
provisional attempt to sketch an account of the early stages of vision as an
energy-driven process. On this account, vision is a form of biological work in
which energy from the environment is absorbed and processed by neurobiological
systems in order to guide behaviour. Evidence from the evolution and
neurobiology of vision is presented in support of this approach. I conclude
that treating vision as an energy-driven process can contribute to our
understanding of its fundamental nature and operation.

<p>Recent research shows that sublevel sets of the loss surfaces of
overparameterized networks are connected, exactly or approximately. We describe
and compare experimentally a panel of methods used to connect two low-loss
points by a low-loss curve on this surface. Our methods vary in accuracy and
complexity. Most of our methods are based on "macroscopic" distributional
assumptions, and some are insensitive to the detailed properties of the points
to be connected. Some methods require a prior training of a "global connection
model" which can then be applied to any pair of points. The accuracy of the
method generally correlates with its complexity and sensitivity to the endpoint
detail.

<p>Recommender systems trained in a continuous learning fashion are plagued by
the feedback loop problem, also known as algorithmic bias. This causes a newly
trained model to act greedily and favor items that have already been engaged by
users. This behavior is particularly harmful in personalised ads
recommendations, as it can also cause new campaigns to remain unexplored.
Exploration aims to address this limitation by providing new information about
the environment, which encompasses user preference, and can lead to higher
long-term reward. In this work, we formulate a display advertising recommender
as a contextual bandit and implement exploration techniques that require
sampling from the posterior distribution of click-through-rates in a
computationally tractable manner. Traditional large-scale deep learning models
do not provide uncertainty estimates by default. We approximate these
uncertainty measurements of the predictions by employing a bootstrapped model
with multiple heads and dropout units. We benchmark a number of different
models in an offline simulation environment using a publicly available dataset
of user-ads engagements. We test our proposed deep Bayesian bandits algorithm
in the offline simulation and online AB setting with large-scale production
traffic, where we demonstrate a positive gain of our exploration model.

<p>The brain constructs population codes to represent stimuli through widely
distributed patterns of activity across neurons. An important figure of merit
of population codes is how much information about the original stimulus can be
decoded from them. Fisher information is widely used to quantify coding
precision and specify optimal codes, because of its relationship to mean
squared error (MSE) under certain assumptions. When neural firing is sparse,
however, optimizing Fisher information can result in codes that are highly
sub-optimal in terms of MSE. We find that this discrepancy arises from the
non-local component of error not accounted for by the Fisher information. Using
this insight, we construct optimal population codes by directly minimizing the
MSE. We study the scaling properties of MSE with coding parameters, focusing on
the tuning curve width. We find that the optimal tuning curve width for coding
no longer scales as the inverse population size, and the quadratic scaling of
precision with system size predicted by Fisher information alone no longer
holds. However, superlinearity is still preserved with only a logarithmic
slowdown. We derive analogous results for networks storing the memory of a
stimulus through continuous attractor dynamics, and show that similar scaling
properties optimize memory and representation.

<p>Statistical mechanics determines the abundance of different arrangements of
matter depending on cost-benefit balances. Its formalism and phenomenology
percolate throughout biological processes and set limits to effective
computation. Under specific conditions, self-replicating and computationally
complex patterns become favored, yielding life, cognition, and Darwinian
evolution. Neurons and neural circuits sit at a crossroads between statistical
mechanics, computation, and (through their role in cognition) natural
selection. Can we establish a {\em statistical physics} of neural circuits?
Such theory would tell what kinds of brains to expect under set energetic,
evolutionary, and computational conditions. With this big picture in mind, we
focus on the fate of duplicated neural circuits. We look at examples from
central nervous systems, with a stress on computational thresholds that might
prompt this redundancy. We also study a naive cost-benefit balance for
duplicated circuits implementing complex phenotypes. From this we derive {\em
phase diagrams} and (phase-like) transitions between single and duplicated
circuits, which constrain evolutionary paths to complex cognition. Back to the
big picture, similar phase diagrams and transitions might constrain I/O and
internal connectivity patterns of neural circuits at large. The formalism of
statistical mechanics seems a natural framework for thsi worthy line of
research.

<p>For supervised classification problems involving design, control, other
practical purposes, users are not only interested in finding a highly accurate
classifier, but they also demand that the obtained classifier be easily
interpretable. While the definition of interpretability of a classifier can
vary from case to case, here, by a humanly interpretable classifier we restrict
it to be expressed in simplistic mathematical terms. As a novel approach, we
represent a classifier as an assembly of simple mathematical rules using a
non-linear decision tree (NLDT). Each conditional (non-terminal) node of the
tree represents a non-linear mathematical rule (split-rule) involving features
in order to partition the dataset in the given conditional node into two
non-overlapping subsets. This partitioning is intended to minimize the impurity
of the resulting child nodes. By restricting the structure of split-rule at
each conditional node and depth of the decision tree, the interpretability of
the classifier is assured. The non-linear split-rule at a given conditional
node is obtained using an evolutionary bilevel optimization algorithm, in which
while the upper-level focuses on arriving at an interpretable structure of the
split-rule, the lower-level achieves the most appropriate weights
(coefficients) of individual constituents of the rule to minimize the net
impurity of two resulting child nodes. The performance of the proposed
algorithm is demonstrated on a number of controlled test problems, existing
benchmark problems, and industrial problems. Results on two to 500-feature
problems are encouraging and open up further scopes of applying the proposed
approach to more challenging and complex classification tasks.

<p>Balancing common disease treatment and epidemic control is a key objective of
medical supplies procurement in hospitals during a pandemic such as COVID-19.
This problem can be formulated as a bi-objective optimization problem for
simultaneously optimizing the effects of common disease treatment and epidemic
control. However, due to the large number of supplies, difficulties in
evaluating the effects, and the strict budget constraint, it is difficult for
existing evolutionary multiobjective algorithms to efficiently approximate the
Pareto front of the problem. In this paper, we present an approach that first
transforms the original high-dimensional, constrained multiobjective
optimization problem to a low-dimensional, unconstrained multiobjective
optimization problem, and then evaluates each solution to the transformed
problem by solving a set of simple single-objective optimization subproblems,
such that the problem can be efficiently solved by existing evolutionary
multiobjective algorithms. We applied the transform-and-divide evolutionary
optimization approach to six hospitals in Zhejiang Province, China, during the
peak of COVID-19. Results showed that the proposed approach exhibits
significantly better performance than that of directly solving the original
problem. Our study has also shown that transform-and-divide evolutionary
optimization based on problem-specific knowledge can be an efficient solution
approach to many other complex problems and, therefore, enlarge the application
field of evolutionary algorithms.

<p>The performance of many machine learning models depends on their
hyper-parameter settings. Bayesian Optimization has become a successful tool
for hyper-parameter optimization of machine learning algorithms, which aims to
identify optimal hyper-parameters during an iterative sequential process.
However, most of the Bayesian Optimization algorithms are designed to select
models for effectiveness only and ignore the important issue of model training
efficiency. Given that both model effectiveness and training time are important
for real-world applications, models selected for effectiveness may not meet the
strict training time requirements necessary to deploy in a production
environment. In this work, we present a unified Bayesian Optimization framework
for jointly optimizing models for both prediction effectiveness and training
efficiency. We propose an objective that captures the tradeoff between these
two metrics and demonstrate how we can jointly optimize them in a principled
Bayesian Optimization framework. Experiments on model selection for
recommendation tasks indicate models selected this way significantly improves
model training efficiency while maintaining strong effectiveness as compared to
state-of-the-art Bayesian Optimization algorithms.

<p>In this paper we present a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for autonomous
navigation, inspired by the chemotaxis network of the worm Caenorhabditis
elegans. In particular, we focus on the problem of contour tracking, wherein
the bot must reach and subsequently follow a desired concentration setpoint.
Past schemes that used only klinokinesis can follow the contour efficiently but
take excessive time to reach the setpoint. We address this shortcoming by
proposing a novel adaptive klinotaxis mechanism that builds upon a previously
proposed gradient climbing circuit. We demonstrate how our klinotaxis circuit
can autonomously be configured to perform gradient ascent, gradient descent and
subsequently be disabled to seamlessly integrate with the aforementioned
klinokinesis circuit. We also incorporate speed regulation (orthokinesis) to
further improve contour tracking performance. Thus for the first time, we
present a model that successfully integrates klinokinesis, klinotaxis and
orthokinesis. We demonstrate via contour tracking simulations that our proposed
scheme achieves an 2.4x reduction in the time to reach the setpoint, along with
a simultaneous 8.7x reduction in average deviation from the setpoint.

<p>Prior studies have unveiled the vulnerability of the deep neural networks in
the context of adversarial machine learning, leading to great recent attention
into this area. One interesting question that has yet to be fully explored is
the bias-variance relationship of adversarial machine learning, which can
potentially provide deeper insights into this behaviour. The notion of bias and
variance is one of the main approaches to analyze and evaluate the
generalization and reliability of a machine learning model. Although it has
been extensively used in other machine learning models, it is not well explored
in the field of deep learning and it is even less explored in the area of
adversarial machine learning.
</p>
<p>In this study, we investigate the effect of adversarial machine learning on
the bias and variance of a trained deep neural network and analyze how
adversarial perturbations can affect the generalization of a network. We derive
the bias-variance trade-off for both classification and regression applications
based on two main loss functions: (i) mean squared error (MSE), and (ii)
cross-entropy. Furthermore, we perform quantitative analysis with both
simulated and real data to empirically evaluate consistency with the derived
bias-variance tradeoffs. Our analysis sheds light on why the deep neural
networks have poor performance under adversarial perturbation from a
bias-variance point of view and how this type of perturbation would change the
performance of a network. Moreover, given these new theoretical findings, we
introduce a new adversarial machine learning algorithm with lower computational
complexity than well-known adversarial machine learning strategies (e.g., PGD)
while providing a high success rate in fooling deep neural networks in lower
perturbation magnitudes.

<p>A well-crafted police patrol route design is vital in providing community
safety and security in the society. Previous works have largely focused on
predicting crime events with historical crime data. The usage of large-scale
mobility data collected from Location-Based Social Network, or check-ins, and
Point of Interests (POI) data for designing an effective police patrol is
largely understudied. Given that there are multiple police officers being on
duty in a real-life situation, this makes the problem more complex to solve. In
this paper, we formulate the dynamic crime patrol planning problem for multiple
police officers using check-ins, crime, incident response data, and POI
information. We propose a joint learning and non-random optimisation method for
the representation of possible solutions where multiple police officers patrol
the high crime risk areas simultaneously first rather than the low crime risk
areas. Later, meta-heuristic Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Cuckoo Search (CS) are
implemented to find the optimal routes. The performance of the proposed
solution is verified and compared with several state-of-art methods using
real-world datasets.

<p>Performing analytical tasks over graph data has become increasingly
interesting due to the ubiquity and large availability of relational
information. However, unlike images or sentences, there is no notion of
sequence in networks. Nodes (and edges) follow no absolute order, and it is
hard for traditional machine learning (ML) algorithms to recognize a pattern
and generalize their predictions on this type of data. Graph Neural Networks
(GNN) successfully tackled this problem. They became popular after the
generalization of the convolution concept to the graph domain. However, they
possess a large number of hyperparameters and their design and optimization is
currently hand-made, based on heuristics or empirical intuition. Neural
Architecture Search (NAS) methods appear as an interesting solution to this
problem. In this direction, this paper compares two NAS methods for optimizing
GNN: one based on reinforcement learning and a second based on evolutionary
algorithms. Results consider 7 datasets over two search spaces and show that
both methods obtain similar accuracies to a random search, raising the question
of how many of the search space dimensions are actually relevant to the
problem.

segments of the brain. The networks representing the biological connectome are
altered both spatially and temporally. The degradation techniques applied here
are "weight degradation", "weight scrambling", and variable activation
function. These methods aim to shine light on the study of neurodegenerative

<p>This study suggests a new data-driven model for the prediction of geomagnetic
storm. The model which is an instance of Brain Emotional Learning Inspired
Models (BELIMs), is known as the Brain Emotional Learning-based Prediction
Model (BELPM). BELPM consists of four main subsystems; the connection between
these subsystems has been mimicked by the corresponding regions of the
emotional system. The functions of these subsystems are explained using
adaptive networks. The learning algorithm of BELPM is defined using the
steepest descent (SD) and the least square estimator (LSE). BELPM is employed
to predict geomagnetic storms using two geomagnetic indices, Auroral Electrojet
(AE) Index and Disturbance Time (Dst) Index. To evaluate the performance of
BELPM, the obtained results have been compared with ANFIS, WKNN and other
instances of BELIMs. The results verify that BELPM has the capability to
achieve a reasonable accuracy for both the short-term and the long-term
geomagnetic storms prediction.

<p>This paper investigates different trade-offs between the number of model
parameters and enhanced speech qualities by employing several deep
tensor-to-vector regression models for speech enhancement. We find that a
hybrid architecture, namely CNN-TT, is capable of maintaining a good quality
performance with a reduced model parameter size. CNN-TT is composed of several
convolutional layers at the bottom for feature extraction to improve speech
quality and a tensor-train (TT) output layer on the top to reduce model
parameters. We first derive a new upper bound on the generalization power of
the convolutional neural network (CNN) based vector-to-vector regression
models. Then, we provide experimental evidence on the Edinburgh noisy speech
corpus to demonstrate that, in single-channel speech enhancement, CNN
outperforms DNN at the expense of a small increment of model sizes. Besides,
CNN-TT slightly outperforms the CNN counterpart by utilizing only 32\% of the
CNN model parameters. Besides, further performance improvement can be attained
if the number of CNN-TT parameters is increased to 44\% of the CNN model size.
Finally, our experiments of multi-channel speech enhancement on a simulated
noisy WSJ0 corpus demonstrate that our proposed hybrid CNN-TT architecture
achieves better results than both DNN and CNN models in terms of
better-enhanced speech qualities and smaller parameter sizes.

<p>Animals exploit time to survive in the world. Temporal information is
required for higher-level cognitive abilities such as planning, decision
making, communication and effective cooperation. Since time is an inseparable
part of cognition, there is a growing interest in the artificial intelligence
approach to subjective time, which has a possibility of advancing the field.
The current survey study aims to provide researchers with an interdisciplinary
perspective on time perception. Firstly, we introduce a brief background from
the psychology and neuroscience literature, covering the characteristics and
models of time perception and the related abilities. Secondly, we summarize the
emergent computational and robotic models of time perception. A general
overview to the literature reveals that a substantial amount of timing models
are based on a dedicated time processing like the emergence of a clock-like
mechanism from the neural network dynamics and reveal a relationship between
the embodiment and time perception. We also notice that most models of timing
are developed for either sensory timing (i.e. the ability of assessment of an
interval) or motor timing (i.e. ability to reproduce an interval). The number
of timing models capable of retrospective timing, which is the ability to track
time without paying attention, is insufficient. In this light, we discuss the
possible research directions to promote interdisciplinary collaboration for
time perception.

<p>Several models have been developed to predict how the COVID-19 pandemic
spreads, and how it could be contained with non-pharmaceutical interventions
(NPIs) such as social distancing restrictions and school and business closures.
This paper demonstrates how evolutionary AI could be used to facilitate the
next step, i.e. determining most effective intervention strategies
automatically. Through evolutionary surrogate-assisted prescription (ESP), it
is possible to generate a large number of candidate strategies and evaluate
them with predictive models. In principle, strategies can be customized for
different countries and locales, and balance the need to contain the pandemic
and the need to minimize their economic impact. While still limited by
available data, early experiments suggest that workplace and school
restrictions are the most important and need to be designed carefully. It also
demonstrates that results of lifting restrictions can be unreliable, and
suggests creative ways in which restrictions can be implemented softly, e.g. by
alternating them over time. As more data becomes available, the approach can be
increasingly useful in dealing with COVID-19 as well as possible future
pandemics.

<p>Many recent state-of-the-art methods for neural architecture search (NAS)
relax the NAS problem into a joint continuous optimization over architecture
parameters and their shared-weights, enabling the application of standard
gradient-based optimizers. However, this training process remains poorly
understood, as evidenced by the multitude of gradient-based heuristics that
have been recently proposed. Invoking the theory of mirror descent, we present
a unifying framework for designing and analyzing gradient-based NAS methods
that exploit the underlying problem structure to quickly find high-performance
architectures. Our geometry-aware framework leads to simple yet novel
algorithms that (1) enjoy faster convergence guarantees than existing
gradient-based methods and (2) achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the latest
NAS benchmarks in computer vision. Notably, we exceed the best published
results for both CIFAR and ImageNet on both the DARTS search space and
NAS-Bench-201; on the latter benchmark we achieve close to oracle-optimal
performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Together, our theory and experiments
demonstrate a principled way to co-design optimizers and continuous
parameterizations of discrete NAS search spaces.

centers. Efficient results are reported on addressing the generation of
handwritten digits (MNIST dataset samples). Moreover, the proposed
implementation is able to reduce the training times and scale properly when
considering different grid sizes for training.

<p>In this paper, we present an approach to determine the smallest possible
number of neurons in a layer of a neural network in such a way that the
topology of the input space can be learned sufficiently well. We introduce a
general procedure based on persistent homology to investigate topological
invariants of the manifold on which we suspect the data set. We specify the
required dimensions precisely, assuming that there is a smooth manifold on or
near which the data are located. Furthermore, we require that this space is
connected and has a commutative group structure in the mathematical sense.
These assumptions allow us to derive a decomposition of the underlying space
whose topology is well known. We use the representatives of the $k$-dimensional
homology groups from the persistence landscape to determine an integer
dimension for this decomposition. This number is the dimension of the embedding
that is capable of capturing the topology of the data manifold. We derive the
theory and validate it experimentally on toy data sets.

<p>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are popular tools for generative
modeling. The dynamics of their adversarial learning give rise to convergence
pathologies during training such as mode and discriminator collapse. In machine
learning, ensembles of predictors demonstrate better results than a single
predictor for many tasks. In this study, we apply two evolutionary algorithms
(EAs) to create ensembles to re-purpose generative models, i.e., given a set of
heterogeneous generators that were optimized for one objective (e.g., minimize
Frechet Inception Distance), create ensembles of them for optimizing a
different objective (e.g., maximize the diversity of the generated samples).
The first method is restricted by the exact size of the ensemble and the second
method only restricts the upper bound of the ensemble size. Experimental
analysis on the MNIST image benchmark demonstrates that both EA ensembles
creation methods can re-purpose the models, without reducing their original
functionality. The EA-based demonstrate significantly better performance
compared to other heuristic-based methods. When comparing both evolutionary,
the one with only an upper size bound on the ensemble size is the best.

<p>Energy-efficient mapless navigation is crucial for mobile robots as they
explore unknown environments with limited on-board resources. Although the
recent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches have been successfully
applied to navigation, their high energy consumption limits their use in
several robotic applications. Here, we propose a neuromorphic approach that
combines the energy-efficiency of spiking neural networks with the optimality
of DRL and benchmark it in learning control policies for mapless navigation.
Our hybrid framework, spiking deep deterministic policy gradient (SDDPG),
consists of a spiking actor network (SAN) and a deep critic network, where the
two networks were trained jointly using gradient descent. The co-learning
enabled synergistic information exchange between the two networks, allowing
them to overcome each other's limitations through a shared representation
learning. To evaluate our approach, we deployed the trained SAN on Intel's
Loihi neuromorphic processor. When validated on simulated and real-world
complex environments, our method on Loihi consumed 75 times less energy per
inference as compared to DDPG on Jetson TX2, and also exhibited a higher rate
of successful navigation to the goal, which ranged from 1% to 4.2% and depended
on the forward-propagation timestep size. These results reinforce our ongoing
efforts to design brain-inspired algorithms for controlling autonomous robots
with neuromorphic hardware.

<p>We propose a novel biologically-plausible solution to the credit assignment
problem, being motivated by observations in the ventral visual pathway and
trained deep neural networks. In both, representations of objects in the same
category become progressively more similar, while objects belonging to
different categories becomes less similar. We use this observation to motivate
a layer-specific learning goal in a deep network: each layer aims to learn a
representational similarity matrix that interpolates between previous and later
layers. We formulate this idea using a supervised deep similarity matching cost
function and derive from it deep neural networks with feedforward, lateral and
feedback connections, and neurons that exhibit biologically-plausible Hebbian
and anti-Hebbian plasticity. Supervised deep similarity matching can be
interpreted as an energy-based learning algorithm, but with significant
differences from others in how a contrastive function is constructed.

<p>Moderate cortical cooling is known to suppress slow oscillations and to evoke persistent cortical activity. However, the cooling-induced changes in electrical activity across cortical layers remain largely unknown. Here, we performed multi-channel local field potential (LFP) and multi-unit activity (MUA) recordings with linear silicone probes through the layers of single cortical barrel columns in urethane-anesthetized rats under normothermia (38°C) and during local cortical surface cooling (30°C). During cortically generated slow oscillations, moderate cortical cooling decreased delta wave amplitude, delta-wave occurrence, the duration of silent states, and delta wave-locked MUA synchronization. Moderate cortical cooling increased total time spent in the active state and decreased total time spent in the silent state. Cooling-evoked changes in the MUA firing rate in cortical layer 5 (L5) varied from increase to decrease across animals, and the polarity of changes in L5 MUA correlated with changes in total time spent in the active state. The decrease in temperature reduced MUA firing rates in all other cortical layers. Sensory-evoked MUA responses also decreased during cooling through all cortical layers. The cooling-dependent slowdown was detected at the fast time-scale with a decreased frequency of sensory-evoked high-frequency oscillations (HFO). Thus, moderate cortical cooling suppresses slow oscillations and desynchronizes neuronal activity through all cortical layers, and is associated with reduced firing across all cortical layers except L5, where cooling induces variable and non-consistent changes in neuronal firing, which are common features of the transition from slow-wave synchronization to desynchronized activity in the barrel cortex.</p>

<p>Aim: To examine the effects of fentanyl, a potent mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist, on-air puff-evoked responses in Purkinje cells (PCs), and molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) using in vivo patch-clamp recordings in anesthetized mice.</p><p>Methods: Male mice 6–8 weeks-old were anesthetized and fixed on a custom-made stereotaxic frame. The cerebellar surface was exposed and perfused with oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF). Patch-clamp recordings in the cell-attached mode were obtained from PCs and MLIs. Facial stimulation by air-puff of the ipsilateral whisker pad was performed through a pressurized injection system. Fentanyl citrate, CTOP, and H-89 dissolved in ACSF were perfused onto the cerebellar surface.</p><p>Results: Fentanyl significantly inhibited the amplitude and area under the curve (AUC) of sensory stimulation-evoked inhibitory responses in PCs. Although fentanyl did not influence the frequency of simple spikes (SSs), it decreased the pause of SS. The IC<sub>50</sub> of the fentanyl-induced suppression of the P1 response amplitude was 5.53 μM. The selective MOR antagonist CTOP abolished fentanyl-induced inhibitory responses in PCs. However, the application of CTOP alone increased the amplitude, AUC of P1, and the pause of SS. Notably, fentanyl significantly inhibited the tactile-evoked response of MLIs but did not affect their spontaneous firing. The fentanyl-induced decrease of inhibitory responses in PCs was partially prevented by a PKA inhibitor, H-89.</p><p>Conclusions: These results suggest that fentanyl binds to MORs in MLIs to reduce GABAergic neurotransmission in MLI-PC projections and one potential mechanism is via modulation of the cAMP-PKA pathway.</p>

<p>The dynamic trafficking of AMPA receptors (AMPARs), which enables the endocytosis, recycling, and exocytosis of AMPARs, is crucial for synaptic plasticity. Endophilin2, which directly interacts with the GluA1 subunit of AMPARs, plays an important role in AMPAR endocytosis. Collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) promotes the maturation of the dendritic spine and can transfer AMPARs to the membrane. Although the mechanisms of AMPAR endocytosis and exocytosis are well known, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying AMPAR recycling remain unclear. Here, we report a unique interaction between CRMP2 and endophilin2. Our results showed that overexpression of CRMP2 and endophilin2 increased the amplitude and frequency of miniature excitatory synaptic currents (mEPSCs) and modestly enhanced AMPAR levels in hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, the CRMP2 and endophilin2 overexpression phenotype failed to occur when the interaction between these two proteins was inhibited. Further analysis revealed that this interaction was regulated by CRMP2 phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of CRMP2 inhibited its interaction with endophilin2; this was mainly affected by the phosphorylation of Thr514 and Ser518 by glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3β. CRMP2 phosphorylation increased degradation and inhibited the surface expression of AMPAR GluA1 subunits in cultured hippocampal neurons. However, the dephosphorylation of CRMP2 inhibited degradation and promoted the surface expression of AMPAR GluA1 subunits in cultured hippocampal neurons. Taken together, our data demonstrated that the interaction between CRMP2 and endophilin2 was conductive to the recycling of AMPA receptor GluA1 subunits in hippocampal neurons.</p>

<p>Theta burst stimulation is increasingly growing in popularity as a non-invasive method of moderating corticospinal networks. Theta burst stimulation uses gamma frequency trains applied at the rhythm of theta, thus, mimicking theta–gamma coupling involved in cognitive processes. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has been found to play a crucial role in numerous cognitive processes. Here, we include 25 studies for review to determine the cognitive effects of continuous theta burst stimulation over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; 20 of these studies are healthy participant and five are patient (pharmacotherapy-resistant depression) studies. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the included studies, only a descriptive approach is used and meta-analytics ruled out. The cognitive effect is measured on various cognitive domains: attention, working memory, planning, language, decision making, executive function, and inhibitory and cognitive control. We conclude that continuous theta burst stimulation over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex mainly inhibits cognitive performance. However, in some instances, it can lead to improved performance by inhibiting the effect of distractors or other competing irrelevant cognitive processes. To be precise, continuous theta burst stimulation over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex impaired attention, inhibitory control, planning, and goal-directed behavior in decision making but also improved decision making by reducing impulsivity. Conversely, continuous theta burst stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex impaired executive function, working, auditory feedback regulation, and cognitive control but accelerated the planning, decision-making process. These findings constitute a useful contribution to the literature on the cognitive effects of continuous theta burst stimulation over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.</p>

Background<p>Apathy is one of the most common non-motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, its pathophysiology remains unclear.</p>Methods<p>We analyzed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data acquired at a 3.0T MRI scanner using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) metric in 20 de novo, drug-naïve, non-demented PD patients with apathy (PD-A), 26 PD patients without apathy (PD-NA) without comorbidity of depressive or anxious symptoms, and 23 matched healthy control (HC) subjects.</p>Results<p>We found that the ALFF decreased significantly in the bilateral nucleus accumbens, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in patients with PD-A compared to patients with PD-NA and HC subjects. Furthermore, apathy severity was negatively correlated with the ALFF in the bilateral nucleus accumbens and dorsal ACC in the pooled patients with PD.</p>Conclusion<p>The present study characterized the functional pattern of changes in spontaneous neural activity in patients with PD-A. With the aim to better elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for these changes, this study controlled for the potentially confounding effects of dopaminergic medication, depression, anxiety, and global cognitive impairment. The findings of the current study add to the literature by highlighting potential abnormalities in mesocorticolimbic pathways involved in the development of apathy in PD.</p>

<p>Transient receptor potential (TRP) are cation channels expressed in both non-excitable and excitable cells from diverse tissues, including heart, lung, and brain. The TRP channel family includes 28 isoforms activated by physical and chemical stimuli, such as temperature, pH, osmotic pressure, and noxious stimuli. Recently, it has been shown that TRP channels are also directly or indirectly activated by reactive oxygen species. Oxidative stress plays an essential role in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, and TRP channels are involved in the progression of those diseases by mechanisms involving changes in the crosstalk between Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation, oxidative stress, and production of inflammatory mediators. TRP channels involved in nociception include members of the TRPV, TRPM, TRPA, and TRPC subfamilies that transduce physical and chemical noxious stimuli. It has also been reported that pain is a complex issue in patients with Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, and adequate management of pain in those conditions is still in discussion. TRPV1 has a role in neuroinflammation, a critical mechanism involved in neurodegeneration. Therefore, some studies have considered TRPV1 as a target for both pain treatment and neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, this review aimed to describe the TRP-dependent mechanism that can mediate pain sensation in neurodegenerative diseases and the therapeutic approach available to palliate pain and neurodegenerative symptoms throughout the regulation of these channels.</p>

<p>Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado–Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD) is a progressive autosomal dominantly inherited cerebellar ataxia characterized by the aggregation of polyglutamine-expanded protein within neuronal nuclei in the brain, which can lead to brain damage that precedes the onset of clinical manifestations. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques such as morphometric MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) have gained increasing attention as non-invasive and quantitative methods for the assessment of structural and functional alterations in clinical SCA3/MJD patients as well as preclinical carriers. Morphometric MRI has demonstrated typical patterns of atrophy or volume loss in the cerebellum and brainstem with extensive lesions in some supratentorial areas. DTI has detected widespread microstructural alterations in brain white matter, which indicate disrupted brain anatomical connectivity. Task-related fMRI has presented unusual brain activation patterns within the cerebellum and some extracerebellar tissue, reflecting the decreased functional connectivity of these brain regions in SCA3/MJD subjects. MRS has revealed abnormal neurochemical profiles, such as the levels or ratios of N-acetyl aspartate, choline, and creatine, in both clinical cases and preclinical cases before the alterations in brain anatomical structure. Moreover, a number of studies have reported correlations of MR imaging alterations with clinical and genetic features. The utility of these MR imaging techniques can help to identify preclinical SCA3/MJD carriers, monitor disease progression, evaluate response to therapeutic interventions, and illustrate the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the occurrence, development, and prognosis of SCA3/MJD.</p>

<p>Introduction: In this study, we examined whether the self-selection of occupations of interest affects reaction times (RTs) and cognitive processing by using the Aid for Decision-making in Occupation Choice (ADOC) and event-related potentials (ERP). We also assessed the relationship of these with psychological indicators.</p><p>Method: We extracted 78 occupations from the ADOC in consideration of the subjects’ age, and three conditions were set: (1) self-selection of an interesting occupation; (2) self-selection of a disliked occupation; and (3) forced selection. The RT task was executed under their conditions during which ERP was measured. We compared the P300 component of ERP in these conditions. Moreover, we examined the association of cognitive processing and degree of satisfaction and performance concerning occupation, with psychological indicators.</p><p>Results: P300 amplitude at Fz significantly increased in the self-selection of an interesting occupation. P300 amplitude at Pz was significantly positively correlated with the occupational satisfaction score.</p><p>Conclusion: Self-selection of interesting occupations in the ADOC resulted in increased attention resource allocation by increasing motivation. Further, there was a positive correlation between satisfaction concerning the occupation and attention of resource allocation. Therefore, occupational therapists should know which occupations the patients consider interesting and help them to select by themselves, thus enhancing their satisfaction after consultation. These interventions may contribute to promoting motivation and cognitive processing.</p>

<p>The process of aging commonly features a gradual deterioration in cognitive performance and, in particular, the decline of memory. Despite the increased longevity of the world’s population, the prevalence of neurodegenerative conditions, such as dementia, continues to be a major burden on public health, and consequently, the latest research has been focused on memory and aging. Currently, the failure of episodic and Prospective memory (PM) is one of the main complaints in the elderly, considered among the early symptoms of dementia. It is therefore increasingly important to define more clearly the boundaries between normal and pathological aging. Recently, researchers have begun to build and apply Virtual Environments (VE) to the explicit purpose of better understanding the performance of episodic and PM in complex and realistic contexts, with the perspective of further developing effective training procedures that depend on reliable cognitive assessment methods. Virtual technology offers higher levels of realism than “pen and paper” testing and at the same time more experimental control than naturalistic settings. In this mini-review article, we examine the outcomes of recently available studies on virtual reality technology applications developed for the assessment and improvement of episodic and/or PM. To consider the latest technology, we selected 29 articles that have been published in the last 10 years. These documents show that VR-based technologies can provide a valid basis for screening and treatment and, through increased sensory stimulation and enriched environments reproducing the scenarios of everyday life, could represent effective stimulating experiences even in pathological aging.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00072">Admittance Method for Estimating Local Field Potentials Generated in a Multi-Scale Neuron Model of the Hippocampus</a></h4>

<p>Significant progress has been made toward model-based prediction of neral tissue activation in response to extracellular electrical stimulation, but challenges remain in the accurate and efficient estimation of distributed local field potentials (LFP). Analytical methods of estimating electric fields are a first-order approximation that may be suitable for model validation, but they are computationally expensive and cannot accurately capture boundary conditions in heterogeneous tissue. While there are many appropriate numerical methods of solving electric fields in neural tissue models, there isn't an established standard for mesh geometry nor a well-known rule for handling any mismatch in spatial resolution. Moreover, the challenge of misalignment between current sources and mesh nodes in a finite-element or resistor-network method volume conduction model needs to be further investigated. Therefore, using a previously published and validated multi-scale model of the hippocampus, the authors have formulated an algorithm for LFP estimation, and by extension, bidirectional communication between discretized and numerically solved volume conduction models and biologically detailed neural circuit models constructed in NEURON. Development of this algorithm required that we assess meshes of (i) unstructured tetrahedral and grid-based hexahedral geometries as well as (ii) differing approaches for managing the spatial misalignment of current sources and mesh nodes. The resulting algorithm is validated through the comparison of Admittance Method predicted evoked potentials with analytically estimated LFPs. Establishing this method is a critical step toward closed-loop integration of volume conductor and NEURON models that could lead to substantial improvement of the predictive power of multi-scale stimulation models of cortical tissue. These models may be used to deepen our understanding of hippocampal pathologies and the identification of efficacious electroceutical treatments.</p>

<p>Glioblastoma is a WHO grade IV brain tumor, which leads to poor overall survival (OS) of patients. For precise surgical and treatment planning, OS prediction of glioblastoma (GBM) patients is highly desired by clinicians and oncologists. Radiomic research attempts at predicting disease prognosis, thus providing beneficial information for personalized treatment from a variety of imaging features extracted from multiple MR images. In this study, first-order, intensity-based volume and shape-based and textural radiomic features are extracted from fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T1ce MRI data. The region of interest is further decomposed with stationary wavelet transform with low-pass and high-pass filtering. Further, radiomic features are extracted on these decomposed images, which helped in acquiring the directional information. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge training, validation, and test datasets. The proposed approach achieved 0.695, 0.571, and 0.558 on BraTS training, validation, and test datasets. The proposed approach secured the third position in BraTS 2018 challenge for the OS prediction task.</p>

<p>One of the risk factors for schizophrenia is maternal infection. We have previously shown that Polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (poly I:C) induced maternal immune activation in mice caused histological changes in the hippocampal CA1 area of offspring during the developmental period and impaired sensorimotor gating in offspring during adulthood, resulting in behavioral changes. However, it remains unclear how maternal immune activation functionally impacts the hippocampal neuronal activity of offspring. We studied the effect of prenatal poly I:C treatment on synaptic transmission of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells in postnatal and adult offspring. Treatment with poly I:C diminished excitatory and enhanced inhibitory (GABAergic) synaptic transmission on pyramidal cells in adult offspring. During the early developmental period, we still observed that treatment with poly I:C decreased excitatory synaptic transmission and potentially increased GABAergic synaptic transmission, which was uncovered under a condition of high extracellular potassium-activated neurons. In conclusion, we demonstrate that maternal immune activation decreased excitatory and increased inhibitory synaptic transmission on hippocampal pyramidal cells from an early developmental period to adulthood, which could result in net inhibition in conjunction with poor functional organization and integration of hippocampal circuits.</p>

<p>The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family polypeptides play key roles in promoting tissue regeneration and repair. FGF5 is strongly up-regulated in Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system following injury; however, a role for FGF5 in peripheral nerve regeneration has not been shown up to now. In this report, we examined the expression of FGF5 and its receptors FGFR1-4 in Schwann cells of the mouse sciatic nerve following injury, and then measured the effects of FGF5 treatment upon cultured primary rat Schwann cells. By microarray and mRNA sequencing data analysis, RT-PCR, qPCR, western blotting and immunostaining, we show that FGF5 is highly up-regulated in Schwann cells of the mouse distal sciatic nerve following injury, and FGFR1 and FGFR2 are highly expressed in Schwann cells of the peripheral nerve both before and following injury. Using cultured primary rat Schwann cells, we show that FGF5 inhibits ERK1/2 MAP kinase activity but promotes rapid Schwann cell migration and adhesion via the upregulation of N-cadherin. Thus, FGF5 is an autocrine regulator of Schwann cells to regulate Schwann cell migration and adhesion.</p>

<p>Aberrant brain insulin signaling plays a critical role in the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a role in the progression of AD, with excessive mitochondrial fission in the hippocampus being one of the pathological mechanisms of AD. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of AD and mitochondrial fragmentation induced by aberrant brain insulin signaling in the hippocampal neurons are poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the molecular mechanistic signaling associated with mitochondrial dynamics using streptozotocin (STZ), a diabetogenic compound, in the hippocampus cell line, HT-22 cells. In this metabolic dysfunctional cellular model, hallmarks of AD such as neuronal apoptosis, synaptic loss, and tau hyper-phosphorylation are induced by STZ. We found that in the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1, phosphorylation is increased in STZ-treated HT-22 cells. We also determined that inhibition of mitochondrial fragmentation suppresses STZ-induced AD-like pathology. Furthermore, we found that phosphorylation of Drp1 was induced by CDK5, and inhibition of CDK5 suppresses STZ-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and AD-like pathology. Therefore, these findings indicate that mitochondrial morphology and functional regulation may be a strategy of potential therapeutic for treating abnormal metabolic functions associated with the pathogenesis of AD.</p>

<p>Myelin is a dynamic membrane that is important for coordinating the fast propagation of action potentials along small or large caliber axons (0.1–10 μm) some of which extend the entire length of the spinal cord. Due to the heterogeneity of electrical and energy demands of the variable neuronal populations, the axo-myelinic and axo-glial interactions that regulate the biophysical properties of myelinated axons also vary in terms of molecular interactions at the membrane interfaces. An important topic of debate in neuroscience is how myelin is maintained and modified under neuronal control and how disruption of this control (due to disease or injury) can initiate and/or propagate neurodegeneration. One of the key molecular signaling cascades that have been investigated in the context of neural injury over the past two decades involves the myelin-associated inhibitory factors (MAIFs) that interact with Nogo receptor 1 (NgR1). Chief among the MAIF superfamily of molecules is a reticulon family protein, Nogo-A, that is established as a potent inhibitor of neurite sprouting and axon regeneration. However, an understated role for NgR1 is its ability to control axo-myelin interactions and Nogo-A specific ligand binding. These interactions may occur at axo-dendritic and axo-glial synapses regulating their functional and dynamic membrane domains. The current review provides a comprehensive analysis of how neuronal NgR1 can regulate myelin thickness and plasticity under normal and disease conditions. Specifically, we discuss how NgR1 plays an important role in regulating paranodal and juxtaparanodal domains through specific signal transduction cascades that are important for microdomain molecular architecture and action potential propagation. Potential therapeutics designed to target NgR1-dependent signaling during disease are being developed in animal models since interference with the involvement of the receptor may facilitate neurological recovery. Hence, the regulatory role played by NgR1 in the axo-myelinic interface is an important research field of clinical significance that requires comprehensive investigation.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that there is a critical window for estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) in postmenopausal women with Alzheimer’s disease (AD); however, supporting evidence is lacking. To address this issue, we investigated the effective period for estradiol (E2) treatment using a mouse model of AD. Four-month-old female APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice were ovariectomized (OVX) and treated with E2 for 2 months starting at the age of 4 months (early period), 6 months (mid-period), or 8 months (late period). We then evaluated hippocampal neurogenesis, β-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation, telomerase activity, and hippocampal-dependent behavior. Compared to age-matched wild type mice, APP/PS1 mice with intact ovaries showed increased proliferation of hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs) at 8 months of age and decreased proliferation of NSCs at 10 months of age; meanwhile, Aβ accumulation progressively increased with age, paralleling the reduced survival of immature neurons. OVX-induced depletion of E2 in APP/PS1 mice resulted in elevated Aβ levels accompanied by elevated p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75<sup>NTR</sup>) expression and increased NSC proliferation at 6 months of age, which subsequently declined; accelerated reduction of immature neurons starting from 6 months of age, and reduced telomerase activity and worsened memory performance at 10 months of age. Treatment with E2 in the early period post-OVX, rather than in the mid or late period, abrogated these effects, and p75<sup>NTR</sup> inhibition reduced the overproliferation of NSCs in 6-month-old OVX-APP/PS1 mice. Thus, E2 deficiency in young APP/PS1 mice exacerbates cognitive deficits and depletes the hippocampal NSC pool in later life; this can be alleviated by E2 treatment in the early period following OVX, which prevents Aβ/p75<sup>NTR</sup>-induced NSC overproliferation and preserves telomerase activity.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by senile plaques (SPs), which are caused by amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of abnormal hyperphosphorylated tau protein. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) binds to advanced glycation end products deposited during vascular dysfunction. Alzheimer’s disease may occur when RAGE binds to Aβ and releases reactive oxygen species, further exacerbating Aβ deposition and eventually leading to SPs and NFTs. As it is involved in early AD, RAGE may be considered as a more potent biomarker than Aβ. Positron emission tomography provides valuable information regarding the underlying pathological processes of AD many years before the appearance of clinical symptoms. Thus, to further reveal the role of RAGE in AD pathology and for early diagnosis of AD, a tracer that targets RAGE is needed. In this review, we first describe the early diagnosis of AD and then summarize the interaction between RAGE and Aβ and Tau that is required to induce AD pathology, and finally focus on RAGE-targeting probes, highlighting the potential of RAGE to be used as an effective target. The development of RAGE probes is expected to aid in AD diagnosis and treatment.</p>

Although many high-risk mucosal and cutaneous human papillomaviruses (HPVs) theoretically have the potential to synthesize L1 isoforms differing in length, previous seroepidemiological studies only focused on the short L1 variants, co-assembling with L2 to infectious virions. Using the multimammate mouse <i>Mastomys coucha</i> as preclinical model, this is the first study demonstrating seroconversion against different L1 isoforms during the natural course of papillomavirus infection. Intriguingly, positivity with the cutaneous MnPV was accompanied by a strong seroresponse against a longer L1 isoform, but to our surprise, the raised antibodies were non-neutralizing. Only after a delay of around 4 months, protecting antibodies against the short L1 appeared, enabling the virus to successfully establish an infection. This argues for a novel humoral immune escape mechanism that may also have important implications on the interpretation of epidemiological data in terms of seropositivity and protection of PV infections in general.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55684">Intrinsic excitation-inhibition imbalance affects medial prefrontal cortex differently in autistic men versus women</a></h4>

Excitation-inhibition (E:I) imbalance is theorized as an important pathophysiological mechanism in autism. Autism affects males more frequently than females and sex-related mechanisms (e.g., X-linked genes, androgen hormones) can influence E:I balance. This suggests that E:I imbalance may affect autism differently in males versus females. With a combination of in-silico modeling and in-vivo chemogenetic manipulations in mice, we first show that a time-series metric estimated from fMRI BOLD signal, the Hurst exponent (H), can be an index for underlying change in the synaptic E:I ratio. In autism we find that H is reduced, indicating increased excitation, in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) of autistic males but not females. Increasingly intact MPFC H is also associated with heightened ability to behaviorally camouflage social-communicative difficulties, but only in autistic females. This work suggests that H in BOLD can index synaptic E:I ratio and that E:I imbalance affects autistic males and females differently.

<p>by Gabriel Koch Ocker, Michael A. Buice</p>

Neural computation is determined by neurons’ dynamics and circuit connectivity. Uncertain and dynamic environments may require neural hardware to adapt to different computational tasks, each requiring different connectivity configurations. At the same time, connectivity is subject to a variety of constraints, placing limits on the possible computations a given neural circuit can perform. Here we examine the hypothesis that the organization of neural circuitry favors computational flexibility: that it makes many computational solutions available, given physiological constraints. From this hypothesis, we develop models of connectivity degree distributions based on constraints on a neuron’s total synaptic weight. To test these models, we examine reconstructions of the mushroom bodies from the first instar larva and adult <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. We perform a Bayesian model comparison for two constraint models and a random wiring null model. Overall, we find that flexibility under a homeostatically fixed total synaptic weight describes Kenyon cell connectivity better than other models, suggesting a principle shaping the apparently random structure of Kenyon cell wiring. Furthermore, we find evidence that larval Kenyon cells are more flexible earlier in development, suggesting a mechanism whereby neural circuits begin as flexible systems that develop into specialized computational circuits.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OhEIj0eIIGQ" width="1" />

<p>by Giorgos Minas, Dan J. Woodcock, Louise Ashall, Claire V. Harper, Michael R. H. White, David A. Rand</p>

We consider how a signalling system can act as an information hub by multiplexing information arising from multiple signals. We formally define multiplexing, mathematically characterise which systems can multiplex and how well they can do it. While the results of this paper are theoretical, to motivate the idea of multiplexing, we provide experimental evidence that tentatively suggests that the NF-<i>κ</i>B transcription factor can multiplex information about changes in multiple signals. We believe that our theoretical results may resolve the apparent paradox of how a system like NF-<i>κ</i>B that regulates cell fate and inflammatory signalling in response to diverse stimuli can appear to have the low information carrying capacity suggested by recent studies on scalar signals. In carrying out our study, we introduce new methods for the analysis of large, nonlinear stochastic dynamic models, and develop computational algorithms that facilitate the calculation of fundamental constructs of information theory such as Kullback–Leibler divergences and sensitivity matrices, and link these methods to new theory about multiplexing information. We show that many current models such as those of the NF-<i>κ</i>B system cannot multiplex effectively and provide models that overcome this limitation using post-transcriptional modifications.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9MxzVqLUduA" width="1" />

Hypoxia-activated prodrugs (HAPs) present a conceptually elegant approach to not only overcome, but better yet, exploit intra-tumoural hypoxia. Despite being successful <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, HAPs are yet to achieve successful results in clinical settings. It has been hypothesised that this lack of clinical success can, in part, be explained by the insufficiently stringent clinical screening selection of determining which tumours are suitable for HAP treatments. Taking a mathematical modelling approach, we investigate how tumour properties and HAP-radiation scheduling influence treatment outcomes in simulated tumours. The following key results are demonstrated <i>in silico</i>: <i>(i)</i> HAP and ionising radiation (IR) monotherapies may attack tumours in dissimilar, and complementary, ways. <i>(ii)</i> HAP-IR scheduling may impact treatment efficacy. <i>(iii)</i> HAPs may function as IR treatment intensifiers. <i>(iv)</i> The spatio-temporal intra-tumoural oxygen landscape may impact HAP efficacy. Our <i>in silico</i> framework is based on an on-lattice, hybrid, multiscale cellular automaton spanning three spatial dimensions. The mathematical model for tumour spheroid growth is parameterised by multicellular tumour spheroid (MCTS) data.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oXpNL_S1XMU" width="1" />

<p>by Andy Hoyle, David Cairns, Iona Paterson, Stuart McMillan, Gabriela Ochoa, Andrew P. Desbois</p>

Mass production and use of antibiotics has led to the rise of resistant bacteria, a problem possibly exacerbated by inappropriate and non-optimal application. Antibiotic treatment often follows <i>fixed-dose</i> regimens, with a standard dose of antibiotic administered equally spaced in time. But are such fixed-dose regimens optimal or can alternative regimens be designed to increase efficacy? Yet, few mathematical models have aimed to identify optimal treatments based on biological data of infections inside a living host. In addition, assumptions to make the mathematical models analytically tractable limit the search space of possible treatment regimens (e.g. to fixed-dose treatments). Here, we aimed to address these limitations by using experiments in a <i>Galleria mellonella</i> (insect) model of bacterial infection, to create a fully parametrised mathematical model of a systemic <i>Vibrio</i> infection. We successfully validated this model with biological experiments, including treatments unseen by the mathematical model. Then, by applying artificial intelligence, this model was used to determine optimal antibiotic dosage regimens to treat the host to maximise survival while minimising total antibiotic used. As expected, host survival increased as total quantity of antibiotic applied during the course of treatment increased. However, many of the optimal regimens tended to follow a large initial ‘loading’ dose followed by doses of incremental reductions in antibiotic quantity (dose ‘tapering’). Moreover, application of the entire antibiotic in a single dose at the start of treatment was never optimal, except when the total quantity of antibiotic was very low. Importantly, the range of optimal regimens identified was broad enough to allow the antibiotic prescriber to choose a regimen based on additional criteria or preferences. Our findings demonstrate the utility of an insect host to model antibiotic therapies <i>in vivo</i> and the approach lays a foundation for future regimen optimisation for patient and societal benefits.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/n6KNpSUkA4E" width="1" />

Many large-scale functional connectivity studies have emphasized the importance of communication through increased inter-region correlations during task states. In contrast, local circuit studies have demonstrated that task states primarily reduce correlations among pairs of neurons, likely enhancing their information coding by suppressing shared spontaneous activity. Here we sought to adjudicate between these conflicting perspectives, assessing whether co-active brain regions during task states tend to increase or decrease their correlations. We found that variability and correlations primarily decrease across a variety of cortical regions in two highly distinct data sets: non-human primate spiking data and human functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Moreover, this observed variability and correlation reduction was accompanied by an overall increase in dimensionality (reflecting less information redundancy) during task states, suggesting that decreased correlations increased information coding capacity. We further found in both spiking and neural mass computational models that task-evoked activity increased the stability around a stable attractor, globally quenching neural variability and correlations. Together, our results provide an integrative mechanistic account that encompasses measures of large-scale neural activity, variability, and correlations during resting and task states.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5-P3CCpUKEk" width="1" />

<p>by K. L. Nikhil, Sandra Korge, Achim Kramer</p>

A ubiquitous feature of the circadian clock across life forms is its organization as a network of cellular oscillators, with individual cellular oscillators within the network often exhibiting considerable heterogeneity in their intrinsic periods. The interaction of coupling and heterogeneity in circadian clock networks is hypothesized to influence clock’s entrainability, but our knowledge of mechanisms governing period heterogeneity within circadian clock networks remains largely elusive. In this study, we aimed to explore the principles that underlie intercellular period variation in circadian clock networks (clonal period heterogeneity). To this end, we employed a laboratory selection approach and derived a panel of 25 clonal cell populations exhibiting circadian periods ranging from 22 to 28 h. We report that a single parent clone can produce progeny clones with a wide distribution of circadian periods, and this heterogeneity, in addition to being stochastically driven, has a heritable component. By quantifying the expression of 20 circadian clock and clock-associated genes across our clone panel, we found that inheritance of expression patterns in at least three clock genes might govern clonal period heterogeneity in circadian clock networks. Furthermore, we provide evidence suggesting that heritable epigenetic variation in gene expression regulation might underlie period heterogeneity.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/nO7_HYsM5lM" width="1" />

<p>by Shashi Prakash Singh, Peter A. Thomason, Sergio Lilla, Matthias Schaks, Qing Tang, Bruce L. Goode, Laura M. Machesky, Klemens Rottner, Robert H. Insall</p>

The Scar/WAVE complex is the principal catalyst of pseudopod and lamellipod formation. Here we show that Scar/WAVE’s proline-rich domain is polyphosphorylated after the complex is activated. Blocking Scar/WAVE activation stops phosphorylation in both <i>Dictyostelium</i> and mammalian cells, implying that phosphorylation modulates pseudopods after they have been formed, rather than controlling whether they are initiated. Unexpectedly, phosphorylation is not promoted by chemotactic signaling but is greatly stimulated by cell:substrate adhesion and diminished when cells deadhere. Phosphorylation-deficient or phosphomimetic Scar/WAVE mutants are both normally functional and rescue the phenotype of knockout cells, demonstrating that phosphorylation is dispensable for activation and actin regulation. However, pseudopods and patches of phosphorylation-deficient Scar/WAVE last substantially longer in mutants, altering the dynamics and size of pseudopods and lamellipods and thus changing migration speed. Scar/WAVE phosphorylation does not require ERK2 in <i>Dictyostelium</i> or mammalian cells. However, the MAPKKK homologue SepA contributes substantially—<i>sep</i>A mutants have less steady-state phosphorylation, which does not increase in response to adhesion. The mutants also behave similarly to cells expressing phosphorylation-deficient Scar, with longer-lived pseudopods and patches of Scar recruitment. We conclude that pseudopod engagement with substratum is more important than extracellular signals at regulating Scar/WAVE’s activity and that phosphorylation acts as a pseudopod timer by promoting Scar/WAVE turnover.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Z8MkWjL8crs" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/O3TPN2fSdms/article">Selfing mutants link Ku proteins to mating type determination in &lt;i&gt;Tetrahymena&lt;/i&gt;</a></h4>

<p>by I-Ting Lin, Meng-Chao Yao</p>

Recognition of self and nonself is important for outcrossing organisms, and different mating types establish the barrier against self-mating. In the unicellular ciliate <i>T</i>. <i>thermophila</i>, mating type determination requires complex DNA rearrangements at a single <i>mat</i> locus during conjugation to produce a type-specific gene pair (<i>MTA</i> and <i>MTB</i>) for 1 of 7 possible mating types. Surprisingly, we found that decreased expression of the DNA breakage-repair protein Ku80 at late stages of conjugation generated persistent selfing phenotype in the progeny. DNA analysis revealed multiple mating-type gene pairs as well as a variety of mis-paired, unusually arranged mating-type genes in these selfers that resemble some proposed rearrangement intermediates. They are found also in normal cells during conjugation and are lost after 10 fissions but are retained in Ku mutants. Silencing of <i>TKU80</i> or <i>TKU70-2</i> immediately after conjugation also generated selfing phenotype, revealing a hidden DNA rearrangement process beyond conjugation. Mating reactions between the mutant and normal cells suggest a 2-component system for self–nonself-recognition through <i>MTA</i> and <i>MTB</i> genes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/O3TPN2fSdms" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/vW68mrDTUfg/article">Down-regulation of a cytokine secreted from peripheral fat bodies improves visual attention while reducing sleep in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;</a></h4>

<p>by Deniz Ertekin, Leonie Kirszenblat, Richard Faville, Bruno van Swinderen</p>

Sleep is vital for survival. Yet under environmentally challenging conditions, such as starvation, animals suppress their need for sleep. Interestingly, starvation-induced sleep loss does not evoke a subsequent sleep rebound. Little is known about how starvation-induced sleep deprivation differs from other types of sleep loss, or why some sleep functions become dispensable during starvation. Here, we demonstrate that down-regulation of the secreted cytokine unpaired 2 (<i>upd2</i>) in <i>Drosophila</i> flies may mimic a starved-like state. We used a genetic knockdown strategy to investigate the consequences of <i>upd2</i> on visual attention and sleep in otherwise well-fed flies, thereby sidestepping the negative side effects of undernourishment. We find that knockdown of <i>upd2</i> in the fat body (FB) is sufficient to suppress sleep and promote feeding-related behaviors while also improving selective visual attention. Furthermore, we show that this peripheral signal is integrated in the fly brain via insulin-expressing cells. Together, these findings identify a role for peripheral tissue-to-brain interactions in the simultaneous regulation of sleep quality and attention, to potentially promote adaptive behaviors necessary for survival in hungry animals.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/vW68mrDTUfg" width="1" />

<p>Within months of birth, children have meaningful expectations about the world
around them. How much of this early knowledge can be explained through generic
learning mechanisms applied to sensory data, and how much of it requires more
substantive innate inductive biases? Addressing this fundamental question in
its full generality is currently infeasible, but we can hope to make real
progress in more narrowly defined domains, such as the development of
high-level visual categories, thanks to improvements in data collecting
technology and recent progress in deep learning. In this paper, our goal is to
achieve such progress by utilizing modern self-supervised deep learning methods
and a recent longitudinal, egocentric video dataset recorded from the
perspective of several young children (Sullivan et al., 2020). Our results
demonstrate the emergence of powerful, high-level visual representations from
developmentally realistic natural videos using generic self-supervised learning
objectives.

<p>Neural Architecture Search has achieved state-of-the-art performance in a
variety of tasks, out-performing human-designed networks. However, many
assumptions, that require human definition, related with the problems being
solved or the models generated are still needed: final model architectures,
number of layers to be sampled, forced operations, small search spaces, which
ultimately contributes to having models with higher performances at the cost of
inducing bias into the system. In this paper, we propose HMCNAS, which is
composed of two novel components: i) a method that leverages information about
human-designed models to autonomously generate a complex search space, and ii)
an Evolutionary Algorithm with Bayesian Optimization that is capable of
generating competitive CNNs from scratch, without relying on human-defined
parameters or small search spaces. The experimental results show that the
proposed approach results in competitive architectures obtained in a very short
time. HMCNAS provides a step towards generalizing NAS, by providing a way to
create competitive models, without requiring any human knowledge about the
specific task.

<p>Scientific studies of consciousness rely on objects whose existence is
independent of any consciousness. This theoretical-assumption leads to the
"hard problem" of consciousness. We avoid this problem by assuming
consciousness to be fundamental, and the main feature of consciousness is
characterized as being other-dependent. We set up a framework which naturally
subsumes the other-dependent feature by defining a compact closed category
where morphisms represent conscious processes. These morphisms are a
composition of a set of generators, each being specified by their relations
with other generators, and therefore other-dependent. The framework is general
enough, i.e. parameters in the morphisms take values in arbitrary commutative
semi-rings, from which any finitely dimensional system can be dealt with. Our
proposal fits well into a compositional model of consciousness and is an
important step forward that addresses both the hard problem of consciousness
and the combination problem of (proto)-panpsychism.

<p>Normal-hearing listeners adapt to alterations in sound localization cues.
This adaptation can result from the establishment of a new spatial map of the
altered cues or from a stronger relative weighting of unaltered compared to
altered cues. Such reweighting has been shown for monaural vs. binaural cues.
However, studies attempting to reweight the two binaural cues, interaural
differences in time and level, yielded inconclusive results. In this study we
investigated whether binaural cue reweighting can be induced by a
lateralization training in a virtual audio-visual environment. 20
normal-hearing participants, divided into two groups, completed the experiment
consisting of a seven-day lateralization training in a virtual audio-visual
environment, preceded and followed by a test measuring the binaural cue
weights. During testing, the participants task was to lateralize 500-ms
bandpass-filtered (2-4 kHz) noise bursts containing various combinations of
spatially consistent and inconsistent ITDs and ILDs. During training, the task
was extended by visual cues reinforcing ITDs in one group and ILDs in the other
group as well as manipulating the azimuthal ranges of the two cues. In both
groups, the weight given to the reinforced cue increased significantly from
pre- to posttest, suggesting that participants reweighted the binaural cues in
the expected direction. This reweighting occurred predominantly within the
first training session. The present results are relevant as binaural cue
reweighting is, for example, likely to occur when normal-hearing listeners
adapt to new acoustic environments. Similarly, binaural cue reweighting might
be a factor underlying the low contribution of ITDs to sound localization of
cochlear-implant listeners as they typically do not experience reliable ITD
cues with their clinical devices.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.16104">Uncovering the structure of clinical EEG signals with self-supervised learning. (arXiv:2007.16104v1 [stat.ML])</a></h4>

<p>Objective. Supervised learning paradigms are often limited by the amount of
labeled data that is available. This phenomenon is particularly problematic in
clinically-relevant data, such as electroencephalography (EEG), where labeling
can be costly in terms of specialized expertise and human processing time.
Consequently, deep learning architectures designed to learn on EEG data have
yielded relatively shallow models and performances at best similar to those of
traditional feature-based approaches. However, in most situations, unlabeled
data is available in abundance. By extracting information from this unlabeled
data, it might be possible to reach competitive performance with deep neural
networks despite limited access to labels. Approach. We investigated
self-supervised learning (SSL), a promising technique for discovering structure
in unlabeled data, to learn representations of EEG signals. Specifically, we
explored two tasks based on temporal context prediction as well as contrastive
predictive coding on two clinically-relevant problems: EEG-based sleep staging
and pathology detection. We conducted experiments on two large public datasets
with thousands of recordings and performed baseline comparisons with purely
supervised and hand-engineered approaches. Main results. Linear classifiers
trained on SSL-learned features consistently outperformed purely supervised
deep neural networks in low-labeled data regimes while reaching competitive
performance when all labels were available. Additionally, the embeddings
learned with each method revealed clear latent structures related to
physiological and clinical phenomena, such as age effects. Significance. We
demonstrate the benefit of self-supervised learning approaches on EEG data. Our
results suggest that SSL may pave the way to a wider use of deep learning
models on EEG data.

While previous studies have focused on neural contributions to this process of systems consolidation, a new study by Kol et al. reveals that astrocytes play crucial modulatory roles in the formation of remote memories.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/YldoyKEKzJ8" width="1" />

<p>Nature Communications, Published online: 03 August 2020; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17678-4">doi:10.1038/s41467-020-17678-4</a></p>RNA-sequencing of tumour tissue can provide important diagnostic and prognostic information but this is costly and not routinely performed in all clinical settings.

<p>Adaptation is an important mechanism that causes a decrease in the neural response both in terms of local field potentials (LFP) and spiking activity. We previously showed this reduction effect in the tuning curve of the primary auditory cortex. Moreover, we revealed that a repeated stimulus reduces the neural response in terms of spike-phase coupling (SPC). In the current study, we examined the effect of adaptation on the SPC tuning curve. To this end, employing the phase-locking value (PLV) method, we estimated the spike-LFP coupling. The data was obtained by a simultaneous recording from four single-electrodes in the primary auditory cortex of 15 rats. We first investigated whether the neural system may use spike-LFP phase coupling in the primary auditory cortex to encode sensory information. Secondly, we investigated the effect of adaptation on this potential SPC tuning. Our data showed that the coupling between spikes’ times and the LFP phase in beta oscillations represents sensory information (different stimulus frequencies), with an inverted bell-shaped tuning curve. Furthermore, we showed that adaptation to a specific frequency modulates SPC tuning curve of the adapter and its neighboring frequencies. These findings could be useful for interpretation of feature representation in terms of SPC and the underlying neural mechanism of adaptation.</p>

<p>Novel therapeutic approaches for treating inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs) prompt a need to understand which patients with impaired vision have the anatomical potential to gain from participation in a clinical trial. We used supervised machine learning to predict foveal function from foveal structure in blue cone monochromacy (BCM), an X-linked congenital cone photoreceptor dysfunction secondary to mutations in the OPN1LW/OPN1MW gene cluster. BCM patients with either disease-associated large deletion or missense mutations were studied and results compared with those from subjects with other forms of IRD and various degrees of preserved central structure and function. A machine learning technique was used to associate foveal sensitivities and best-corrected visual acuities to foveal structure in IRD patients. Two random forest (RF) models trained on IRD data were applied to predict foveal function in BCM. A curve fitting method was also used and results compared with those of the RF models. The BCM and IRD patients had a comparable range of foveal structure. IRD patients had peak sensitivity at the fovea. Machine learning could successfully predict foveal sensitivity (FS) results from segmented or un-segmented optical coherence tomography (OCT) input. Application of machine learning predictions to BCM at the fovea showed differences between predicted and measured sensitivities, thereby defining treatment potential. The curve fitting method provided similar results. Given a measure of visual acuity (VA) and foveal outer nuclear layer thickness, the question of how many lines of acuity would represent the best efficacious result for each BCM patient could be answered. We propose that foveal vision improvement potential in BCM is predictable from retinal structure using machine learning and curve fitting approaches. This should allow estimates of maximal efficacy in patients being considered for clinical trials and also guide decisions about dosing.</p>

<p>Background: Neuronal apoptosis involved in secondary injury following traumatic brain injury (TBI) significantly contributes to the poor outcomes of patients with TBI. The tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) can selectively induce apoptosis of tumor cells. Hypoxia factor (HIF) 1α is a controversial factor that mediates the neuronal apoptotic pathway. Herein, we hypothesize that HIF-1α may mediate the TRAIL-induced neuronal apoptosis after TBI.</p><p>Methods: We used Western blots and immunofluorescence to study the expression and cell localization of TRAIL and death receptor 5 (DR5) after TBI in rats. Soluble DR5 (sDR5) administration was used to block the TRAIL-induced neuronal death and neural deficits. HIF-1α inhibitor 2ME and agonist DMOG were used to study the role of HIF-1α in TRAIL-induced neuronal death. Meanwhile, HIF-1α siRNA was used to investigate the role of HIF-1α in TRAIL-induced neuronal death in vitro.</p><p>Results: The expressions of microglia-located TRAIL and neuron-located DR5 were significantly upregulated after TBI. sDR5 significantly attenuated TRAIL-induced neuronal apoptosis and neurological deficits. 2ME decreased neuronal apoptosis, lesion area, and brain edema and improved neurological function via increased expression of TRAIL decoy receptor 1 (DcR1), which inhibited TRAIL-induced apoptosis after TBI. The administration of DMOG produced the opposite effect than did 2ME. Similarly, HIF-1α siRNA attenuated TRAIL-induced neuronal death via increased DcR1 expression in vitro.</p><p>Conclusion: Our findings suggested that the TRAIL/DR5 signaling pathway plays an important role after neuronal apoptosis after TBI. HIF-1α mediates TRAIL-induced neuronal apoptosis by regulating DcR1 expression following TBI.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59733">Activation of a neural stem cell transcriptional program in parenchymal astrocytes</a></h4>

Adult neural stem cells, located in discrete brain regions, generate new neurons throughout life. These stem cells are specialized astrocytes, but astrocytes in other brain regions do not generate neurons under physiological conditions. After stroke, however, striatal astrocytes undergo neurogenesis in mice, triggered by decreased Notch signaling. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize neurogenesis by Notch-depleted striatal astrocytes in vivo. Striatal astrocytes were located upstream of neural stem cells in the neuronal lineage. As astrocytes initiated neurogenesis, they became transcriptionally very similar to subventricular zone stem cells, progressing through a near-identical neurogenic program. Surprisingly, in the non-neurogenic cortex, Notch-depleted astrocytes also initiated neurogenesis. Yet, these cortical astrocytes, and many striatal ones, stalled before entering transit-amplifying divisions. Infusion of epidermal growth factor enabled stalled striatal astrocytes to resume neurogenesis. We conclude that parenchymal astrocytes are latent neural stem cells and that targeted interventions can guide them through their neuronal differentiation.

La-related protein 4 (LARP4) directly binds both poly(A) and poly(A)-binding protein (PABP). LARP4 was shown to promote poly(A) tail (PAT) lengthening and stabilization of individual mRNAs presumably by protection from deadenylation (Mattijssen et al., 2017). We developed a nucleotide resolution transcriptome-wide, single molecule SM-PAT-seq method. This revealed LARP4 effects on a wide range of PAT lengths for human mRNAs and mouse mRNAs from LARP4 knockout (KO) and control cells. LARP4 effects are clear on long PAT mRNAs but become more prominent at 30-75 nucleotides. We also analyzed time courses of PAT decay transcriptome-wide and for ~200 immune response mRNAs. This demonstrated accelerated deadenylation in KO cells on PATs &lt;75 nucleotides and phasing features consistent with greater PABP dissociation in the absence of LARP4. Thus, LARP4 shapes PAT profiles throughout mRNA lifespan and with impact on mRNA decay at short lengths known to sensitize PABP dissociation in response to deadenylation machinery.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59151">The Structural Determinants of PH Domain-Mediated Regulation of Akt Revealed by Segmental Labeling</a></h4>

Akt is a critical protein kinase that governs cancer cell growth and metabolism. Akt appears to be autoinhibited by an intramolecular interaction between its N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and kinase domain, which is relieved by C-tail phosphorylation, but the precise molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here we use a combination of protein semisynthesis, NMR, and enzymological analysis to characterize structural features of the PH domain in its autoinhibited and activated states. We find that Akt autoinhibition depends on the length/flexibility of the PH-kinase linker. We identify a role for a dynamic short segment in the PH domain that appears to regulate autoinhibition and PDK1-catalyzed phosphorylation of Thr308 in the activation loop. We determine that Akt allosteric inhibitor MK2206 drives distinct PH domain structural changes compared to baseline autoinhibited Akt. These results highlight how the conformational plasticity of Akt governs the delicate control of its catalytic properties.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58836">Gene autoregulation by 3’ UTR-derived bacterial small RNAs</a></h4>

Negative feedback regulation, that is the ability of a gene to repress its own synthesis, is the most abundant regulatory motif known to biology. Frequently reported for transcriptional regulators, negative feedback control relies on binding of a transcription factor to its own promoter. Here, we report a novel mechanism for gene autoregulation in bacteria relying on small regulatory RNA (sRNA) and the major endoribonuclease, RNase E. TIER-seq analysis (transiently-inactivating-an-endoribonuclease-followed-by-RNA-seq) revealed ~25,000 RNase E-dependent cleavage sites in <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, several of which resulted in the accumulation of stable sRNAs. Focusing on two examples, OppZ and CarZ, we discovered that these sRNAs are processed from the 3’ untranslated region (3’ UTR) of the <i>oppABCDF</i> and <i>carAB</i> operons, respectively, and base-pair with their own transcripts to inhibit translation. For OppZ, this process also triggers Rho-dependent transcription termination. Our data show that sRNAs from 3’ UTRs serve as autoregulatory elements allowing negative feedback control at the post-transcriptional level.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58828">EDF1 coordinates cellular responses to ribosome collisions</a></h4>

Translation of aberrant mRNAs induces ribosomal collisions, thereby triggering pathways for mRNA and nascent peptide degradation and ribosomal rescue. Here we use sucrose gradient fractionation combined with quantitative proteomics to systematically identify proteins associated with collided ribosomes. This approach identified Endothelial differentiation-related factor 1 (EDF1) as a novel protein recruited to collided ribosomes during translational distress. Cryo-electron microscopic analyses of EDF1 and its yeast homolog Mbf1 revealed a conserved 40S ribosomal subunit binding site at the mRNA entry channel near the collision interface. EDF1 recruits the translational repressors GIGYF2 and EIF4E2 to collided ribosomes to initiate a negative-feedback loop that prevents new ribosomes from translating defective mRNAs. Further, EDF1 regulates an immediate-early transcriptional response to ribosomal collisions. Our results uncover mechanisms through which EDF1 coordinates multiple responses of the ribosome-mediated quality control pathway and provide novel insights into the intersection of ribosome-mediated quality control with global transcriptional regulation.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a heterogenous group of RNAs, which can encode small proteins. The extent to which developmentally regulated lncRNAs are translated and whether the produced microproteins are relevant for human development is unknown. Using a human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-based pancreatic differentiation system, we show that many lncRNAs in direct vicinity of lineage-determining transcription factors (TFs) are dynamically regulated, predominantly cytosolic, and highly translated. We genetically ablated ten such lncRNAs, most of them translated, and found that nine are dispensable for pancreatic endocrine cell development. However, deletion of <i>LINC00261</i> diminishes insulin<sup>+</sup> cells, in a manner independent of the nearby TF <i>FOXA2</i>. One-by-one deletion of each of <i>LINC00261</i>'s open reading frames suggests that the RNA, rather than the produced microproteins, is required for endocrine development. Our work highlights extensive translation of lncRNAs during hESC pancreatic differentiation and provides a blueprint for dissection of their coding and noncoding roles.

How cells adjust nutrient transport across their membranes is incompletely understood. Previously, we have shown that <i>S. cerevisiae</i> broadly re-configures the nutrient transporters at the plasma membrane in response to amino acid availability, through endocytosis of sugar- and amino acid transporters (AATs) (Müller et al., 2015). A genome-wide screen now revealed that the selective endocytosis of four AATs during starvation required the α-arrestin family protein Art2/Ecm21, an adaptor for the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5, and its induction through the general amino acid control pathway. Art2 uses a basic patch to recognize C-terminal acidic sorting motifs in AATs and thereby instructs Rsp5 to ubiquitinate proximal lysine residues. When amino acids are in excess, Rsp5 instead uses TORC1-activated Art1 to detect N-terminal acidic sorting motifs within the same AATs, which initiates exclusive substrate-induced endocytosis. Thus, amino acid excess or starvation activate complementary α-arrestin-Rsp5-complexes to control selective endocytosis and adapt nutrient acquisition.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56376">Alternative splicing of <i>coq-2</i> controls the level of rhodoquinone in animals</a></h4>

Parasitic helminths use two benzoquinones as electron carriers in the electron transport chain. In normoxia they use ubiquinone (UQ), but in the anaerobic conditions inside the host, they require rhodoquinone (RQ) and greatly increase RQ levels. We previously showed the switch from UQ to RQ synthesis is driven by a change in substrates by the polyprenyltransferase COQ-2 (Del Borrello et al., 2019; Roberts Buceta et al., 2019) - how this substrate choice is made is unknown. Here, we show helminths make two <i>coq-2</i> splice forms, <i>coq-2a </i>and <i>coq-2e</i>, and the <i>coq-2e-</i>specific exon is only found in species that make RQ. We show that in <i>C. elegans </i>COQ-2e is required for efficient RQ synthesis and for survival in cyanide. Crucially, parasites switch from COQ-2a to COQ-2e as they transition into anaerobic environments. We conclude helminths switch from UQ to RQ synthesis principally via changes in the alternative splicing of <i>coq-2.</i>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54993">NuRD subunit CHD4 regulates super-enhancer accessibility in Rhabdomyosarcoma and represents a general tumor dependency</a></h4>

The NuRD complex subunit CHD4 is essential for fusion-positive rhabdomyosarcoma (FP-RMS) survival, but the mechanisms underlying this dependency are not understood. Here, a NuRD-specific CRISPR screen demonstrates that FP-RMS is particularly sensitive to CHD4 amongst the NuRD members. Mechanistically, NuRD complex containing CHD4 localizes to super-enhancers where CHD4 generates a chromatin architecture permissive for the binding of the tumor driver and fusion protein PAX3-FOXO1, allowing downstream transcription of its oncogenic program. Moreover, CHD4 depletion removes HDAC2 from the chromatin, leading to an increase and spread of histone acetylation, and prevents the positioning of RNA Polymerase 2 at promoters impeding transcription initiation. Strikingly, analysis of genome-wide cancer dependency databases identifies CHD4 as a general cancer vulnerability. Our findings describe CHD4, a classically defined repressor, as positive regulator of transcription and super-enhancer accessibility as well as establish this remodeler as an unexpected broad tumor susceptibility and promising drug target for cancer therapy.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54347">Efficient coding of natural scene statistics predicts discrimination thresholds for grayscale textures</a></h4>

Previously, in (Hermundstad et al., 2014), we showed that when sampling is limiting, the efficient coding principle leads to a 'variance is salience' hypothesis, and that this hypothesis accounts for visual sensitivity to binary image statistics. Here, using extensive new psychophysical data and image analysis, we show that this hypothesis accounts for visual sensitivity to a large set of grayscale image statistics at a striking level of detail, and also identify the limits of the prediction. We define a 66-dimensional space of local grayscale light-intensity correlations, and measure the relevance of each direction to natural scenes. The 'variance is salience' hypothesis predicts that two-point correlations are most salient, and predicts their relative salience. We tested these predictions in a texture-segregation task using un-natural, synthetic textures. As predicted, correlations beyond second order are not salient, and predicted thresholds for over 300 second-order correlations match psychophysical thresholds closely (median fractional error &lt; 0:13).

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54201">Boosts in brain signal variability track liberal shifts in decision bias</a></h4>

Adopting particular decision biases allows organisms to tailor their choices to environmental demands. For example, a liberal response strategy pays off when target detection is crucial, whereas a conservative strategy is optimal for avoiding false alarms. Using conventional time-frequency analysis of human electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, we previously showed that bias setting entails adjustment of evidence accumulation in sensory regions (Kloosterman et al., 2019), but the presumed prefrontal signature of a conservative-to-liberal bias shift has remained elusive. Here, we show that a liberal bias shift is reflected in a more unconstrained neural regime (boosted entropy) in frontal regions that is suited to the detection of unpredictable events. Overall EEG variation, spectral power and event-related potentials could not explain this relationship, highlighting that moment-to-moment neural variability uniquely tracks bias shifts. Neural variability modulation through prefrontal cortex appears instrumental for permitting an organism to adapt its biases to environmental demands.

During meiosis, homologous chromosomes pair and recombine, enabling balanced segregation and generating genetic diversity. In many vertebrates, double-strand breaks (DSBs) initiate recombination within hotspots where PRDM9 binds, and deposits H3K4me3 and H3K36me3. However, no protein(s) recognising this unique combination of histone marks have been identified. We identified <i>Zcwpw1</i>, containing H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 recognition domains, as having highly correlated expression with <i>Prdm9</i>. Here, we show that ZCWPW1 has co-evolved with PRDM9 and, in human cells, is strongly and specifically recruited to PRDM9 binding sites, with higher affinity than sites possessing H3K4me3 alone. Surprisingly, ZCWPW1 also recognises CpG dinucleotides. Male <i>Zcwpw1</i> knockout mice show completely normal DSB positioning, but persistent DMC1 foci, severe DSB repair and synapsis defects, and downstream sterility. Our findings suggest ZCWPW1 recognition of PRDM9-bound sites at DSB hotspots is critical for synapsis, and hence fertility.

Biological agents adapt behavior to support the survival needs of the individual and the species. In this review we outline the anatomical, physiological, and computational processes that support reinforcement learning (RL). We describe two circuits in the primate brain that are linked to specific aspects of learning and goal-directed behavior. The ventral circuit, that includes the amygdala, ventral medial prefrontal cortex, and ventral striatum, has substantial connectivity with the hypothalamus.

Past studies have employed the subjective experience of decision time (Libets W) as an index of consciousness, marking the moment at which the agent first becomes aware of a decision.   In the current study, we examined whether the temporal experience of W affects subsequent experience related to the action.   Specifically, we tested whether W influenced the perception of difficulty in a decision-making task, hypothesizing that temporal awareness of W might influence the sense of difficulty.     Consistent with our predictions, when W was perceived as early or late, participants subsequently rated the decision difficulty to be easy or difficult, respectively (Exp.1).   Further investigation showed that perceived difficulty, however, did not influence W (Exp.2).   Together, our findings suggest a unidirectional relationship such that W plays a role in the metacognition of difficulty evaluation.   The results imply that subjective temporal experience of decision time modifies the consequential sense of difficulty.

Autism has been characterised by different behavioural and cognitive profiles compared to typically developing (TD) individuals, and increasingly these differences have been associated with differences in structural and functional brain connectivity. It is currently unknown as to whether autistic and TD listeners process music in the same way: emotionally, mnemonically, and perceptually. The present study explores the brain's dynamical landscape linked to music familiarity in an fMRI dataset from autistic and TD individuals. Group analysis using leading eigenvector dynamics analysis (LEiDA) revealed significantly higher probability of occurrence of a brain network in TD compared to autistic individuals during listening to familiar music. This network includes limbic and paralimbic areas (amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and temporal pole). No significant differences were found between autistic and TD individuals while listening to a scrambled, i.e. unfamiliar and more unpredictable, version of the same music track. These findings provide novel neuroimaging insights into how autistic prediction monitoring may shape brain networks during listening to familiar musical excerpts.

The forebrain hemispheres are predominantly separated during embryogenesis by the interhemispheric fissure (IHF). Radial astroglia remodel the IHF to form a continuous substrate between the hemispheres for midline crossing of the corpus callosum (CC) and hippocampal commissure (HC). DCC and NTN1 are molecules that have an evolutionarily conserved function in commissural axon guidance. The CC and HC are absent in Dcc and Ntn1 knockout mice, while other commissures are only partially affected, suggesting an additional aetiology in forebrain commissure formation. Here, we find that these molecules play a critical role in regulating astroglial development and IHF remodelling during CC and HC formation. Human subjects with DCC mutations display disrupted IHF remodelling associated with CC and HC malformations. Thus, axon guidance molecules such as DCC and NTN1 first regulate the formation of a midline substrate for dorsal commissures prior to their role in regulating axonal growth and guidance across it.

A bitter substance induces specific orofacial and somatic behavioral reactions such as gapes in mice as well as monkeys and humans. These reactions have been proposed to represent affective disgust, and therefore, understanding the neuronal basis of the reactions would pave the way to understand affective disgust. It is crucial to identify and access the specific neuronal ensembles that are activated by bitter substances, such as quinine, the intake of which induces disgust reactions. However, the method to access the quinine-activated neurons has not been fully established yet. Here, we show evidence that a targeted recombination in active populations (TRAP) method, induces genetic recombination in the quinine-activated neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). CeA is one of the well-known emotional centers of the brain. We found that the intraoral quinine infusion, that resulted in disgust reactions, increased both cFos-positive cells and Arc-positive cells in the CeA. By using Arc-CreER;Ai3 TRAP mice, we induced genetic recombination in the quinine-activated neurons and labelled them with fluorescent protein. We confirmed that the quinine-TRAPed fluorescently-labelled cells preferentially coexpressed Arc after quinine infusion. Our results suggest that the TRAP method can be used to access specific functional neurons in the CeA.

Sleep loss profoundly disrupts consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memory. To better characterize effects of learning and sleep loss on the hippocampal circuit, we quantified activity-dependent phosphorylation of ribosomal subunit S6 (pS6) across the dorsal hippocampus of mice. We find that pS6 in enhanced in the dentate gyrus (DG) following single-trial contextual fear conditioning (CFC), but is reduced throughout the hippocampus after brief sleep deprivation (SD), a manipulation which disrupts contextual fear memory (CFM) consolidation. To characterize cell populations with activity affected by SD, we used translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP)-seq to identify cell type-specific transcripts on pS6 ribosomes after SD vs. sleep. Cell type-specific enrichment analysis (CSEA) of these transcripts revealed that hippocampal somatostatin-expressing (Sst+) interneurons, and cholinergic and orexinergic inputs to hippocampus, are selectively activated after SD. We used TRAP targeted to hippocampal Sst+ interneurons to identify cellular mechanisms mediating SD-driven Sst+ interneuron activation. We next used pharmacogenetics to mimic the effects of SD, selectively activating hippocampal Sst+ interneurons while mice slept in the hours following CFC. We find that activation of Sst+ interneurons is sufficient to disrupt CFM consolidation, by gating activity in surrounding pyramidal neurons. Pharmacogenetic inhibition of cholinergic input to hippocampus from the medial septum (MS) promoted CFM consolidation and disinhibited neurons in the DG, increasing pS6 expression. This suggests that state-dependent gating of DG activity is mediated by cholinergic input during SD. Together these data provide evidence for an inhibitory gate on hippocampal information processing, which is activated by sleep loss.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.02.232462v1?rss=1">The cell-autonomous clock of VIP receptor VPAC2 cells drives circadian behaviour</a></h4>

Circadian (~daily) rhythms pervade mammalian behaviour. They are generated by cell-autonomous, transcriptional/translational feedback loops (TTFL), active in all tissues. This distributed clock network is co-ordinated by the principal circadian pacemaker, the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Its robust and accurate time-keeping arises from circuit-level interactions that bind its individual cellular clocks into a coherent time-keeper. Cells that express the neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) mediate retinal entrainment of the SCN, and in the absence of VIP, or its cognate receptor VPAC2, circadian behaviour is compromised because SCN cells cannot synchronise. The contributions to SCN pacemaking and circadian behaviour of other cell types, not least the VPAC2-expressing target cells of VIP, are, however, not understood. We therefore employed intersectional genetics to manipulate the cell-autonomous TTFL of VPAC2-expressing cells, creating temporally chimaeric mice. We could then determine whether and how VPAC2-expressing cells (a minority ~35% of SCN cells) contribute to SCN time-keeping. Lengthening of the intrinsic TTFL period of VPAC2 cells by deletion of the CK1{varepsilon}Tau allele concomitantly lengthened the period of circadian behavioural rhythms. It also increased the variability of the circadian period of bioluminescent TTFL rhythms in SCN slices recorded ex vivo. Abrogation of circadian competence in VPAC2 cells by deletion of Bmal1 severely disrupted circadian behavioural rhythms and compromised TTFL time-keeping in the corresponding SCN slices. Thus, VPAC2-expressing cells are a distinct, functionally powerful subset of the SCN circuit, contributing to computation of ensemble period and maintenance of circadian robustness. These findings extend our understanding of SCN circuit topology.

Many major neuropsychiatric pathologies, some of which appear in adolescence, show differentiated prevalence, onset, and symptomatology across the biological sexes. Therefore, mapping differences in brain structure between males and females during this critical developmental period may provide information about the neural mechanisms underlying the dimorphism of these pathologies. Utilizing a large dataset collected through the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study, we investigated the differences of adolescent (9-10 years old) male and female brains (n = 8325) by using a linear Support-Vector Machine Classifier to predict sex based on morphometry and image intensity values of structural brain imaging data. The classifier correctly classified the sex of 86% individuals with the insula, the precentral and postcentral gyri, and the pericallosal sulcus as the most discernable features. The role of these significant dimorphic features in psychopathology was explored by testing them as mediators between sex and clinical symptomology. The results demonstrate the existence of morphometrical brain markers of sex difference.

The neuropeptide PACAP, acting as a co-transmitter, increases neuronal excitability, which may enhance anxiety and arousal associated with threat conveyed by multiple sensory modalities. The distribution of neurons expressing PACAP and its receptor, PAC1, throughout the mouse nervous system was determined, in register with expression of glutamatergic and GABAergic neuronal markers, to develop a coherent chemoanatomical picture of PACAP role in brain motor responses to sensory input. A circuit role for PACAP was tested by observing fos activation of brain neurons after olfactory threat cue in wild type and PACAP knockout mice. Neuronal activation, and behavioral response, were blunted in PACAP knock-out mice, accompanied by sharply down-regulated vesicular transporter expression in both GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons expressing PACAP and its receptor. This report signals a new perspective on the role of neuropeptide signaling in supporting excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in the nervous system within functionally coherent polysynaptic circuits.

Background: There are clinically relevant sex differences in acute and chronic pain mechanisms, but we are only beginning to understand their mechanistic basis. Transcriptome analyses of rodent whole dorsal root ganglion (DRG) have revealed sex differences, mostly in immune cells. We examined the transcriptome and translatome of the mouse DRG with the goal of identifying sex differences. Methods: We used Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP) sequencing and behavioral pharmacology to test the hypothesis that nociceptor (Nav1.8 expressing neurons) translatomes would differ by sex. Results: We found 66 genes whose mRNA were sex-differentially bound to nociceptor ribosomes. Many of these genes have known neuronal functions but have not been explored in sex differences in pain. We focused on Ptgds, which was increased in female mice. The mRNA encodes the prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) synthesizing enzyme. We observed increased Ptgds protein and PGD2 in female mouse DRG. The Ptgds inhibitor AT-56 caused intense pain behaviors in male mice but was only effective at high doses in females. Conversely, female mice responded more robustly to another major prostaglandin, PGE2, than did male mice. Ptgds protein expression was also higher in female cortical neurons, suggesting DRG findings may be generalizable to other nervous system structures. Conclusions: Nociceptor TRAP sequencing (TRAP-seq) reveals unexpected sex differences in one of the oldest known nociceptive signaling molecule families, the prostaglandins. Our results demonstrate that translatome analysis reveals physiologically relevant sex differences important for fundamental protective behaviors driven by nociceptors.

Hemodynamic signals in the brain are used as surrogates of neural activity, but how these hemodynamic signals depend on arousal state is poorly understood. Here, we monitored neural activity and hemodynamic signals in un-anesthetized, head-fixed mice to understand how sleep and awake states impact cerebral hemodynamics. In parallel with electrophysiological recordings, we used intrinsic optical signal imaging to measure bilateral changes in cerebral hemoglobin ([HbT]), and two-photon laser scanning microscopy (2PLSM) to measure dilations of individual arterioles. We concurrently monitored body motion, whisker movement, muscle EMG, cortical LFP, and hippocampal LFP to classify the arousal state of the mouse into awake, NREM sleep, or REM sleep. We found that mice invariably fell asleep during imaging, and these sleep states were interspersed with periods of awake. During both NREM and REM sleep, mice showed large increases in [HbT] relative to the awake state, showing increase in hemoglobin and arteriole diameter two to five times larger than those seen in response to sensory stimulation. During NREM sleep, the amplitude of bilateral low-frequency oscillations in [HbT] increased markedly, and coherency between neural activity and hemodynamic signals was higher than the awake resting and REM states. Bilateral correlations in neural activity and [HbT] were highest during NREM sleep, and lowest in the awake state. Our results show that hemodynamic signals in the cortex are strongly modulated by arousal state, with hemodynamic changes during sleep being substantially larger than sensory-evoked responses. These results underscore the critical importance of behavioral monitoring during studies of spontaneous activity, as sleep-related hemodynamics dominate measures of neurovascular coupling and functional connectivity.

Everyday tasks such as catching a ball appear effortless, but in fact require complex interactions and tight temporal coordination between the brain's visual and motor systems. What makes such interceptive actions particularly impressive is the capacity of the brain to account for temporal delays in the central nervous system - a limitation that can be mitigated by making predictions about the environment as well as one's own actions. Here, we wanted to assess how well human participants can plan an upcoming movement based on a dynamic, predictable stimulus that is not the target of action. A central stationary or rotating stimulus determined the probability that each of two potential targets would be the eventual target of a rapid reach-to-touch movement. We examined the extent to which reach movement trajectories convey internal predictions about the future state of dynamic probabilistic information conveyed by the rotating stimulus. We show that movement trajectories reflect the target probabilities determined at movement onset, suggesting that humans rapidly and accurately integrate visuospatial predictions and estimates of their own reaction times to effectively guide action.

Placebo analgesia is hypothesized to involve top-down engagement of prefrontal regions that access endogenous pain inhibiting opioid pathways. Fibromyalgia (FM) patients have neuroanatomical and neurochemical alterations in pathways relevant to placebo analgesia. Thus, it remains unclear whether placebo analgesic mechanisms would differ in FM patients compared to healthy controls (HCs). Here, using placebo-analgesia-inducing paradigms that included verbal suggestions and conditioning manipulations, we examined whether behavioral and neural placebo analgesic responses differed between 32 FM patients and 46 age- and sex- matched HCs. Participants underwent a manipulation scan, where noxious high and low heat were paired with the control and placebo cream, respectively, and a placebo experimental scan with equal noxious heat temperatures. Before the experimental scan, each participant received saline or naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist. Across all participants, the placebo condition decreased pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings, decreased activity within the right insula and bilateral secondary somatosensory cortex, and modulated the Neurologic Pain Signature. There were no differences between HCs and FM patients in pain intensity ratings or neural responses during the placebo condition. Despite the perceptual and neural effects of the placebo manipulation, prefrontal circuitry was not activated during the expectation period and the placebo analgesia was unaltered by naloxone, suggesting placebo effects were driven more by conditioning than expectation. Together, these findings suggest that placebo analgesia can occur in both HCs and chronic pain FM patients, without the involvement of opiodergic prefrontal modulatory networks.

Major Depression (MD) is the most prevalent psychiatric disease in the population and is considered a prodromal stage of the Alzheimer s disease (AD). Despite both diseases having a robust genetic component, the common transcriptomic signature remains unknown. In this regard, we investigated the cognitive and emotional responses in 3- and 6-month-old in APP/PSEN1-Tg mutant mice, before beta-amyloid plaques were detected. Then, we studied the deregulation of genes and pathways in prefrontal cortex, striatum, hippocampus and amygdala, using transcriptomic and functional data analysis. The results demonstrated that depressive-like and anxiety-like behaviours, as well as memory impairments are already present at 3-month-old together with the deregulation of several genes and gene sets, including components of the circadian rhythms, electronic transport chain and neurotransmission. Finally, DisGeNET GSEA provides translational support for common depregulated gene sets related to MD and AD. Altogether, the results demonstrate that MD could be an early manifestation of AD.

Communication between neurons relies on the release of diverse neurotransmitters, which represent a key-defining feature of a neuron's chemical and functional identity. Neurotransmitters are packaged into vesicles by specific vesicular transporters. However, tools for labeling and imaging synaptic vesicles based on their neurochemical identity remain limited. We developed a genetically encoded probe to identify glutamatergic synaptic vesicles at the levels of both light and electron microscopy (EM) by fusing the mini singlet oxygen generator (miniSOG) probe to an intra-lumenal loop of the vesicular glutamate transporter-2. We then used a 3D imaging method, serial block face scanning EM, combined with a deep learning approach for automatic segmentation of labeled synaptic vesicles to assess the subcellular distribution of transporter-defined vesicles at nanometer scale. These tools represent a new resource for accessing the subcellular structure and molecular machinery of neurotransmission and for transmitter-defined tracing of neuronal connectivity.

Background: In human tauopathies, pathological aggregation of misfolded/unfolded proteins particularly microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT, tau) is considered to be essential mechanisms that trigger the induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Here we assessed the molecular effects of natural antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) in human tauR406W (htau)-induced ER unfolded protein response (ERUPR) in the young and older flies. Methods: In order to reduce htau neurotoxicity during brain development, we used a transgenic model of tauopathy where the maximum toxicity was observed in adult flies. Then, the effects of ALA (0.001, 0.005, and 0.025% w/w of diet) in htau-induced ERUPR in the ages 20 and 30 days were evaluated. Results: Data from expression (mRNA and protein) patterns of htau, analysis of eyes external morphology as well as larvae olfactory memory were confirmed our tauopathy model. Moreover, expression of ERUPR-related proteins involving activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), inositol regulating enzyme 1 (IRE1), and protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) were upregulated and locomotor function decreased in both ages of the model flies. Remarkably, the lower dose of ALA modified ERUPR and supported the reduction of behavioral deficits in youngest adults through enhancement of GRP87/Bip, reduction of ATF6, downregulation of PERK-ATF4 pathway, and activation of the IRE1-XBP1 pathway. On the other hand, only a higher dose of ALA was able to affect the ERUPR via moderation of PERK-ATF4 signaling in the oldest adults. As ALA exerts their higher protective effects on the locomotor function of younger adults when htauR406W expressed in all neurons (htau-elav) and mushroom body neurons (htau-ok), we proposed that ALA has age-dependent effects in this model. Conclusion: Taken together, based on our results we conclude that aging potentially influences the ALA effective dose and mechanism of action on tau-induced ERUPR. Further molecular studies will warrant possible therapeutic applications of ALA in age-related tauopathies.

synuclein aggregation at the synapse is an early event in Parkinson disease and is associated with impaired striatal synaptic function and dopaminergic neuronal death. The cysteine string protein (CSP) and synuclein have partially overlapping roles in maintaining synaptic function and mutations in each cause neurodegenerative diseases. CSP is a member of the DNAJ/HSP40 family of co-chaperones and like synuclein, chaperones the SNARE complex assembly and neurotransmitter release. synuclein can rescue neurodegeneration in CSP KO mice. However, whether synuclein aggregation alters CSP expression and function is unknown. Here we show that synuclein aggregation at the synapse induces a decrease in synaptic CSP and a reduction in the complexes that CSP forms with HSC70 and STGa. We further show that viral delivery of CSP rescues in vitro the impaired vesicle recycling in PC12 cells with synuclein aggregates and in vivo reduces synaptic synuclein aggregates restoring normal dopamine release in 1-120hsyn mice. These novel findings reveal a mechanism by which synuclein aggregation alters CSP at the synapse, and show that CSP rescues synuclein aggregation-related phenotype in 1-120hsyn mice similar to the effect of synuclein in CSP KO mice. These results implicate CSP as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of early-stage Parkinson disease.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.31.228866v1?rss=1">Respiration and brain neural dynamics associated with interval timing during odor fear learning in rats</a></h4>

In fear conditioning, where a conditioned stimulus predicts the arrival of an aversive stimulus, the animal encodes the time interval between the two stimuli. Freezing, the most used index to assess learned fear, lacks the temporal resolution required to investigate interval timing at the early stages of learning. Here we monitored respiration to visualize anticipatory behavioral responses in an odor fear conditioning in rats, while recording theta (5-15Hz) and gamma (40-80Hz) brain oscillatory activities in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), basolateral amygdala (BLA), dorsomedial striatum (DMS) and olfactory piriform cortex (PIR). We investigated the temporal patterns of respiration frequency and of theta and gamma activity power during the odor-shock interval. We found that akin to respiration patterns, theta temporal curves were modulated by the duration of the odor-shock interval in the four recording sites, and respected scalar property in mPFC and DMS. In contrast, gamma temporal curves were modulated by the interval duration only in the mPFC, and in a manner that did not respect scalar property. This suggests a preferential role for theta rhythm in interval timing. In addition, our data bring the novel idea that the respiratory rhythm might take part in the setting of theta activity dynamics.

Recognizing the neural patterns underlying different brain functions is essential to achieve a more comprehensive view on how small sets of neurons organize in complex 3D networks to determine different behaviours. In this framework optogenetic techniques have been successfully proven as a powerful tool to control brain functions achieving millisecond temporal resolution and cell-type specificity, by combining the use of light-gated opsins and ad-hoc light delivery optoelectronic devices. However, targeting small brain volumes with simultaneous electrical recording results in the introduction of photoelectric artefacts, in particular when light emission and recoding sites are very close one to each other. In this work we take advantage of the photonic properties of tapered fibers to present a fully integrated fibertrode to target small brain volumes with abated photoelectric noise. The device hosts a light emitting window just below a recording pad, and exploits the angled light emission from the window to achieve simultaneous activation and electrical readout of small groups of cells with no photoelectric artifacts in vivo. Despite the highly non-planar surface of the fiber taper, window size, shape and the impedance of the electrode can be modulated by controlling the fabrication parameters during focused ion beam milling and deposition, thus resulting in a versatile, integrated and customizable optogenetic tool for neurobiology studies in closed-loop configuration over small brain volumes.

<p>Ultrasonic neuromodulation of peripheral nerve cells.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Satisfactory treatment of peripheral nerve injury (PNI) faces difficulties owing to the intrinsic biological barriers in larger injuries and invasive surgical interventions. Injury gaps &gt;3 cm have low chances of full motor and sensory recovery, and the unmet need for PNI repair techniques which increase the likelihood of functional recovery while limiting invasiveness motivate this work. Building upon prior work in ultrasound stimulation (US) of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, the effects of US on DRG neuron and Schwann cell (SC) cocultures were investigated to uncover the role of SCs in mediating the neuronal response to US <i>in vitro </i>. Acoustic intensity‐dependent alteration in selected neuromorphometrics of DRG neurons in coculture with SCs was observed in total outgrowth, primary neurites, and length compared to previously reported DRG monoculture in a calcium‐independent manner. SC viability and proliferation were not impacted by US. Conditioned medium studies suggest secreted factors from SCs subjected to US impact DRG neuron morphology. These findings advance the current understanding of mechanisms by which these cell types respond to US, which may lead to new noninvasive US therapies for treating PNI.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25862?af=R">Alertness Training Improves Spatial Bias and Functional Ability in Spatial Neglect</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We conducted a multi‐site, randomized, double‐blinded controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of a digital health intervention targeting the intrinsic regulation of goal‐directed alertness in patients with chronic hemispatial neglect.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Forty‐nine participants with hemispatial neglect that demonstrated significant spatially biased attention following acquired brain injury were randomly assigned to the experimental attention remediation treatment or active control group. The participants engaged with the remotely administered interventions for twelve weeks. The primary outcome was spatial bias on the Posner cueing task (response time difference: left – right target trials). Secondary outcomes included functional abilities (measured via the Catherine Bergego scale and Barthel index), spatial cognition, executive function, quality of life and sleep. Assessments were conducted prior to and immediately following participation in the experimental intervention or control condition, and again after a three‐month no contact period.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared with the active control group, the intervention group exhibited a significant improvement in the primary outcome—a reduction in spatially biased attention on the Posner cueing task (p=0.010, Cohen’s d=0.96)—as well as significant improvements in functional abilities as measured on the Catherine Bergego and Barthel indices (p=0.027, Cohen’s d=0.24).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results demonstrate that our attention training program was effective in improving the debilitating attention deficits common to hemispatial neglect. This benefit generalized to improvements in real‐world functional abilities. This safe, highly scalable and self‐administered treatment for hemispatial neglect may serve as a useful addition to the existing standard of care.</p>

<p>Anti‐IgLON5 disease is a neurological disorder characterized by autoantibodies against IgLON5 and pathological evidence of neuronal‐specific tau accumulation. Here we report that patients' IgLON5 IgG, but not other cell‐surface antibodies, disrupt the cytoskeletal organization in cultured rat hippocampal neurons resulting in dystrophic neurites and axonal swelling. Adsorption of IgLON5 IgG with HEK293 cells expressing IgLON5 abrogated the indicated cytoskeletal changes. These findings along an increase of levels of neurofilaments in patients' CSF suggest that IgLON5 IgG, unlike other cell‐surface antibodies, disrupt neuronal cytoskeleton maintenance providing a link between autoimmunity and neurodegeneration.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Millions suffer a traumatic brain injury (TBI) each year wherein the outcomes associated with injury can vary greatly between individuals. This study postulates that variations in each biomechanical parameter of a head trauma lead to differences in histological and behavioral outcome measures that should be considered collectively in assessing injury. While trauma severity typically scales with the magnitude of injury, much less is known about the effects of rate and duration of the mechanical insult. In this study, a newly developed voice‐coil fluid percussion injury system was used to investigate the effects of injury rate and fluid percussion impulse on a collection of post‐injury outcomes in male rats. Collectively the data suggest a potential shift in the specificity and progression of neuronal injury and function rather than a general scaling of injury severity. While a faster, shorter fluid percussion first presents as a mild TBI, neuronal loss and some behavioral tasks were similar among the slower and faster fluid percussion injuries. This study concludes that the sequelae of neuronal degeneration and behavioral outcomes are related to the complete temporal profile of the fluid percussion and do not scale only with peak pressure.</p>

Neurons in the prefrontal cortex are typically activated by multiple factors when performing a cognitive task, and by different tasks altogether. The selectivity of single neurons for the same stimulus dimension often changes depending on context or task performed, a phenomenon known as nonlinear mixed selectivity. It has been hypothesized that neurons with such mixed selectivity offer a computational advantage for performing cognitive tasks due to high-dimensional neural representations. In this study, we sought to determine how nonlinear mixed selectivity is affected by training to perform a cognitive task by examining the neural responses of monkeys before and after they were trained to perform visual working memory tasks. We also compared nonlinear mixed selectivity in different sub-regions of the prefrontal cortex that play different roles in these tasks. Our findings indicate that a small population of prefrontal neurons exhibit nonlinear mixed selectivity even prior to any training to perform cognitive tasks. Learning to perform working memory tasks induces a modest increase in the proportion of neurons with both linear and non-linear mixed selectivity. However, we saw little evidence that nonlinear mixed selectivity is predictive of task performance. Our results provide insights on the representation of stimulus and task information in neuronal populations.

For normal cochlear function, outer hair cells (OHCs) require a precise regulation of intracellular Ca2+ levels. Influx of Ca2+ occurs both at the stereocillia tips and through the basolateral membrane. In this latter compartment, two different origins for Ca2+ influx have been poorly explored: voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCC) at synapses with type II afferent neurons, and 910 cholinergic nicotinic receptors at synapses with medio-olivochlear complex (MOC) neurons. Using functional imaging, we report that these two Ca2+ entry sites are closely positioned, but present different regulation mechanisms. Ca2+ spread from MOC synapses is contained by cisternal Ca2+-ATPases. Considered a weak drive for transmitter release, we found that VGCC Ca2+ signals are larger than expected and can be potentiated by ryanodine receptors. Finally, we showed that sorcin, a highly expressed gene product in OHCs with reported Ca2+ control function in cardiomyocytes, regulates basal Ca2+ levels and MOC synaptic activity in OHCs.

Information processing in the brain is controlled by quantal release of glutamate, a tightly regulated process. Even in a single axon, presynaptic boutons differ in the number of docked vesicles, but it is not known if the vesicular release probability (pves) is homogenous or variable between individual boutons. We optically measured evoked transmitter release at individual Schaffer collateral synapses using the genetically encoded glutamate sensor iGluSnFR, localizing the fusion site on the bouton with high spatiotemporal precision. Fitting a binomial model to measured response amplitude distributions allowed us to extract the quantal parameters n, pves, and q. Schaffer collateral boutons typically released only a single vesicle under low pves conditions and switched to multivesicular release in high calcium saline. We found that pves was highly variable between individual boutons and had a dominant impact on presynaptic output.

The connection between stimulus perception and time perception remains unknown. The present study combines human and rat psychophysics with sensory cortical neuronal firing to construct a computational model for the percept of elapsed time embedded within sense of touch. When subjects judged the duration of a vibration applied to the fingertip (human) or whiskers (rat), increasing stimulus mean speed led to increasing perceived duration. Symmetrically, increasing vibration duration led to increasing perceived intensity. We modeled spike trains from vibrissal somatosensory cortex as input to dual leaky integrators - an intensity integrator with short time constant and a duration integrator with long time constant -generating neurometric functions that replicated the actual psychophysical functions of rats. Returning to human psychophysics, we then confirmed specific predictions of the dual leaky integrator model. This study offers a framework, based on sensory coding and subsequent accumulation of sensory drive, to account for how a feeling of the passage of time accompanies the tactile sensory experience.

Palm trees are of immense economic, sociocultural, touristic and patrimonial significance all over the world, and date palm-related knowledge, traditions and practices are now included in UNESCOs list of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Of all the pests that infest these trees, the red palm weevil (RPW), Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Olivier) is its primary enemy. The RPW is a category-1 quarantine insect pest that causes enormous economic losses in the cultivation of palm trees worldwide. The RPW synchronizes mass gathering on the palm tree for feeding and mating, regulated by a male-produced pheromone composed of two methyl-branched compounds, (4RS,5RS)-4-methylnonan-5-ol (ferrugineol) and 4(RS)-methylnonan-5-one (ferrugineone). Despite the importance of odorant detection in long-range orientation towards palm trees, palm colonization and mating, nothing regarding the molecular mechanisms of pheromone detection in this species is known. In this study, we report the identification and characterization of the first RPW pheromone receptor, RferOR1. Using gene silencing and functional expression in Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons, we demonstrate that RferOR1 is tuned to both ferrugineol and ferrugineone and binds five other structurally related molecules. We reveal the lifetime expression of RferOR1, which correlates with adult mating success irrespective of age, a factor that could explain the wide distribution and spread of this pest. As palm weevils are challenging to control based on conventional methods, elucidation of the mechanisms of pheromone detection opens new routes for mating disruption and the early detection of this pest via the development of pheromone receptor-based biosensors.

A new family of Genetically Encoded Voltage Indicators (GEVIs) has been developed based on inter-molecular Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). To test the hypothesis that the GEVI, ArcLight, functions via interactions between the fluorescent protein (FP) domain of neighboring probes, the FP of ArcLight was replaced with either a FRET donor or acceptor FP. We discovered relatively large FRET signals only when cells were co-transfected with both the FRET donor and acceptor GEVIs. The intermolecular FRET strategy also works for rhodopsin-based probes potentially improving their flexibility as well. Separating the FRET pair into two distinct proteins has important advantages over intramolecular FRET constructs. First, the signals are larger. Apparently the voltage-induced conformational change moves the two FPs independently thereby increasing the dynamic range. Second, the expression of the FRET donor and acceptor can be restricted independently enabling greater cell type specificity as well as refined subcellular voltage reporting.

Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) have emerged as a new class of drugs to treat a wide range of diseases, including neurological indications. Spinraza, an ASO that modulates splicing of SMN2 RNA, has shown profound disease modifying effects in Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) patients, energizing the field to develop ASOs for other neurological disorders. While SMA specifically affects spinal motor neurons, other disorders affect different central nervous system (CNS) regions, neuronal, and non-neuronal cells. Therefore, it is critically important to characterize ASO distribution and activity in all major CNS structures and cell types to have a better understanding of which neurological diseases are amenable to ASO therapy. Here we present for the first time the atlas of ASO distribution and activity in the CNS of mice, rats, and non-human primates (NHP), species commonly used in preclinical therapeutic development. Following central administration of an ASO to rodents, we observe widespread distribution and robust activity throughout the CNS in neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia. This is also the case in NHP, despite larger CNS volume and more complex neuroarchitecture. Our results demonstrate that ASO drugs are well suited for treating a wide range of neurological diseases for which no effective treatments are available.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Epidemiological studies have pointed at diabetes as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and this has been supported by several studies in animal models of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. However, side‐by‐side comparison of the two types of diabetes is limited. We investigated the role of insulin deficiency and insulin resistance in the development of memory impairments and the effect of Exendin‐4 (Ex4) treatment in a mouse model of AD. Three–4‐month‐old female wild type (WT) mice and mice overexpressing human tau and amyloid precursor protein (TAPP) were injected with streptozotocin (STZ) or fed a high‐fat diet (HFD). A second study was performed in TAPP‐STZ mice treated with Ex4, a long‐lasting analog of GLP‐1. Plasma and brain were collected at study termination for ELISA, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry analysis. Learning and memory deficits were impaired in TAPP transgenic mice compared with WT mice at the end of the study. Deficits were exaggerated by insulin deficiency in TAPP mice but 12 weeks of insulin resistance did not affect memory performances in either WT or TAPP mice. Levels of phosphorylated tau were increased in the brain of WT‐STZ and TAPP‐STZ mice but not in the brain of WT or TAPP mice on HFD. In the TAPP‐STZ mice, treatment with Ex4 initiated after established cognitive deficits ameliorated learning, but not memory, impairments. This was accompanied by the reduction of amyloid β and phosphorylated tau expression. Theses studies support the role of Ex4 in AD, independently from its actions on diabetes.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To explore the role of alpha‐synuclein (αSyn) oligomers and neurofilament light chain (NFL) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as markers of early multiple system atrophy (MSA) and to contrast findings with Lewy body synucleinopathies.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a discovery cohort of well‐characterized early MSA patients (n = 24) and matched healthy controls (CON, n = 14), we utilized enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay to measure NFL and protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) to detect αSyn oligomers in CSF. We confirmed findings in a separate prospectively enrolled cohort of patients with early MSA (n = 38), Parkinson disease (PD, n = 16), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, n = 13), and CON subjects (n = 15).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the discovery cohort, NFL was markedly elevated in MSA patients, with perfect separation from CON. αSyn‐PMCA was nonreactive in all CON, whereas all MSA samples were positive. In the confirmatory cohort, NFL again perfectly separated MSA from CON, and was significantly lower in PD and DLB compared to MSA. PMCA was again nonreactive in all CON, and positive in all but 2 MSA cases. All PD and all but 2 DLB samples were also positive for αSyn aggregates but with markedly different reaction kinetics from MSA; aggregation occurred later, but maximum fluorescence was higher, allowing for perfect separation of reactive samples between MSA and Lewy body synucleinopathies.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>NFL and αSyn oligomers in CSF faithfully differentiate early MSA not only from CON but also from Lewy body synucleinopathies. The findings support the role of these markers as diagnostic biomarkers, and have important implications for understanding pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the synucleinopathies.

<p>Design‐based stereological methods allow the estimation of basic morphological parameters in representative samples of the sectioned central nervous system. Point probes can be used to estimate volume (illustrated for the Area Fraction Fractionator), line probes can be used to estimate surface area (illustrated for a vertical sections design), area probes can be used to estimate length (illustrated for the Spaceball probe), and volume probes must be used to estimate number (illustrated for the Disector). This review provides an introduction to how these methods solve problems associated with other quantitative approaches, how they are applied to histological material, how a sampling scheme can be designed and evaluated, and which practical problems need to be solved to generate the numbers that we will need to come to an understanding of central nervous system function.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Generating numbers has become an almost inevitable task associated with studies of the morphology of the nervous system. Numbers serve a desire for clarity and objectivity in the presentation of results and are a prerequisite for the statistical evaluation of experimental outcomes. Clarity, objectivity, and statistics make demands on the quality of the numbers that are not met by many methods. This review provides a refresher of problems associated with generating numbers that describe the nervous system in terms of the volumes, surfaces, lengths, and numbers of its components. An important aim is to provide comprehensible descriptions of the methods that address these problems. Collectively known as design‐based stereology, these methods share two features critical to their application. First, they are firmly based in mathematics and its proofs. Second and critically underemphasized, an understanding of their mathematical background is not necessary for their informed and productive application. Understanding and applying estimators of volume, surface, length or number does not require more of an organizational mastermind than an immunohistochemical protocol. And when it comes to calculations, square roots are the gravest challenges to overcome. Sampling strategies that are combined with stereological probes are efficient and allow a rational assessment if the numbers that have been generated are “good enough.” Much may be unfamiliar, but very little is difficult. These methods can no longer be scapegoats for discrepant results but faithfully produce numbers on the material that is assessed. They also faithfully reflect problems that associated with the histological material and the anatomically informed decisions needed to generate numbers that are not only valid in theory. It is within reach to generate practically useful numbers that must integrate with qualitative knowledge to understand the function of neural systems.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Small echolocating bats are set apart from most other mammals by their relatively large cerebellum, a feature that has been associated to echolocation, as it is presumed to indicate a relatively enlarged number of neurons in the cerebellum in comparison to other brain structures. Here we quantify the neuronal composition of the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and remaining brain structures of seven species of large Pteropodid bats (formerly classified as megachiropterans), one of which echolocates, and six species of small bats (formerly classified as microchiropterans), all of which echolocate. This chiropteran data is compared to 60 mammalian species in our dataset to determine whether the relatively large cerebellum of the small echolocating bats, and possibly that of the echolocating Pteropodid, contains a relatively enlarged number of neurons. We find no evidence that the distribution of neurons differs between microchiropterans and megachiropterans, but our data indicate that microchiropterans, like the smallest shrew in our dataset, have diminutive cerebral cortices, which makes the cerebellum appear relatively large. We propose that, in agreement with the diminutive brain size of the earliest fossil mammals, this is a plesiomorphic, not a derived, feature of microchiropteran brains. The results of this study also reveal important neural characteristics related to the phylogenetic affinities and relationships of the chiropterans.</p>

<p>Ocular dominance plasticity (ODP) is a type of cortical plasticity operating in visual cortex of mammals that are endowed with binocular vision based on the competition‐driven disparity.</p>
<p>Earlier, a molecular mechanism was proposed that catecholamines play an important role in the maintenance of ODP in kittens. Having survived the initial test, the hypothesis was further advanced to identify noradrenaline (NA) as a key factor that regulates ODP in the immature cortex. Later, the ODP‐promoting effect of NA is extended to the adult with age‐related limitations. Following the enhanced NA availability, the chain events downstream lead to the β‐adrenoreceptor‐induced cAMP accumulation, which in turn activates the protein kinase A. Eventually, the protein kinase translocates to the cell nucleus to activate cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB). CREB is a cellular transcription factor that controls the transcription of various genes, underpinning neuronal plasticity and long‐term memory.</p>
<p>In the advent of molecular genetics in that various types of new tools have become available with relative ease, ODP research has lightly adopted in the rodent model the original concepts and methodologies. Here, after briefly tracing the strategic maturation of our quest, the review moves to the later development of the field, with the emphasis placed around the following issues: 1) Are we testing ODP <i>per s </i>e? 2) What does monocular deprivation deprive of the immature cortex? 3) The critical importance of binocular competition, 4) What is the adult plasticity? 5) Excitation‐Inhibition balance in local circuits, and 6) Species differences in the animal models.</p>

Despite recent advances in tractography, the gap remains wide between the descriptions of white-matter pathways in the literature and the methods to reconstruct and study them from dMRI images. Here, we tackle this challenge by proposing a language to define white matter tracts, namely WMQLT, and a tool to automatically reconstruct pathways from their WMQLT queries. Our method is performant, flexible enough to allow defining tracts using multiple modalities, and allows to extend ROI-based reconstruction methods. Leveraging our language, we define 19 major brain tracts, alongside their subdivisions, and reconstruct them in a large population. We show that the shape of the reconstructed pathways, as well as their connectivity and lateralizations are in accordance with the current neuroanatomical literature. Finally, we showcase our technique in two scenarios: computing the functional subdivisions of a tract, and assessing the role of handedness and gender in the lateralization of language-related tracts.

Speech contains rich acoustic and linguistic information. During speech comprehension, cortical activity tracks the acoustic envelope of speech. Recent studies also observe cortical tracking of higher-level linguistic units, such as words and phrases, using synthesized speech deprived of delta-band acoustic envelope. It remains unclear, however, how cortical activity jointly encodes the acoustic and linguistic information in natural speech. Here, we investigate the neural encoding of words and demonstrate that delta-band cortical activity tracks the rhythm of multi-syllabic words when naturally listening to narratives. Furthermore, by dissociating the word rhythm from acoustic envelope, we find cortical activity primarily tracks the word rhythm during speech comprehension. When listeners attention is diverted, however, neural tracking of words diminishes, and delta-band activity becomes phase locked to the acoustic envelope. These results suggest that large-scale cortical dynamics in the delta band are primarily coupled to the rhythm of linguistic units during natural speech comprehension.

Alzheimers disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease defined by the presence of amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles, and driven by dysproteostatis, inflammation, metabolic dysfunction, and oxidative injury, eventually leading to synapse loss and cell death. Synapse loss correlates with cognitive impairment and may occur independently of the extent of AD pathology. To understand how synaptic composition is changed in relation to AD neuropathology and cognition, highly sensitive multiplexed liquid chromatography mass-spectrometry was used to quantify biochemically enriched synaptic proteins from the parietal association cortex of 100 subjects with contrasting AD pathology and cognitive performance. Functional analysis showed preservation of synaptic signaling, ion transport, and mitochondrial proteins in normal aged and "resilient" (cognitively unimpaired with AD pathology) individuals. Compared to these individuals, those with cognitive impairment showed significant metabolic differences and increased immune- and inflammatory-related proteins, establishing the synapse as a potential integration point for multiple AD pathophysiologies.

Surroundings continually propagate audiovisual (AV) signals, and by attending we make clear and precise sense of those that matter at any given time. In such cases, parallel visual and auditory contributions may jointly serve as a basis for selection. It is unclear what hierarchical effects arise when initial selection criteria are unimodal, or involve uncertainty. Uncertainty in sensory information is a factor considered in computational models of attention proposing precision weighting as a primary mechanism for selection. The effects of visuospatial selection on auditory processing were investigated here with electroencephalography (EEG). We examined the encoding of random tone pips probabilistically associated to spatially-attended visual changes, via a temporal response function model (TRF) of the auditory EEG timeseries. AV precision, or temporal uncertainty, was manipulated across stimuli while participants sustained endogenous visuospatial attention. TRF data showed that cross-modal modulations were dominated by AV precision between auditory and visual onset times. The roles of unimodal (visuospatial and auditory) uncertainties, each a consequence of non-synchronous AV presentations, were further investigated. The TRF data demonstrated that visuospatial uncertainty in attended sector size determines transfer effects by enabling the visual priming of tones when relevant for auditory segregation, in line with top-down processing timescales. Auditory uncertainty in distractor proportion, on the other hand, determined susceptibility of early tone encoding to automatic change by incoming visual update processing. The findings provide a hierarchical account of the role of uni- and cross-modal sources of uncertainty on the neural encoding of sound dynamics in a multimodal attention task.

High levels of heterozygosity present a unique genome assembly challenge and can adversely impact downstream analyses, yet is common in sequencing datasets obtained from non-model organisms. Here we show that by re-assembling a heterozygous dataset with variant parameters and different assembly algorithms, we are able to generate assemblies whose protein annotations are statistically enriched for specific gene ontology categories. While total assembly length was not significantly affected by assembly methodologies tested, the assemblies generated varied widely in fragmentation level and we show local assembly collapse or expansion underlying the enrichment or depletion of specific protein functional groups. We show that these statistically significant deviations in gene ontology groups can occur in seemingly high-quality assemblies, and result from difficult-to-detect local sequence expansion or contractions. Given the unpredictable interplay between assembly algorithm, parameter, and biological sequence data heterozygosity, we highlight the need for better measures of assembly quality than N50 value, including methods for assessing local expansion and collapse.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UOVWOmeRqLQ" width="1" />

<p>by Samy Castro, Wael El-Deredy, Demian Battaglia, Patricio Orio</p>

The capability of cortical regions to flexibly sustain an “ignited” state of activity has been discussed in relation to conscious perception or hierarchical information processing. Here, we investigate how the intrinsic propensity of different regions to get ignited is determined by the specific topological organisation of the structural connectome. More specifically, we simulated the resting-state dynamics of mean-field whole-brain models and assessed how dynamic multi-stability and ignition differ between a reference model embedding a realistic human connectome, and alternative models based on a variety of randomised connectome ensembles. We found that the strength of global excitation needed to first trigger ignition in a subset of regions is substantially smaller for the model embedding the empirical human connectome. Furthermore, when increasing the strength of excitation, the propagation of ignition outside of this initial core–which is able to self-sustain its high activity–is way more gradual than for any of the randomised connectomes, allowing for graded control of the number of ignited regions. We explain both these assets in terms of the exceptional weighted core-shell organisation of the empirical connectome, speculating that this topology of human structural connectivity may be attuned to support enhanced ignition dynamics.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uuJ9kZWwaLk" width="1" />

One of the earliest and most prevalent barriers to successful reproduction is polyspermy, or fertilization of an egg by multiple sperm. To prevent these supernumerary fertilizations, eggs have evolved multiple mechanisms. It has recently been proposed that zinc released by mammalian eggs at fertilization may block additional sperm from entering. Here, we demonstrate that eggs from amphibia and teleost fish also release zinc. Using <i>Xenopus laevis</i> as a model, we document that zinc reversibly blocks fertilization. Finally, we demonstrate that extracellular zinc similarly disrupts early embryonic development in eggs from diverse phyla, including Cnidaria, Echinodermata, and Chordata. Our study reveals that a fundamental strategy protecting human eggs from fertilization by multiple sperm may have evolved more than 650 million years ago.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/sYhQr72cKJU" width="1" />

The temporal association cortex is considered a primate specialization and is involved in complex behaviors, with some, such as language, particularly characteristic of humans. The emergence of these behaviors has been linked to major differences in temporal lobe white matter in humans compared with monkeys. It is unknown, however, how the organization of the temporal lobe differs across several anthropoid primates. Therefore, we systematically compared the organization of the major temporal lobe white matter tracts in the human, gorilla, and chimpanzee great apes and in the macaque monkey. We show that humans and great apes, in particular the chimpanzee, exhibit an expanded and more complex occipital–temporal white matter system; additionally, in humans, the invasion of dorsal tracts into the temporal lobe provides a further specialization. We demonstrate the reorganization of different tracts along the primate evolutionary tree, including distinctive connectivity of human temporal gray matter.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/cbbjsGCW4V0" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00045">Role of Ginkgolides in the Inflammatory Immune Response of Neurological Diseases: A Review of Current Literatures</a></h4>

<p>The inflammatory immune response (IIR) is a physiological or excessive systemic response, induced by inflammatory immune cells according to changes in the internal and external environments. An excessive IIR is the pathological basis for the generation and development of neurological diseases. Ginkgolides are one of the important medicinal ingredients in Ginkgo biloba. Many studies have verified that ginkgolides have anti-platelet-activating, anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidative, neurotrophic, and neuroimmunomodulatory effects. Inflammatory immunomodulation is mediated by inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways.

Objective<p>To investigate the impact of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-related risk gene (ATP-binding cassette A7-ABCA7 and Clusterin-CLU) on the functional connectivity pattern of default mode network (DMN) in healthy middle-age adults.</p>Methods<p>A total of 147 healthy middle-aged volunteers were enrolled in this study. All subjects completed MRI scans, neuropsychological assessments, and AD-related genotyped analysis. All subjects were divided into high, middle and low risk groups according to the score of risk genotypes, which included CLU (rs11136000, rs2279590, rs9331888, and rs9331949) and ABCA7 (rs3764650 and rs4147929). The genetic effects of CLU, ABCA7, and CLU × ABCA7 on DMN functional connectivity pattern were further explored. Moreover, the genetic effect of Apolipoprotein ε4 (APOEε4) was also considered. Finally, correlation analysis was performed between the signals of brain regions with genetic effect and neuropsychological test scores.</p>Results<p>Compared with the low-risk group, the high-risk group of CLU showed decreased functional connectivity in posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the left middle frontal cortex (P &lt; 0.05, GRF correction). As for the interaction between the CLU and ABCA7, all the subjects were divided into high, middle, and low risk group; the middle-risk group was divided into CLU and ABCA7-dominated middle-risk group. The function connectivity pattern of DMN among the three or four groups were distributed in the bilateral medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and bilateral superior frontal gyrus (SFG) (P &lt; 0.05, GRF correction). When APOEε4 carriers were excluded, the CLU-predominant middle-risk group displayed the decreased functional connectivity in MPFC when compared with the low-risk group, while ABCA7-prodominant middle-risk group displayed decreased functional connectivity in cuneus when compared with the high-risk group (all P &lt; 0.05, GRF correction). The z values of left middle frontal cortex were positively correlated with the scores of Serial Dotting Test (SDT) in high-risk group of CLU, while z values of MPFC and cuneus were positively correlated to the scores of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in low-risk group of three or four groups.</p>Conclusion<p>The functional connectivity of MPFC-PCC might be modulated by the interaction of CLU and ABCA7. Moreover, APOEε4 might be interacted with ABCA7 and CLU modulation in the middle-aged carriers.</p>

<p>Alternative splicing occurs in over 95% of protein-coding genes and contributes to the diversity of the human proteome. Apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (apoER2) is a critical modulator of neuronal development and synaptic plasticity in the brain and is enriched in cassette exon splicing events, in which functional exons are excluded from the final transcript. These alternative splicing events affect apoER2 function, as individual apoER2 exons tend to encode distinct protein functional domains. Although several apoER2 splice variants have been characterized, much work remains to understand how apoER2 splicing events modulate distinct apoER2 activities, including ligand binding specificity, synapse formation and plasticity. Additionally, little is known about how apoER2 splicing events are regulated. Often, alternative splicing events are regulated through the combinatorial action of RNA-binding proteins and other epigenetic mechanisms, however, the regulatory pathways corresponding to each specific exon are unknown in most cases. In this mini-review, we describe the structure of apoER2, highlight the unique functions of known isoforms, discuss what is currently known about the regulation of apoER2 splicing by RNA-binding proteins and pose new questions that will further our understanding of apoER2 splicing complexity.</p>

<p>The P2X7 receptor is a cation channel activated by high concentrations of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Upon long-term activation, it complexes with membrane proteins forming a wide pore that leads to cell death and increased release of ATP into the extracellular milieu. The P2X7 receptor is widely expressed in the CNS, such as frontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and striatum, regions involved in neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disorders. Despite P2X7 receptor functions in glial cells have been extensively studied, the existence and roles of this receptor in neurons are still controversially discussed. Regardless, P2X7 receptors mediate several processes observed in neuropsychiatric disorders and brain tumors, such as activation of neuroinflammatory response, stimulation of glutamate release and neuroplasticity impairment. Moreover, P2X7 receptor gene polymorphisms have been associated to depression, and isoforms of P2X7 receptors are implicated in neuropsychiatric diseases. In view of that, the P2X7 receptor has been proposed to be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in brain diseases. This review discusses the molecular mechanisms underlying P2X7 receptor-mediated signaling in neurodegenerative diseases, psychiatric disorders, and brain tumors. In addition, it highlights the recent advances in the development of P2X7 receptor antagonists that are able of penetrating the central nervous system.</p>

Background<p>Despite the recent advances in the acute stroke care, treatment options for long-term disability are limited. RPh201 is a botany-derived bioactive compound that has been shown to exert beneficial effects in various experimental models of neural injury. The present study evaluated the effect of delayed RPh201 treatment on long term functional recovery after stroke.</p>Methods<p>Adult male Wistar rats subjected to embolic middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) were randomized into the following experimental groups (n = 20/group): (1) RPh201 treatment, and (2) Vehicle (cottonseed oil). RPh201 (20 μl) or Vehicle were subcutaneously administered twice a week for 16 consecutive weeks starting at 21 days after MCAO. An array of behavioral tests was performed up to120 days after MCAO.</p>Results<p>Ischemic rats treated with RPh201 exhibited significant (p &lt; 0.05) improvement of neurological function measured by adhesive removal test, foot-fault test, and modified neurological severity score at 90 and 120 days after MCAO. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that RPh201 treatment robustly increased neurofilament heavy chain positive axons and myelin basic protein densities in the peri-infarct area by 61% and 31%, respectively, when compared to the Vehicle treatment, which were further confirmed by Western blot analysis. The RPh201 treatment did not reduce infarct volume.</p>Conclusion<p>Our data demonstrated that RPh201 has a therapeutic effect on improvement of functional recovery in male ischemic rats even when the treatment was initiated 21 days post stroke. Enhanced axonal and myelination densities by RPh201 in ischemic brain may contribute to improved stroke recovery.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00791">Will Sirtuins Be Promising Therapeutic Targets for TBI and Associated Neurodegenerative Diseases?</a></h4>

<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI), a leading cause of morbidity worldwide, induces mechanical, persistent structural, and metabolic abnormalities in neurons and other brain-resident cells. The key pathological features of TBI include neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and mitochondrial dysfunction. These pathological processes persist for a period of time after TBIs. Sirtuins are evolutionarily conserved nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent deacetylases and mono-ADP-ribosyl transferases. The mammalian sirtuin family has seven members, referred to as Sirtuin (SIRT) 1–7. Accumulating evidence suggests that SIRT1 and SIRT3 play a neuroprotective role in TBI. Although the evidence is scant, considering the involvement of SIRT2, 4–7 in other brain injury models, they may also intervene in similar pathophysiology in TBI. Neurodegenerative diseases are generally accepted sequelae of TBI. It was found that TBI and neurodegenerative diseases have many similarities and overlaps in pathological features. Besides, sirtuins play some unique roles in some neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, we propose that sirtuins might be a promising therapeutic target for both TBI and associated neurodegenerative diseases. In this paper, we review the neuroprotective effects of sirtuins on TBI as well as related neurodegeneration and discuss the therapeutic potential of sirtuin modulators.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, accounting for 60–70% of all dementias. AD is often under-diagnosed and recognized only at a later, more advanced stage, and this delay in diagnosis has been suggested as a contributing factor in the numerous unsuccessful AD treatment trials. Although there is no known cure for AD, early diagnosis is important for disease management and care. A hallmark of AD is the deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ)-containing senile neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosporylated tau in the brain. However, current in vivo methods to quantify Aβ in the brain are invasive, requiring radioactive tracers and positron emission tomography. Toward development of alternative methods to assess AD progression, we focus on the retinal manifestation of AD pathology. The retina is an extension of the central nervous system uniquely accessible to light-based, non-invasive ophthalmic imaging. However, earlier studies in human retina indicate that the literature is divided on the presence of Aβ in the AD retina. To help resolve this disparity, this study assessed retinal tissues from neuropathologically confirmed AD cases to determine the regional distribution of Aβ in retinal wholemounts and to inform on future retinal image studies targeting Aβ. Concurrent post-mortem brain tissues were also collected. Neuropathological cortical assessments including neuritic plaque (NP) scores and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) were correlated with retinal Aβ using immunohistochemistry, confocal microscopy, and quantitative image analysis. Aβ load was compared between AD and control (non-AD) eyes. Our results indicate that levels of intracellular and extracellular Aβ retinal deposits were significantly higher in AD than controls. Mid-peripheral Aβ levels were greater than central retina in both AD and control eyes. In AD retina, higher intracellular Aβ was associated with lower NP score, while higher extracellular Aβ was associated with higher CAA score. Our data support the feasibility of using the retinal tissue to assess ocular Aβ as a surrogate measure of Aβ in the brain of individuals with AD. Specifically, mid-peripheral retina possesses more Aβ deposition than central retina, and thus may be the optimal location for future in vivo ocular imaging.</p>

Purpose<p>The occurrence of mental fatigue when users stare at stimuli is a critical problem in the implementation of steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based visual acuity assessment, which may weaken the SSVEP amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and subsequently affect the results of visual acuity assessment. This study aimed to explore the anti-fatigue performance of six stimulus paradigms (reverse vertical sinusoidal gratings, reverse horizontal sinusoidal gratings, reverse vertical square-wave gratings, brief-onset vertical sinusoidal gratings, reversal checkerboards, and oscillating expansion–contraction concentric rings) in SSVEP acuity assessment.</p>Methods<p>Based on four indices of α + θ index, pupil diameter, National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX), and amplitude and SNR of SSVEPs, this study quantitatively evaluated mental fatigue in six SSVEP visual attention runs corresponding to six paradigms with 12 subjects.</p>Results<p>These indices of mental fatigue showed a good agreement. The results showed that the paradigm of motion expansion–contraction concentric rings had a superior anti-fatigue efficacy than the other five paradigms of conventional onset mode or pattern reversal mode during prolonged SSVEP experiment. The paradigm of brief-onset mode showed the lowest anti-fatigue efficacy, and the other paradigms of pattern reversal SSVEP paradigms showed a similar anti-fatigue efficacy, which was between motion expansion–contraction mode and onset mode.</p>Conclusion<p>This study recommended the paradigm of oscillating expansion–contraction concentric rings as the stimulation paradigm in SSVEP visual acuity because of its superior anti-fatigue efficacy.</p>

<p>The brain–computer interface (BCI) is a system that is designed to provide communication channels to anyone through a computer. Initially, it was suggested to help the disabled, but actually had been proposed a wider range of applications. However, the cross-subject recognition in BCI systems is difficult to break apart from the individual specific characteristics, unsteady characteristics, and environmental specific characteristics, which also makes it difficult to develop highly reliable and highly stable BCI systems. Rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) is one of the most recent spellers with a clean, unified background and a single stimulus, which may evoke event-related potential (ERP) patterns with less individual difference. In order to build a BCI system that allows new users to use it directly without calibration or with less calibration time, RSVP was employed as evoked paradigm, then correlation analysis rank (CAR) algorithm was proposed to improve the cross-individual classification and simultaneously use as less training data as possible. Fifty-eight subjects took part in the experiments. The flash stimulation time is 200 ms, and the off time is 100 ms. The P300 component was locked to the target representation by time. The results showed that RSVP could evoke more similar ERP patterns among subjects compared with matrix paradigm. Then, the included angle cosine was calculated and counted for averaged ERP waveform between each two subjects. The average matching number of all subjects was 6 for the matrix paradigm, while for the RSVP paradigm, the average matching number range was 20 when the threshold value was set to 0.5, more than three times as much larger, quantificationally indicating that ERP waveforms evoked by the RSVP paradigm produced smaller individual differences, and it is more favorable for cross-subject classification. Information transfer rates (ITR) were also calculated for RSVP and matrix paradigms, and the RSVP paradigm got the average ITR of 43.18 bits/min, which was 13% higher than the matrix paradigm. Then, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve value was computed and compared using the proposed CAR algorithm and traditional random selection. The results showed that the proposed CAR got significantly better performance than the traditional random selection and got the best AUC value of 0.8, while the traditional random selection only achieved 0.65. These encouraging results suggest that with proper evoked paradigm and classification methods, it is feasible to get stable performance across subjects for ERP-based BCI. Thus, our findings provide a new approach to improve BCI performances.</p>

<p>Previous research investigating handle-response compatibility effects with graspable objects used different categories of objects as stimuli, regardless of their specific, intrinsic characteristics. The current study explores whether different types of objects’ characteristics may elicit different types of spatial compatibility, that is, handle-response and response-effect compatibility as well as their potential interaction. In Experiment 1, objects having a graspable handle opposite to either a visible functional component (i.e., handle-function objects: a teapot) or a latent functional component (handle-only objects: a pitcher lacking the spout) were presented separately in different blocks. Both the handle and the goal-directed functional components of these objects were located on the horizontal axis. In Experiment 2, handle-only objects had a handle located on the horizontal axis and a latent functional component located on the vertical axis (e.g., a cup). In both experiments, participants were required to judge the material (plastic and metal) the object was made of. Results showed that the handle-response compatibility effect was sensitive to whether the actions consequences of object manipulation took place on the horizontal rather than on the vertical axis.</p>

<p>Introduction: Neuroimaging studies on neural processes associated with mirror-induced visual illusion (MVI) are growing in number. Previous systematic reviews on these studies used qualitative approaches.</p><p>Objective: The present study conducted activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis to locate the brain areas for unfolding the neural processes associated with the MVI.</p><p>Method: We searched the CINAHL, MEDLINE, Scopus, and PubMed databases and identified eight studies (with 14 experiments) that met the inclusion criteria.</p><p>Results: Contrasting with a rest condition, strong convergence in the bilateral primary and premotor areas and the inferior parietal lobule suggested top-down motor planning and execution. In addition, convergence was identified in the ipsilateral precuneus, cerebellum, superior frontal gyrus, and superior parietal lobule, clusters corresponding to the static hidden hand indicating self-processing operations, somatosensory processing, and motor control. When contrasting with an active movement condition, additional substantial convergence was revealed in visual-related areas, such as the ipsilateral cuneus, fusiform gyrus, middle occipital gyrus (visual area V2) and lingual gyrus, which mediate basic visual processing.</p><p>Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, the current meta-analysis is the first to reveal the visualization, mental rehearsal and motor-related processes underpinning the MVI and offers theoretical support on using MVI as a clinical intervention for post-stroke patients.</p>

<p>The brain shows a complex multiscale organization that prevents a direct understanding of how structure, function and dynamics are correlated. To date, advances in neural modeling offer a unique opportunity for simulating global brain dynamics by embedding empirical data on different scales in a mathematical framework. The Virtual Brain (TVB) is an advanced data-driven model allowing to simulate brain dynamics starting from individual subjects’ structural and functional connectivity obtained, for example, from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The use of TVB has been limited so far to cerebral connectivity but here, for the first time, we have introduced cerebellar nodes and interconnecting tracts to demonstrate the impact of cerebro-cerebellar loops on brain dynamics. Indeed, the matching between the empirical and simulated functional connectome was significantly improved when including the cerebro-cerebellar loops. This positive result should be considered as a first step, since issues remain open about the best strategy to reconstruct effective structural connectivity and the nature of the neural mass or mean-field models generating local activity in the nodes. For example, signal processing is known to differ remarkably between cortical and cerebellar microcircuits. Tackling these challenges is expected to further improve the predictive power of functional brain activity simulations, using TVB or other similar tools, in explaining not just global brain dynamics but also the role of cerebellum in determining brain states in physiological conditions and in the numerous pathologies affecting the cerebro-cerebellar loops.</p>

<p>Asthma is a heterogeneous disease, and the central nervous system (CNS) also participates in the pathogenesis of asthma. We previously reported the amygdala might regulate asthmatic attacks via projecting to the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN). The dorsal vagal complex (DVC) is a crucial region that modulates respiratory. This study aimed to observe the activity in both PVN and DVC and the connection between PVN and DVC in asthmatic rats. Immunohistochemistry was conducted to observe the changes in Fos and oxytocin (OT) expression. Retrograde tracing using wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) and double immunohistochemistry for OT and Fos was used to observe the HRP/OT/Fos positive neurons distribution in the PVN. The results showed that during an asthma attack, the Fos positive neurons increased in both PVN and DVC over time. The expression of OT positive neurons in PVN showed a similar trend in parallel to the c-Fos positive neurons in PVN. The HRP retrograde-labeled neurons were densely distributed in the medial and lateral subnucleus in the PVN. OT<sup>+</sup>/HRP<sup>+</sup> and Fos<sup>+</sup>/OT<sup>+</sup>/HRP<sup>+</sup> accounted for 18.14%, and 2.37% of HRP-labeled neurons, respectively. Our study showed PVN and DVC were activated and the expression of OT positive neurons in PVN were increased over time during an asthma attack. The existence of connection between PVN and DVC suggested the OT neurons in PVN might project to DVC which might be involved in the pathogenesis of asthma.</p>

<p>Accumulating evidence suggests that freezing of gait (FOG) is a unique gait disturbance in Parkinson’s disease (PD), and its pathophysiology is not fully elucidated. The present study aims to investigate the clinical and oculomotor associations with FOG in Chinese PD patients. From Jan 2017 to Dec 2019, a total of 210 PD patients were consecutively registered for FOG evaluation based on item-3 of the Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FOGQ). We explored the demographic, motor, and non-motor symptom differences in FOG positive (PD+FOG, n = 45) vs. negative (PD-FOG, n = 165) group. In addition, 40 PD patients and 37 healthy controls (HC) also underwent oculomotor test via videonystagmography (VNG). Visually guided saccade (VGS) latency, saccade accuracy and gain in smooth pursuit eye movement (SPEM) at three frequencies of horizontal axis were compared among PD+FOG (n = 20), PD-FOG (n = 20), and HC (n = 37). Compared with PD-FOG, PD+FOG had longer disease duration, more severe motor symptoms, lower cognitive scores, more severe depressive and autonomic impairments, as well as higher daily levodopa equivalent dosage. FOG occurred more frequently in patients with wearing-off. VNG subgroup analysis demonstrated that PD+FOG had prolonged saccade latency and decreased saccade accuracy relative to PD-FOG or HC. SPEM gain at 0.1 and 0.2 Hz was also decreased in PD+FOG compared with HC. Furthermore, prolonged saccade latency was correlated with higher FOGQ scores in PD patients. Our results verify that PD with FOG patients suffer from more severe motor and non-motor symptoms, indicating more extensive neurodegeneration. Prolonged saccade latency could be a practical oculomotor parameter both for identification and progression of FOG in PD.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59407">Structure and mechanism of the Mrp complex, an ancient cation/proton antiporter</a></h4>

Multiple resistance and pH adaptation (Mrp) antiporters are multi-subunit Na<sup>+</sup> (or K<sup>+</sup>)/H<sup>+</sup> exchangers representing an ancestor of many essential redox-driven proton pumps, such as respiratory complex I. The mechanism of coupling between ion or electron transfer and proton translocation in this large protein family is unknown. Here, we present the structure of the Mrp complex from <i>Anoxybacillus flavithermus </i>solved by cryo-EM at 3.0 Å resolution. It is a dimer of seven-subunit protomers with 50 trans-membrane helices each. Surface charge distribution within each monomer is remarkably asymmetric, revealing probable proton and sodium translocation pathways. On the basis of the structure we propose a mechanism where the coupling between sodium and proton translocation is facilitated by a series of electrostatic interactions between a cation and key charged residues. This mechanism is likely to be applicable to the entire family of redox proton pumps, where electron transfer to substrates replaces cation movements.

Gap junctions are ubiquitous in metazoans and play critical roles in important biological processes, including electrical conduction and development. Yet, only a few defined molecules passing through gap junction channels have been linked to specific functions. We isolated gap junction channel mutants that reduce coupling between the soma and germ cells in the <i>C. elegans</i> gonad. We provide evidence that malonyl-CoA, the rate-limiting substrate for fatty acid synthesis (FAS), is produced in the soma and delivered through gap junctions to the germline; there it is used in fatty acid synthesis to critically support embryonic development. Separation of malonyl-CoA production from its site of utilization facilitates somatic control of germline development. Additionally, we demonstrate that loss of malonyl-CoA production in the intestine negatively impacts germline development independently of FAS. Our results suggest that metabolic outsourcing of malonyl-CoA may be a strategy by which the soma communicates nutritional status to the germline.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58191">Drainage of inflammatory macromolecules from brain to periphery targets the liver for macrophage infiltration</a></h4>

Many brain pathologies are associated with liver damage, but a direct link has long remained elusive. Here, we establish a new paradigm for interrogating brain-periphery interactions by leveraging zebrafish for its unparalleled access to the intact whole animal for <i>in vivo</i> analysis in real time after triggering focal brain inflammation. Using traceable lipopolysaccharides (LPS), we reveal that drainage of these inflammatory macromolecules from the brain led to a strikingly robust peripheral infiltration of macrophages into the liver independent of Kupffer cells. We further demonstrate that this macrophage recruitment requires signaling from the cytokine IL-34 and Toll-like receptor adaptor MyD88, and occurs in coordination with neutrophils. These results highlight the possibility for circulation of brain-derived substances to serve as a rapid mode of communication from brain to the liver. Understanding how the brain engages the periphery at times of danger may offer new perspectives for detecting and treating brain pathologies.

The inferior olive (IO) is comprised of electrically-coupled neurons that make climbing fiber synapses onto Purkinje cells. Neurons in different IO subnuclei are inhibited by synapses with wide ranging release kinetics. Inhibition can be exclusively synchronous, asynchronous, or a mixture of both. Whether the same boutons, neurons or sources provide these kinetically distinct types of inhibition was not known. We find that the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) and vestibular nuclei (VN) are two major sources of inhibition to the IO that are specialized to provide inhibitory input with distinct kinetics. DCN to IO synapses lack fast synaptotagmin isoforms, release neurotransmitter asynchronously, and are exclusively GABAergic. VN to IO synapses contain fast synaptotagmin isoforms, release neurotransmitter synchronously, and are mediated by combined GABAergic and glycinergic transmission. These findings indicate that VN and DCN inhibitory inputs to the IO are suited to control different aspects of IO activity.

<p>by Rafael D’Andrea, Theo Gibbs, James P. O’Dwyer</p>

Neutral theory assumes all species and individuals in a community are ecologically equivalent. This controversial hypothesis has been tested across many taxonomic groups and environmental contexts, and successfully predicts species abundance distributions across multiple high-diversity communities. However, it has been critiqued for its failure to predict a broader range of community properties, particularly regarding community dynamics from generational to geological timescales. Moreover, it is unclear whether neutrality can ever be a true description of a community given the ubiquity of interspecific differences, which presumably lead to ecological inequivalences. Here we derive analytical predictions for when and why non-neutral communities of consumers and resources may present neutral-like outcomes, which we verify using numerical simulations. Our results, which span both static and dynamical community properties, demonstrate the limitations of summarizing distributions to detect non-neutrality, and provide a potential explanation for the successes of neutral theory as a description of macroecological pattern.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_7VQxYo9Oqg" width="1" />

<p>by Ian F. Coccimiglio, David C. Clarke</p>

Exercise training elicits profound metabolic adaptations in skeletal muscle cells. A key molecule in coordinating these adaptations is AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), whose activity increases in response to cellular energy demand. AMPK activity dynamics are primarily controlled by the adenine nucleotides ADP and AMP, but how each contributes to its control in skeletal muscle during exercise is unclear. We developed and validated a mathematical model of AMPK signaling dynamics, and then applied global parameter sensitivity analyses with data-informed constraints to predict that AMPK activity dynamics are determined principally by ADP and not AMP. We then used the model to predict the effects of two additional direct-binding activators of AMPK, ZMP and Compound 991, further validating the model and demonstrating its applicability to understanding AMPK pharmacology. The relative effects of direct-binding activators can be understood in terms of four properties, namely their concentrations, binding affinities for AMPK, abilities to enhance AMPK phosphorylation, and the magnitudes of their allosteric activation of AMPK. Despite AMP’s favorable values in three of these four properties, ADP is the dominant controller of AMPK activity dynamics in skeletal muscle during exercise by virtue of its higher concentration compared to that of AMP.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YsGRQ_l22zc" width="1" />

We previously proposed, on theoretical grounds, that the cerebellum must regulate the dimensionality of its neuronal activity during motor learning and control to cope with the low firing frequency of inferior olive neurons, which form one of two major inputs to the cerebellar cortex. Such dimensionality regulation is possible via modulation of electrical coupling through the gap junctions between inferior olive neurons by inhibitory GABAergic synapses. In addition, we previously showed in simulations that intermediate coupling strengths induce chaotic firing of inferior olive neurons and increase their information carrying capacity. However, there is no <i>in vivo</i> experimental data supporting these two theoretical predictions. Here, we computed the levels of synchrony, dimensionality, and chaos of the inferior olive code by analyzing <i>in vivo</i> recordings of Purkinje cell complex spike activity in three different coupling conditions: carbenoxolone (gap junctions blocker), control, and picrotoxin (GABA-A receptor antagonist). To examine the effect of electrical coupling on dimensionality and chaotic dynamics, we first determined the physiological range of effective coupling strengths between inferior olive neurons in the three conditions using a combination of a biophysical network model of the inferior olive and a novel Bayesian model averaging approach. We found that effective coupling co-varied with synchrony and was inversely related to the dimensionality of inferior olive firing dynamics, as measured via a principal component analysis of the spike trains in each condition. Furthermore, for both the model and the data, we found an inverted U-shaped relationship between coupling strengths and complexity entropy, a measure of chaos for spiking neural data. These results are consistent with our hypothesis according to which electrical coupling regulates the dimensionality and the complexity in the inferior olive neurons in order to optimize both motor learning and control of high dimensional motor systems by the cerebellum.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ISLNhcmuOB8" width="1" />

<p>by Edward C. Schrom II, Simon A. Levin, Andrea L. Graham</p>

In the animal kingdom, various forms of swarming enable groups of autonomous individuals to transform uncertain information into unified decisions which are probabilistically beneficial. Crossing scales from individual to group decisions requires dynamically accumulating signals among individuals. In striking parallel, the mammalian immune system is also a group of decentralized autonomous units (i.e. cells) which collectively navigate uncertainty with the help of dynamically accumulating signals (i.e. cytokines). Therefore, we apply techniques of understanding swarm behavior to a decision-making problem in the mammalian immune system, namely effector choice among CD4+ T helper (Th) cells. We find that incorporating dynamic cytokine signaling into a simple model of Th differentiation comprehensively explains divergent observations of this process. The plasticity and heterogeneity of individual Th cells, the tunable mixtures of effector types that can be generated <i>in vitro</i>, and the polarized yet updateable group effector commitment often observed <i>in vivo</i> are all explained by the same set of underlying molecular rules. These rules reveal that Th cells harness dynamic cytokine signaling to implement a system of quorum sensing. Quorum sensing, in turn, may confer adaptive advantages on the mammalian immune system, especially during coinfection and during coevolution with manipulative parasites. This highlights a new way of understanding the mammalian immune system as a cellular swarm, and it underscores the power of collectives throughout nature.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ceLFKZWz0xM" width="1" />

Epigenetic dynamics, such as DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility, have been extensively explored in human preimplantation embryos. However, the active demethylation process during this crucial period remains largely unexplored. In this study, we use single-cell chemical-labeling-enabled C-to-T conversion sequencing (CLEVER-seq) to quantify the DNA 5-formylcytosine (5fC) levels of human preimplantation embryos. We find that 5-formylcytosine phosphate guanine (5fCpG) exhibits genomic element-specific distribution features and is enriched in L1 and endogenous retrovirus-K (ERVK), the subfamilies of repeat elements long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) and long terminal repeats (LTRs), respectively. Unlike in mice, paired pronuclei in the same zygote present variable difference of 5fCpG levels, although the male pronuclei experience stronger global demethylation. The nucleosome-occupied regions show a higher 5fCpG level compared with nucleosome-depleted ones, suggesting the role of 5fC in organizing nucleosome position. Collectively, our work offers a valuable resource for ten-eleven translocation protein family (TET)-dependent active demethylation-related study during human early embryonic development.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/pPNXRIlZ2wM" width="1" />

<p>by Harrison Steel, Robert Habgood, Ciarán Kelly, Antonis Papachristodoulou</p>

The precision and repeatability of in vivo biological studies is predicated upon methods for isolating a targeted subsystem from external sources of noise and variability. However, in many experimental frameworks, this is made challenging by nonstatic environments during host cell growth, as well as variability introduced by manual sampling and measurement protocols. To address these challenges, we developed Chi.Bio, a parallelised open-source platform that represents a new experimental paradigm in which all measurement and control actions can be applied to a bulk culture in situ. In addition to continuous-culturing capabilities, it incorporates tunable light outputs, spectrometry, and advanced automation features. We demonstrate its application to studies of cell growth and biofilm formation, automated in silico control of optogenetic systems, and readout of multiple orthogonal fluorescent proteins in situ. By integrating precise measurement and actuation hardware into a single low-cost platform, Chi.Bio facilitates novel experimental methods for synthetic, systems, and evolutionary biology and broadens access to cutting-edge research capabilities.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/4MGotWIcqu0" width="1" />

Virus proliferation involves gene replication inside infected cells and transmission to new target cells. Once positive-strand RNA virus has infected a cell, the viral genome serves as a template for copying (“stay-strategy”) or is packaged into a progeny virion that will be released extracellularly (“leave-strategy”). The balance between genome replication and virion release determines virus production and transmission efficacy. The ensuing trade-off has not yet been well characterized. In this study, we use hepatitis C virus (HCV) as a model system to study the balance of the two strategies. Combining viral infection cell culture assays with mathematical modeling, we characterize the dynamics of two different HCV strains (JFH-1, a clinical isolate, and Jc1-n, a laboratory strain), which have different viral release characteristics. We found that 0.63% and 1.70% of JFH-1 and Jc1-n intracellular viral RNAs, respectively, are used for producing and releasing progeny virions. Analysis of the Malthusian parameter of the HCV genome (i.e., initial proliferation rate) and the number of de novo infections (i.e., initial transmissibility) suggests that the leave-strategy provides a higher level of initial transmission for Jc1-n, whereas, in contrast, the stay-strategy provides a higher initial proliferation rate for JFH-1. Thus, theoretical-experimental analysis of viral dynamics enables us to better understand the proliferation strategies of viruses, which contributes to the efficient control of virus transmission. Ours is the first study to analyze the stay-leave trade-off during the viral life cycle and the significance of the replication-release switching mechanism for viral proliferation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/br8qW96G6AI" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) modulates synaptic activity and is widely distributed in brain areas such as the hippocampus, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and striatum, among others. CB1R is involved in processes such as memory, learning, motor coordination, and mood. Genetic deletion of CB1R causes behavioral alterations. In this work, we evaluated neuronal morphology and synaptic structure in the hippocampus of adult male CB1R knockout mice (CB1R<sup>−/−</sup>). Morphological changes in the CB1R<sup>−/−</sup> hippocampus evidenced a decrease in the expression of cytoskeletal proteins neurofilaments 160 KDa, neurofilaments 200 KDa, and microtubule‐associated protein 2. CA1 neurons showed decreased arborization and changes in synaptic structure such as lower thickness of postsynaptic density and a reduction in synaptophysin levels. Results obtained in the present work provide evidence of the participation of CB1R in the establishment of neuronal structure and networks that could have an important role in neuronal plasticity. In addition, these changes observed in CB1R<sup>−/−</sup> could be correlated with behavioral alterations reported.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a rare genetic disorder leading to degenerative processes. So far, no effective treatment has been found. Therefore, it is important to assist the development of medication with imaging biomarkers reflecting disease status and progress. Ten FRDA patients (mean age 37 ± 14 years; four female) and 10 age‐ and sex‐matched controls were included. Acquisition of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data for quantitative susceptibility mapping, <i>R </i>
<sub>1</sub>, <i>R </i>
<sub>2</sub> relaxometry and diffusion imaging was performed at 7 Tesla. Results of volume of interest (VOI)‐based analyses of the quantitative data were compared with a voxel‐based morphometry (VBM) evaluation. Differences between patients and controls were assessed using the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA; <i>p </i> &lt; 0.01) with age and sex as covariates, effect size of group differences, and correlations with disease characteristics with Spearman correlation coefficient. For the VBM analysis, a statistical threshold of 0.001 for uncorrected and 0.05 for corrected <i>p</i>‐values was used. Statistically significant differences between FRDA patients and controls were found in five out of twelve investigated structures, and statistically significant correlations with disease characteristics were revealed. Moreover, VBM revealed significant white matter atrophy within regions of the brainstem, and the cerebellum. These regions overlapped partially with brain regions for which significant differences between healthy controls and patients were found in the VOI‐based quantitative MRI evaluation. It was shown that two independent analyses provided overlapping results. Moreover, positive results on correlations with disease characteristics were found, indicating that these quantitative MRI parameters could provide more detailed information and assist the search for effective treatments.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Kappa opioid receptor (KOR) agonists produce robust analgesia with minimal abuse liability and are considered promising pharmacological agents to manage chronic pain and itch. The KOR system is also notable for robust differences between the sexes, with females exhibiting lower analgesic response than males. Sexually dimorphic traits can be due to either the influence of gonadal hormones during development or adulthood, or due to the complement of genes expressed on the X or Y chromosome. Previous studies examining sex differences in KOR antinociception have relied on surgical or pharmacological manipulation of the gonads to determine whether sex hormones influence KOR function. While there are conflicting reports whether gonadal hormones influence KOR function, no study has examined these effects in context with sex chromosomes. Here, we use two genetic mouse models, the four core genotypes and XY*, to isolate the chromosomal and hormonal contributions to sex differences in KOR analgesia. Mice were treated with systemic KOR agonist (U50,488H) and thermal analgesia measured in the tail withdrawal assay. We found that KOR antinociception was influenced predominantly by the number of the X chromosomes. These data suggest that the dose and/or parental imprint on X gene(s) contribute significantly to the sexually dimorphism in KOR analgesia.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00825">Investigating the Reliability of Population Receptive Field Size Estimates Using fMRI</a></h4>

<p>In functional MRI (fMRI), population receptive field (pRF) models allow a quantitative description of the response as a function of the features of the stimuli that are relevant for each voxel. The most popular pRF model used in fMRI assumes a Gaussian shape in the features space (e.g., the visual field) reducing the description of the voxel’s pRF to the Gaussian mean (the pRF preferred feature) and standard deviation (the pRF size). The estimation of the pRF mean has been proven to be highly reliable. However, the estimate of the pRF size has been shown not to be consistent within and between subjects. While this issue has been noted experimentally, here we use an optimization theory perspective to describe how the inconsistency in estimating the pRF size is linked to an inherent property of the Gaussian pRF model. When fitting such models, the goodness of fit is less sensitive to variations in the pRF size than to variations in the pRF mean. We also show how the same issue can be considered from a bias-variance perspective. We compare different estimation procedures in terms of the reliability of their estimates using simulated and real fMRI data in the visual (using the Human Connectome Project database) and auditory domain. We show that, the reliability of the estimate of the pRF size can be improved considering a linear combination of those pRF models with similar goodness of fit or a permutation based approach. This increase in reliability of the pRF size estimate does not affect the reliability of the estimate of the pRF mean and the prediction accuracy.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00793">In vivo PET Imaging of Gliogenesis After Cerebral Ischemia in Rats</a></h4>

<p>In vivo positron emission tomography of neuroinflammation has mainly focused on the evaluation of glial cell activation using radiolabeled ligands. However, the non-invasive imaging of neuroinflammatory cell proliferation has been scarcely evaluated so far. In vivo and ex vivo assessment of gliogenesis after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats was carried out using PET imaging with the marker of cell proliferation 3′-Deoxy-3′-[18F] fluorothymidine ([<sup>18</sup>F]FLT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fluorescence immunohistochemistry. MRI-T<sub>2</sub>W studies showed the presence of the brain infarction at 24 h after MCAO affecting cerebral cortex and striatum. In vivo PET imaging showed a significant increase in [<sup>18</sup>F]FLT uptake in the ischemic territory at day 7 followed by a progressive decline from day 14 to day 28 after ischemia onset. In addition, immunohistochemistry studies using Ki67, CD11b, and GFAP to evaluate proliferation of microglia and astrocytes confirmed the PET findings showing the increase of glial proliferation at day 7 after ischemia followed by decrease later on. Hence, these results show that [<sup>18</sup>F]FLT provides accurate quantitative information on the time course of glial proliferation in experimental stroke. Finally, this novel brain imaging method might guide on the imaging evaluation of the role of gliogenesis after stroke.</p>

<p>Concussion or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in athletes can cause persistent symptoms, known as post-concussion syndrome (PCS), and repeated injuries may increase the long-term risk for an athlete to develop neurodegenerative diseases such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The Center for Disease Control estimates that up to 3.8 million sport-related mTBI are reported each year in the United States. Despite the magnitude of the phenomenon, there is a current lack of comprehensive prognostic indicators and research has shown that available monitoring tools are moderately sensitive to short-term concussion effects but less sensitive to long-term consequences. The overall aim of this review is to discuss novel, quantitative, and objective measurements that can predict long-term outcomes following repeated sports-related mTBIs. The specific objectives were (1) to provide an overview of the current clinical and biomechanical tools available to health practitioners to ensure recovery after mTBIs, (2) to synthesize potential biological mechanisms in animal models underlying the long-term adverse consequences of mTBIs, (3) to discuss the possible link between repeated mTBI and neurodegenerative diseases, and (4) to discuss the current knowledge about fluid biomarkers for mTBIs with a focus on novel exosomal biomarkers. The conclusions from this review are that current post-concussion clinical tests are not sufficiently sensitive to injury and do not accurately quantify post-concussion alterations associated with repeated mTBIs. In the current review, it is proposed that current practices should be amended to include a repeated symptom inventory, a cognitive assessment of executive function and impulse control, an instrumented assessment of balance, vestibulo-ocular assessments, and an improved panel of blood or exosome biomarkers.</p>

<p>Resting-state Arterial Spin Labeling (rs-ASL) is a rather confidential method compared to resting-state BOLD. As ASL allows to quantify the cerebral blood flow, unlike BOLD, rs-ASL can lead to significant clinical subject-scaled applications. Despite directly impacting clinical practicability and functional networks estimation, there is no standard for rs-ASL regarding the acquisition duration. Our work here focuses on assessing the feasibility of ASL as an rs-fMRI method and on studying the effect of the acquisition duration on the estimation of functional networks. To this end, we acquired a long 24 min 30 s rs-ASL sequence and investigated how estimations of six typical functional brain networks evolved with respect to the acquisition duration. Our results show that, after a certain acquisition duration, the estimations of all functional networks reach their best and are stabilized. Since, for clinical application, the acquisition duration should be the shortest possible, we suggest an acquisition duration of 14 min, i.e., 240 volumes with our sequence parameters, as it covers the functional networks estimation stabilization.</p>

<p>Cooperation and competition are two ways of social interaction keys to life in society. Recent EEG-based hyperscanning studies reveal that cooperative and competitive interactions induce an increase in interbrain coupling. However, whether this interbrain coupling effect is just a reflection of inter-subject motor coordination or can also signal the type of social interaction is unknown. Here, we show that behavioral coordination and social interaction type can be distinguished according to the frequency of oscillation in which the brains are coupled. We use EEG to simultaneously measure the brain activity of pairs of subjects, while they were performing a visual cue-target task in a cooperative and competitive manner. Behavioral responses were quasi-simultaneous between subject pairs for both competitive and cooperative conditions, with faster average response times for the competitive condition. Concerning brain activity, we found increased interbrain coupling in theta band (3–7 Hz) during cooperation and competition, with stronger coupling during competitive interactions. This increase of interbrain theta coupling correlated with a decrease in reaction times of the dyads. Interestingly, we also found an increase in brain-to-brain coupling in gamma band (38–42 Hz) only during cooperative interactions. Unlike the theta coupling effect, the gamma interbrain coupling did not correlate with dyads’ reaction times. Taken together, these results suggest that theta interbrain coupling could be linked to motor coordination processes common to cooperative and competitive interactions, while gamma brain-to-brain coupling emerges as an electrophysiological marker of shared intentionality during cooperative interactions.</p>

<p>The EMERT (ecological microexpression recognition test) by Zhang et al. (2017) used between-subjects Latin square block design for backgrounds; therefore, participants could not get comparable scores. The current study used within-subject pseudorandom design for backgrounds to improve EMERT to PREMERT (pseudorandom EMERT) and used eyes-closed and eyes-open resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to detect relevant brain activity of PREMERT for the first time. The results showed (1) two new recapitulative indexes of PREMERT were adopted, such as microexpression M and microexpression SD. Using pseudorandom design, the participants could effectively identify almost all the microexpressions, and each microexpression type had significant background effect. The PREMERT had good split-half reliability, parallel-forms reliability, criterion validity, and ecological validity. Therefore, it could stably and efficiently detect the participants’ microexpression recognition abilities. Because of its pseudorandom design, all participants did the same test; their scores could be compared with each other. (2) amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF; 0.01–0.1 Hz) in both eyes-closed and eyes-open resting states and ALFF difference could predict microexpression M, and the ALFF difference was less predictive. The relevant resting-state brain areas of microexpression M were some frontal lobes, insula, cingulate cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, fusiform gyrus, parietal lobe, caudate nucleus, precuneus, thalamus, putamen, temporal lobe, and cerebellum. (3) ALFFs in both eyes-closed and eyes-open resting states and ALFF difference could predict microexpression SD, and the ALFF difference was more predictive. The relevant resting-state brain areas of microexpression SD were some frontal lobes, central anterior gyrus, supplementary motor area, insula, hippocampus, amygdala, cuneus, occipital lobe, fusiform gyrus, parietal lobe, caudate nucleus, pallidum, putamen, thalamus, temporal lobe, and cerebellum. (4) There were many similar relevant resting-state brain areas, such as brain areas of expression recognition, microexpressions consciousness and attention, and the change from expression backgrounds to microexpression, and some different relevant resting-state brain areas, such as precuneus, insula, and pallidum, between microexpression M and SD. The ALFF difference was more sensitive to PREMERT fluctuations.</p>

<p>Mitochondria are highly specialized organelles essential for the synapse, and their impairment contributes to the neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Previously, we studied the role of caspase-3–cleaved tau in mitochondrial dysfunction in AD. In neurons, the presence of this AD-relevant tau form induced mitochondrial fragmentation with a concomitant reduction in the expression of Opa1, a mitochondrial fission regulator. More importantly, we showed that caspase-cleaved tau affects mitochondrial transport, decreasing the number of moving mitochondria in the neuronal processes without affecting their velocity rate. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in these events are unknown. We studied the possible role of motor proteins (kinesin 1 and dynein) and mitochondrial protein adaptors (RhoT1/T2, syntaphilin, and TRAK2) in the mitochondrial transport failure induced by caspase-cleaved tau. We expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP), GFP-full-length, and GPF-caspase-3–cleaved tau proteins in rat hippocampal neurons and immortalized cortical neurons (CN 1.4) and analyzed the expression and localization of these proteins involved in mitochondrial transport regulation. We observed that hippocampal neurons expressing caspase-cleaved tau showed a significant accumulation of a mitochondrial population in the soma. These changes were accompanied by evident mitochondrial bioenergetic deficits, including depolarization, oxidative stress, and a significant reduction in ATP production. More critically, caspase-cleaved tau significantly decreased the expression of TRAK2 in immortalized and primary hippocampal neurons without affecting RhoT1/T2 and syntaphilin levels. Also, when we analyzed the expression of motor proteins—Kinesin 1 (KIF5) and Dynein—we did not detect changes in their expression, localization, and binding to the mitochondria. Interestingly, the expression of truncated tau significantly increases the association of TRAK2 with mitochondria compared with neuronal cells expressing full-length tau. Altogether these results indicate that caspase-cleaved tau may affect mitochondrial transport through the increase of TRAK2–mitochondria binding and reduction of ATP production available for the process of movement of these organelles. These observations are novel and represent a set of exciting findings whereby tau pathology could affect mitochondrial distribution in neurons, an event that may contribute to synaptic failure observed in AD.</p>

<p>Astrocytes are commonly identified by their expression of the intermediate filament protein glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). GFAP-immunoreactive (GFAP-IR) astrocytes exhibit regional heterogeneity in density and morphology in the mouse brain as well as morphological diversity in the human cortex. However, regional variations in astrocyte distribution and morphology remain to be assessed comprehensively. This was the overarching objective of this postmortem study, which mainly exploited the immunolabeling of vimentin (VIM), an intermediate filament protein expressed by astrocytes and endothelial cells which presents the advantage of more extensively labeling cell structures. We compared the densities of vimentin-immunoreactive (VIM-IR) and GFAP-IR astrocytes in various brain regions (prefrontal and primary visual cortex, caudate nucleus, mediodorsal thalamus) from male individuals having died suddenly in the absence of neurological or psychiatric conditions. The morphometric properties of VIM-IR in these brain regions were also assessed. We found that VIM-IR astrocytes generally express the canonical astrocytic markers Aldh1L1 and GFAP but that VIM-IR astrocytes are less abundant than GFAP-IR astrocytes in all human brain regions, particularly in the thalamus, where VIM-IR cells were nearly absent. About 20% of all VIM-IR astrocytes presented a twin cell morphology, a phenomenon rarely observed for GFAP-IR astrocytes. Furthermore VIM-IR astrocytes in the striatum were often seen to extend numerous parallel processes which seemed to give rise to large VIM-IR fiber bundles projecting over long distances. Moreover, morphometric analyses revealed that VIM-IR astrocytes were more complex than their mouse counterparts in functionally homologous brain regions, as has been previously reported for GFAP-IR astrocytes. Lastly, the density of GFAP-IR astrocytes in gray and white matter were inversely correlated with vascular density, but for VIM-IR astrocytes this was only the case in gray matter, suggesting that gliovascular interactions may especially influence the regional heterogeneity of GFAP-IR astrocytes. Taken together, these findings reveal special features displayed uniquely by human VIM-IR astrocytes and illustrate that astrocytes display important region- and marker-specific differences in the healthy human brain.</p>

<p>Graphical, voxel, and region-based analysis has become a popular approach to studying neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and its prodromal stage [mild cognitive impairment (MCI)]. These methods have been used previously for classification or discrimination of AD in subjects in a prodromal stage called stable MCI (MCIs), which does not convert to AD but remains stable over a period of time, and converting MCI (MCIc), which converts to AD, but the results reported across similar studies are often inconsistent. Furthermore, the classification accuracy for MCIs vs. MCIc is limited. In this study, we propose combining different neuroimaging modalities (sMRI, FDG-PET, AV45-PET, DTI, and rs-fMRI) with the apolipoprotein-E genotype to form a multimodal system for the discrimination of AD, and to increase the classification accuracy. Initially, we used two well-known analyses to extract features from each neuroimage for the discrimination of AD: whole-brain parcelation analysis (or region-based analysis), and voxel-wise analysis (or voxel-based morphometry). We also investigated graphical analysis (nodal and group) for all six binary classification groups (AD vs. HC, MCIs vs. MCIc, AD vs. MCIc, AD vs. MCIs, HC vs. MCIc, and HC vs. MCIs). Data for a total of 129 subjects (33 AD, 30 MCIs, 31 MCIc, and 35 HCs) for each imaging modality were obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) homepage. These data also include two APOE genotype data points for the subjects. Moreover, we used the 2-mm AICHA atlas with the NiftyReg registration toolbox to extract 384 brain regions from each PET (FDG and AV45) and sMRI image. For the rs-fMRI images, we used the DPARSF toolbox in MATLAB for the automatic extraction of data and the results for REHO, ALFF, and fALFF. We also used the pyClusterROI script for the automatic parcelation of each rs-fMRI image into 200 brain regions. For the DTI images, we used the FSL (Version 6.0) toolbox for the extraction of fractional anisotropy (FA) images to calculate a tract-based spatial statistic. Moreover, we used the PANDA toolbox to obtain 50 white-matter-region-parcellated FA images on the basis of the 2-mm JHU-ICBM-labeled template atlas. To integrate the different modalities and different complementary information into one form, and to optimize the classifier, we used the multiple kernel learning (MKL) framework. The obtained results indicated that our multimodal approach yields a significant improvement in accuracy over any single modality alone. The areas under the curve obtained by the proposed method were 97.78, 96.94, 95.56, 96.25, 96.67, and 96.59% for AD vs. HC, MCIs vs. MCIc, AD vs. MCIc, AD vs. MCIs, HC vs. MCIc, and HC vs. MCIs binary classification, respectively. Our proposed multimodal method improved the classification result for MCIs vs. MCIc groups compared with the unimodal classification results. Our study found that the (left/right) precentral region was present in all six binary classification groups (this region can be considered the most significant region). Furthermore, using nodal network topology, we found that FDG, AV45-PET, and rs-fMRI were the most important neuroimages, and showed many affected regions relative to other modalities. We also compared our results with recently published results.</p>

<p>The importance of early interventions in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) emphasizes the need to accurately and efficiently identify at-risk individuals. Although many dementia prediction models have been developed, there are fewer studies focusing on detection of brain pathology. We developed a model for identification of amyloid-PET positivity using data on demographics, vascular factors, cognition, APOE genotype, and structural MRI, including regional brain volumes, cortical thickness and a visual medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) rating. We also analyzed the relative importance of different factors when added to the overall model. The model used baseline data from the Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) exploratory PET sub-study. Participants were at risk for dementia, but without dementia or cognitive impairment. Their mean age was 71 years. Participants underwent a brain 3T MRI and PiB-PET imaging. PiB images were visually determined as positive or negative. Cognition was measured using a modified version of the Neuropsychological Test Battery. Body mass index (BMI) and hypertension were used as cardiovascular risk factors in the model. Demographic factors included age, gender and years of education. The model was built using the Disease State Index (DSI) machine learning algorithm. Of the 48 participants, 20 (42%) were rated as Aβ positive. Compared with the Aβ negative group, the Aβ positive group had a higher proportion of APOE ε4 carriers (53 vs. 14%), lower executive functioning, lower brain volumes, and higher visual MTA rating. AUC [95% CI] for the complete model was 0.78 [0.65–0.91]. MRI was the most effective factor, especially brain volumes and visual MTA rating but not cortical thickness. APOE was nearly as effective as MRI in improving detection of amyloid positivity. The model with the best performance (AUC 0.82 [0.71–0.93]) was achieved by combining APOE and MRI. Our findings suggest that combining demographic data, vascular risk factors, cognitive performance, APOE genotype, and brain MRI measures can help identify Aβ positivity. Detecting amyloid positivity could reduce invasive and costly assessments during the screening process in clinical trials.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59136">Neuropathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection</a></h4>

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 has recently emerged as a serious jolt to human life and economy. Initial knowledge established pulmonary complications as the chief symptom, however, the neurological aspect of the disease is also becoming increasingly evident. Emerging reports of encephalopathies and similar ailments with the detection of the virus in the CSF has elicited an urgent need for investigating the possibility of neuroinvasiveness of the virus, which cannot be ruled out given the expression of low levels of ACE2 receptors in the brain. Sensory impairments of the olfactory and gustatory systems have also been reported in a large proportion of the cases, indicating the involvement of the peripheral nervous system. Hence, the possibility of neurological damage caused by the virus demands immediate attention and investigation of the mechanisms involved, so as to customize the treatment of patients presenting with neurological complications.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59053">Long non-coding RNAs in regulation of adipogenesis and adipose tissue function</a></h4>

Complex interaction between genetics, epigenetics, environment, and nutrition affect the physiological activities of adipose tissues and their dysfunctions, which lead to several metabolic diseases including obesity or type 2 diabetes. Here, adipogenesis appears to be a process characterized by an intricate network that involves many transcription factors and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that regulate gene expression. LncRNAs are being investigated to determine their contribution to adipose tissue development and function. LncRNAs possess multiple cellular functions, and they regulate chromatin remodeling, along with transcriptional and post-transcriptional events; in this way, they affect gene expression. New investigations have demonstrated the pivotal role of these molecules in modulating white and brown/beige adipogenic tissue development and activity. This review aims to provide an update on the role of lncRNAs in adipogenesis and adipose tissue function to promote identification of new drug targets for treating obesity and related metabolic diseases.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59038">Molecular principles of assembly, activation, and inhibition in epithelial sodium channel</a></h4>

The molecular bases of heteromeric assembly and link between Na<sup>+</sup> self-inhibition and protease-sensitivity in epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) are not fully understood. Previously, we demonstrated that ENaC subunits – α, β, and γ – assemble in a counterclockwise configuration when viewed from outside the cell with the protease-sensitive GRIP domains in the periphery (Noreng et al., 2018). Here we describe the structure of ENaC resolved by cryo-electron microscopy at 3 Å. We find that a combination of precise domain arrangement and complementary hydrogen bonding network defines the subunit arrangement. Furthermore, we determined that the α subunit has a primary functional module consisting of the finger and GRIP domains. The module is bifurcated by the α2 helix dividing two distinct regulatory sites: Na<sup>+</sup> and the inhibitory peptide. Removal of the inhibitory peptide perturbs the Na<sup>+</sup> site via the α2 helix highlighting the critical role of the α2 helix in regulating ENaC function.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58625">Keratinocytes contribute to normal cold and heat sensation</a></h4>

Keratinocytes are the most abundant cell type in the epidermis, the most superficial layer of skin. Historically, epidermal-innervating sensory neurons were thought to be the exclusive detectors and transmitters of environmental stimuli. However, recent work from our lab (Moehring et al., 2018) and others (Baumbauer et al., 2015) has demonstrated that keratinocytes are also critical for normal mechanotransduction and mechanically-evoked behavioral responses in mice. Here, we asked whether keratinocyte activity is also required for normal cold and heat sensation. Using calcium imaging, we determined that keratinocyte cold activity is conserved across mammalian species and requires the release of intracellular calcium through one or more unknown cold-sensitive proteins. Both epidermal cell optogenetic inhibition and interruption of ATP-P2X4 signaling reduced reflexive behavioral responses to cold and heat stimuli. Based on these data and our previous findings, keratinocyte purinergic signaling is a modality-conserved amplification system that is required for normal somatosensation <i>in vivo</i>.

Nanodiscs are membrane mimetics that consist of a protein belt surrounding a lipid bilayer, and are broadly used for characterization of membrane proteins. Here, we investigate the structure, dynamics and biophysical properties of two small nanodiscs, MSP1D1ΔH5 and ΔH4H5. We combine our SAXS and SANS experiments with molecular dynamics simulations and previously obtained NMR and EPR data to derive and validate a conformational ensemble that represents the structure and dynamics of the nanodisc. We find that it displays conformational heterogeneity with various elliptical shapes, and with substantial differences in lipid ordering in the centre and rim of the discs. Together, our results reconcile previous apparently conflicting observations about the shape of nanodiscs, and paves the way for future integrative studies of larger complex systems such as membrane proteins embedded in nanodiscs.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56259">Convergent changes in muscle metabolism depend on duration of high-altitude ancestry across Andean waterfowl</a></h4>

High-altitude environments require that animals meet the metabolic O<sub>2</sub> demands for locomotion and thermogenesis in O<sub>2</sub>-thin air, but the degree to which convergent metabolic changes have arisen across independent high-altitude lineages or the speed at which such changes arise is unclear. We examined seven high-altitude waterfowl that have inhabited the Andes (3812-4806m elevation) over varying evolutionary time scales, to elucidate changes in biochemical pathways of energy metabolism in flight muscle relative to low-altitude sister-taxa. Convergent changes across high-altitude taxa included increased hydroxyacyl-coA dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase activities, decreased lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, creatine kinase, and cytochrome c oxidase activities, and increased myoglobin content. ATP synthase activity increased in only the longest established high-altitude taxa, whereas hexokinase activity increased in only newly established taxa. Therefore, changes in pathways of lipid oxidation, glycolysis, and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation are common strategies to cope with high-altitude hypoxia, but some changes require longer evolutionary time to arise.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56168">Apoptotic neurodegeneration in whitefly promotes the spread of TYLCV</a></h4>

The mechanism by which plant viruses manipulate the behavior of insect vectors has largely been described as indirect manipulation through modifications of the host plant. However, little is known about the direct interaction of the plant virus on the nervous system of its insect vector, and the substantial behavioral effect on virus transmission. Using a system consisting of a <i>Tomato yellow leaf curl virus</i> (TYLCV) and its insect vector whitefly, we found that TYLCV caused caspase-dependent apoptotic neurodegeneration with severe vacuolar neuropathological lesions in the brain of viruliferous whitefly by inducing a putative inflammatory signaling cascade of innate immunity. The sensory defects caused by neurodegeneration removed the steady preference of whitefly for virus-infected plants, thereby enhancing the probability of the virus to enter uninfected hosts, and eventually benefit TYLCV spread among the plant community. These findings provide a neuromechanism for virus transmission to modify its associated insect vector behavior.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55714">A unified computational model for cortical post-synaptic plasticity</a></h4>

Signalling pathways leading to post-synaptic plasticity have been examined in many types of experimental studies, but a unified picture on how multiple biochemical pathways collectively shape neocortical plasticity is missing. We built a biochemically detailed model of post-synaptic plasticity describing CaMKII, PKA, and PKC pathways and their contribution to synaptic potentiation or depression. We developed a statistical AMPA-receptor-tetramer model, which permits the estimation of the AMPA-receptor-mediated maximal synaptic conductance based on numbers of GluR1s and GluR2s predicted by the biochemical signalling model. We show that our model reproduces neuromodulator-gated spike-timing-dependent plasticity as observed in the visual cortex and can be fit to data from many cortical areas, uncovering the biochemical contributions of the pathways pinpointed by the underlying experimental studies. Our model explains the dependence of different forms of plasticity on the availability of different proteins and can be used for the study of mental disorder-associated impairments of cortical plasticity.

Following testicular spermatogenesis, mammalian sperm continue to mature in a long epithelial tube known as the epididymis, which plays key roles in remodeling sperm protein, lipid, and RNA composition. To understand the roles for the epididymis in reproductive biology, we generated a single cell atlas of the murine epididymis and vas deferens. We recovered key epithelial cell types including principal cells, clear cells, and basal cells, along with associated support cells that include fibroblasts, smooth muscle, macrophages and other immune cells. Moreover, our data illuminate extensive regional specialization of principal cell populations across the length of the epididymis. In addition to region-specific specialization of principal cells, we find evidence for functionally specialized subpopulations of stromal cells, and, most notably, two distinct populations of clear cells. Our dataset extends on existing knowledge of epididymal biology, and provides a wealth of information on potential regulatory and signaling factors that bear future investigation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55395">Revealing the structure of information flows discriminates similar animal social behaviors</a></h4>

Behavioral correlations stretching over time are an essential but often neglected aspect of interactions among animals. These correlations pose a challenge to current behavioral-analysis methods that lack effective means to analyze complex series of interactions. Here we show that non-invasive information-theoretic tools can be used to reveal communication protocols that guide complex social interactions by measuring simultaneous flows of different types of information between subjects. We demonstrate this approach by showing that the tandem-running behavior of the ant <i>Temnothorax rugatulus</i> and that of the termites <i>Coptotermes formosanus</i> and <i>Reticulitermes speratus</i> are governed by different communication protocols. Our discovery reconciles the diverse ultimate causes of tandem running across these two taxa with their apparently similar signaling mechanisms. We show that bidirectional flow of information is present only in ants and is consistent with the use of acknowledgement signals to regulate the flow of directional information.

Agarwal et al. show that the post-translational modification of SUMO-conjugation of proteins (SUMOylation) in pain-sensing neurons regulates sensory ion channels and metabolic enzymes governing energy production. Reduced SUMOylation in diabetes leads to metabolic arrest and accumulation of toxic metabolites, driving neuropathy and sensory loss. Enhancing SUMOylation may reverse diabetic neuropathy.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Poor sociability and aggressive behavior are key clinical features of opioid use disorders. The corticotropin‐releasing factor (CRF) system may mediate behavioral effects of substances of abuse <i>but </i> its implication in substance‐induced social behavior deficits and outward‐directed hostility remains largely unknown. CRF signaling is mediated by two receptor types, termed CRF<sub>1</sub> and CRF<sub>2</sub>. The present study aimed at understanding the role for the CRF<sub>1</sub> receptor in social and aggressive behavior induced by withdrawal from repeated opiate administration. Thus, wild‐type (CRF<sub>1</sub>+/+), CRF<sub>1</sub> receptor heterozygous (CRF<sub>1</sub>+/−), and null mutant (CRF<sub>1</sub>−/−) female and male mice were treated with saline or escalating doses of morphine (20‐100 mg/kg, i.p.) during six consecutive days and tested in the three‐chamber task for sociability (i.e., preference for an unfamiliar same‐sex conspecific vs. an object) 7 days after the last administration. Moreover, aggressive biting behavior toward the unfamiliar conspecific was assessed during the three‐chamber test. Opiate withdrawal disrupted sociability in CRF<sub>1</sub>+/+ and CRF<sub>1</sub>+/−, <i>but not </i> in CRF<sub>1</sub>−/−, female mice, without affecting aggressive biting behavior in any genotype. In contrast, opiate withdrawal did not affect sociability <i>but </i> increased aggressive biting behavior in male mice, independently of CRF<sub>1</sub> receptor‐deficiency. Nevertheless, in opiate‐withdrawn CRF<sub>1</sub>+/+, <i>but not </i> CRF<sub>1</sub>+/− and CRF<sub>1</sub>−/−, male mice, sociability directly correlated with aggressive biting behavior, suggesting a role for the CRF<sub>1</sub> receptor in hostility‐linked social approach. These findings demonstrate the implication of the CRF<sub>1</sub> receptor in social behavior deficits associated with repeated opiate administration and withdrawal, revealing a new potential target for the treatment of opioid use disorders.</p>

<p>cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) was evaluated for its role in physical activity motivation of wild‐type (WT) and low voluntary wheel‐running (LVR) rats. Elevated CREB activity has been associated with reward deficits and was found to be higher in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of LVR rats. Reducing NAc activity through Gi‐DREADDs, pharmacology (C646/SR11302), and environmental enrichment increased LVR wheel‐running behavior. These findings highlight a potential molecular pathway important for the motivation to be physically active.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Given the integral role of nucleus accumbens (NAc) cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) activity in motivational processes, the goal of the current study was to determine whether blunting chronic NAc CREB activity could rescue the low physical activity motivation of female, low voluntary running (LVR) rats. NAc CREB phosphorylation is elevated in these rats, a state previously attributed to deficits in reward valuation. It was recently shown that overexpression of the upstream CREB inhibitor, protein kinase inhibitor alpha (PKIα), increased LVR nightly running by ~threefold. Therefore, the current study addresses the extent to which NAc CREB attenuation influences female LVR and wild‐type (WT) wheel‐running behavior. Inducible reductions in NAc neuronal activity using Gi‐coupled hM4Di DREADDs increased running behavior in LVR, but not in WT, rats. Similarly, site‐directed pharmacological inhibition of NAc CREB activity significantly increased LVR nightly running distance and time by ~twofold, with no effect in WT rats. Finally, environmentally enriched LVR rats exhibit higher levels of running compared to socially isolated rats in what appeared to be a CREB‐related manner. Considering the positive outcomes of upstream CREB modulation and environmental enrichment on LVR behavior, we believe that blunting NAc CREB activity has the neuromolecular potential to partially reverse low physical activity motivation, as exemplified by the LVR model. The positive physical activity outcome of early life enrichment adds translatable value to human childhood enrichment and highlights its importance on motivational processes later in life.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Endothelial microvesicles (EMVs) could reflect the status of endothelial cells (ECs) which are involved in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke (IS). MiR‐155 could regulate EC functions. However, their roles in IS remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the levels of plasma EMVs and EMVs carrying miRNA‐155 (EMVs‐miR‐155) in IS patients to explore their potential roles as biomarkers. Ninety‐three IS patients and 70 controls were recruited in this study. The levels of circulating EMVs and EMVs‐miR‐155 were detected by fluorescence nanoparticle tracking analysis and quantitative real‐time PCR, respectively. The correlations between level of EMVs/EMVs‐miR‐155 and the onset time, severity, infarct volume, and subtypes of IS were analyzed. The severity and infarct volume were assessed by NIHSS and magnetic resonance imaging, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the risk factors of IS. The ROC curve and area under ROC curve (AUC) of EMVs and EMVs‐miR‐155 were determined. The levels of plasma EMVs and EMVs‐miR‐155 were increased significantly in acute and subacute stages of IS and remained unchanged in chronic stage, and were positively related to the infarct volume and NIHSS scores and were associated with large artery atherosclerosis and cardioembolism subtypes defined by Trial of Org 10 172 in acute stroke treatment (TOAST) classification. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that plasma EMVs and EMVs‐miR‐155 were significant and independent risk factors of IS and their AUC were 0.778 and 0.851, respectively, and increased to 0.892 after combination. Our study suggests that plasma EMVs and EMVs‐miR‐155 are promising biomarkers for IS. The diagnostic value of EMVs‐miR‐155 is higher and their combination is the best.</p>

<p>We engrafted RFP‐expressing astrocytes differentiated from hiPSCs into the cortex of immunodeficient mice neonatally. Nine months post engraftment, the human astrocytes in the superficial cortex developed into interlaminar astrocytes that mimicked the interlaminar astrocytes architecture of the adult human cortex. This chimeric mouse model will enable the study of human‐specific interlaminar astrocytes in vivo.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Astrocytes, a highly heterogeneous population of glial cells, serve as essential regulators of brain development and homeostasis. The heterogeneity of astrocyte populations underlies the diversity in their functions. In addition to the typical mammalian astrocyte architecture, the cerebral cortex of humans exhibits a radial distribution of interlaminar astrocytes in the supragranular layers. These primate‐specific interlaminar astrocytes are located in the superficial layer and project long processes traversing multiple layers of the cerebral cortex. However, due to the lack of accessible experimental models, their functional properties and their role in regulating neuronal circuits remain unclear. Here we modeled human interlaminar astrocytes in humanized glial chimeric mice by engrafting astrocytes differentiated from human‐induced pluripotent stem cells into the mouse cortex. This model provides a novel platform for understanding neuron‐glial interaction and its alterations in neurological diseases.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Lithium is widely used to treat bipolar disorder. However, the efficacy and vulnerability as to its side effects are known to differ. Although the specific biochemical mechanism of action is still elusive, lithium may influence mitochondrial function, and consequently, metabolism. Lithium exposure in this study was conducted on a unique set of mito‐nuclear introgression lines of <i>Drosophila subobscura </i> to disentangle the independent effects of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) against a common nuclear DNA background. The study addressed three issues: (a) whether lithium has a dose‐dependent effect on whole‐organism metabolic rate, (b) whether mtDNA haplotypes show divergent metabolic efficiency measured by metabolic rate to lithium exposure and (c) whether lithium influences the whole‐organism metabolic rate across sexes. The results confirm that lithium influenced the whole‐organism metabolic rate, showing a subtle balance between efficacy and adverse effects within a narrow dose range. In addition, lithium exposure was found to influence metabolism differently based on mtDNA haplotypes and sex. This preliminary research may have a range of biological implications for the role of mitochondrial variability in psychiatric disease and treatment by contributing to the understanding and predicting of the lithium treatment response and risk for toxic side effects.</p>

<p>“Stem cell tourism,” the practice of offering unproven cellular preparations to patients as approved therapy, is rising in neurology. Currently, the experiences of patients and reported complications from these procedures are unknown in the United States. We evaluate academic neurologists' experiences with stem cell tourism and assess perceived competency on discussing this topic with patients. We found a lack of neurologist preparedness to discuss stem cell therapies with patients and an alarming list of unreported complications from these unregulated procedures. We also identified an urgent need for neurologist education and the creation of a national registry for reporting patient complications resulting from experimental stem cell interventions.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The variegated pelage and social complexity of the African wild dog (<i>Lycaon pictus </i>) hint at the possibility of specializations of the visual system. Here, using a range of architectural and immunohistochemical stains, we describe the systems‐level organization of the image‐forming, non‐image forming, oculomotor, and accessory optic, vision‐associated systems in the brain of one representative individual of the African wild dog. For all of these systems, the organization, in terms of location, parcellation and topology (internal and external), is very similar to that reported in other carnivores. The image‐forming visual system consists of the superior colliculus, visual dorsal thalamus (dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, pulvinar and lateral posterior nucleus) and visual cortex (occipital, parietal, suprasylvian, temporal and splenial visual regions). The non‐image forming visual system comprises the suprachiasmatic nucleus, ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, pretectal nuclear complex and the Edinger‐Westphal nucleus. The oculomotor system incorporates the oculomotor, trochlear and abducens cranial nerve nuclei as well as the parabigeminal nucleus, while the accessory optic system includes the dorsal, lateral and medial terminal nuclei. The extent of similarity to other carnivores in the systems‐level organization of these systems indicates that the manner in which these systems process visual information is likely to be consistent with that found, for example, in the well‐studied domestic cat. It would appear that the sociality of the African wild dog is dependent upon the processing of information extracted from the visual system in the higher‐order cognitive and affective neural systems.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00042">A History of Corollary Discharge: Contributions of Mormyrid Weakly Electric Fish</a></h4>

<p>Corollary discharge is an important brain function that allows animals to distinguish external from self-generated signals, which is critical to sensorimotor coordination. Since discovery of the concept of corollary discharge in 1950, neuroscientists have sought to elucidate underlying neural circuits and mechanisms. Here, we review a history of neurophysiological studies on corollary discharge and highlight significant contributions from studies using African mormyrid weakly electric fish. Mormyrid fish generate brief electric pulses to communicate with other fish and to sense their surroundings. In addition, mormyrids can passively locate weak, external electric signals. These three behaviors are mediated by different corollary discharge functions including inhibition, enhancement, and predictive “negative image” generation. Owing to several experimental advantages of mormyrids, investigations of these mechanisms have led to important general principles that have proven applicable to a wide diversity of animal species.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00781">Tremor in Vascular Cognitive Impairment Raises the Possibility of Mixed Pathology With Lewy Body Disease</a></h4>

Objectives<p>Tremor is common in patients with Lewy body disease (LBD) and not rare in normal individuals. Prevalence of tremor in patients with vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) and its association with other comorbidities are seldom studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the patient characteristics of VCI associated with tremor and to evaluate the possibility of mixed pathology with LBD in these patients.</p>Methods<p>Retrospective analysis of a large population with VCI registered in the database of a regional healthcare system was performed. VCI patients were divided into tremor and non-tremor groups. The associated characteristics including demographics, clinical features in motor and non-motor domains, vascular risk factors, and neuroimaging features were compared between the tremor group and the non-tremor group.</p>Results<p>Among 1337 patients with VCI, 292 (21.8%) had tremor, while 1045 (78.2%) did not have tremor. The tremor group had significantly higher prevalence of all motor and non-motor LBD clinical features than the non-tremor group. The tremor group also demonstrated more severe neuropsychiatric symptoms. Among patients with tremor, patients having tremor onset earlier than stroke onset showed significantly higher prevalence of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder. All comparisons were adjusted for age and severity of dementia.</p>Conclusion<p>Tremor is a common comorbidity of VCI. VCI patients with tremor had a higher prevalence of motor and non-motor LBD features. These findings raised the possibility of VCI patients with tremor having high possibility of mixed pathology with LBD.</p>

<p>The mechanistic target of rapamycin protein complex, mTORC1, has received attention in recent years for its role in aging and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Numerous excellent reviews have been written on the pathways and drug targeting of this keystone regulator of metabolism. However, none have specifically highlighted several important nuances of mTOR regulation as relates to neurodegeneration. Herein, we focus on six such nuances/open questions: (1) “Antagonistic pleiotropy” – Should we weigh the beneficial anabolic functions of mTORC1 against its harmful inhibition of autophagy? (2) “Early/late-stage specificity” – Does the relative importance of these neuroprotective/neurotoxic actions change as a disease progresses? (3) “Regional specificity” – Does mTOR signaling respond differently to the same interventions in different brain regions? (4) “Disease specificity” – Could the same intervention to inhibit mTORC1 help in one disease and cause harm in another disease? (5) “Personalized therapy” – Might genetically-informed personalized therapies that inhibit particular nodes in the mTORC1 regulatory network be more effective than generalized therapies? (6) “Lifestyle interventions” – Could specific diets, micronutrients, or exercise alter mTORC1 signaling to prevent or improve the progression neurodegenerative diseases? This manuscript is devoted to discussing recent research findings that offer insights into these gaps in the literature, with the aim of inspiring further inquiry.</p>

Objective<p>To evaluate amyloid-β deposition with <sup>18</sup>F-florbetaben (FBB) PET imaging against <sup>11</sup>C-PIB PET in cognitive normal controls (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients.</p>Methods<p>We recruited 45 subjects (15 in each group of NC, MCI, and mild/moderate AD) who had undergone dynamic <sup>18</sup>F-FBB amyloid PET imaging. For comparison study, 17 participants, including six NC, five MCI, and six AD patients, also underwent <sup>11</sup>C-PIB PET imaging on separate days. Standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) were calculated using the cerebellar cortex as the reference region with regions of interest (ROI) manually defined on co-registered CT.

In the comparison study, one NC participant, five MCI patients, and five AD patients had amyloid-positive lesions on <sup>11</sup>C-PIB PET images. There was a significant linear correlation (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.81, P &lt; 0.001) between <sup>18</sup>F-FBB and PIB global SUVR values.

<p>Knowledge of lipid droplets (LDs) has evolved from simple depots of lipid storage to dynamic and functionally active organelles involved in a variety of cellular functions. Studies have now informed significant roles for LDs in cellular signaling, metabolic disease, and inflammation. While lipid droplet biology has been well explored in peripheral organs such as the liver and heart, LDs within the brain are relatively understudied. The presence and function of these dynamic organelles in the central nervous system has recently gained attention, especially in the context of neurodegeneration. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of LDs within the brain, with an emphasis on their relevance in neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>Alternating current stimulation is a promising method for the study and treatment of various visual neurological dysfunctions as well as progressive understanding of the healthy brain. Unfortunately, due to the current stimulation artifact, problems remain in the context of analysis of the electroencephalography (EEG) signal recorded during ongoing stimulation. To address this problem, we propose the use of a simple moving average subtraction as a method for artifact elimination. This method involves the creation of a template of the stimulation artifact from EEG signal recorded during non-invasive electrical stimulation with a sinusoidal alternating current. The present report describes results of the effects of a simple moving average filtration that varies based on averaging parameters; in particular, we varied the number of sinusoidal periods per segment of the recorded signal and the number of segments used to construct an artifact template. Given the ongoing lack of a mathematical model that allows for the prediction of the “hidden” EEG signal with the alternating current stimulation artifact, we propose performing an earlier simulation that is based on the addition of artificial stimulation artifact to the known EEG signal. This solution allows for the optimization of filtering parameters with detailed knowledge about the accuracy of artifact removal. The algorithm, designed in the MATLAB environment, has been tested on data recorded from two volunteers subjected to sinusoidal transorbital alternating current stimulation. Analysis of the percentage difference between the original and filtered signal in time and frequency domain highlights the advantage of 1-period filtration.</p>

<p>For more than two decades, a network of face-selective brain regions has been identified as the core system for face processing, including occipital face area (OFA), fusiform face area (FFA), and posterior region of superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). Moreover, recent studies have suggested that the ventral route of face processing and memory should end at the anterior temporal lobes (i.e., vATLs), which may play an important role bridging face perception and face memory. It is not entirely clear, however, the extent to which neural activities in these face-selective regions can effectively predict behavioral performance on tasks that are frequently used to investigate face processing and face memory test that requires recognition beyond variation in pose and lighting, especially when non-Caucasian East Asian faces are involved. To address these questions, we first identified during a functional scan the core face network by asking participants to perform a one-back task, while viewing either static images or dynamic videos. Dynamic localizers were effective in identifying regions of interest (ROIs) in the core face-processing system. We then correlated the brain activities of core ROIs with performances on face-processing tasks (component, configural, and composite) and face memory test (Taiwanese Face Memory Test, TFMT) and found evidence for limited predictability. We next adopted an multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) approach to further explore the predictability of face-selective brain regions on TFMT performance and found evidence suggesting that a basic visual processing area such as calcarine and an area for structural face processing such as OFA may play an even greater role in memorizing faces. Implications regarding how differences in processing demands between behavioral and neuroimaging tasks and cultural specificity in face-processing and memory strategies among participants may have contributed to the findings reported here are discussed.</p>

<p>Reliable propagation of slow-modulations of the firing rate across multiple layers of a feedforward network (FFN) has proven difficult to capture in spiking neural models. In this paper, we explore necessary conditions for reliable and stable propagation of time-varying asynchronous spikes whose instantaneous rate of changes—in fairly short time windows [20–100] msec—represents information of slow fluctuations of the stimulus. Specifically, we study the effect of network size, level of background synaptic noise, and the variability of synaptic delays in an FFN with all-to-all connectivity. We show that network size and the level of background synaptic noise, together with the strength of synapses, are substantial factors enabling the propagation of asynchronous spikes in deep layers of an FFN. In contrast, the variability of synaptic delays has a minor effect on signal propagation.</p>

<p>Hearing loss is the third most common chronic health condition in the United States and largely results from damage to sensory hair cells. Major causes of hair cell damage include aging, noise exposure, and medications such as aminoglycoside antibiotics. Due to their potent antibacterial properties and low cost, aminoglycosides are often used for the treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections, surpassing expensive antibiotics with fewer harmful side effects. However, their use is coupled with permanent hearing loss in over 20% of patients requiring these life-sustaining antibiotics. There are currently no FDA-approved drugs that prevent hearing loss from aminoglycosides. A previous study by our group identified the plant alkaloid berbamine as a strong protectant of zebrafish lateral line hair cells from aminoglycoside damage. This effect is likely due to a block of the mechanotransduction channel, thereby reducing aminoglycoside entry into hair cells. The present study builds on this previous work, investigating 16 synthetic berbamine analogs to determine the core structure underlying their protective mechanisms. We demonstrate that nearly all of these berbamine analogs robustly protect lateral line hair cells from ototoxic damage, with ED<sub>50</sub> values nearing 20 nM for the most potent analogs. Of the 16 analogs tested, nine strongly protected hair cells from both neomycin and gentamicin damage, while one conferred strong protection only from gentamicin. These data are consistent with prior research demonstrating that different aminoglycosides activate somewhat distinct mechanisms of damage. Regardless of the mechanism, protection required the entire berbamine scaffold. Phenolic alkylation or acylation with lipophilic groups appeared to improve protection compared to berbamine, implying that these structures may be responsible for mitigating damage. While the majority of analogs confer protection by blocking aminoglycoside uptake, 18% of our analogs also confer protection via an uptake-independent mechanism; these analogs exhibited protection when delivered after aminoglycoside removal. Based on our studies, berbamine analogs represent a promising tool to further understand the pathology of aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss and can serve as lead compounds to develop otoprotective drugs.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00228">Purkinje Cell-Specific Knockout of Tyrosine Hydroxylase Impairs Cognitive Behaviors</a></h4>

<p>Tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) expression has previously been reported in Purkinje cells (PCs) of rodents and humans, but its role in the regulation of behavior is not understood. Catecholamines are well known for facilitating cognitive behaviors and are expressed in many regions of the brain. Here, we investigated a possible role in cognitive behaviors of PC catecholamines, by mapping and testing functional roles of Th positive PCs in mice. Comprehensive mapping analyses revealed a distinct population of Th expressing PCs primarily in the posterior and lateral regions of the cerebellum (comprising about 18% of all PCs). To identify the role of PC catecholamines, we selectively knocked out Th in PCs using a conditional knockout approach, by crossing a Purkinje cell-selective Cre recombinase line, Pcp2-Cre, with a floxed tyrosine hydroxylase mouse line (Th<sup>lox/lox</sup>) to produce Pcp2-Cre;Th<sup>lox/lox</sup> mice. This manipulation resulted in approximately 50% reduction of Th protein expression in the cerebellar cortex and lateral cerebellar nucleus, but no reduction of Th in the locus coeruleus, which is known to innervate the cerebellum in mice. Pcp2-Cre;Th<sup>lox/lox</sup> mice showed impairments in behavioral flexibility, response inhibition, social recognition memory, and associative fear learning relative to littermate controls, but no deficits in gross motor, sensory, instrumental learning, or sensorimotor gating functions. Catecholamines derived from specific populations of PCs appear to support cognitive functions, and their spatial distribution in the cerebellum suggests that they may underlie patterns of activation seen in human studies on the cerebellar role in cognitive function.</p>

<p>The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is the peripheral synapse that controls the coordinated movement of many organisms. The NMJ is also an archetypical model to study synaptic morphology and function. As the NMJ is the primary target of neuromuscular diseases and traumatic injuries, the establishment of suitable models to study the contribution of specific postsynaptic muscle-derived proteins on NMJ maintenance and regeneration is a permanent need. Considering the unique experimental advantages of the levator auris longus (LAL) muscle, here we present a method allowing for efficient electroporation-mediated gene transfer and subsequent detailed studies of the morphology and function of the NMJ and muscle fibers. Also, we have standardized efficient facial nerve injury protocols to analyze LAL muscle NMJ degeneration and regeneration. Our results show that the expression of a control fluorescent protein does not alter either the muscle structural organization, the apposition of the pre- and post-synaptic domains, or the functional neurotransmission parameters of the LAL muscle NMJs; in turn, the overexpression of MuSK, a major regulator of postsynaptic assembly, induces the formation of ectopic acetylcholine receptor clusters. Our NMJ denervation experiments showed complete reinnervation of LAL muscle NMJs four weeks after facial nerve injury. Together, these experimental strategies in the LAL muscle constitute effective methods to combine protein expression with accurate analyses at the levels of structure, function, and regeneration of the NMJ.</p>

<p>Neuroinflammation constitutes a fundamental cellular process to signal the loss of brain homeostasis. Glial cells play a central role in orchestrating these neuroinflammation processes in both deleterious and beneficial ways. These cellular responses depend on their intercellular interactions with neurons, astrocytes, the blood–brain barrier (BBB), and infiltrated T cells in the central nervous system (CNS). However, this intercellular crosstalk seems to be activated by specific stimuli for each different neurological scenario. This review summarizes key studies linking neuroinflammation with certain neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and for the development of better therapeutic strategies based on immunomodulation.</p>

<p>Background: The pathogenesis of dementia often starts several years prior to clinical onset during which the individual is asymptomatic. Existing strategies for the accurate diagnosis of early dementia are limited by high cost and the invasive nature of the procedures. Eye movement parameters associated with cognitive functions may be helpful in the early identification of dementia and in the development and evaluation of preventive and therapeutic strategies.</p><p>Objective: We aimed to assess differences in eye movement parameters between healthy elderly individuals and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Furthermore, we examined the correlations between eye movement parameters with cognitive functions and specific hemispheric region and neural structures in individuals with MCI.</p><p>Method: Eighty individuals with MCI without dementia (based on DSM-IV criteria) identified by community screening and 170 healthy controls were administered Chinese versions of MoCA and NTB, and a long (20 min) or short (5 min) version of a visual paired comparison (VPC) task. Two weeks later, 44 MCI patients and 107 healthy controls completed a retest of the VPC task, 44 MCI patients and 43 healthy controls among them administered a MRI. At the end of 1-year follow-up, a subset of 26 individuals with MCI and 57 healthy controls were administered the long version of VPC task and MoCA test again. Eye movement parameters and the relationship of eye movement parameters with cognitive functions and with changes in neural structures were compared between groups.</p><p>Results: Patients with MCI were older, had less education, and had lower scores on cognitive tests than healthy controls. After adjustment for age and level of education, patients with MCI had lower novelty preference scores on the VPC than healthy controls. Using the logistic regression model, the amount of time that subjects focused on these novel images could predict MCI patients from normal elderly with an out of sample area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.62. Furthermore, the cognition score of subjects whose novelty preference score was low decreased more remarkably in 1 year. For both the patient and control groups, VPC novelty preference was significantly correlated with verbal fluency and delayed and short-term memory function. Novelty preference score was also significantly correlated with the cortical thickness of several structures in the right hemisphere.</p><p>Conclusion: Eye movement parameters are stable indicators to distinguish patients with MCI and cognitively normal subjects and are not affected by different testing versions and numbers. Additionally, the patients’ cognitive deficits and eye movement indices were correlated. Future longitudinal studies should further explore the clinical utility of eye movement parameters as early markers of MCI.</p>

<p>Background: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is described as an age-related neurodegenerative disorder. However, the vast majority of research is carried out using experimental models of young animals lacking the implications of the decline processes associated with aging. It has been suggested that several molecular pathways are involved in the perpetuation of the degeneration and the neuroinflammation in PD. Among others, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) have been highly implicated in the development of PD, and regulating components of their activity are indicated as promising therapeutic targets.</p><p>Methods: To further define how MAPKs expression is related to the glial response and neuronal cell death, Parkinsonism was induced under an acute regimen in old mice. Moreover, the sacrifice was carried out at different time points (4, 8, 24, and 48 h) after 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine hydrochloride (MPTP) injections to describe the early dynamic changes over time produced by the intoxication.</p><p>Results: The results revealed that neuronal death increases as glial response increases in the nigrostriatal pathway. It was observed that both processes increase from 4 h in the ventral mesencephalon (VM), and neuronal death becomes significant at 48 h. In the striatum, they were significantly increased from 48 h after the MPTP administration compared with that in the control mice. Moreover, the p-ERK levels decrease, while phospho-p38 expression increases specifically in the striatum at 48 h after MPTP intoxication.</p><p>Conclusions: The importance of these data lies in the possibility of elucidating the underlying mechanisms of neurodegenerative processes under aging conditions to provide knowledge for the search of solutions that slow down the progression of PD.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59007">Lichen mimesis in mid-Mesozoic lacewings</a></h4>

Animals mimicking other organisms or using camouflage to deceive predators are vital survival strategies. Modern and fossil insects can simulate diverse objects. Lichens are an ancient symbiosis between a fungus and an alga or a cyanobacterium that sometimes have a plant-like appearance and occasionally are mimicked by modern animals. Nevertheless, lichen models are almost absent in fossil record of mimicry. Here, we provide the earliest fossil evidence of a mimetic relationship between the moth lacewing mimic <i>Lichenipolystoechotes</i> gen. nov. and its co-occurring fossil lichen model <i>Daohugouthallus ciliiferus</i>. We corroborate the lichen affinity of <i>D. ciliiferus</i> and document this mimetic relationship by providing structural similarities and detailed measurements of the mimic’s wing and correspondingly the model’s thallus. Our discovery of lichen mimesis predates modern lichen-insect associations by 165 million years, indicating that during the mid-Mesozoic, the lichen-insect mimesis system was well established and provided lacewings with highly honed survival strategies.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56428">A mechanism for the extension and unfolding of parallel G-quadruplexes by human telomerase at single-molecule resolution</a></h4>

Telomeric G-quadruplexes (G4) were long believed to form a protective structure at telomeres, preventing their extension by the ribonucleoprotein telomerase. Contrary to this belief, we have previously demonstrated that parallel-stranded conformations of telomeric G4 can be extended by human and ciliate telomerase. However, a mechanistic understanding of the interaction of telomerase with structured DNA remained elusive. Here, we use single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) microscopy and bulk-phase enzymology to propose a mechanism for the resolution and extension of parallel G4 by telomerase. Binding is initiated by the RNA template of telomerase interacting with the G-quadruplex; nucleotide addition then proceeds to the end of the RNA template. It is only through the large conformational change of translocation following synthesis that the G-quadruplex structure is completely unfolded to a linear product. Surprisingly, parallel G4 stabilization with either small molecule ligands or by chemical modification does not always inhibit G4 unfolding and extension by telomerase. These data reveal that telomerase is a parallel G-quadruplex resolvase.

<p>by Antica Culina, Ilona van den Berg, Simon Evans, Alfredo Sánchez-Tójar</p>

Access to analytical code is essential for transparent and reproducible research. We review the state of code availability in ecology using a random sample of 346 nonmolecular articles published between 2015 and 2019 under mandatory or encouraged code-sharing policies. Our results call for urgent action to increase code availability: only 27% of eligible articles were accompanied by code. In contrast, data were available for 79% of eligible articles, highlighting that code availability is an important limiting factor for computational reproducibility in ecology. Although the percentage of ecological journals with mandatory or encouraged code-sharing policies has increased considerably, from 15% in 2015 to 75% in 2020, our results show that code-sharing policies are not adhered to by most authors. We hope these results will encourage journals, institutions, funding agencies, and researchers to address this alarming situation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/RJFUVgs1x3U" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) convey visual signals to 50 regions of the brain. For reasons of interest and convenience, they constitute an excellent system for the study of brain structure and function. There is general agreement that, absent a complete “parts list”, understanding how the nervous system processes information will remain an elusive goal. Recent studies indicate that there are 30‐50 types of ganglion cell in mouse retina, whereas only a few years ago it was still written that mice and the more visually oriented lagomorphs had less than 20 types of RGC. More than 30 years ago I estimated that rabbits have about 40 types of RGC. The present study indicates that this number is much too low. I have employed the old but powerful method of Golgi‐impregnation to rabbit retina, studying the range of component neurons in this already well‐studied retinal system. Close quantitative and qualitative analysis of 1142 RGCs in 26 retinas takes into account cell body and dendritic field size, level(s) of dendritic stratification in the retina’s inner plexiform layer, and details of dendritic branching. 91 morphologies are recognized. Of these, at least 32 can be correlated with physiologically studied RGCs, dye‐injected for morphological analysis. It is unlikely that rabbits have 91 types of RGC, but is argued here that this number lies between 60 and 70. The present study provides a “yardstick” for measuring the output of future molecular studies that may be more definitive in fixing the number of RGC types in rabbit retina.</p>

<p>Studies of the phenotype and population distribution of rare genetic forms of parkinsonism are required, now that gene‐targeting approaches for Parkinson disease have reached the clinical trial stage. We evaluated the frequencies of <i>PRKN </i>, <i>PINK1 </i>, and <i>DJ‐1 </i> mutations in a cohort of 1,587 cases. Mutations were found in 14.1% of patients; 27.6% were familial and 8% were isolated. <i>PRKN </i> was the gene most frequently mutated in Caucasians, whereas <i>PINK1 </i> mutations predominated in Arab‐Berber individuals. Patients with <i>PRKN </i> mutations had an earlier age at onset, and less asymmetry, levodopa‐induced motor complications, dysautonomia, and dementia than those without mutations.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The African wild dog is endemic to sub‐Saharan Africa and belongs to the family Canidae which includes domestic dogs and their closest relatives (i.e. wolves, coyotes, jackals, dingoes and foxes). The African wild dog is known for its highly social behaviour, co‐ordinated pack predation, and striking vocal repertoire, but little is known about its brain and whether it differs in any significant way from that of other canids. We employed gross anatomical observation, magnetic resonance imaging and classical neuroanatomical staining to provide a broad overview of the structure of the African wild dog brain. Our results reveal a mean brain mass of 154.08 g, with an encephalization quotient of 1.73, indicating that the African wild dog has a relatively large brain size. Analysis of the various structures that comprise their brains and their topological inter‐relationships, as well as the areas and volumes of the corpus callosum, ventricular system, hippocampus, amygdala, cerebellum and the gyrification index, all reveal that the African wild dog brain is, in general, similar to that of other mammals, and very similar to that of other carnivorans. While at this level of analysis we do not find any striking specializations within the brain of the African wild dog, apart from a relatively large brain size, the observations made indicate that more detailed analyses of specific neural systems, particularly those involved in sensorimotor processing, sociality or cognition, may reveal features that are either unique to this species or shared amongst the Canidae to the exclusion of other Carnivora.</p>

<p>The evolution of syllable structure in speech depended upon a coupling between vocalization and oscillatory movement of the jaw. Using functional MRI, we identify the neural basis of this coupling by demonstrating overlapping representations between the larynx and the jaw muscles in the human motor cortex.

</p>
<br />
<p>A prominent model of the origins of speech, known as the “frame/content” theory, posits that oscillatory lowering and raising of the jaw provided an evolutionary scaffold for the development of syllable structure in speech. Because such oscillations are non‐vocal in most non‐human primates, the evolution of speech required the addition of vocalization onto this scaffold in order to turn such jaw oscillations into vocalized syllables. In the present functional MRI study, we demonstrate overlapping somatotopic representations between the larynx and the jaw muscles in the human primary motor cortex. This proximity between the larynx and jaw in the brain might support the coupling between vocalization and jaw oscillations to generate syllable structure. This model suggests that humans inherited voluntary control of jaw oscillations from ancestral species, but added voluntary control of vocalization onto this via the evolution of a new brain area that came to be situated near the jaw region in the human motor cortex.</p>

<p>Spaceflight missions to the International Space Station (ISS) expose astronauts to microgravity, radiation, isolation, and elevated carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), among other factors. Head down tilt bed rest (HDBR) is an Earth-based analog for spaceflight used to study body unloading, fluid shifts, and other factors unrelated to gravitational changes. While in space, astronauts need to use mental rotation strategies to facilitate their adaptation to the ISS environment. Therefore, spatial working memory is essential for crewmember performance. Although the effects of HDBR on spatial working memory have recently been studied, the results are still inconclusive. Here, we expand upon past work and examine the effects of HDBR with elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub>) on brain activation patterns during spatial working memory performance. In addition, we compare brain activation between 30 days of HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> and 70 days of HDBR to test the isolated effect of CO<sub>2</sub>. Eleven subjects (6 males, 5 females; mean age = 34 ± 8 years) underwent six functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sessions pre-, during, and post-HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub>. During the HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> intervention, we observed decreasing activation in the right middle frontal gyrus and left regions of the cerebellum, followed by post-intervention recovery. We detected several correlations between brain and behavioral slopes of change with the HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> intervention. For example, greater increases in activation in frontal, temporal and parietal regions were associated with larger spatial working memory improvements. Comparing the HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> group to data from our previous 70-day HDBR study, we found greater decreases in activation in the right hippocampus and left inferior temporal gyrus for the HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> group over the course of the intervention. Together, these findings increase our understanding of the neural mechanisms of HDBR, elevated levels of CO<sub>2</sub> and spaceflight-related changes in spatial working memory performance.</p>

<p>Neural prostheses enable users to effect movement through a variety of actuators by translating brain signals into movement control signals. However, to achieve more natural limb movements from these devices, the restoration of somatosensory feedback is required. We used feature-learnability, a machine-learning approach, to assess signal features for their capacity to enhance decoding performance of neural signals evoked by natural tactile and proprioceptive somatosensory stimuli, recorded from the surface of the dorsal column nuclei (DCN) in urethane-anesthetized rats. The highest performing individual feature, spike amplitude, classified somatosensory DCN signals with 70% accuracy. The highest accuracy achieved was 87% using 13 features that were extracted from both high and low-frequency (LF) bands of DCN signals. In general, high-frequency (HF) features contained the most information about peripheral somatosensory events, but when features were acquired from short time-windows, classification accuracy was significantly improved by adding LF features to the feature set. We found that proprioception-dominated stimuli generalize across animals better than tactile-dominated stimuli, and we demonstrate how information that signal features contribute to neural decoding changes over the time-course of dynamic somatosensory events. These findings may inform the biomimetic design of artificial stimuli that can activate the DCN to substitute somatosensory feedback. Although, we investigated somatosensory structures, the feature set we investigated may also prove useful for decoding other (e.g., motor) neural signals.</p>

<p>GABA is proposed to act as a gliotransmitter in the brain. Differences in GABA release from astroglia are thought to underlie differences in tonic inhibition between the cerebellum and the CA1 hippocampus. Here we used quantitative immunogold cytochemistry to localize and compare the levels of GABA in astroglia in these brain regions. We found that the density of GABA immunogold particles was similar in delicate processes of Bergman glia in the cerebellum and astrocytes in the CA1 hippocampus. The astrocytic GABA release is proposed to be mediated by, among others, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated Cl<sup>–</sup> channel bestrophin-1. The bestrophin-1 antibodies did not show any significant bestrophin-1 signal in the brain of wt mice, nor in bestrophin-1 knockout mice. The bestrophin-1 signal was low both on Western blots and immunofluorescence laser scanning microscopic images. These results suggest that GABA is localized in astroglia, but in similar concentrations in the cerebellum and CA1 hippocampus, and thus cannot account for differences in tonic inhibition between these brain regions. Furthermore, our data seem to suggest that the GABA release from astroglia previously observed in the hippocampus and cerebellum occurs via mechanisms other than bestrophin-1.</p>

<p>The endocannabinoid (eCB) system is a lipid-based neurotransmitter complex that plays crucial roles in the neural control of learning and memory. The current model of eCB-mediated retrograde signaling is that eCBs released from postsynaptic elements travel retrogradely to presynaptic axon terminals, where they activate cannabinoid type-1 receptors (CB<sub>1</sub>Rs) and ultimately decrease neurotransmitter release on a short- or long-term scale. An increasing body of evidence has enlarged this view and shows that eCBs, besides depressing synaptic transmission, are also able to increase neurotransmitter release at multiple synapses of the brain. This indicates that eCBs act as bidirectional regulators of synaptic transmission and plasticity. Recently, studies unveiled links between the expression of eCB-mediated long-term potentiation (eCB-LTP) and learning, and between its dysregulation and several pathologies. In this review article, we first distinguish the various forms of eCB-LTP based on their mechanisms, resulting from homosynaptically or heterosynaptically-mediated processes. Next, we consider the neuromodulation of eCB-LTP, its behavioral impact on learning and memory, and finally, eCB-LTP disruptions in various pathologies and its potential as a therapeutic target in disorders such as stress coping, addiction, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, and pain. Cannabis is gaining popularity as a recreational substance as well as a medicine, and multiple eCB-based drugs are under development. In this context, it is critical to understand eCB-mediated signaling in its multi-faceted complexity. Indeed, the bidirectional nature of eCB-based neuromodulation may offer an important key to interpret the functions of the eCB system and how it is impacted by cannabis and other drugs.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00130">Downregulation of the CB1-Mediated Endocannabinoid Signaling Underlies D-Galactose-Induced Memory Impairment</a></h4>

<p>Imbalance in redox homeostasis is a major cause of age-related cognitive impairment. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a key player in regulating synaptic transmission, plasticity and memory. Increasing evidence indicates an important interplay between the two systems. However, how excessive oxidative stress could alter ECS and that, in turn, impairs its modulatory role in synaptic plasticity and cognitive function remains elusive. In the present study, we examined this causal link in D-galactose-induced oxidative rats. First, the reactive oxygen species generating enzymes, especially nitric oxide synthase (NOS), indeed show an elevated expression in D-galactose-treated rats, and this was correlated to an impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and spatial memory loss in animal behavioral tests. Second, the cannabinoid receptor type I (CB1)-mediated signaling is known to regulate synaptic plasticity. We show that a decrease in CB1 and increase in degradation enzymes for CB1 ligand endocannabinoid anandamide all occurred to D-galactose-treated rats. Surprisingly, application of low-dose anandamide, known to reduce LTP under physiological condition, now acted to enhance LTP in D-galactose-treated rats, most likely resulted from the inhibition of GABAergic synapses. Furthermore, this reversal behavior of CB1-signaling could be fully simulated by a NOS inhibitor, diphenyleneiodonium. These observations suggest that interaction between redox dysfunction and ECS should contribute significantly to the impaired synaptic plasticity and memory loss in D-galactose-treated rats. Therefore, therapies focusing on the balance of these two systems may shed lights on the treatment of age-related cognitive impairment in the future.</p>

<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a multifactorial disease, characterized by a progressive loss of motor neurons that eventually leads to paralysis and death. The current ALS-approved drugs modestly change the clinical course of the disease. The mechanism by which motor neurons progressively degenerate remains unclear but entails a non-cell autonomous process. Astrocytes impaired biological functionality were implicated in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and Alzheimer disease (AD). In ALS disease patients, A1 reactive astrocytes were found to play a key role in the pathology of ALS disease and death of motor neurons, via loss or gain of function or acquired toxicity. The contribution of astrocytes to the maintenance of motor neurons by diverse mechanisms makes them a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of ALS. Therapeutic approaches targeting at modulating the function of endogenous astrocytes or replacing lost functionality by transplantation of healthy astrocytes, may contribute to the development of therapies which might slow down or even halt the progression ALS diseases. The proposed mechanisms by which astrocytes can potentially ameliorate ALS progression and the status of ALS clinical studies involving astrocytes are discussed.</p>

Background<p>Encephalitis is a common central nervous system inflammatory disease that seriously endangers human health owing to the lack of effective diagnostic methods, which leads to a high rate of misdiagnosis and mortality. Glutamate is implicated closely in microglial activation, and activated microglia are key players in encephalitis. Hence, using glutamate chemical exchange saturation transfer (GluCEST) imaging for the early diagnosis of encephalitis holds promise.</p>Methods<p>The sensitivity of GluCEST imaging with different concentrations of glutamate and other major metabolites in the brain was validated in phantoms. Twenty-seven Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats with encephalitis induced by Staphylococcus aureus infection were used for preclinical research of GluCEST imaging in a 7.0-Tesla scanner. For the clinical study, six patients with encephalitis, six patients with lacunar infarction, and six healthy volunteers underwent GluCEST imaging in a 3.0-Tesla scanner.</p>Results<p>The number of amine protons on glutamate that had a chemical shift of 3.0 ppm away from bulk water and the signal intensity of GluCEST were concentration-dependent. Under physiological conditions, glutamate is the main contributor to the GluCEST signal. Compared with normal tissue, in both rats and patients with encephalitis, the encephalitis areas demonstrated a hyper-intense GluCEST signal, while the lacunar infarction had a decreased GluCEST signal intensity. After intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, patients with encephalitis lesions showed a decrease in GluCEST signal, and the results were significantly different from the pre-treatment signal (1.34 ± 0.31 vs 5.0 ± 0.27%, respectively; p = 0.000).</p>Conclusion<p>Glutamate plays a role in encephalitis, and the GluCEST imaging signal has potential as an in vivo imaging biomarker for the early diagnosis of encephalitis. GluCEST will provide new insight into encephalitis and help improve the differential diagnosis of brain disorders.</p>

<p>As functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is developed as a neuroimaging technique and becomes an option to study a variety of populations and tasks, the reproducibility of the fNIRS signal is still subject of debate. By performing test–retest protocols over different functional tasks, several studies agree that the fNIRS signal is reproducible over group analysis, but the inter-subject and within-subject reproducibility is poor. The high variability at the first statistical level is often attributed to global systemic physiology. In the present work, we revisited the reproducibility of the fNIRS signal during a finger-tapping task across multiple sessions on the same and different days. We expanded on previous studies by hypothesizing that the lack of spatial information of the optodes contributes to the low reproducibility in fNIRS, and we incorporated a real-time neuronavigation protocol to provide accurate cortical localization of the optodes. Our proposed approach was validated in 10 healthy volunteers, and our results suggest that the addition of neuronavigation can increase the within-subject reproducibility of the fNIRS data, particularly in the region of interest. Unlike traditional approaches to positioning the optodes, in which low intra-subject reproducibility has been found, we were able to obtain consistent and robust activation of the contralateral primary motor cortex at the intra-subject level using a neuronavigation protocol. Overall, our findings support the hypothesis that at least part of the variability in fNIRS cannot be only attributed to global systemic physiology. The use of neuronavigation to guide probe positioning, as proposed in this work, has impacts to longitudinal protocols performed with fNIRS.</p>

<p>This study examined stepping accuracy, gaze behavior, and state-anxiety in children with (N = 21, age M = 10.81, SD = 1.89) and without (N = 18, age M = 11.39, SD = 2.06) developmental coordination disorder (DCD) during an adaptive locomotion task. Participants walked at a self-selected pace along a pathway, placing their foot into a raised rectangular floor-based target box followed by either no obstacles, one obstacle, or two obstacles. Stepping kinematics and accuracy were determined using three-dimensional motion capture, whilst gaze was determined using mobile eye-tracking equipment. The children with DCD displayed greater foot placement error and variability when placing their foot within the target box and were more likely to make contact with its edges than their typically developing (TD) peers. The DCD group also displayed greater variability in the length and width of their steps in the approach to the target box. No differences were observed between groups in any of the gaze variables measured, in mediolateral velocity of the center of mass during the swing phase into the target box, or in the levels of self-reported state-anxiety experienced prior to facing each task. We therefore provide the first quantifiable evidence that deficits to foot placement accuracy and precision may be partially responsible for the increased incidence of trips and falls in DCD, and that these deficits are likely to occur independently from gaze behavior and state-anxiety.</p>

<p>Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and neuroscience are impressive. In AI, this includes the development of computer programs that can beat a grandmaster at GO or outperform human radiologists at cancer detection. A great deal of these technological developments are directly related to progress in artificial neural networks—initially inspired by our knowledge about how the brain carries out computation. In parallel, neuroscience has also experienced significant advances in understanding the brain. For example, in the field of spatial navigation, knowledge about the mechanisms and brain regions involved in neural computations of cognitive maps—an internal representation of space—recently received the Nobel Prize in medicine. Much of the recent progress in neuroscience has partly been due to the development of technology used to record from very large populations of neurons in multiple regions of the brain with exquisite temporal and spatial resolution in behaving animals. With the advent of the vast quantities of data that these techniques allow us to collect there has been an increased interest in the intersection between AI and neuroscience, many of these intersections involve using AI as a novel tool to explore and analyze these large data sets. However, given the common initial motivation point—to understand the brain—these disciplines could be more strongly linked. Currently much of this potential synergy is not being realized. We propose that spatial navigation is an excellent area in which these two disciplines can converge to help advance what we know about the brain. In this review, we first summarize progress in the neuroscience of spatial navigation and reinforcement learning. We then turn our attention to discuss how spatial navigation has been modeled using descriptive, mechanistic, and normative approaches and the use of AI in such models. Next, we discuss how AI can advance neuroscience, how neuroscience can advance AI, and the limitations of these approaches. We finally conclude by highlighting promising lines of research in which spatial navigation can be the point of intersection between neuroscience and AI and how this can contribute to the advancement of the understanding of intelligent behavior.</p>

<p>Efficient methods for visualizing cell morphology in the intact animal are of great benefit to the study of structural development in the nervous system. Quantitative analysis of the complex arborization patterns of brain cells informs cell-type classification, dissection of neuronal circuit wiring, and the elucidation of growth and plasticity mechanisms. Time-lapse single-cell morphological analysis requires labeling and imaging of single cells in situ without contamination from the ramified processes of other nearby cells. Here, using the Xenopus laevis optic tectum as a model system, we describe CRE-Mediated Single-Cell Labeling by Electroporation (CREMSCLE), a technique we developed based on bulk co-electroporation of Cre-dependent inducible expression vectors, together with very low concentrations of plasmid encoding Cre recombinase. This method offers efficient, sparse labeling in any brain area where bulk electroporation is possible. Unlike juxtacellular single-cell electroporation methods, CREMSCLE relies exclusively on the bulk electroporation technique, circumventing the need to precisely position a micropipette next to the target cell. Compared with viral transduction methods, it is fast and safe, generating high levels of expression within 24 h of introducing non-infectious plasmid DNA. In addition to increased efficiency of single-cell labeling, we confirm that CREMSCLE also allows for efficient co-expression of multiple gene products in the same cell. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this method is particularly well-suited for labeling immature neurons to follow their maturation over time. This approach therefore lends itself well to time-lapse morphological studies, particularly in the context of early neuronal development and under conditions that prevent more difficult visualized juxtacellular electroporation.</p>

<p>The neocortex performs a wide range of functions, including working memory, sensory perception, and motor planning. Despite this diversity in function, evidence suggests that the neocortex is made up of repeating subunits (“macrocolumns”), each of which is largely identical in circuitry. As such, the specific computations performed by these macrocolumns are of great interest to neuroscientists and AI researchers. Leading theories of this microcircuit include models of predictive coding, hierarchical temporal memory (HTM), and Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART). However, these models have not yet explained: (1) how microcircuits learn sequences input with delay (i.e., working memory); (2) how networks of columns coordinate processing on precise timescales; or (3) how top-down attention modulates sensory processing. I provide a theory of the neocortical microcircuit that extends prior models in all three ways. Additionally, this theory provides a novel working memory circuit that extends prior models to support simultaneous multi-item storage without disrupting ongoing sensory processing. I then use this theory to explain the functional origin of a diverse set of experimental findings, such as cortical oscillations.</p>

<p>Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is a major complication of prenatal ischemic/hypoxic exposure and affects 5%–10% of pregnancies. It causes various disorders, including neurodevelopmental disabilities due to chronic hypoxia, circulatory failure, and malnutrition via the placenta, and there is no established treatment. Therefore, the development of treatments is an urgent task. We aimed to develop a new FGR rat model with a gradual restrictive load of uterus/placental blood flow and to evaluate the treatment effect of the administration of umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (UC-MSCs). To create the FGR rat model, we used ameroid constrictors that had titanium on the outer wall and were composed of C-shaped casein with a notch and center hole inside that gradually narrowed upon absorbing water. The ameroid constrictors were attached to bilateral ovarian/uterine arteries on the 17th day of pregnancy to induce chronic mild ischemia, which led to FGR with over 20% bodyweight reduction. After the intravenous administration of 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> UC-MSCs, we confirmed a significant improvement in the UC-MSC group in a negative geotaxis test at 1 week after birth and a rotarod treadmill test at 5 months old. In the immunobiological evaluation, the total number of neurons counted via the stereological counting method was significantly higher in the UC-MSC group than in the vehicle-treated group. These results indicate that the UC-MSCs exerted a treatment effect for neurological impairment in the FGR rats.</p>

<p>Improved biomarkers are needed for vestibular schwannoma (VS), the most common tumor of the cerebellopontine angle, as existing clinical biomarkers have poor predictive value. Factors such as tumor size or growth rate do not shed light on the pathophysiology of associated sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and suffer from low specificity and sensitivity, whereas histological markers only sample a fraction of the tumor and are difficult to ascertain before tumor treatment or surgical intervention. Proteases play diverse and critical roles in tumorigenesis and could be leveraged as a new class of VS biomarkers. Using a combination of in silico, in vitro, and ex vivo approaches, we identified matrixmetalloprotease 14 (MMP-14; also known as MT1-MMP), from a panel of candidate proteases that were differentially expressed through the largest meta-analysis of human VS transcriptomes. The abundance and proteolytic activity of MMP-14 in the plasma and tumor secretions from VS patients correlated with clinical parameters and the degree of SNHL. Further, MMP-14 plasma levels correlated with surgical outcomes such as the extent of resection. Finally, the application of MMP-14 at physiologic concentrations to cochlear explant cultures led to damage to spiral ganglion neuronal fibers and synapses, thereby providing mechanistic insight into VS-associated SNHL. Taken together, MMP-14 represents a novel molecular biomarker that merits further validation in both diagnostic and prognostic applications for VS.</p>

<p>The pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) is thought to rely on a complex interaction between the patient’s genetic background and a variety of largely unknown environmental factors. In this scenario, the investigation of the genetic bases underlying familial PD could unveil key molecular pathways to be targeted by new disease-modifying therapies, still currently unavailable. Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are responsible for the majority of inherited familial PD cases and can also be found in sporadic PD, but the pathophysiological functions of LRRK2 have not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we will review the evidence obtained in transgenic LRRK2 experimental models, characterized by altered striatal synaptic transmission, mitochondrial dysfunction, and α-synuclein aggregation. Interestingly, the processes triggered by mutant LRRK2 might represent early pathological phenomena in the pathogenesis of PD, anticipating the typical neurodegenerative features characterizing the late phases of the disease. A comprehensive view of LRRK2 neuronal pathophysiology will support the possible clinical application of pharmacological compounds targeting this protein, with potential therapeutic implications for patients suffering from both familial and sporadic PD.</p>

<p>Digital reconstruction or tracing of 3D tree-like neuronal structures from optical microscopy images is essential for understanding the functionality of neurons and reveal the connectivity of neuronal networks. Despite the existence of numerous tracing methods, reconstructing a neuron from highly noisy images remains challenging, particularly for neurites with low and inhomogeneous intensities. Conducting deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based segmentation prior to neuron tracing facilitates an approach to solving this problem via separation of weak neurites from a noisy background. However, large manual annotations are needed in deep learning-based methods, which is labor-intensive and limits the algorithm’s generalization for different datasets. In this study, we present a weakly supervised learning method of a deep CNN for neuron reconstruction without manual annotations. Specifically, we apply a 3D residual CNN as the architecture for discriminative neuronal feature extraction. We construct the initial pseudo-labels (without manual segmentation) of the neuronal images on the basis of an existing automatic tracing method. A weakly supervised learning framework is proposed via iterative training of the CNN model for improved prediction and refining of the pseudo-labels to update training samples. The pseudo-label was iteratively modified via mining and addition of weak neurites from the CNN predicted probability map on the basis of their tubularity and continuity. The proposed method was evaluated on several challenging images from the public BigNeuron and Diadem datasets, to fMOST datasets. Owing to the adaption of 3D deep CNNs and weakly supervised learning, the presented method demonstrates effective detection of weak neurites from noisy images and achieves results similar to those of the CNN model with manual annotations. The tracing performance was significantly improved by the proposed method on both small and large datasets (&gt;100 GB). Moreover, the proposed method proved to be superior to several novel tracing methods on original images. The results obtained on various large-scale datasets demonstrated the generalization and high precision achieved by the proposed method for neuron reconstruction.</p>

<p>Familial Alzheimer’s Disease (FAD) caused by Presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations is characterized by early onset, cognitive impairment, and dementia. Impaired gamma secretase function favors production of longer beta-amyloid species in PS1 FAD. The PS1 E280A mutation is the largest FAD kindred under study. Here, we studied beta-amyloid deposits in PS1 E280A FAD brains in comparison to sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (SAD). We analyzed cortices and cerebellum from 10 FAD and 10 SAD brains using immunohistochemistry to determine total beta-amyloid, hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau), and specific beta-amyloid peptides 1-38, 1-40, 1-42, and 1-43. Additionally, we studied beta-amyloid subspecies by ELISA, and vessel pathology was detected with beta-amyloid 1-42 and truncated pyroglutamylated beta-amyloid antibodies. There were no significant differences in total beta-amyloid signal between SAD and FAD. Beta-amyloid 1-38 and 1-43 loads were increased, and 1-42 loads were decreased in frontal cortices of SAD when compared to FAD. Beta-amyloid species assessment by ELISA resembled our findings by immunohistochemical analysis. Differences in beta-amyloid 1-38 and 1-42 levels between SAD and FAD were evidenced by using beta-amyloid length-specific antibodies, reflecting a gamma secretase-dependent shift in beta-amyloid processing in FAD cases. The use of beta-amyloid length-specific antibodies for postmortem assessment of beta-amyloid pathology can differentiate between SAD and PS1 FAD cases and it can be useful for identification of SAD cases potentially affected with gamma secretase dysfunction.</p>

<p>Background: Cognitive frailty (CF) is defined as the simultaneous presence of physical frailty and cognitive impairment among older adults without dementia. Previous studies have revealed that neuropathological changes may contribute to the degeneration of subcortical nuclei in the process of cognitive impairment. However, it is unclear in CF. The aim of this study is to investigate the changes in subcortical nuclei in older adults with CF and their relationship with cognitive decline and physical frailty.</p><p>Methods: A total of 26 older adults with CF and 26 matched healthy subjects were enrolled. Cognitive function and physical frailty were assessed with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale (Fuzhou version) and the Chinese version of the Edmonton Frailty Scale (EFS). Volumetric and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters of subcortical nuclei were measured with structural and DTI brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and compared between groups. Partial correlation analysis was conducted between subcortical nuclei volumes, MoCA scores, and physical frailty indexes.</p><p>Results: Significant volume reductions were found in five subcortical nuclei, including the bilateral thalami, left caudate, right pallidum, and accumbens area, in older adults with CF (P &lt; 0.05), and the bilateral thalami was most obvious. Decreased fractional anisotropy and relative anisotropy values were observed only in the left thalamus in the CF group (P &lt; 0.05). No group differences were found in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. The MoCA scores were positively correlated with the volumes of the bilateral thalami, right pallidum, and accumbens area (P &lt; 0.05). Negative correlations were found between the physical frailty index and the volumes of the bilateral thalami, caudate, pallidum, and right accumbens area (P &lt; 0.05).</p><p>Conclusion: Microstructural changes occur in the subcortical nuclei of older adults with CF, and these changes are correlated with cognitive decline and physical frailty. Therefore, microstructural atrophy of the subcortical nuclei may be involved in the pathological progression of CF.</p>

Animals and humans evolved sophisticated nervous systems that endowed them with the ability to form internal-models or beliefs and make predictions about the future to survive and flourish in a world in which future outcomes are often uncertain. Crucial to this capacity is the ability to adjust behavioral and learning policies in response to the level of uncertainty. Until recently, the neuronal mechanisms that could underlie such uncertainty-guided control have been largely unknown. In this review, I discuss newly discovered neuronal circuits in primates that represent uncertainty about future rewards and propose how they guide information-seeking, attention, decision-making, and learning to help us survive in an uncertain world.

Homology recombination (HR) repair preserves genomic stability and averts cancerization. Here, Zhang et al. uncover an HR pathway centered on LARP7. ATM activation triggers BRCA1/BARD1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of LARP7 that further activates the G2/M checkpoint and enhances HR by suppressing the expression of the CDK1/CCNB1/CCNB2 complex.

Albrecht et al. show that macropinocytosis is triggered by GSK3 inhibition or mutation of the tumor suppressor Axin1. Wnt-regulated macropinocytosis leads to acidification and activation of catabolism in lysosomes, increasing the utilization of extracellular macromolecules to fuel cell growth. These findings have implications for novel therapies in cancer.

Parikh et al. show that major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I)-restricted control of viral infection is due to natural killer (NK) cells rather than cytotoxic T cells. Inhibitory NK cell receptors are essential for protection, requiring NK cell licensing (education) by self-MHC-I and missing-self recognition due to virus-induced MHC-I downregulation.

Holderith et al. present a sensitive, quantitative immunolocalization method that allows the visualization of dozens of synaptic proteins in epoxy-resin-embedded ultrathin sections with a resolution of &lt;40 nm. Their method is ideal for molecular characterization of individual synapses following in vitro paired recordings, two-photon [Ca2+] or glutamate-sensor (iGluSnFR) imaging.

Kovacs et al. demonstrate that natural killer and T cells produce IFN-γ to prime caspase-11 during Burkholderia thailandensis infection. They demonstrate that in neutrophils, caspase-1 and caspase-11 activation lead to gasdermin D cleavage, but only caspase-11 activation leads to pyroptosis that is necessary for clearance of this cytosol-invasive pathogen in vivo.

Hahm et al. describe a regulatory mechanism of UHRF1 in DNA methylation maintenance. UHRF1 acetylation by PCAF at lysine 490 disrupts the binding affinity of UHRF1 to hemi-methylated DNA in nascent DNA. These findings suggest that fine-tuned acetylation of UHRF1 is essential for inheritance of epigenomic information.

Flosbach et al. demonstrate that PTPN2-deficient T cells are less dependent on cytokines and show increased programmed expansion, and short-lived effector T cells have enhanced survival and expansion capacity.

Using a TC-rMNase-seq method, Yu et al. show that low-compact chromatin is divided into two compartments corresponding to active or bivalent regions in mESCs. By calculating the COPI, one can predict the transcription potential of genes and identify the factors that take part in the development process.

<p>by Philipp Schneider, Axel von Kamp, Steffen Klamt</p>

The concept of minimal cut sets (MCS) provides a flexible framework for analyzing properties of metabolic networks and for computing metabolic intervention strategies. In particular, it has been used to support the targeted design of microbial strains for bio-based production processes. Herein we present a number of major extensions that generalize the existing MCS approach and broaden its scope for applications in metabolic engineering. We first introduce a modified approach to integrate gene-protein-reaction associations (GPR) in the metabolic network structure for the computation of gene-based intervention strategies. In particular, we present a set of novel compression rules for GPR associations, which effectively speedup the computation of gene-based MCS by a factor of up to one order of magnitude. These rules are not specific for MCS and as well applicable to other computational strain design methods. Second, we enhance the MCS framework by allowing the definition of multiple target (undesired) and multiple protected (desired) regions. This enables precise tailoring of the metabolic solution space of the designed strain with unlimited flexibility. Together with further generalizations such as individual cost factors for each intervention, direct combinations of reaction/gene deletions and additions as well as the possibility to search for substrate co-feeding strategies, the scope of the MCS framework could be broadly extended. We demonstrate the applicability and performance benefits of the described developments by computing (gene-based) <i>Escherichia coli</i> strain designs for the bio-based production of 2,3-butanediol, a chemical, that has recently received much attention in the field of metabolic engineering. With our extended framework, we could identify promising strain designs that were formerly unpredictable, including those based on substrate co-feeding.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v3gT-h3RCy8" width="1" />

<p>by William Davis Haselden, Ravi Teja Kedarasetti, Patrick J. Drew</p>

Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous signaling molecule that plays an important role in neurovascular coupling. NO produced by neurons diffuses into the smooth muscle surrounding cerebral arterioles, driving vasodilation. However, the rate of NO degradation in hemoglobin is orders of magnitude higher than in brain tissue, though how this might impact NO signaling dynamics is not completely understood. We used simulations to investigate how the spatial and temporal patterns of NO generation and degradation impacted dilation of a penetrating arteriole in cortex. We found that the spatial location of NO production and the size of the vessel both played an important role in determining its responsiveness to NO. The much higher rate of NO degradation and scavenging of NO in the blood relative to the tissue drove emergent vascular dynamics. Large vasodilation events could be followed by post-stimulus constrictions driven by the increased degradation of NO by the blood, and vasomotion-like 0.1–0.3 Hz oscillations could also be generated. We found that these dynamics could be enhanced by elevation of free hemoglobin in the plasma, which occurs in diseases such as malaria and sickle cell anemia, or following blood transfusions. Finally, we show that changes in blood flow during hypoxia or hyperoxia could be explained by altered NO degradation in the parenchyma. Our simulations suggest that many common vascular dynamics may be emergent phenomena generated by NO degradation by the blood or parenchyma.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gD5wzUCSmDA" width="1" />

<p>by Margaret L. DeMaegd, Wolfgang Stein</p>

Action potentials are a key component of neuronal communication and their precise timing is critical for processes like learning, memory, and complex behaviors. Action potentials propagate through long axons to their postsynaptic partners, which requires axons not only to faithfully transfer action potentials to distant synaptic regions but also to maintain their timing. This is particularly challenging when axons differ in their morphological and physiological properties, as timing is predicted to diverge between these axons when extrinsic conditions change. It is unknown if and how diverse axons maintain timing during temperature changes that animals and humans encounter. We studied whether ambient temperature changes cause different timing in the periphery of neurons that centrally produce temperature-robust activity. In an approach combining modeling, imaging, and electrophysiology, we explored mechanisms that support timing by exposing the axons of three different neuron types from the same crustacean (<i>Cancer borealis</i>) motor circuit and involved in the same functional task to a range of physiological temperatures. We show that despite substantial differences between axons, the effects of temperature on action potential propagation were moderate and supported temperature-robust timing over long-distances. Our modeling demonstrates that to maintain timing, the underlying channel properties of these axons do not need to be temperature-insensitive or highly restricted, but coordinating the temperature sensitivities of the Sodium activation gate time constant and the maximum Sodium conductance is required. Thus, even highly temperature-sensitive ion channel properties can support temperature-robust timing between distinct neuronal types and across long distances.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1J3KcNtroxI" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/1VHzBX3PoEg/article">A circuit model of auditory cortex</a></h4>

<p>by Youngmin Park, Maria N. Geffen</p>

The mammalian sensory cortex is composed of multiple types of inhibitory and excitatory neurons, which form sophisticated microcircuits for processing and transmitting sensory information. Despite rapid progress in understanding the function of distinct neuronal populations, the parameters of connectivity that are required for the function of these microcircuits remain unknown. Recent studies found that two most common inhibitory interneurons, parvalbumin- (PV) and somatostatin-(SST) positive interneurons control sound-evoked responses, temporal adaptation and network dynamics in the auditory cortex (AC). These studies can inform our understanding of parameters for the connectivity of excitatory-inhibitory cortical circuits. Specifically, we asked whether a common microcircuit can account for the disparate effects found in studies by different groups. By starting with a cortical rate model, we find that a simple current-compensating mechanism accounts for the experimental findings from multiple groups. They key mechanisms are two-fold. First, PVs compensate for reduced SST activity when thalamic inputs are strong with less compensation when thalamic inputs are weak. Second, SSTs are generally disinhibited by reduced PV activity regardless of thalamic input strength. These roles are augmented by plastic synapses. These differential roles reproduce the differential effects of PVs and SSTs in stimulus-specific adaptation, forward suppression and tuning-curve adaptation, as well as the influence of PVs on feedforward functional connectivity in the circuit. This circuit exhibits a balance of inhibitory and excitatory currents that persists on stimulation. This approach brings together multiple findings from different laboratories and identifies a circuit that can be used in future studies of upstream and downstream sensory processing.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1VHzBX3PoEg" width="1" />

<p>by Xiao Zheng, Yuan Huang, Xiufen Zou</p>

Disease development and cell differentiation both involve dynamic changes; therefore, the reconstruction of dynamic gene regulatory networks (DGRNs) is an important but difficult problem in systems biology. With recent technical advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), large volumes of scRNA-seq data are being obtained for various processes. However, most current methods of inferring DGRNs from bulk samples may not be suitable for scRNA-seq data. In this work, we present scPADGRN, a novel DGRN inference method using “time-series” scRNA-seq data. scPADGRN combines the preconditioned alternating direction method of multipliers with cell clustering for DGRN reconstruction. It exhibits advantages in accuracy, robustness and fast convergence. Moreover, a quantitative index called Differentiation Genes’ Interaction Enrichment (DGIE) is presented to quantify the interaction enrichment of genes related to differentiation. From the DGIE scores of relevant subnetworks, we infer that the functions of embryonic stem (ES) cells are most active initially and may gradually fade over time. The communication strength of known contributing genes that facilitate cell differentiation increases from ES cells to terminally differentiated cells. We also identify several genes responsible for the changes in the DGIE scores occurring during cell differentiation based on three real single-cell datasets. Our results demonstrate that single-cell analyses based on network inference coupled with quantitative computations can reveal key transcriptional regulators involved in cell differentiation and disease development.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kywao3Rf5pI" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To examine associations of molecular markers of brain insulin signaling with Alzheimer disease (AD) and cognition among older persons with or without diabetes.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This clinical–pathologic study was derived from a community‐based cohort study, the Religious Orders Study. We studied 150 individuals (mean age at death =87 years, 48% women): 75 with and 75 without diabetes (matched by sex on age at death and education). Using enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay, immunohistochemistry, and ex vivo stimulation of brain tissue with insulin, we assessed insulin signaling in the postmortem middle frontal gyrus cortex. Postmortem data documented AD neuropathology. Clinical evaluations documented cognitive function proximate to death, based on 17 neuropsychological tests. In adjusted regression analyses, we examined associations of brain insulin signaling with diabetes, AD, and level of cognition.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Brain insulin receptor substrate‐1 (IRS1) phosphorylation (pS<sup>307</sup>IRS1/total IRS1) and serine/threonine‐protein kinase (AKT) phosphorylation (pT<sup>308</sup>AKT1/total AKT1) were similar in persons with or without diabetes. AKT phosphorylation was associated with the global AD pathology score (<i>p = </i> 0.001). In contrast, IRS1 phosphorylation was not associated with AD (<i>p </i> = 0.536). No other associations of insulin signaling were found with the global AD score, including when using the ex vivo brain insulin stimulation method. In secondary analyses, normalized pT<sup>308</sup>AKT1 was positively correlated with both the amyloid burden and tau tangle density, and no other associations of brain insulin signaling with neuropathology were observed. Moreover, normalized pT<sup>308</sup>AKT1 was associated with a lower level of global cognitive function (estimate = −0.212, standard error = 0.097; <i>p </i> = 0.031).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Brain AKT phosphorylation, a critical node in the signaling of insulin and other growth factors, is associated with AD neuropathology and lower cognitive function. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Genetic variants of the cytoplasmic FMR1‐interacting protein 2 (<i>CYFIP2 </i>) encoding an actin‐regulatory protein are associated with brain disorders, including intellectual disability and epilepsy. However, specific in vivo neuronal defects and potential treatments for <i>CYFIP2 </i>‐associated brain disorders remain largely unknown. Here, we characterized <i>Cyfip2 </i> heterozygous (<i>Cyfip2 </i>
<sup>+/−</sup>) mice to understand their neurobehavioral phenotypes and the underlying pathological mechanisms. Furthermore, we examined a potential treatment for such phenotypes of the <i>Cyfip2 </i>
<sup>
   <i>+/− </i>
</sup> mice and specified a neuronal function mediating its efficacy.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed behavioral analyses of <i>Cyfip2 </i>
<sup>+/−</sup> mice. We combined molecular, ultrastructural, and in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological analyses of <i>Cyfip2 </i>
<sup>+/−</sup> prefrontal neurons. We also selectively reduced CYFIP2 in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of mice with virus injections.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Adult <i>Cyfip2 </i>
<sup>+/−</sup> mice exhibited lithium‐responsive abnormal behaviors. We found increased filamentous actin, enlarged dendritic spines, and enhanced excitatory synaptic transmission and excitability in the adult <i>Cyfip2 </i>
<sup>+/−</sup> PFC that was restricted to layer 5 (L5) neurons. Consistently, adult <i>Cyfip2 </i>
<sup>+/−</sup> mice showed increased seizure susceptibility and auditory steady‐state responses from the cortical electroencephalographic recordings. Among the identified prefrontal defects, lithium selectively normalized the hyperexcitability of <i>Cyfip2 </i>
<sup>+/−</sup> L5 neurons. RNA sequencing revealed reduced expression of potassium channel genes in the adult <i>Cyfip2 </i>
<sup>+/−</sup> PFC. Virus‐mediated reduction of CYFIP2 in the PFC was sufficient to induce L5 hyperexcitability and lithium‐responsive abnormal behavior.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results suggest that L5‐specific prefrontal dysfunction, especially hyperexcitability, underlies both the pathophysiology and the lithium‐mediated amelioration of neurobehavioral phenotypes in adult <i>Cyfip2 </i>
<sup>+/−</sup> mice, which can be implicated in <i>CYFIP2 </i>‐associated brain disorders. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>Validation of [3H] CP‐55,940 for autoradiography of endocannabinoid receptors in prairie vole brains. Three adjacent sections of brain tissue were incubated with [3H] CP‐55,940 with or without an unlabeled receptor competitor. Co‐incubation of the radioligand with the CB2 blocker (HU308) had no discernible impact on binding in the HPC but increased binding in the PFC relative to control. Co‐incubation of the radioligand with the CB1 blocker (AM251) significantly decreased signal in both regions.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Across many species, endocannabinoids play an important role in regulating social play, reward, and anxiety. These processes are mediated through at least two distinct cannabinoid receptors (CB), CB1 and CB2. CB1 expression is found in appreciable densities across regions of the brain that integrate memory with socio‐spatial information; many of these regions have been directly linked to the neurobiology of pair bonding in monogamous species. Using receptor autoradiography, we provide the first distributional map of CB1 within the brains of closely related monogamous prairie voles and promiscuous meadow voles, and compare receptor densities across sexes and species in limbic regions. We observe CB1‐specific signal using [3H] CP‐55,940 and [3H] SR141716A, though the latter exhibited a lower signal to noise ratio. We confirmed the presence of CB2 in prairie vole spleen tissue using [3H] CP‐55,940. However, we found no evidence of CB2 in the brain using either [3H] CP‐55,940 or [3H] A‐836,339. The overall distribution of putative CB1 in the brain was similar across vole species and followed the pattern of CB1 expression observed in other species—high intensity binding within the telencephalon, moderate binding within the diencephalon, and mild binding within the mesencephalon and metencephalon (aside from the cerebellar cortex). However, we found profound differences in CB1 densities across species, with prairie voles having higher CB1 binding in regions implicated in social attachment and spatial memory (e.g. periaqueductal gray, hippocampus). These findings suggest that CB1 densities, but not distribution, correlate with the social systems of vole species.</p>

<p>Oxidative stress (OS) contributes to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. OS can be a result of increased reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, reduced antioxidants, oxidatively damaged molecules, and/or a combination of these factors. Scientific literature is scarce for the markers of OS-specific for detecting AD at an early stage. The first aim of the current review is to provide an overview of the potential OS markers in the brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood and/or urine that can be used for early diagnosis of human AD. The reason for exploring OS markers is that the proposed antioxidant therapies against AD appear to start too late to be effective. The second aim is to evaluate the evidence for natural antioxidants currently proposed to prevent or treat AD symptoms. To address these two aims, we critically evaluated the studies on humans in which various OS markers for detecting AD at an early stage were presented. Non-invasive OS markers that can detect mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD at an early stage in humans with greater specificity and sensitivity are primarily related to lipid peroxidation. However, a combination of OS markers, family history, and other biochemical tests are needed to detect the disease early on. We also report that the long-term use of vitamins (vitamin E as in almonds) and polyphenol-rich foods (curcumin/curcuminoids of turmeric, ginkgo biloba, epigallocatechin-3-gallate in green tea) seem justified for ameliorating AD symptoms. Future research on humans is warranted to justify the use of natural antioxidants.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To identify the genetic cause for progressive peripheral nerve disease in a Venezuelan family.</p>


<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Despite the growing list of genes associated with Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease, many patients with axonal forms lack a genetic diagnosis.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A pedigree was constructed, based on family clinical data. Next‐generation sequencing of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was performed for six affected family members. Muscle biopsies from four family members were used for analysis of muscle histology and ultrastructure, mtDNA sequencing, and RNA quantification. Ultrastructural studies were performed on sensory nerve biopsies from two affected family members.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Electrodiagnostic testing showed a motor and sensory axonal polyneuropathy. Pedigree analysis revealed inheritance only through the maternal line, consistent with mitochondrial transmission. Sequencing of mtDNA identified a mutation in the mitochondrial tRNA<sup>Val</sup> (mt‐tRNA<sup>Val</sup>) gene, m.1661A&gt;G, present at nearly 100% heteroplasmy, which disrupts a Watson‐Crick base pair in the T‐stem‐loop. Muscle biopsies showed chronic denervation/reinnervation changes, while biochemical analysis of electron transport chain (ETC) enzyme activities showed reduction in multiple ETC complexes. Northern blots from skeletal muscle total RNA showed severe reduction in abundance of mt‐tRNA<sup>Val</sup>, and mildly increased mt‐tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>, in subjects compared to unrelated age‐ and sex‐matched controls. Nerve biopsies from two affected family members demonstrated ultrastructural mitochondrial abnormalities (hyperplasia, hypertrophy, crystalline arrays) consistent with a mitochondrial neuropathy.</p>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We identify a previously unreported cause of Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth (CMT) disease, a mutation in the mt‐tRNA<sup>Val</sup>, in a Venezuelan family. This work expands the list of CMT‐associated genes from protein‐coding genes to a mitochondrial tRNA gene.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Excitatory synapse formation begins in mid‐fetal gestation. However, due to our inability to image fetal synaptogenesis, the initial formation of synapses remains understudied. The recent development of human fetal brain spheroids provides access to this critical period of synapse formation. Using human neurons and brain spheroids, we address how altered actin regulation impacts the formation of excitatory synapses during fetal brain development. Prior to synapse formation, inhibition of RhoA kinase (ROCK) signaling promotes neurite elongation and branching. In addition to increasing neural complexity, ROCK inhibition increases the length of protrusions along the neurite, ultimately promoting excitatory synapse formation in human cortical brain spheroids. A corresponding increase in Rac1‐driven actin polymerization drives this increase in excitatory synaptogenesis. Using STORM super‐resolution microscopy, we demonstrate that actomyosin regulators, including the Rac1 regulator, α‐PIX, and the RhoA regulator, p115‐RhoGEF, localize to nascent excitatory synapses, where they preferentially localize to postsynaptic compartments. These results demonstrate that coordinated RhoGTPase activities underlie the initial formation of excitatory synapses and identify critical cytoskeletal regulators of early synaptogenic events.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Hippocampal theta oscillations show prominent changes in frequency and amplitude depending on behavioral state or cognitive demands. How these dynamic changes in theta oscillations contribute to the spatial and temporal organization of hippocampal cells, and ultimately behavior, remain unclear. We used low‐theta frequency optogenetic stimulation to pace coordination of cellular and network activity between the medial septum (MS) and hippocampus during baseline and MS stimulation while rats were at rest or performing a spatial accuracy task with a visible or hidden goal zone. Hippocampal receptivity to pan‐neuronal septal stimulation at low‐theta frequency was primarily determined by speed and secondarily by task demands. Competition between artificial and endogenous field potentials at theta frequency attenuated hippocampal phase preference relative to local theta, but the spike‐timing activity of hippocampal pyramidal cells was effectively driven by artificial septal output, particularly during the hidden goal task. Notwithstanding temporal reorganization by artificial theta stimulation, place field properties were unchanged and alterations to spatial behavior were limited to goal zone approximation. Our results indicate that even a low‐theta frequency timing signal in the septohippocampal circuit is sufficient for spatial goal finding behavior. The results also advance a mechanistic understanding of how endogenous or artificial somatodendritic timing signals relate to displacement computations during navigation and spatial memory.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cathodal direct current stimulation (cDCS) induces long‐term depression (LTD)‐like reduction of cortical excitability (DCS‐LTD), which has been tested in the treatment of epilepsy with modest effects. In part, this may be due to variable cortical neuron orientation relative to the electric field. We tested, in vivo and in vitro, whether DCS‐LTD occurs throughout the cortical thickness, and if not, then whether drug–DCS pairing can enhance the uniformity of the cortical response and the cDCS antiepileptic effect.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>cDCS‐mediated changes in cortical excitability were measured in vitro in mouse motor cortex (M1) and in human postoperative neocortex, in vivo in mouse somatosensory cortex (S1), and in a mouse kainic acid (KA)‐seizure model. Contributions of N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate–type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) to cDCS‐mediated plasticity were tested with application of NMDAR blockers (memantine/D‐AP5).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>cDCS reliably induced DCS‐LTD in superficial cortical layers, and a long‐term potentiation (LTP)‐like enhancement (DCS‐LTP) was recorded in deep cortical layers. Immunostaining confirmed layer‐specific increase of phospho‐S6 ribosomal protein in mouse M1. Similar nonuniform cDCS aftereffects on cortical excitability were also found in human neocortex in vitro and in S1 of alert mice in vivo. Application of memantine/D‐AP5 either produced a more uniform DCS‐LTD throughout the cortical thickness or at least abolished DCS‐LTP. Moreover, a combination of memantine and cDCS suppressed KA‐induced seizures.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>cDCS aftereffects are not uniform throughout cortical layers, which may explain the incomplete cDCS clinical efficacy. NMDAR antagonists may augment cDCS efficacy in epilepsy and other disorders where regional depression of cortical excitability is desirable. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This study investigates the response to spinal cord injury in the Grey short‐tailed opossum (<i>Monodelphis domestica </i>). In opossums spinal injury early in development results in spontaneous axon growth through the injury, but this regenerative potential diminishes with maturity until it’s lost entirely. The mechanisms underlying this regeneration remain unknown. RNA sequencing was used to identify differential gene expression in regenerating (SCI at postnatal day 7, P7SCI) and non‐regenerating (SCI at day 28, P28SCI) cords +1d, +3d and +7d after complete spinal transection, compared to age‐matched controls. Genes showing significant differential expression (log2FC≥1, Padj≤0.05) were used for downstream analysis. Across all time‐points 233 genes altered expression after P7SCI, and 472 genes altered expression after P28SCI. 147 genes altered expression in both injury ages (63% of P7SCI dataset). The majority of changes were gene up‐regulations. Gene ontology overrepresentation analysis in P7SCI gene‐sets showed significant overrepresentations only in immune‐associated categories, while P28SCI gene‐sets showed overrepresentations in these same immune categories, along with other categories such as ‘cell proliferation’, ‘cell adhesion’ and ‘apoptosis’. Cell‐type–association analysis suggested that, regardless of injury age, injury‐associated gene transcripts were most strongly associated with microglia and endothelial cells, with strikingly fewer astrocyte, oligodendrocyte and neuron‐related genes, the notable exception being a cluster of mostly down‐regulated oligodendrocyte‐associated genes in the P7SCI+7d gene‐set. Our findings demonstrate a more complex transcriptomic response in non‐regenerating cords, suggesting a strong influence of non‐neuronal cells in the outcome after injury and providing the largest survey yet of the transcriptomic changes occurring after SCI in this model.</p>

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has become a powerful tool for dissecting the molecular and pathological signatures of a variety of human diseases. However, the limited availability of biological samples from different disease stages is a major hurdle in studying disease progressions and identifying early pathological changes. Deep learning techniques have recently begun to be applied to analyze NGS data and thereby predict the progression of biological processes. In this study, we applied a deep learning technique called generative adversarial networks (GANs) to predict the molecular progress of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We successfully applied GANs to analyze RNA-seq data from a 5xFAD mouse model of AD, which recapitulates major AD features of massive amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation in the brain. We examined how the generator is featured to have specific-sample generation and biological gene association. Based on the above observations, we suggested virtual disease progress by latent space interpolation to yield the transition curves of various genes with pathological changes from normal to AD state. By performing pathway analysis based on the transition curve patterns, we identified several pathological processes with progressive changes, such as inflammatory systems and synapse functions, which have previously been demonstrated to be involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Interestingly, our analysis indicates that alteration of cholesterol biosynthesis begins at a very early stage of AD, suggesting that it is the first effect to mediate the cholesterol metabolism of AD downstream of Aβ accumulation. Here, we suggest that GANs are a useful tool to study disease progression, leading to the identification of early pathological signatures.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bhIz_qwVxII" width="1" />

<p>by Noor Seijdel, Nikos Tsakmakidis, Edward H. F. de Haan, Sander M. Bohte, H. Steven Scholte</p>

Feedforward deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) are, under specific conditions, matching and even surpassing human performance in object recognition in natural scenes. This performance suggests that the analysis of a loose collection of image features could support the recognition of natural object categories, without dedicated systems to solve specific visual subtasks. Research in humans however suggests that while feedforward activity may suffice for sparse scenes with isolated objects, additional visual operations ('routines') that aid the recognition process (e.g. segmentation or grouping) are needed for more complex scenes. Linking human visual processing to performance of DCNNs with increasing depth, we here explored if, how, and when object information is differentiated from the backgrounds they appear on. To this end, we controlled the information in both objects and backgrounds, as well as the relationship between them by adding noise, manipulating background congruence and systematically occluding parts of the image. Results indicate that with an increase in network depth, there is an increase in the distinction between object- and background information. For more shallow networks, results indicated a benefit of training on segmented objects. Overall, these results indicate that, de facto, scene segmentation can be performed by a network of sufficient depth. We conclude that the human brain could perform scene segmentation in the context of object identification without an explicit mechanism, by selecting or “binding” features that belong to the object and ignoring other features, in a manner similar to a very deep convolutional neural network.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2f6aQtWdfSQ" width="1" />

<p>We used multiple methods for examining the AVT system in female African cichlid fish <i>Astatotilapia burtoni </i>. AVT cell size varied with female reproductive state in a cell type‐dependent manner.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Nonapeptides play a crucial role in mediating reproduction, aggression, and parental care across taxa. In fishes, <i>arginine vasotocin </i> (AVT) expression is related to social and/or reproductive status in most male fishes studied to date, and is linked to territorial defense, paternal care, and courtship. Despite a plethora of studies examining AVT in male fishes, relatively little is known about how AVT expression varies with female reproductive state or its role in female social behaviors. We used multiple methods for examining the AVT system in female African cichlid fish <i>Astatotilapia burtoni </i>, including immunohistochemistry for AVT, <i>in situ </i> hybridization for <i>avt </i>‐mRNA, and quantitative PCR. Ovulated and mouthbrooding females had similar numbers of parvocellular, magnocellular, and gigantocellular AVT cells in the preoptic area. However, ovulated females had larger magnocellular and gigantocellular cells compared to mouthbrooding females, and gigantocellular AVT cell size correlated with the number of days brooding, such that late‐stage brooding females had larger AVT cells than mid‐stage brooding females. In addition, we found that ventral hypothalamic cells were more prominent in females compared to males, and were larger in mouthbrooding compared to ovulated females, suggesting a role in maternal care. Together, these data indicate that AVT neurons change across the reproductive cycle in female fishes, similar to that seen in males. These data on females complement studies in male <i>A. burtoni </i>, providing a comprehensive picture of the regulation and potential function of different AVT cell types in reproduction and social behaviors in both sexes.</p>

<h2>Graphical Abstract</h2>
<p>We identified a novel population of inhibitory prodynorphin neurons in the mouse and human brainstem which we named LJA5.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sensory information is transmitted from peripheral nerves, through the spinal cord, and up to the brain. Sensory information may be modulated by projections from the brain to the spinal cord, but the neural substrates for top‐down sensory control are incompletely understood. We identified a novel population of inhibitory neurons in the mouse brainstem, distinguished by their expression of prodynorphin, which we named LJA5. Here, we identify a similar group of <i>Pdyn+ </i> neurons in the human brainstem, and we define the efferent and afferent projection patterns of LJA5 neurons in mouse. Using specific genetic tools, we selectively traced the projections of the <i>Pdyn </i>‐expressing LJA5 neurons through the brain and spinal cord. Terminal fields were densest in the lateral and ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (PAG), lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPB), caudal pressor area, and lamina I of the spinal trigeminal nucleus and all levels of the spinal cord. We then labeled cell types in the PAG, LPB, medulla, and spinal cord to better define the specific targets of LJA5 boutons. LJA5 neurons send the only known inhibitory descending projection specifically to lamina I of the spinal cord, which transmits afferent pain, temperature, and itch information up to the brain. Using retrograde tracing, we found LJA5 neurons receive inputs from sensory and stress areas such as somatosensory/insular cortex, preoptic area, paraventricular nucleus, dorsomedial nucleus and lateral hypothalamus, PAG, and LPB. This pattern of inputs and outputs suggest LJA5 neurons are uniquely positioned to be activated by sensation and stress, and in turn, inhibit pain and itch.</p>

<p>Dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) was established in the past decade as a potent approach to reveal non-trivial, time-varying properties of neural interactions – such as their multifractality or information content –, that otherwise remain hidden from conventional static methods. Several neuropsychiatric disorders were shown to be associated with altered DFC, with schizophrenia (SZ) being one of the most intensely studied among such conditions. Here we analyzed resting-state electroencephalography recordings of 14 SZ patients and 14 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC). We reconstructed dynamic functional networks from delta band (0.5–4 Hz) neural activity and captured their spatiotemporal dynamics in various global network topological measures. The acquired network measure time series were made subject to dynamic analyses including multifractal analysis and entropy estimation. Besides group-level comparisons, we built a classifier to explore the potential of DFC features in classifying individual cases. We found stronger delta-band connectivity, as well as increased variance of DFC in SZ patients. Surrogate data testing verified the true multifractal nature of DFC in SZ, with patients expressing stronger long-range autocorrelation and degree of multifractality when compared to controls. Entropy analysis indicated reduced temporal complexity of DFC in SZ. When using these indices as features, an overall cross-validation accuracy surpassing 89% could be achieved in classifying individual cases. Our results imply that dynamic features of DFC such as its multifractal properties and entropy are potent markers of altered neural dynamics in SZ and carry significant potential not only in better understanding its pathophysiology but also in improving its diagnosis. The proposed framework is readily applicable for neuropsychiatric disorders other than schizophrenia.</p>

<p>AMPA-type glutamate receptors in the CNS are normally impermeable to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but the aberrant expression of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) occurs in pathological conditions such as ischemia or epilepsy, or degenerative diseases such as ALS. Here, we show that select populations of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) similarly express high levels of CP-AMPARs in a mouse model of glaucoma. CP-AMPAR expression increased dramatically in both On sustained alpha and Off transient alpha RGCs, and this increase was prevented by genomic editing of the GluA2 subunit. On sustained alpha RGCs with elevated CP-AMPAR levels displayed profound synaptic depression, which was reduced by selectively blocking CP-AMPARs, buffering Ca<sup>2+</sup> with BAPTA, or with the CB1 antagonist AM251, suggesting that depression was mediated by a retrograde transmitter which might be triggered by the influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> through CP-AMPARs. Thus, glaucoma may alter the composition of AMPARs and depress excitatory synaptic input in select populations of RGCs.</p>

<p>Neurodegenerative diseases are neuronal disorders characterized by the loss of a large number of neurons in the human brain. Innate immunity-mediated neuroinflammation actively contributes to the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Inflammasomes are involved in the progression of the innate immune response and are responsible for the maturation of caspase-1 and inflammatory cytokines during neuroinflammation. The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, which is one of the most intensively investigated inflammasomes, has been reported to play a key role in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we reviewed the mechanisms, role, and latest developments regarding the NLRP3 inflammasome with respect to three neurodegenerative diseases: Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Patient and animal model studies have found that abnormal protein aggregation of Aβ, synuclein, or copper–zinc superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1), which are the main proteins expressed in the three diseases, respectively, can activate microglial cells, induce increased interleukin-1β (IL-1β) release, and activate the NLRP3 pathway, leading to neurodegeneration. In contrast, a deficiency of the components of the NLRP3 pathway may inhibit Aβ, synuclein, or SOD1-induced microglial activation. These studies indicate a positive correlation between NLRP3 levels and abnormal protein aggregation. However, in the case of ALS, not only microglia but also astrocytes express increased NLRP3 levels and contribute to activation of the NLRP3 pathway. In addition, in this review article, we also focus on the therapeutic implications of targeting novel inhibitors of the NLRP3 inflammasome or of novel drugs that mediate the NLRP3 pathway, which could play a role via NLRP3 in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>This special issue of Frontiers in Neuroscience-Neurodegeneration celebrates the 50th anniversary of John Olney’s seminal work introducing the concept of excitotoxicity as a mechanism for neuronal cell death. Since that time, fundamental research on the pathophysiological activation of glutamate receptors has played a central role in our understanding of excitotoxic cellular signaling pathways, leading to the discovery of many potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of acute or chronic/progressive neurodegenerative disorders. Importantly, excitotoxic signaling processes have been found repeatedly to be closely intertwined with oxidative cellular cascades. With this in mind, this review looks back at long-standing collaborative efforts by the authors linking cellular redox status and glutamate neurotoxicity, focusing first on the discovery of the redox modulatory site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, followed by the study of the oxidative conversion of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) to the non-NMDA receptor agonist and neurotoxin 2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanine (TOPA) quinone. Finally, we summarize our work linking oxidative injury to the liberation of zinc from intracellular metal binding proteins, leading to the uncovering of a signaling mechanism connecting excitotoxicity with zinc-activated cell death-signaling cascades.</p>

<p>The societal burden of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is staggering, with current estimates suggesting that 50 million people world-wide have AD. Identification of new therapeutic targets is a critical barrier to the development of disease-modifying therapies. A large body of data implicates vascular pathology and cardiovascular risk factors in the development of AD, indicating that there are likely shared pathological mediators. Inflammation plays a role in both cardiovascular disease and AD, and recent evidence has implicated elements of the coagulation system in the regulation of inflammation. In particular, the multifunctional serine protease thrombin has been found to act as a mediator of vascular dysfunction and inflammation in both the periphery and the central nervous system. In the periphery, thrombin contributes to the development of cardiovascular disease, including atherosclerosis and diabetes, by inducing endothelial dysfunction and related inflammation. In the brain, thrombin has been found to act on endothelial cells of the blood brain barrier, microglia, astrocytes, and neurons in a manner that promotes vascular dysfunction, inflammation, and neurodegeneration. Thrombin is elevated in the AD brain, and thrombin signaling has been linked to both tau and amyloid beta, pathological hallmarks of the disease. In AD mouse models, inhibiting thrombin preserves cognition and endothelial function and reduces neuroinflammation. Evidence linking atrial fibrillation with AD and dementia indicates that anticoagulant therapy may reduce the risk of dementia, with targeting thrombin shown to be particularly effective. It is time for “outside-the-box” thinking about how vascular risk factors, such as atherosclerosis and diabetes, as well as the coagulation and inflammatory pathways interact to promote increased AD risk. In this review, we present evidence that thrombin is a convergence point for AD risk factors and as such that thrombin-based therapeutics could target multiple points of AD pathology, including neurodegeneration, vascular activation, and neuroinflammation. The urgent need for disease-modifying drugs in AD demands new thinking about disease pathogenesis and an exploration of novel drug targets, we propose that thrombin inhibition is an innovative tactic in the therapeutic battle against this devastating disease.</p>

<p>Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) is a promising tool to enhance human motor skills. However, the underlying physiological mechanisms are not fully understood. On the other hand, neuroimaging modalities provide powerful tools to map some of the neurophysiological biomarkers associated with tES. Here, a comprehensive review was undertaken to summarize the neuroimaging evidence of how tES affects human motor skills. A literature search has been done on the PubMed database, and 46 relative articles were selected. After reviewing these articles, we conclude that neuroimaging techniques are feasible to be coupled with tES and offer valuable information of cortical excitability, connectivity, and oscillations regarding the effects of tES on human motor behavior. The biomarkers derived from neuroimaging could also indicate the motor performance under tES conditions. This approach could advance the understanding of tES effects on motor skill and shed light on a new generation of adaptive stimulation models.</p>

<p>As experimental neuroscience is moving toward more integrative approaches, with a variety of acquisition techniques covering multiple spatiotemporal scales, data management is becoming increasingly challenging for neuroscience laboratories. Often, datasets are too large to practically be stored on a laptop or a workstation. The ability to query metadata collections without retrieving complete datasets is therefore critical to efficiently perform new analyses and explore the data. At the same time, new experimental paradigms lead to constantly changing specifications for the metadata to be stored. Despite this, there is currently a serious lack of agile software tools for data management in neuroscience laboratories. To meet this need, we have developed Expipe, a lightweight data management framework that simplifies the steps from experiment to data analysis. Expipe provides the functionality to store and organize experimental data and metadata for easy retrieval in exploration and analysis throughout the experimental pipeline. It is flexible in terms of defining the metadata to store and aims to solve the storage and retrieval challenges of data/metadata due to ever changing experimental pipelines. Due to its simplicity and lightweight design, we envision Expipe as an easy-to-use data management solution for experimental laboratories, that can improve provenance, reproducibility, and sharing of scientific projects.</p>

Introduction<p>Neurofeedback (NF) using real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has proven to be a valuable neuroscientific tool for probing cognition and promising therapeutic approach for several psychiatric disorders. Even though learning constitutes an elementary aspect of NF, the question whether certain training schemes might positively influence its dynamics has largely been neglected.</p>Methods<p>To address this issue, participants were trained to exert control on their subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) blood-oxygenation-level-dependent signal, receiving either exclusively positive reinforcement (PR, “positive feedback”) or also positive punishment (PP, “negative feedback”). The temporal dynamics of the learning process were investigated by individually modeling the feedback periods and trends, offering the possibility to assess activation changes within and across blocks, runs and sessions.</p>Results<p>The results show faster initial learning of the PR + PP group by significantly lower deactivations of the sgACC in the first session and stronger regulation trends during the first runs. Independent of the group, significant control over the sgACC could further be shown with but not without feedback.</p>Conclusion<p>The beneficial effect of PP is supported by previous findings of multiple research domains suggesting that error avoidance represents an important motivational factor of learning, which complements the reward spectrum. This hypothesis warrants further investigation with respect to NF, as it could offer a way to generally facilitate the process of gaining volitional control over brain activity.</p>

<p>Response inhibition is considered to involve the fronto-basal ganglia circuit including the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA)/SMA, subthalamic nucleus (STN), and the motor cortices, but it remains unclear whether there exists a correspondence between the anatomical and effective connections between these regions. We defined regions of interest (ROI) based on the results of our previous study, and subsequently used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), especially probabilistic fiber tractography, for the identification of white matter tracts of interest. Accordingly, we extracted the fractional anisotropy (FA) from the tracts of interest and applied data-driven hierarchical clustering to examine whether a specific pattern exists in white matter tracts. We found three clusters in the fronto-basal ganglia circuits: (1) the IFG-SMA and IFG- STN; (2) the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)-caudate and caudate-STN and caudate-IFG; and (3) the SMA-STN. Further investigation with pairwise linear inter-tract FA correlations revealed that there were significant correlations between specific pairs: (1) the DLPFC-caudate and caudate-IFG; (2) the caudate-IFG and IFG-SMA; (3) the IFG-SMA and SMA-STN; (4) the IFG-SMA and caudate-SMA; (5) the IFG-SMA and IFG-STN; (6) the SMA-STN and caudate-STN; (7) the SMA-STN and IFG-STN; and (8) the caudate-STN and IFG-STN. The combination of results from hierarchical clustering and microstructural correlations showed that probabilistic tractography infers effective connectivity: i.e., the DLPFC-caudate-IFG-SMA-STN pathway. Our results revealed that specific clusters in the fronto-basal ganglia circuit and certain pairs of white matter tracts with significant correlations predict the effective pathways (hyper-direct and indirect pathways) in response inhibition.</p>

<p>Elderly people affected by Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) usually report a perceived decline in cognitive functions that deeply impacts their quality of life. This subtle waning, although it cannot be diagnosable as dementia, is noted by caregivers on the basis of their relative’s behaviors. Crucially, if this condition is also not detected in time by clinicians, it can easily turn into dementia. Thus, early detection of MCI is strongly needed. Classical neuropsychological measures – underlying a categorical model of diagnosis - could be integrated with a dimensional assessment approach involving Virtual Reality (VR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). VR can be used to create highly ecologically controlled simulations resembling the daily life contexts in which patients’ daily instrumental activities (IADL) usually take place. Clinicians can record patients’ kinematics, particularly gait, while performing IADL (Digital Biomarkers). Then, Artificial Intelligence employs Machine Learning (ML) to analyze them in combination with clinical and neuropsychological data. This integrated computational approach would enable the creation of a predictive model to identify specific patterns of cognitive and motor impairment in MCI. Therefore, this new dimensional cognitive-behavioral assessment would reveal elderly people’s neural alterations and impaired cognitive functions, typical of MCI and dementia, even in early stages for more time-sensitive interventions.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00222">Mechanosensitivity of Human Oligodendrocytes</a></h4>

<p>Oligodendrocytes produce and repair myelin, which is critical for the integrity and function of the central nervous system (CNS). Oligodendrocyte and oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) biology is modulated in vitro by mechanical cues within the magnitudes observed in vivo. In some cases, these cues are sufficient to accelerate or inhibit terminal differentiation of murine oligodendrocyte progenitors. However, our understanding of oligodendrocyte lineage mechanobiology has been restricted primarily to animal models to date, due to the inaccessibility and challenges of human oligodendrocyte cell culture. Here, we probe the mechanosensitivity of human oligodendrocyte lineage cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells. We target phenotypically distinct stages of the human oligodendrocyte lineage and quantify the effect of substratum stiffness on cell migration and differentiation, within the range documented in vivo. We find that human oligodendrocyte lineage cells exhibit mechanosensitive migration and differentiation. Further, we identify two patterns of human donor line-dependent mechanosensitive differentiation. Our findings illustrate the variation among human oligodendrocyte responses, otherwise not captured by animal models, that are important for translational research. Moreover, these findings highlight the importance of studying glia under conditions that better approximate in vivo mechanical cues. Despite significant progress in human oligodendrocyte derivation methodology, the extended duration, low yield, and low selectivity of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived oligodendrocyte protocols significantly limit the scale-up and implementation of these cells and protocols for in vivo and in vitro applications. We propose that mechanical modulation, in combination with traditional soluble and insoluble factors, provides a key avenue to address these challenges in cell production and in vitro analysis.</p>

<p>The glomerular array in the olfactory bulb of many vertebrates is segregated into molecularly and anatomically distinct clusters linked to different olfactory functions. In anurans, glomerular clustering is so far only described in Xenopus laevis. We traced olfactory projections to the bulb in tadpoles belonging to six distantly related anuran species in four families (Pipidae, Hylidae, Bufonidae, Dendrobatidae) and found that glomerular clustering is remarkably conserved. The general bauplan consists of four unequally sized glomerular clusters with minor inter-species variation. During metamorphosis, the olfactory system undergoes extensive remodeling. Tracings in metamorphotic and juvenile Dendrobates tinctorius and Xenopus tropicalis suggest a higher degree of variation in the glomerular organization after metamorphosis is complete. Our study highlights, that the anatomical organization of glomeruli in the main olfactory bulb (MOB) is highly conserved, despite an extensive ecomorphological diversification among anuran tadpoles, which suggests underlying developmental constraints.</p>

<p>Neuron apoptosis in ischemic penumbra was proved to be involved in ischemic stroke (IS) development and contributed to the poor prognosis of IS. Recent studies showed that aberrant trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) level was associated with cell apoptosis. This study aimed to explore the underlying mechanism of neuron apoptosis in ischemic penumbra via histone methyltransferase (HMT) mixed lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) mediated epigenetic pathway. Mouse IS model was established by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Mouse primary cortical mixed cells were cultured and treated with oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) to simulate IS process. The expressions of apoptosis signal regulating kinase-1 (ASK-1), pASK-1, cleaved caspase-3, ASK-1/serine–threonine kinase receptor-associated protein (STRAP)/14-3-3 complex, ASK-1/tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) complex, and MLL1 in mouse brain tissue and mouse primary cortical mixed cells were analyzed. The function of MLL1 was investigated using small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting MLL1 and vector overexpressing MLL1. In vivo inhibition of MLL1 was conducted to explore its value as a therapeutic target. The prognostic value of MLL1 was investigated in IS patients. Results showed that the expressions of ASK-1, pASK-1, cleaved caspase-3, ASK-1/TNF-α complex, and MLL1 increased significantly in ischemic penumbra compared to brain tissue from the control group (P &lt; 0.05). MCAO and OGD significantly upregulated the H3K4me3 level in ASK-1 promoter region and promoted the recruitment of MLL1 to this region (P &lt; 0.05). siMLL1 significantly reversed the proapoptosis effects of OGD in primary cortical mixed cells, while MLL1 overexpression induced apoptosis of cells (P &lt; 0.05). In vivo inhibition of MLL1 significantly reduced the infarct volume and the neurological score of MCAO mice (P &lt; 0.05). Serum MLL1 level had a positive association with that in ischemic core and penumbra in mouse model and was positively correlated with the infarct volume and neurological score (P &lt; 0.05). Besides, serum MLL1 level was also significantly correlated with the severity of IS (P &lt; 0.05), and high serum MLL1 level indicated poor prognosis of IS patients (P &lt; 0.05). These results revealed that MLL1 contributed to neuron cell apoptosis in ischemic penumbra after IS onset by promoting the formation of ASK-1/TNF-α complex, and its serum level was associated with poor prognosis of IS.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons in the ventral brain. A disaccharide trehalose has demonstrated the potential to mitigate the DAergic loss in disease models for PD. However, trehalose is rapidly hydrolyzed into glucose by trehalase in the intestine, limiting its potential for clinical practice. Here, we investigated the neuroprotective potential of two trehalase-indigestible analogs, lactulose and melibiose, in sub-chronic 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mouse model of PD. Treatment with MPTP generated significant motor deficits, inhibited dopamine levels, and down-regulated dopamine transporter (DAT) in the striatum. Expression levels of genes involved in anti-oxidative stress pathways, including superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), and NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NQO1) were also down-regulated. Meanwhile, expression of the oxidative stress marker 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) was up-regulated along with increased microglia and astrocyte reactivity in the ventral midbrain following MPTP treatment. MPTP also reduced the activity of autophagy, evaluated by the autophagosomal marker microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)-II. Lactulose and melibiose significantly rescued motor deficits, increased dopamine in the striatum, reduced microglia and astrocyte reactivity as well as decreased levels of 4-HNE. Furthermore, lactulose and melibiose up-regulated SOD2, NRF2, and NQO1 levels, as well as enhanced the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio in the ventral midbrain with MPTP treatment. Our findings indicate the potential of lactulose and melibiose to protect DAergic neurons in PD.</p>

<p>The vascular endothelium in the brain is an essential part of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) because of its very tight structure to secure a functional and molecular separation of the brain from the rest of the body and to protect neurons from pathogens and toxins. Impaired transport of metabolites across the BBB due to its increasing dysfunction affects brain health and cognitive functioning, thus providing a starting point of neurodegenerative diseases. The term “cerebral metabolic syndrome” is proposed to highlight the importance of lifestyle factors in neurodegeneration and to describe the impact of increasing BBB dysfunction on neurodegeneration and dementia, especially in elderly patients. If untreated, the cerebral metabolic syndrome may evolve into dementia. Due to the high energy demand of the brain, impaired glucose transport across the BBB via glucose transporters as GLUT1 renders the brain increasingly susceptible to neurodegeneration. Apoptotic processes are further supported by the lack of essential metabolites of the phosphocholine synthesis. In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), inflammatory and infectious processes at the BBB increase the dysfunction and might be pace-making events. At this point, the potentially highly relevant role of the thrombocytic amyloid precursor protein (APP) in endothelial inflammation of the BBB is discussed. Chronic inflammatory processes of the BBB transmitted to an increasing number of brain areas might cause a lasting build-up of spreading, pore-forming β-amyloid fragments explaining the dramatic progression of the disease. In the view of the essential requirement of an early diagnosis to investigate and implement causal therapeutic strategies against dementia, brain imaging methods are of great importance. Therefore, status and opportunities in the field of diagnostic imaging of the living human brain will be portrayed, comprising diverse techniques such as positron emissions tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to uncover the patterns of atrophy, protein deposits, hypometabolism, and molecular as well as functional alterations in AD.</p>

<p>by Christophe Verbist, Michael G. Müller, Huibert D. Mansvelder, Robert Legenstein, Michele Giugliano</p>

The dynamics and the sharp onset of action potential (AP) generation have recently been the subject of intense experimental and theoretical investigations. According to the resistive coupling theory, an electrotonic interplay between the site of AP initiation in the axon and the somato-dendritic load determines the AP waveform. This phenomenon not only alters the shape of AP recorded at the soma, but also determines the dynamics of excitability across a variety of time scales. Supporting this statement, here we generalize a previous numerical study and extend it to the quantification of the input-output gain of the neuronal dynamical response. We consider three classes of multicompartmental mathematical models, ranging from ball-and-stick simplified descriptions of neuronal excitability to 3D-reconstructed biophysical models of excitatory neurons of rodent and human cortical tissue. For each model, we demonstrate that increasing the distance between the axonal site of AP initiation and the soma markedly increases the bandwidth of neuronal response properties. We finally consider the Liquid State Machine paradigm, exploring the impact of altering the site of AP initiation at the level of a neuronal population, and demonstrate that an optimal distance exists to boost the computational performance of the network in a simple classification task.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UWzOBTrjGuU" width="1" />

<p>by Hidetoshi Urakubo, Sho Yagishita, Haruo Kasai, Shin Ishii</p>

Animals remember temporal links between their actions and subsequent rewards. We previously discovered a synaptic mechanism underlying such reward learning in D1 receptor (D1R)-expressing spiny projection neurons (D1 SPN) of the striatum. Dopamine (DA) bursts promote dendritic spine enlargement in a time window of only a few seconds after paired pre- and post-synaptic spiking (pre–post pairing), which is termed as reinforcement plasticity (RP). The previous study has also identified underlying signaling pathways; however, it still remains unclear how the signaling dynamics results in RP. In the present study, we first developed a computational model of signaling dynamics of D1 SPNs. The D1 RP model successfully reproduced experimentally observed protein kinase A (PKA) activity, including its critical time window. In this model, adenylate cyclase type 1 (AC1) in the spines/thin dendrites played a pivotal role as a coincidence detector against pre–post pairing and DA burst. In particular, pre–post pairing (Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal) stimulated AC1 with a delay, and the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated AC1 was activated by the DA burst for the asymmetric time window. Moreover, the smallness of the spines/thin dendrites is crucial to the short time window for the PKA activity. We then developed a RP model for D2 SPNs, which also predicted the critical time window for RP that depended on the timing of pre–post pairing and phasic DA dip. AC1 worked for the coincidence detector in the D2 RP model as well. We further simulated the signaling pathway leading to Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activation and clarified the role of the downstream molecules of AC1 as the integrators that turn transient input signals into persistent spine enlargement. Finally, we discuss how such timing windows guide animals’ reward learning.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fA0hsdYc4Yc" width="1" />

Biomedical research is becoming increasingly data driven. New technologies that generate large-scale, complex data are continually emerging and evolving. As a result, there is a concurrent need for training researchers to use and understand new computational tools. Here we describe an efficient and effective approach to developing curriculum materials that can be deployed in a research environment to meet this need.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_m1OJLWtyg4" width="1" />

ELIXIR is a pan-European intergovernmental organisation for life science that aims to coordinate bioinformatics resources in a single infrastructure across Europe; bioinformatics training is central to its strategy, which aims to develop a training community that spans all ELIXIR member states. In an evidence-based approach for strengthening bioinformatics training programmes across Europe, the ELIXIR Training Platform, led by the ELIXIR EXCELERATE Quality and Impact Assessment Subtask in collaboration with the ELIXIR Training Coordinators Group, has implemented an assessment strategy to measure quality and impact of its entire training portfolio. Here, we present ELIXIR’s framework for assessing training quality and impact, which includes the following: specifying assessment aims, determining what data to collect in order to address these aims, and our strategy for centralised data collection to allow for ELIXIR-wide analyses. In addition, we present an overview of the ELIXIR training data collected over the past 4 years. We highlight the importance of a coordinated and consistent data collection approach and the relevance of defining specific metrics and answer scales for consortium-wide analyses as well as for comparison of data across iterations of the same course.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/n_U48-jMths" width="1" />

Myelosuppression is one of the most common and severe adverse events associated with anti-cancer therapies and can be a source of drug attrition. Current mathematical modeling methods for assessing cytopenia risk rely on indirect measurements of drug effects and primarily focus on single lineage responses to drugs. However, anti-cancer therapies have diverse mechanisms with varying degrees of effect across hematopoietic lineages. To improve predictive understanding of drug-induced myelosuppression, we developed a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model of hematopoiesis <i>in vitro</i> for quantifying the effects of anti-cancer agents on multiple hematopoietic cell lineages. We calibrated the system parameters of the model to cell kinetics data without treatment and then validated the model by showing that the inferred mechanisms of anti-proliferation and/or cell-killing are consistent with the published mechanisms for three classes of drugs with different mechanisms of action. Using a set of compounds as a sample set, we then analyzed novel compounds to predict their mechanisms and magnitude of myelosuppression. Further, these quantitative mechanisms are valuable for the development of translational <i>in vivo</i> models to predict clinical cytopenia effects.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/I81pnC3FqOw" width="1" />

Amyloids are protein aggregates with a highly ordered spatial structure giving them unique physicochemical properties. Different amyloids not only participate in the development of numerous incurable diseases but control vital functions in archaea, bacteria and eukarya. Plants are a poorly studied systematic group in the field of amyloid biology. Amyloid properties have not yet been demonstrated for plant proteins under native conditions in vivo. Here we show that seeds of garden pea <i>Pisum sativum</i> L. contain amyloid-like aggregates of storage proteins, the most abundant one, 7S globulin Vicilin, forms bona fide amyloids in vivo and in vitro. Full-length Vicilin contains 2 evolutionary conserved β-barrel domains, Cupin-1.1 and Cupin-1.2, that self-assemble in vitro into amyloid fibrils with similar physicochemical properties. However, Cupin-1.2 fibrils unlike Cupin-1.1 can seed Vicilin fibrillation. In vivo, Vicilin forms amyloids in the cotyledon cells that bind amyloid-specific dyes and possess resistance to detergents and proteases. The Vicilin amyloid accumulation increases during seed maturation and wanes at germination. Amyloids of Vicilin resist digestion by gastrointestinal enzymes, persist in canned peas, and exhibit toxicity for yeast and mammalian cells. Our finding for the first time reveals involvement of amyloid formation in the accumulation of storage proteins in plant seeds.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/8AvMhlhIXgY" width="1" />

<p>by Mudan He, Ru Zhang, Shengbo Jiao, Fenghua Zhang, Ding Ye, Houpeng Wang, Yonghua Sun</p>

Maternal β-catenin activity is essential and critical for dorsal induction and its dorsal activation has been thoroughly studied. However, how the maternal β-catenin activity is suppressed in the nondorsal cells remains poorly understood. Nanog is known to play a central role for maintenance of the pluripotency and maternal -zygotic transition (MZT). Here, we reveal a novel role of Nanog as a strong repressor of maternal β-catenin signaling to safeguard the embryo against hyperactivation of maternal β-catenin activity and hyperdorsalization. In zebrafish, knockdown of <i>nanog</i> at different levels led to either posteriorization or dorsalization, mimicking zygotic or maternal activation of Wnt/β-catenin activities, and the maternal zygotic mutant of <i>nanog</i> (MZ<i>nanog</i>) showed strong activation of maternal β-catenin activity and hyperdorsalization. Although a constitutive activator-type Nanog (Vp16-Nanog, lacking the N terminal) perfectly rescued the MZT defects of MZ<i>nanog</i>, it did not rescue the phenotypes resulting from β-catenin signaling activation. Mechanistically, the N terminal of Nanog directly interacts with T-cell factor (TCF) and interferes with the binding of β-catenin to TCF, thereby attenuating the transcriptional activity of β-catenin. Therefore, our study establishes a novel role for Nanog in repressing maternal β-catenin activity and demonstrates a transcriptional switch between β-catenin/TCF and Nanog/TCF complexes, which safeguards the embryo from global activation of maternal β-catenin activity.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/1w2ekyH-Fk8" width="1" />

Background<p>Parkinson disease (PD) patients have difficulty with self-initiated (SI) movements, presumably related to basal ganglia thalamocortical (BGTC) circuit dysfunction, while showing less impairment with externally cued (EC) movements.</p>Objectives<p>We investigate the role of BGTC in movement initiation and the neural underpinning of impaired SI compared to EC movements in PD using multifocal intracranial recordings and correlating signals with symptom severity.</p>Methods<p>We compared time-resolved neural activities within and between globus pallidus internus (GPi) and motor cortex during between SI and EC movements recorded invasively in 13 PD patients undergoing deep brain stimulation implantation. We compared cortical (but not subcortical) dynamics with those recorded in 10 essential tremor (ET) patients, who do not have impairments in movement initiation.</p>Results<p>SI movements in PD are associated with greater low-beta (13–20 Hz) power suppression during pre-movement period in GPi and motor cortex compared to EC movements in PD and compared to SI movements in ET (motor cortex only). SI movements in PD are uniquely associated with significant low-beta pallidocortical coherence suppression during movement execution that correlates with bradykinesia severity. In ET, motor cortex neural dynamics during EC movements do not significantly differ from that observed in PD and do not significantly differ between SI and EC movements.</p>Conclusion<p>These findings implicate low beta BGTC oscillations in impaired SI movements in PD. These results provide a physiological basis for the strategy of using EC movements in PD, circumventing diseased neural circuits associated with SI movements and instead engaging circuits that function similarly to those without PD.</p>

<p>Nowadays, great efforts are made to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms that underlie structural neuronal plasticity. Moreover, the identification of signaling pathways involved in the development of psychiatric disorders aids the screening of possible therapeutic targets. Genetic variations or alterations in GPM6A expression are linked to neurological disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, and Alzheimer’s disease. GPM6A encodes the neuronal surface glycoprotein M6a that promotes filopodia/spine, dendrite, and synapse formation by unknown mechanisms. A substantial body of evidence suggests that the extracellular loops of M6a command its function. However, the proteins that associate with them and that modulate neuronal plasticity have not been determined yet. To address this question, we generated a chimera protein that only contains the extracellular loops of M6a and performed a co-immunoprecipitation with rat hippocampus samples followed by TMT/MS. Here, we report 72 proteins, which are good candidates to interact with M6a’s extracellular loops and modify its function. Gene ontology (GO) analysis showed that 63% of the potential M6a’s interactor proteins belong to the category “synapse,” at both sides of the synaptic cleft, “neuron projections” (51%) and “presynapse” (49%). In this sense, we showed that endogenous M6a interacts with piccolo, synaptic vesicle protein 2B, and synapsin 1 in mature cultured hippocampal neurons. Interestingly, about 28% of the proteins left were related to the “myelin sheath” annotation, suggesting that M6a could interact with proteins at the surface of oligodendrocytes. Indeed, we demonstrated the (cis and trans) interaction between M6a and proteolipid protein (PLP) in neuroblastoma N2a cells. Finally, the 72 proteins were subjected to disease-associated genes and variants screening by DisGeNET. Apart from the diseases that have already been associated with M6a, most of the proteins are also involved in “autistic disorder,” “epilepsy,” and “seizures” increasing the spectrum of disorders in which M6a could play a role.

<p>Laminin α2 gene (LAMA2)-related Congenital Muscular Dystrophy (CMD) was distinguished by a defining central nervous system (CNS) abnormality—aberrant white matter signals by MRI—when first described in the 1990s. In the past 25 years, researchers and clinicians have expanded our knowledge of brain involvement in LAMA2-related CMD, also known as Congenital Muscular Dystrophy Type 1A (MDC1A). Neurological changes in MDC1A can be structural, including lissencephaly and agyria, as well as functional, including epilepsy and intellectual disability. Mouse models of MDC1A include both spontaneous and targeted LAMA2 mutations and range from a partial loss of LAMA2 function (e.g., dy<sup>2J</sup>/dy<sup>2J</sup>), to a complete loss of LAMA2 expression (dy<sup>3K</sup>/dy<sup>3K</sup>). Diverse cellular and molecular changes have been reported in the brains of MDC1A mouse models, including blood-brain barrier dysfunction, altered neuro- and gliogenesis, changes in synaptic plasticity, and decreased myelination, providing mechanistic insight into potential neurological dysfunction in MDC1A. In this review article, we discuss selected studies that illustrate the potential scope and complexity of disturbances in brain development in MDC1A, and as well as highlight mechanistic insights that are emerging from mouse models.</p>

<p>Impairment of executive function has been reported in patients with prolactinomas. However, few studies have investigated the electrophysiological mechanisms of response activation and response inhibition in these patients. In this study, we employ an event-related potentials (ERPs) technique to quantitatively assess response activation and inhibition before and after the surgical treatment of prolactinomas. A 64-electrode electroencephalogram (EEG) skullcap was used to record the brain activity in 20 pre-operative patients, 20 follow-up post-operative patients, and 20 healthy controls (HCs) while performing the visual Go/Nogo task. As expected, we identified P300 across all study populations that could reflect response activation and inhibition. Across the three groups, the Nogo stimuli evoked larger frontal-central P300 than the Go stimuli did. In contrast, the Go trials elicited larger parietal P300 than the Nogo trials did. The peak latency of P300 was significantly delayed in both the pre-operative and the post-operative groups compared to the HCs. The amplitude of P300 in both the Go and the Nogo conditions was significantly decreased in the pre-operative patients compared with that of the HCs. At 6 months post-operatively, the prolactinoma patients showed an increase in amplitude of P300 during both the Go and the Nogo tasks. These findings indicate that the prolactinoma patients suffer from deficits in response activation and inhibition, which could be improved by surgical treatment.</p>

<p>Perspective taking is the ability to take into account what the other agent knows. This skill is not unique to humans as it is also displayed by other animals like chimpanzees. It is an essential ability for social interactions, including efficient cooperation, competition, and communication. Here we present our progress toward building artificial agents with such abilities. We implemented a perspective taking task inspired by experiments done with chimpanzees. We show that agents controlled by artificial neural networks can learn via reinforcement learning to pass simple tests that require some aspects of perspective taking capabilities. We studied whether this ability is more readily learned by agents with information encoded in allocentric or egocentric form for both their visual perception and motor actions. We believe that, in the long run, building artificial agents with perspective taking ability can help us develop artificial intelligence that is more human-like and easier to communicate with.</p>

<p>Previous studies have shown that cortico-striatal pathways link auditory signals to action-selection and reward-learning behavior through excitatory projections. Only recently it has been demonstrated that long-range GABAergic cortico-striatal somatostatin-expressing neurons in the auditory cortex project to the dorsal striatum, and functionally inhibit the main projecting neuronal population, the spiny projecting neuron. Here we tested the hypothesis that parvalbumin-expressing neurons of the auditory cortex can also send long-range projections to the auditory striatum. To address this fundamental question, we took advantage of viral and non-viral anatomical tracing approaches to identify cortico-striatal parvalbumin neurons (CS-Parv inhibitory projections → auditory striatum). Here, we describe their anatomical distribution in the auditory cortex and determine the anatomical and electrophysiological properties of layer 5 CS-Parv neurons. We also analyzed their characteristic voltage-dependent membrane potential gamma oscillation, showing that intrinsic membrane mechanisms generate them. The inherent membrane mechanisms can also trigger intermittent and irregular bursts (stuttering) of the action potential in response to steps of depolarizing current pulses.</p>

<p>Following an injury to the central nervous system (CNS), spontaneous plasticity is observed throughout the neuraxis and affects multiple key circuits. Much of this spontaneous plasticity can elicit beneficial and deleterious functional outcomes, depending on the context of plasticity and circuit affected. Injury-induced activation of the neuroimmune system has been proposed to be a major factor in driving this plasticity, as neuroimmune and inflammatory factors have been shown to influence cellular, synaptic, structural, and anatomical plasticity. Here, we will review the mechanisms through which the neuroimmune system mediates plasticity after CNS injury. Understanding the role of specific neuroimmune factors in driving adaptive and maladaptive plasticity may offer valuable therapeutic insight into how to promote adaptive plasticity and/or diminish maladaptive plasticity, respectively.</p>

<p>Diabetes-associated cognitive impairment (DACI) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus (DM) that affects the central nervous system. Cognitive impairment, such as learning and memory impairment, and even dementia, is the main clinical manifestation of DACI. Unfortunately, there is no effective means by which to delay the cognitive symptoms of DM. Evidence has shown that strawberry leaf extract could alleviate cognitive decline, suppress oxidative stress, and reduce inflammatory responses in rats. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of strawberry leaf extract on cognitive function in a rat model of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. After the continuous administration of strawberry leaf extract for 4 weeks, the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test results showed that the cognitive impairment of the rats was alleviated. Moreover, strawberry leaf extract significantly reduced the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), decreased the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), improved the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), decreased the mRNA expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and decreased the protein expression of caspase-3 and caspase-9 in the hippocampus of DM rats. Also, transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NF-E2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/hemeoxygenase-1(HO-1) signaling was activated by the administration of strawberry leaf extract. Our findings indicate that strawberry leaf extract may be a potential drug candidate for the treatment of DACI and may be used as a basis for further research on the development of drugs for cognitive impairment in diabetes.</p>

<p>Working memory (WM) is a limited-capacity cognitive system that allows the storage and use of a limited amount of information for a short period of time. Two WM processes can be distinguished: maintenance (i.e., storing, monitoring, and matching information) and manipulation (i.e., reordering and updating information). A number of studies have reported an age-related decline in WM, but the mechanisms underlying this deterioration need to be investigated. Previous research, including studies conducted in our laboratory, revealed that age-related cognitive deficits are related to decreased millisecond timing, i.e., the ability to perceive and organize incoming events in time. The aim of the current study was: (1) to identify in the elderly the brain network involved in the maintenance and manipulation WM processes; and (2) to use an fMRI task to investigate the relation between the brain activity associated with these two processes and the efficiency of temporal information processing (TIP) on a millisecond level reflected by psychophysical indices. Subjects were 41 normal healthy elderly people aged from 62 to 78 years. They performed: (1) an auditory verbal n-back task for assessing WM efficiency in an MRI scanner; and (2) a psychophysical auditory temporal-order judgment (TOJ) task for assessing temporal resolution in the millisecond domain outside the scanner. The n-back task comprised three conditions (0-, 1-, and 2-back), which allowed maintenance (1- vs. 0-back comparisons) and manipulation (2- vs. 1-back comparisons) processes to be distinguished. Results revealed the involvement of a similar brain network in the elderly to that found in previous studies. However, during maintenance processes, we found relatively limited and focused activations, which were significantly extended during manipulation. A novel result of our study, never reported before, is an indication of significant moderate correlations between the efficiency of WM and TIP. These correlations were found only for manipulation but not for maintenance. Our results confirmed the hypothesis that manipulation in the elderly is a dynamic process requiring skilled millisecond timing with high temporal resolution. We conclude that millisecond timing contributes to WM manipulation in the elderly, but not to maintenance.</p>

<p>by Doina Bucur, Petter Holme</p>

Identifying important nodes for disease spreading is a central topic in network epidemiology. We investigate how well the position of a node, characterized by standard network measures, can predict its epidemiological importance in any graph of a given number of nodes. This is in contrast to other studies that deal with the easier prediction problem of ranking nodes by their epidemic importance in given graphs. As a benchmark for epidemic importance, we calculate the exact expected outbreak size given a node as the source. We study exhaustively all graphs of a given size, so do not restrict ourselves to certain generative models for graphs, nor to graph data sets. Due to the large number of possible nonisomorphic graphs of a fixed size, we are limited to ten-node graphs. We find that combinations of two or more centralities are predictive (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> scores of 0.91 or higher) even for the most difficult parameter values of the epidemic simulation. Typically, these successful combinations include one normalized spectral centrality (such as PageRank or Katz centrality) and one measure that is sensitive to the number of edges in the graph.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tvShCCVi60c" width="1" />

<p>by David Moi, Laurent Kilchoer, Pablo S. Aguilar, Christophe Dessimoz</p>

Phylogenetic profiling is a computational method to predict genes involved in the same biological process by identifying protein families which tend to be jointly lost or retained across the tree of life. Phylogenetic profiling has customarily been more widely used with prokaryotes than eukaryotes, because the method is thought to require many diverse genomes. There are now many eukaryotic genomes available, but these are considerably larger, and typical phylogenetic profiling methods require at least quadratic time as a function of the number of genes. We introduce a fast, scalable phylogenetic profiling approach entitled HogProf, which leverages hierarchical orthologous groups for the construction of large profiles and locality-sensitive hashing for efficient retrieval of similar profiles. We show that the approach outperforms Enhanced Phylogenetic Tree, a phylogeny-based method, and use the tool to reconstruct networks and query for interactors of the kinetochore complex as well as conserved proteins involved in sexual reproduction: Hap2, Spo11 and Gex1. HogProf enables large-scale phylogenetic profiling across the three domains of life, and will be useful to predict biological pathways among the hundreds of thousands of eukaryotic species that will become available in the coming few years.

<p>by Cees J. Voesenek, Gen Li, Florian T. Muijres, Johan L. van Leeuwen</p>

Most fish swim with body undulations that result from fluid–structure interactions between the fish’s internal tissues and the surrounding water. Gaining insight into these complex fluid–structure interactions is essential to understand how fish swim. To this end, we developed a dedicated experimental–numerical inverse dynamics approach to calculate the lateral bending moment distributions for a large-amplitude undulatory swimmer that moves freely in three-dimensional space. We combined automated motion tracking from multiple synchronised high-speed video sequences, computation of fluid dynamic stresses on the swimmer’s body from computational fluid dynamics, and bending moment calculations using these stresses as input for a novel beam model of the body. The bending moment, which represent the system’s net actuation, varies over time and along the fish’s central axis due to muscle actions, passive tissues, inertia, and fluid dynamics. Our three-dimensional analysis of 113 swimming events of zebrafish larvae ranging in age from 3 to 12 days after fertilisation shows that these bending moment patterns are not only relatively simple but also strikingly similar throughout early development and from fast starts to periodic swimming. This suggests that fish larvae may produce and adjust swimming movements relatively simply, yet effectively, while restructuring their neuromuscular control system throughout their rapid development.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/xnSPEDauSUs" width="1" />

<p>Impairments of the lower urinary tract function including urine storage and voiding are widely spread among patients with spinal cord injuries. The management of such patients includes bladder catheterization, surgical and pharmacological approaches, which reduce the morbidity from urinary tract-related complications. However, to date, there is no effective treatment of neurogenic bladder and restoration of urinary function. In the present study, we examined neuromodulation of detrusor (Detr) and external urethral sphincter by epidural electrical stimulation (EES) of lumbar and sacral regions of the spinal cord in chronic rats. To our knowledge, it is the first chronic study where detrusor and external urethral sphincter signals were recorded simultaneously to monitor their neuromodulation by site-specific spinal cord stimulation (SCS). The data obtained demonstrate that activation of detrusor muscle mainly occurs during the stimulation of the upper lumbar (L1) and lower lumbar (L5-L6) spinal segments whereas external urethral sphincter was activated predominantly by sacral stimulation. These findings can be used for the development of neurorehabilitation strategies based on spinal cord epidural stimulation for autonomic function recovery after severe spinal cord injury (SCI).</p>

<p>Taurine is a sulfur-containing amino acid that is widely expressed throughout the human brain, heart, retina, and muscle tissues. Taurine deficiency is associated with cardiomyopathy, renal dysfunction, abnormalities of the developing nervous system, and epilepsy which suggests a role specific to excitable tissues. Like vertebrates, invertebrates maintain high levels of taurine during embryonic and larval development, which decline during aging, indicating a potential developmental role. Notwithstanding its extensive presence throughout, taurine’s precise role/s during early brain development, function, and repair remains largely unknown in both vertebrate and invertebrate. Here, we investigated whether taurine affects neurite outgrowth, synapse formation, and synaptic transmission between postnatal day 0 rat cortical neurons in vitro, whereas its synaptogenic role was tested more directly using the Lymnaea soma-soma synapse model. We provide direct evidence that when applied at physiological concentrations, taurine exerts a significant neurotrophic effect on neuritic outgrowth and thickness of neurites as well as the expression of synaptic puncta as revealed by immunostaining of presynaptic synaptophysin and postsynaptic PSD95 proteins in rat cortical neurons, indicating direct involvement in synapse development. To demonstrate taurine’s direct effects on neurons in the absence of glia and other confounding factors, we next exploited individually identified pre- and postsynaptic neurons from the mollusk Lymnaea stagnalis. We found that taurine increased both the incidence of synapse formation (percent of cells that form synapses) and the efficacy of synaptic transmission between the paired neurons. This effect was comparable, but not additive, to Lymnaea trophic factor-induced synaptogenesis. This study thus provides direct morphological and functional evidence that taurine plays an important role in neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis, and synaptic transmission during the early stages of brain development and that this role is conserved across both vertebrate and invertebrate species.</p>

<p>Sleep is a vital function of the nervous system that contributes to brain and bodily homeostasis, energy levels, cognitive ability, and other key functions of a variety of organisms. Dysfunctional sleep induces neural problems and is a key part of almost all human psychiatric disorders including substance abuse disorders. The hypnotic effects of cannabis have long been known and there is increasing use of phytocannabinoids and other formulations as sleep aids. Thus, it is crucial to gain a better understanding of the neurobiological basis of cannabis drug effects on sleep, as well as the role of the endogenous cannabinoid system in sleep physiology. In this review article, we summarize the current state of knowledge concerning sleep-related endogenous cannabinoid function derived from research on humans and rodent models. We also review information on acute and chronic cannabinoid drug effects on sleep in these organisms, and molecular mechanisms that may contribute to these effects. We point out the potential benefits of acute cannabinoids for sleep improvement, but also the potential sleep-disruptive effects of withdrawal following chronic cannabinoid drug use. Prescriptions for future research in this burgeoning field are also provided.</p>

<p>Although it has been demonstrated that edge-based information is more important than surface-based information in incidental category learning, it remains unclear how the two types of information play different roles in incidental category learning. To address this issue, the present study combined behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) techniques in an incidental category learning task in which the categories were defined by either edge- or surface-based features. The results from Experiment 1 showed that participants could simultaneously learn both edge- and surface-based information in incidental category learning, and importantly, there was a larger learning effect for the edge-based category than for the surface-based category. The behavioral results from Experiment 2 replicated those from Experiment 1, and the ERP results further revealed that the stimuli from the edge-based category elicited larger anterior and posterior P2 components than those from the surface-based category, whereas the stimuli from the surface-based category elicited larger anterior N1 and P3 components than those from the edge-based category. Taken together, the results suggest that, although surface-based information might attract more attention during feature detection, edge-based information plays more important roles in evaluating the relevance of information in making a decision in categorization.</p>

<p>This paper presents a unique approach for wavelet-based MRI brain image de-noising. Adaptive soft and hard threshold functions are first proposed to improve the results of standard soft and hard threshold functions for image de-noising in the wavelet domain. Then, we applied the newly emerged improved adaptive generalized Gaussian distributed oriented threshold function (improved AGGD) on the MRI images to improve the results of the adaptive soft and hard threshold functions and also to display, this non-linear and data-driven function can work promisingly even in de-noising the medical images. The most important characteristic of this function is that it is dependent on the image since it is combined with an adaptive generalized Gaussian distribution function.Traditional thresholding neural network (TNN) and optimized based noise reduction have good results but fail to keep the visual quality and may blur some parts of an image. In TNN and optimized based image de-noising, it was required to use Least-mean-square (LMS) learning and optimization algorithms, respectively to find the optimum threshold value and parameters of the threshold functions which was time consuming. To address these issues, the improved AGGD based image de-noising approach is introduced to enhance the qualitative and quantitative performance of the above mentioned image de-noising techniques. De-noising using improved AGGD threshold function provides better results in terms of Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and also faster processing time since there is no need to use any Least-mean-square (LMS) learning and optimization algorithms for obtaining the optimum value and parameters of the thresholding functions. The experimental results indicate that image de-noising using improved AGGD threshold performs pretty well comparing with the adaptive threshold, standard threshold, improved wavelet threshold, and the optimized based noise reduction methods.</p>

<p>Premature ejaculation (PE) is the most common male sexual dysfunction. The brain disturbances that cause this disorder remain poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate how the morphology of cortical and subcortical brain structures differed in PE, how these morphologic differences were associated with severity measures of PE, such as intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT), and how these cortical and subcortical structures were causally connected through mediation analysis. Anatomical MRI scans were acquired from 39 male participants, 23 with PE (28.78 ± 4.32 years), and 16 without PE (27.88 ± 3.65 years). We used a subcortical analysis package within FSL to perform subcortical shape segmentation and statistical analysis. The PE group was compared with the normal control (NC) group in the shapes of 15 subcortical structures with general linear models [p &lt; 0.05, family-wise error (FWE)-corrected]. We analyzed the cortical complexity revealed by the gyrification index using the Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT12). Vertex-wise shape analyses revealed outward shape deformations (expansions) in the left hippocampus and bilateral thalamus. Gyrification index analyses revealed that the right orbital frontal cortex and the right nucleus accumbens had greater complexity in PE patients. The shape deformations were positively correlated with the IELTs in the NC group, while this relationship was interrupted in the PE group. PE is associated with outward deformations of the subcortical surfaces and more complexity of the cortical structures. These morphological differences may be the basis of the brain functional alterations underlying PE.</p>

<p>Generalization is the ability to apply past experience to similar but non-identical situations. It not only affects stimulus-outcome relationships, as observed in conditioning experiments, but may also be essential for adaptive behaviors, which involve the interaction between individuals and their environment. Computational modeling could potentially clarify the effect of generalization on adaptive behaviors and how this effect emerges from the underlying computation. Recent neurobiological observation indicated that the striatal dopamine system achieves generalization and subsequent discrimination by updating the corticostriatal synaptic connections in differential response to reward and punishment. In this study, we analyzed how computational characteristics in this neurobiological system affects adaptive behaviors. We proposed a novel reinforcement learning model with multilayer neural networks in which the synaptic weights of only the last layer are updated according to the prediction error. We set fixed connections between the input and hidden layers to maintain the similarity of inputs in the hidden-layer representation. This network enabled fast generalization of reward and punishment learning, and thereby facilitated safe and efficient exploration of spatial navigation tasks. Notably, it demonstrated a quick reward approach and efficient punishment aversion in the early learning phase, compared to algorithms that do not show generalization. However, disturbance of the network that causes noisy generalization and impaired discrimination induced maladaptive valuation. These results suggested the advantage and potential drawback of computation by the striatal dopamine system with regard to adaptive behaviors.</p>

<p>We live in a world continuously immersed in noise, an environmental, recreational, and occupational factor present in almost every daily human activity. Exposure to high-level noise could affect the auditory function of individuals at any age, resulting in a condition called noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Given that by 2018, more than 400 million people worldwide were suffering from disabling hearing loss and that about one-third involved noise over-exposure, which represents more than 100 million people, this hearing impairment represents a serious health problem. As of today, there are no therapeutic measures available to treat NIHL. Conventional preventive measures, including public awareness and education and physical barriers to noise, do not seem to suffice, as the population is still being affected by damaging noise levels. Therefore, it is necessary to develop or test pharmacological agents that may prevent and/or diminish the impact of noise on hearing. Data availability about the pathophysiological processes involved in triggering NIHL has allowed researchers to use compounds, that could act as effective therapies, by targeting specific mechanisms such as the excess generation of free radicals and blood flow restriction to the cochlea. In this review, we summarize the advantages/disadvantages of these therapeutic agents, providing a critical view of whether they could be effective in the human clinic.</p>

<p>Comprehensive analysis of 3D angioarchitecture within the intact rat spinal cord remains technically challenging due to its sophisticated anatomical properties. In this study, we aim to present a framework for ultrahigh-resolution digitalized mapping of the normal rat spinal cord angioarchitecture and to determine the physiological parameters using synchrotron radiation micro-CT (SRμCT). Male SD rats were used in this ex vivo study. After a proportional mixture of contrast agents perfusion, the intact spinal cord covered the cervical spinal from the upper of the 1st cervical vertebra to the 5th lumbar vertebra was harvested and cut into proper lengths within three distinct regions: Cervical 3–5 levels, Thoracic 10–12 levels, Lumbar 3–5 levels spinal cord and examined using SRμCT. This method enabled the replication of the complicated microvasculature network of the normal rat spinal cord at the ultrahigh-resolution level, allowing for the precise quantitative analysis of the vascular morphological difference among cervical, thoracic and lumbar spinal cord in a 3D manner. Apart from a series of delicate 3D digital anatomical maps of the rat spinal cord angioarchitecture ranging from the cervical and thoracic to the lumbar spinal cord were presented, the 3D reconstruction data of SRμCT made the 3D printing of the spinal cord targeted selected microvasculature reality, that possibly provided deep insight into the nature and role of spinal cord intricate angioarchitecture. Our data proposed a new approach to outline systematic visual and quantitative evaluations on the 3D arrangement of the entire hierarchical microvasculature of the normal rat spinal cord at ultrahigh resolution. The technique may have great potential and become useful for future research on the poorly understood nature and function of the neurovascular interaction, particularly to investigate their pathology changes in various models of neurovascular disease.</p>

We assessed the serum levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, total cholesterol, selected metals (Cu, Al, Zn, Pb, Mn, Cad), and total-tau and amyloid beta-42 protein in mild (n = 71), moderate (n = 86) and severe (n = 25) cognitively impaired patients and compared them with age-matched healthy controls (n = 90) from Pakistan. We found that a decrease in HDL cholesterol (correlation coefficient r = 0.467) and amyloid beta-42 (r = 0.451) were associated with increased severity of CI. On the other hand, an increase in cholesterol ratio (r = −0.562), LDL cholesterol (r = −0.428), triglycerides, and total-tau (r = −0.443) were associated with increased severity of CI. Increases in cholesterol ratio showed the strongest association and correlated with increases in tau concentration (r = 0.368), and increased triglycerides were associated with decreased amyloid beta-42 (r = −0.345). Increased Cu levels showed the strongest association with tau increase and increased Zn and Pb levels showed the strongest association with reduced amyloid beta-42 levels. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) showed the cutoff values of blood metals (Al, Pb, Cu, Cad, Zn, and Mn), total-tau, and amyloid beta-42 with sensitivity and specificity. Our data show for the first time that blood lipids, metals (particularly Cu, Zn, Pb, and Al), serum amyloid-beta-42/tau proteins modulate each other’s levels and can be collectively used as a predictive marker for CI.</p>

<p>Diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) place a significant burden on health care systems in the world and its aging populations. These diseases have long been regarded as separate entities; however, advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and the receptors for AGEs (RAGE) may be a link between diabetes and AD. In our study, mice injected with AGEs through stereotaxic surgery showed significant AD-like features: behavior showed decreased memory; immunofluorescence showed increased phosphorylated tau and APP. These results suggest links between diabetes and AD. Patients with diabetes are at a higher risk of developing AD, and the possible underlying molecular components of this association are now beginning to emerge.</p>

<p>Background and purpose: The aggregation of vascular risk factors (VRFs) can aggravate cognitive impairment in stroke-free patients. Metabolites in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may irreversibly reflect early functional deterioration. This study evaluated small-molecule metabolites (&lt;1,000 Da) in the serum and CSF of patients with different degrees of cerebrovascular burden and investigated the correlation between metabolism and cognitive performance associated with VRFs.</p><p>Methods: The subjects were divided into a low-risk group (10-year stroke risk ≤ 5%), a middle-risk group (10-year stroke risk &gt;5% and &lt;15%), and a high-risk group (10 years stroke risk ≥ 15%) according to the Framingham stroke risk profile (FSRP) score, which was used to quantify VRFs. We assess the cognitive function of the participants. We semiquantitatively quantified the small molecules using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The correlation between the small molecules and cognitive function, along with VRFs, was investigated to identify key small molecules and possible underlying metabolic pathways.</p><p>Results: When the FSRP scores increased, the cognitive performances of the subjects decreased, specifically the performance regarding the tasks of immediate memory, delayed recall, and executive function. Seven metabolites (2-aminobutyric acid, Asp Asp Ser, Asp Thr Arg, Ile Cys Arg, 1-methyluric acid, 3-tert-butyladipic acid, and 5α-dihydrotestosterone glucuronide) in serum and three metabolites [Asp His, 13-HOTrE(r), and 2,5-di-tert-Butylhydroquinone] in CSF were significantly increased, and one metabolite (arachidonoyl PAF C-16) in serum was significantly decreased in high-risk group subjects. Among these metabolites, 1-methyluric acid, 3-tert-butyladipic, acid and Ile Cys Arg in serum and 13-HOTrE(r), 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone, and Asp His in CSF were found to be negatively related with cognitive performance in the high-risk group. Arachidonoyl PAF C-16 in serum was found to be associated with better cognitive performance. Caffeine metabolism and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) were identified as key pathways.</p><p>Conclusions: 1-Methyluric acid, 3-tert-butyladipic acid, arachidonoyl PAF C-16, and Ile Cys Arg in serum and 13-HOTrE(r), 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone, and Asp His in CSF were identified as potential biomarkers of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) at the early stage. Caffeine metabolism and the TCA cycle may play important roles in the pathophysiology of VRF-associated cognitive impairment.</p>

<p>Introduction: The diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) mainly relies on clinical manifestation, but may be difficult to make in very early stages of the disease, especially in pre-motor PD. Thus, there is great interest in finding a biomarker for PD. Among diagnostic biomarkers, the most promising molecules are those which reflect the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease. Until now, only α-synuclein, a classical CSF Alzheimer’s disease biomarker, and neurofilament light (NFL) chains have turned out to be helpful in differential diagnosis between PD and healthy control subjects.</p><p>Aim: To assess whether CSF molecules related to some pathological processes present in PD might be of interest in the diagnosis of PD and whether they correlate with disease severity.</p><p>Methods: CSF levels of S100B and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) were measured in 58 PD patients and in 28 healthy control subjects. Correlations were determined between the levels of these CSF molecules and measures of disease severity (Hoehn–Yahr scale and UPDRS part III), as well as disease duration and levodopa dose.</p><p>Results: CSF S100B and CSF NSE were both significantly increased in PD subjects vs. healthy controls (p = 0.007 and p = 0.00035, respectively). CSF S100B was significantly positively correlated with measures of disease severity (H-Y score and UPDRS part III), as well as disease duration (p &lt; 0.05). No correlation was found between CSF NSE levels and disease severity or disease duration (p &gt; 0.05). CSF S100B levels alone provided a relatively high discrimination (AUC 0.77) between PD and healthy controls, with 60.7% sensitivity and 88.5% specificity (p &lt; 0.001) at a cut-off value of 123.22 pg/ml. Similarly, CSF NSE levels alone provided a relatively high discrimination (AUC 0.775) between PD and healthy controls, with 78.6% sensitivity and 74.1% specificity at a cut-off value of 51.56 ng/ml (p &lt; 0.001).</p><p>Conclusions: Our results show that both CSF S100B and CSF NSE seem to be promising markers of the axonal and glial degeneration present in PD. Additionally CSF S100B may be a promising marker of PD progression.</p>

Social interaction can be seen as a dynamic feedback loop that couples action, reaction, and internal cognitive processes across individual agents. A fuller understanding of the social brain requires a description of how the neural dynamics across coupled brains are linked and how they coevolve over time. We elaborate a multi-brain framework that considers social interaction as an integrated network of neural systems that dynamically shape behavior, shared cognitive states, and social relationships.

Park et al. show that the human brain constructs a multidimensional cognitive map from piecemeal observations of the outcomes of individual decisions. The cognitive map constructed in the hippocampal-entorhinal system and orbitofrontal cortex represents abstract relationships among discrete entities, enabling efficient inferences to guide new decisions.

Classically, visual processing is described as a cascade of local feedforward computations. Feedforward Convolutional Neural Networks (ffCNNs) have shown how powerful such models can be. However, using visual crowding as a well-controlled challenge, we previously showed that no classic model of vision, including ffCNNs, can explain human global shape processing. Here, we show that Capsule Neural Networks (CapsNets), combining ffCNNs with recurrent grouping and segmentation, solve this challenge. We also show that ffCNNs and standard recurrent CNNs do not, suggesting that the grouping and segmentation capabilities of CapsNets are crucial. Furthermore, we provide psychophysical evidence that grouping and segmentation are implemented recurrently in humans, and show that CapsNets reproduce these results well. We discuss why recurrence seems needed to implement grouping and segmentation efficiently. Together, we provide mutually reinforcing psychophysical and computational evidence that a recurrent grouping and segmentation process is essential to understand the visual system and create better models that harness global shape computations.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eskchC4EIf8" width="1" />

Ageing affects a wide range of phenotypes at all scales, but an objective measure of ageing remains challenging, even in simple model organisms. To measure the ageing process, we characterized the sequence of alterations of multiple phenotypes at organismal scale. Hundreds of morphological, postural, and behavioral features were extracted from high-resolution videos. Out of the 1019 features extracted, 896 are ageing biomarkers, defined as those that show a significant correlation with relative age (age divided by lifespan). We used support vector regression to predict age, remaining life and lifespan of individual <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i>. The quality of these predictions (age R<sup>2</sup> = 0.79; remaining life R<sup>2</sup> = 0.77; lifespan R<sup>2</sup> = 0.72) increased with the number of features added to the model, supporting the use of multiple features to quantify ageing. We quantified the rate of ageing as how quickly animals moved through a phenotypic space; we quantified health decline as the slope of the declining predicted remaining life. In both ageing dimensions, we found that short lived-animals aged faster than long-lived animals. In our conditions, for isogenic wild-type worms, the health decline of the individuals was scaled to their lifespan without significant deviation from the average for short- or long-lived animals.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Xw3MR4g2MV8" width="1" />

Although there is increasing importance placed on the use of mathematical models for the effective design and management of long-term parasite elimination, it is becoming clear that transmission models are most useful when they reflect the processes pertaining to local infection dynamics as opposed to generalized dynamics. Such localized models must also be developed even when the data required for characterizing local transmission processes are limited or incomplete, as is often the case for neglected tropical diseases, including the disease system studied in this work, viz. lymphatic filariasis (LF). Here, we draw on progress made in the field of computational knowledge discovery to present a reconstructive simulation framework that addresses these challenges by facilitating the discovery of both data and models concurrently in areas where we have insufficient observational data. Using available data from eight sites from Nigeria and elsewhere, we demonstrate that our data-model discovery system is able to estimate local transmission models and missing pre-control infection information using generalized knowledge of filarial transmission dynamics, monitoring survey data, and details of historical interventions. Forecasts of the impacts of interventions carried out in each site made by the models estimated using the reconstructed baseline data matched temporal infection observations and provided useful information regarding when transmission interruption is likely to have occurred. Assessments of elimination and resurgence probabilities based on the models also suggest a protective effect of vector control against the reemergence of LF transmission after stopping drug treatments. The reconstructive computational framework for model and data discovery developed here highlights how coupling models with available data can generate new knowledge about complex, data-limited systems, and support the effective management of disease programs in the face of critical data gaps.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WnbH81XzJ8c" width="1" />

<p>by Andrew R. Ghazi, Xianguo Kong, Ed S. Chen, Leonard C. Edelstein, Chad A. Shaw</p>

NGS studies have uncovered an ever-growing catalog of human variation while leaving an enormous gap between observed variation and experimental characterization of variant function. High-throughput screens powered by NGS have greatly increased the rate of variant functionalization, but the development of comprehensive statistical methods to analyze screen data has lagged. In the massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA), short barcodes are counted by sequencing DNA libraries transfected into cells and the cell’s output RNA in order to simultaneously measure the shifts in transcription induced by thousands of genetic variants. These counts present many statistical challenges, including overdispersion, depth dependence, and uncertain DNA concentrations. So far, the statistical methods used have been rudimentary, employing transformations on count level data and disregarding experimental and technical structure while failing to quantify uncertainty in the statistical model. We have developed an extensive framework for the analysis of NGS functionalization screens available as an R package called malacoda (available from github.com/andrewGhazi/malacoda). Our software implements a probabilistic, fully Bayesian model of screen data. The model uses the negative binomial distribution with gamma priors to model sequencing counts while accounting for effects from input library preparation and sequencing depth. The method leverages the high-throughput nature of the assay to estimate the priors empirically. External annotations such as ENCODE data or DeepSea predictions can also be incorporated to obtain more informative priors–a transformative capability for data integration. The package also includes quality control and utility functions, including automated barcode counting and visualization methods. To validate our method, we analyzed several datasets using malacoda and alternative MPRA analysis methods. These data include experiments from the literature, simulated assays, and primary MPRA data. We also used luciferase assays to experimentally validate several hits from our primary data, as well as variants for which the various methods disagree and variants detectable only with the aid of external annotations.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/g1qfmg-6GBM" width="1" />

<p>by Yiling Zhang, Zhankun Li, Naizhi Chen, Yao Huang, Shanjin Huang</p>

Tight regulation of gene transcription and mRNA splicing is essential for plant growth and development. Here we demonstrate that a plant-specific protein, EMBRYO DEFECTIVE 1579 (EMB1579), controls multiple growth and developmental processes in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. We demonstrate that EMB1579 forms liquid-like condensates both in vitro and in vivo, and the formation of normal-sized EMB1579 condensates is crucial for its cellular functions. We found that some chromosomal and RNA-related proteins interact with EMB1579 compartments, and loss of function of <i>EMB1579</i> affects global gene transcription and mRNA splicing. Using floral transition as a physiological process, we demonstrate that EMB1579 is involved in <i>FLOWERING LOCUS C</i> (<i>FLC</i>)-mediated repression of flowering. Interestingly, we found that EMB1579 physically interacts with a homologue of <i>Drosophila</i> nucleosome remodeling factor 55-kDa (p55) called MULTIPLE SUPPRESSOR OF IRA 4 (MSI4), which has been implicated in repressing the expression of <i>FLC</i> by forming a complex with DNA Damage Binding Protein 1 (DDB1) and Cullin 4 (CUL4). This complex, named CUL4-DDB1<sup>MSI4</sup>, physically associates with a CURLY LEAF (CLF)-containing Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (CLF-PRC2). We further demonstrate that EMB1579 interacts with CUL4 and DDB1, and EMB1579 condensates can recruit and condense MSI4 and DDB1. Furthermore, <i>emb1579</i> phenocopies <i>msi4</i> in terms of the level of H3K27 trimethylation on <i>FLC</i>. This allows us to propose that EMB1579 condensates recruit and condense CUL4-DDB1<sup>MSI4</sup> complex, which facilitates the interaction of CUL4-DDB1<sup>MSI4</sup> with CLF-PRC2 and promotes the role of CLF-PRC2 in establishing and/or maintaining the level of H3K27 trimethylation on <i>FLC</i>. Thus, we report a new mechanism for regulating plant gene transcription, mRNA splicing, and growth and development.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/kco-nDo3w0E" width="1" />

Introduction<p>Deep brain stimulation is an established method for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders. To elicit the underlying mechanisms and explore new stimulation targets, rodent models are necessary. Cable bound external stimulation or portable devices limit movement of the animals and influence behavioral experiments. Therefore, implantable, individually programmed devices are required.</p>Experimental procedure<p>The stimulator consists of an 8bit-microcontroller mounted on a square electrical board (10 × 10 mm). External control is enabled by a magnetic reed contact, as running control serves a white LED, running modes are displayed by flash codes. Stimulation parameters could be programmed in the range of pulse width: 60–500 μs, amplitude: up to 300 μA and frequency: 10–500 Hz. Power is supplied by two standard batteries. The device was implanted in 8–10 weeks old BALBc-mice. Functionality was examined by electrical stimulation of nucleus accumbens area with standard parameters for mice and determination of c-fos levels in vitro in brain slices.</p>Results<p>The implanted microstimulators were well-tolerated by the mice, without impairment of free movement. Coating, external control, and monitoring of function with LED flash code proved to be fully adequate. Stimulation with standard stimulating parameters of nucleus accumbens elicited strong c-fos elevation on simulation site.</p>Conclusion<p>We present a fully implantable stimulator for freely moving mice that meets the urgent need for further research on the effects of deep brain stimulation in rodent models. It offers the possibility to conduct behavioral experiments for up to 30 days of stimulation.</p>

<p>A novel analytical framework combined fuzzy learning and complex network approaches is proposed for the identification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with multichannel scalp-recorded electroencephalograph (EEG) signals. Weighted visibility graph (WVG) algorithm is first applied to transform each channel EEG into network and its topological parameters were further extracted. Statistical analysis indicates that AD and normal subjects show significant difference in the structure of WVG network and thus can be used to identify Alzheimer's disease. Taking network parameters as input features, a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy model is established to identify AD's EEG signal. Three feature sets—single parameter from multi-networks, multi-parameters from single network, and multi-parameters from multi-networks—are considered as input vectors. The number and order of input features in each set is optimized with various feature selection methods. Classification results demonstrate the ability of network-based TSK fuzzy classifiers and the feasibility of three input feature sets. The highest accuracy that can be achieved is 95.28% for single parameter from four networks, 93.41% for three parameters from single network. In particular, multi-parameters from the multi-networks set obtained the best result. The highest accuracy, 97.12%, is achieved with five features selected from four networks. The combination of network and fuzzy learning can highly improve the efficiency of AD's EEG identification.</p>

<p>Together, mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) occupy more than 20% of a cell's volume, and morphological abnormality may lead to cellular function disorders. With the rapid development of large-scale electron microscopy (EM), manual contouring and three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of these organelles has previously been accomplished in biological studies. However, manual segmentation of mitochondria and ER from EM images is time consuming and thus unable to meet the demands of large data analysis. Here, we propose an automated pipeline for mitochondrial and ER reconstruction, including the mitochondrial and ER contact sites (MAMs). We propose a novel recurrent neural network to detect and segment mitochondria and a fully residual convolutional network to reconstruct the ER. Based on the sparse distribution of synapses, we use mitochondrial context information to rectify the local misleading results and obtain 3D mitochondrial reconstructions. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00594">The Potential of Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy-Based Neurofeedback—A Systematic Review and Recommendations for Best Practice</a></h4>

<p>Background: The effects of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-neurofeedback on brain activation and behaviors have been studied extensively in the past. More recently, researchers have begun to investigate the effects of functional near-infrared spectroscopy-based neurofeedback (fNIRS-neurofeedback). FNIRS is a functional neuroimaging technique based on brain hemodynamics, which is easy to use, portable, inexpensive, and has reduced sensitivity to movement artifacts.</p><p>Method: We provide the first systematic review and database of fNIRS-neurofeedback studies, synthesizing findings from 22 peer-reviewed studies (including a total of N = 441 participants; 337 healthy, 104 patients). We (1) give a comprehensive overview of how fNIRS-neurofeedback training protocols were implemented, (2) review the online signal-processing methods used, (3) evaluate the quality of studies using pre-set methodological and reporting quality criteria and also present statistical sensitivity/power analyses, (4) investigate the effectiveness of fNIRS-neurofeedback in modulating brain activation, and (5) review its effectiveness in changing behavior in healthy and pathological populations.</p><p>Results and discussion: (1–2) Published studies are heterogeneous (e.g., neurofeedback targets, investigated populations, applied training protocols, and methods). (3) Large randomized controlled trials are still lacking. In view of the novelty of the field, the quality of the published studies is moderate. We identified room for improvement in reporting important information and statistical power to detect realistic effects. (4) Several studies show that people can regulate hemodynamic signals from cortical brain regions with fNIRS-neurofeedback and (5) these studies indicate the feasibility of modulating motor control and prefrontal brain functioning in healthy participants and ameliorating symptoms in clinical populations (stroke, ADHD, autism, and social anxiety). However, valid conclusions about specificity or potential clinical utility are premature.</p><p>Conclusion: Due to the advantages of practicability and relatively low cost, fNIRS-neurofeedback might provide a suitable and powerful alternative to EEG and fMRI neurofeedback and has great potential for clinical translation of neurofeedback. Together with more rigorous research and reporting practices, further methodological improvements may lead to a more solid understanding of fNIRS-neurofeedback. Future research will benefit from exploiting the advantages of fNIRS, which offers unique opportunities for neurofeedback research.</p>

<p>Despite widely reported gender differences in both brain structure and brain function, very few studies have examined the relationship between the structural differences and the functional differences between genders. Here, different imaging measures including both structural [i.e., gray matter volume (GMV)] and functional [i.e., regional homogeneity (ReHo) and functional connectivity (FC)] measures were employed to detect the gender differences in the human brain based on univariate and multivariate approaches with a sample of 290 healthy adults (155 females). The univariate analyses revealed that gender differences were detected in both structural (i.e., GMV) and functional (ReHo or FC) imaging measures, mainly manifested as greater values in females than in males in regions of the frontal, parietal, occipital lobes and cerebellum. Importantly, there was little overlap between the differences detected in GMV and those detected in ReHo and FC, and their differences between genders were not correlated with each other. The multivariate pattern analyses revealed that each of these measures had discriminative power to successfully distinguish between genders (classification accuracy: 94.3%, 90.73%, and 83.89% for GMV, ReHo, and FC, respectively) and their combination further improved the classification performance (96.6%). Our results suggest that gender differences are encoded in both brain structure and brain function, but in different manners. The finding of different and complementary information contained in structural and functional differences between genders highlights the complex relationship between brain structure and function, which may underlie the complex nature of gender differences in behavior.</p>

<p>Typical anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) in forward gait or step initiation tasks to prepare for possible disturbances caused by prime voluntary movements and to accelerate the body forward have been previously reported. However, it is not clear how wide the variations in step directions are differentiated and controlled in non-forward step initiation tasks during the APA phase. The main goal of this study is to explain the directional control mechanisms by investigating the APA of step initiation tasks in forward, diagonal, lateral, and posterior directions. The center of pressure (COP) trajectories and related muscle (soleus, tibialis anterior, and gluteus medius of both lower limbs) activities during the APA of step initiation tasks in nine different directions were analyzed in six healthy young males. Posterior shifts of COP during APA decreased as the direction became more lateral (0° to 90°). For posterior step initiations, COP moved anteriorly from the initial position to accelerate the center of mass of the whole body (COM) backward. Lateral shifts of COP toward the stepping foot during APA decreased as the stepping direction became more lateral (from 0° to 45° and from 180° to 113°) while it plateaued to about zero in the direction from 45° to 113°. Both anteroposterior and lateral displacements of COP in APA were nonlinearly modulated to each direction, but they were linearly related to the anteroposterior and mediolateral component of the velocities of COM at the take-off of the stance foot. Thus, the scaling of APA, reflected in the anteroposterior and lateral displacements of COP and the temporal sequence of selected muscle activities, was based on the anteroposterior and mediolateral components of the take-off velocity of COM that ultimately controls the direction of steps.</p>

<p>The problem of cancer risk analysis is of great importance to health-service providers and medical researchers. In this study, we propose a novel Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm based on the probabilistic framework, which aims to investigate patient patterns associated with their disease development. Compared to the traditional ANN where input features are directly extracted from raw data, the proposed probabilistic ANN manipulates original inputs according to their probability distribution. More precisely, the Naïve Bayes and Markov chain models are used to approximate the posterior distribution of the raw inputs, which provides a useful estimation of subsequent disease development. Later, this distribution information is further leveraged as additional input to train ANN. Additionally, to reduce the training cost and to boost the generalization capability, a sparse training strategy is also introduced. Experimentally, one of the largest cancer-related datasets is employed in this study. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, the proposed algorithm achieves a much better outcome, in terms of the prediction accuracy of subsequent disease development. The result also reveals the potential impact of patients' disease sequence on their future risk management.</p>

<p>Background: Evidences indicate that exosomes-mediated delivery of microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) is involved in the neurogenesis of stroke. This study was to investigate the role of exosomal miRNAs in non-drug therapy of electro-acupuncture (EA) regulating endogenous neural stem cells for stroke recovery.</p><p>Methods: The model of focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion in rats were established by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and treated by EA. The exosomes were extracted from peri-ischemic striatum and identified by exosomal biomarkers, and detected differentially expressed miRNAs with microarray chip. Primary stem cells were cultured, and oxygen–glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R) was used to mimic vitro ischemic injury.</p><p>Results: The levels of exosomal biomarkers TSG101 and CD81 were increased in peri-ischemic striatum after EA treatment, and we revealed 25 differentially expressed miRNAs in isolated exosomes, of which miR-146b was selected for further analysis, and demonstrated that EA increased miR-146b expression and its inhibitors could block the effects. Subsequently, we confirmed that EA upregulated miR-146b expression to promote neural stem cells differentiation into neurons in peri-ischemic striatum. In vitro, it was verified that OGD/R hindered neural stem cells differentiation, and miR-146b inhibitors furtherly suppressed its differentiation, simultaneously NeuroD1 was involved in neural stem cells differentiation into neurons. Moreover, in vivo we found EA promoted NeuroD1-mediated neural stem cells differentiation via miR-146b. In addition, EA also could improve neurological deficits through miR-146b after ischemic stroke.</p><p>Conclusion: EA promotes the differentiation of endogenous neural stem cells via exosomal miR-146b to improve neurological injury after ischemic stroke.</p>

<p>The central medial nucleus (CM), a prominent cell group of the intralaminar nuclei (ILN) of the thalamus, and the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray matter (vlPAG) are two major components of the medial pain system. Whether vlPAG and CM are input sources of nociceptive information to the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and whether they are involved in neuropathic pain regulation remain unclear. Clarifying the hierarchical organization of these subcortical nuclei (vlPAG, CM, and BLA) can enhance our understanding on the neural circuits for pain regulation. Behavioral test results showed that a CM lesion made by kainic acid (KA) injection could effectively alleviate mechanical hyperalgesia 4, 6, and 8 days after spared nerve injury (SNI) surgery, with the symptoms returning after 10 days. Morphological studies revealed that: (1) the CM received afferents from vlPAG and sent efferents to BLA, indicating that an indirect vlPAG–CM–BLA pathway exists; (2) such CM–BLA projections were primarily excitatory glutamatergic neurons as revealed by fluorescence in situ hybridization; (3) the fibers originated from the CM-formed close contacts with both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the BLA; and (4) BLA-projecting CM neurons expressed Fos induced by SNI and formed close contacts with fibers from vlPAG, suggesting that the vlPAG–CM–BLA indirect pathway was activated in neuropathic pain conditions. Finally, the vlPAG–CM–BLA indirect pathway was further confirmed using anterograde and monosynaptic virus tracing investigation. In summary, our present results provide behavioral and morphological evidence that the indirect vlPAG–CM–BLA pathway might be a novel pain pathway involved in neuropathic pain regulation.</p>

<p>Alzheimer disease (AD) has an insidious onset and heterogeneous clinical symptoms. The well-accepted biomarkers for clinical diagnosis of AD include β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition and pathologic tau level within cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and imaging AD pathology such as positive emission tomography (PET) imaging of the amyloid-binding agent Pittsburgh compound B (PET-PiB). However, the high expense and invasive nature of these methods highly limit their wide usage in clinic practice. Therefore, it is imperious to develop less expensive and invasive methods, and plasma biomarkers are the premium targets. In the current study, we utilized a single-blind comparison method; all the probable AD cases met the core clinical National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer’s Association (NIA-AA) criteria and validated by PET-PiB. We used ultrasensitive immunomagnetic reduction (IMR) assays to measure plasma Aβ<sub>42</sub> and total-tau (t-tau) levels, in combination with different variables including Aβ42 × t-tau value, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). We used logistic regression to analyze the effect of all these variables in the algorism. Our results showed that (1) plasma Aβ42 and t-tau are efficient biomarkers for AD diagnosis using IMR platform, whereas Aβ42 × t-tau value is more efficient for discriminating control and AD; (2) in the control group, Aβ42 level and age demonstrated strong negative correlation; Aβ42 × t-tau value and age demonstrated significant negative correlation; (3) in the AD group, t-tau level and MMSE score demonstrated strong negative correlation; (4) using the model that Aβ42, Aβ42 × t-tau, and MoCA as the variable to generate receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, cutoff value = 0.48, sensitivity = 0.973, specificity = 0.982, area under the curve (AUC) = 0.986, offered better categorical efficacy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC. The multifactor model of plasma Aβ42 and t-tau in combination with MoCA can be a viable model separate health and AD subjects in clinical practice.</p>

<p>Motor neuron diseases (MNDs) are fatal diseases characterized by loss of motor neurons in the brain cortex, in the bulbar region, and/or in the anterior horns of the spinal cord. While generally sporadic, inherited forms linked to mutant genes encoding altered RNA/protein products have also been described. Several different mechanisms have been found altered or dysfunctional in MNDs, like the protein quality control (PQC) system. In this review, we will discuss how the PQC system is affected in two MNDs—spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)—and how this affects the clearance of aberrantly folded proteins, which accumulate in motor neurons, inducing dysfunctions and their death. In addition, we will discuss how the PQC system can be targeted to restore proper cell function, enhancing the survival of affected cells in MNDs.</p>

Place cells in the hippocampus exhibit distinct spike patterns in different environments, a circuit function called remapping. Jun et al. show that remapping is disrupted in the APP knockin mouse model, suggesting that remapping impairment is a circuit mechanism underlying spatial memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease.

<p>by Jennifer N. Wells, Robert Buschauer, Timur Mackens-Kiani, Katharina Best, Hanna Kratzat, Otto Berninghausen, Thomas Becker, Wendy Gilbert, Jingdong Cheng, Roland Beckmann</p>

Cells adjust to nutrient deprivation by reversible translational shutdown. This is accompanied by maintaining inactive ribosomes in a hibernation state, in which they are bound by proteins with inhibitory and protective functions. In eukaryotes, such a function was attributed to suppressor of target of Myb protein 1 (Stm1; SERPINE1 mRNA-binding protein 1 [SERBP1] in mammals), and recently, late-annotated short open reading frame 2 (Lso2; coiled-coil domain containing short open reading frame 124 [CCDC124] in mammals) was found to be involved in translational recovery after starvation from stationary phase. Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of translationally inactive yeast and human ribosomes. We found Lso2/CCDC124 accumulating on idle ribosomes in the nonrotated state, in contrast to Stm1/SERBP1-bound ribosomes, which display a rotated state. Lso2/CCDC124 bridges the decoding sites of the small with the GTPase activating center (GAC) of the large subunit. This position allows accommodation of the duplication of multilocus region 34 protein (Dom34)-dependent ribosome recycling system, which splits Lso2-containing, but not Stm1-containing, ribosomes. We propose a model in which Lso2 facilitates rapid translation reactivation by stabilizing the recycling-competent state of inactive ribosomes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/7HDgOnINe_s" width="1" />

The 70 kDa heat shock protein (HSP70) family of chaperones are the front line of protection from stress-induced misfolding and aggregation of polypeptides in most organisms and are responsible for promoting the stability, folding, and degradation of clients to maintain cellular protein homeostasis. Here, we demonstrate quantitative identification of HSP70 and 71 kDa heat shock cognate (HSC70) clients using a ubiquitin-mediated proximity tagging strategy and show that, despite their high degree of similarity, these enzymes have largely nonoverlapping specificities. Both proteins show a preference for association with newly synthesized polypeptides, but each responds differently to changes in the stoichiometry of proteins in obligate multi-subunit complexes. In addition, expression of an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-associated superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) mutant protein induces changes in HSP70 and HSC70 client association and aggregation toward polypeptides with predicted disorder, indicating that there are global effects from a single misfolded protein that extend to many clients within chaperone networks. Together these findings show that the ubiquitin-activated interaction trap (UBAIT) fusion system can efficiently isolate the complex interactome of HSP chaperone family proteins under normal and stress conditions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ADIksXEycdo" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate the differences in actigraphy‐measured rest‐activity patterns (e.g., sleep‐wake cycle, circadian rest‐activity rhythm, and physical activity) across different stages of α‐synucleinopathy.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We compared alterations in 7‐day actigraphy‐measured rest‐activity patterns among patients with clinically diagnosed α‐synucleinopathies (n = 44), and their age‐, sex‐, and BMI‐matched patients with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD, n = 88), and non‐RBD controls (n = 44) in a case‐control study (<i>Study 1 </i>) and between convertors (n = 22) and their age‐, sex‐, BMI‐, iRBD‐duration and follow‐up‐duration‐matched non‐convertors (n = 66) in a prospective nested case‐control study (<i>Study 2 </i>).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In <i>Study 1 </i>, there were significantly increases (<i>P </i> values were adjusted by false discovery rate &lt; 0.01) in probable napping behaviors (percentage, duration, and episodes), activity fragmentation (estimated by k<sub>AR</sub>), and physical inactivity during active period across controls, iRBD, to clinically diagnosed α‐synucleinopathies. In <i>Study 2 </i>, higher levels (all <i>P </i> values were adjusted by false discovery rate &lt; 0.05) of baseline objective probable napping, activity fragmentation, and physical inactivity during active period were associated with the conversion of iRBD patients into clinically diagnosed α‐synucleinopathies at two years of follow‐up with medium to large effect sizes (Cohen's d: 0.56 to 0.80). These findings were further supported by functional linear modeling analyses.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Rest‐activity pattern alterations, mainly objective probable napping behaviors, activity fragmentation, and physical inactivity during active period, emerge as early as at the stage of iRBD, which serve as early and robust prodromal markers of the conversion of iRBD into clinically diagnosed α‐synucleinopathies.</p>

<p>Comparative studies on canid cognition have revealed tantalizing evidence for some restructuring in the canine brain. Using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging, we compared the degree of cortical folding in wild and domestic canids. We demonstrate that this parameter is largely consistent across canid species although regional differences in gyrification exist.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Over the last 15 years, research on canid cognition has revealed that domestic dogs possess a surprising array of complex sociocognitive skills pointing to the possibility that the domestication process might have uniquely altered their brains; however, we know very little about how evolutionary processes (natural or artificial) might have modified underlying neural structure to support species‐specific behaviors. Evaluating the degree of cortical folding (i.e., gyrification) within canids may prove useful, as this parameter is linked to functional variation of the cerebral cortex. Using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the impact of domestication on the canine cortical surface, we compared the gyrification index (GI) in 19 carnivore species, including six wild canid and 13 domestic dog individuals. We also explored correlations between global and local GI with brain mass, cortical thickness, white and gray matter volume and surface area. Our results indicated that GI values for domestic dogs are largely consistent with what would be expected for a canid of their given brain mass, although more variable than that observed in wild canids. We also found that GI in canids is positively correlated with cortical surface area, cortical thickness and total cortical gray matter volumes. While we found no evidence of global differences in GI between domestic and wild canids, certain regional differences in gyrification were observed.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The rs12608932 single nucleotide polymorphism in <i>UNC13A </i> is associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) susceptibility, and may underlie differences in treatment response. We aimed to characterize the clinical, cognitive, behavioral, and neuroimaging phenotype of <i>UNC13A </i> in patients with ALS.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 2,216 patients with ALS without a <i>C9orf72 </i> mutation to identify clinical characteristics associated with the <i>UNC13A </i> polymorphism. A subcohort of 428 patients with ALS was used to study cognitive and behavioral profiles, and 375 patients to study neuroimaging characteristics. Associations were analyzed under an additive genetic model.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Genotyping rs12608932 resulted in 854 A/A, 988 A/C, and 374 C/C genotypes. The C allele was associated with a higher age at symptom onset (median years A/A 63.5, A/C 65.6, and C/C 65.5; <i>p </i> &lt; 0.001), more frequent bulbar onset (A/A 29.6%, A/C 31.8%, and C/C 43.1%; <i>p </i> &lt; 0.001), higher incidences of ALS‐FTD (A/A 4.3%, A/C 5.2%, and C/C 9.5%; <i>p </i> = 0.003), lower forced vital capacity at diagnosis (median percentage A/A 92.0, A/C 90.0, and C/C 86.5; <i>p </i> &lt; 0.001), and a shorter survival (median in months A/A 33.3, A.C 30.7, and C/C 26.6; <i>p </i> &lt; 0.001). <i>UNC13A </i> was associated with lower scores on ALS‐specific cognition tests (means A/A 79.5, A/C 78.1, and C/C 76.6; <i>p </i> = 0.037), and more frequent behavioral disturbances (A/A 16.7%, A/C 24.4%, and C/C 27.7%; <i>p </i> = 0.045). Thinner left inferior temporal and right fusiform cortex were associated with the <i>UNC13A </i> single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; <i>p </i> = 0.045 and <i>p </i> = 0.036).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Phenotypical distinctions associated with <i>UNC13A </i> make it an important factor to take into account in clinical trial design, studies on cognition and behavior, and prognostic counseling. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>
