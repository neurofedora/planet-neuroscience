                Background Gastric cancer is associated with a high mortality and morbidity rate. Patients often experience anxiety and depression, which are associated with a poor health-related quality of life. Furthermore, anxiety and depression have been associated with worse survival in patients with cancer. Therefore, this systematic review aims to identify the risk factors and prognostic impacts of anxiety and depression in gastric cancer. Methods We searched for relevant literature published up to April 7, 2025 from the MEDLINE, EBSCOhost, and ProQuest databases. We included studies that evaluated the risk factors and prognostic impact of anxiety and depression in gastric cancer. Studies that also included other types of cancers or only analyzed risk factors of psychological distress were excluded. Quality of studies was analyzed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Meta-analysis was performed if the adjusted odds ratio for a specific risk factor was evaluated in ≥ 3 studies. Otherwise, only qualitative analysis was performed. Results Fourteen studies were included in the review with a total number of 31,660 patients. From the included studies, we identified various risk factors that were significantly associated with anxiety or depression. We classified those risk factors based on Engel’s biopsychosocial model. Meta-analysis for eligible risk factors showed that female sex (adjusted OR = 3.04; 95% CI 2.04–4.54) and diabetes mellitus (adjusted OR = 4.78; 95% CI 2.46–9.28) were independently associated with higher odds of depression in gastric cancer. Furthermore, most studies showed that anxiety or depression was associated with worse survival in patients with gastric cancer. Conclusions We identified various risk factors for anxiety and depression in gastric cancer based on the available literature. It is important to screen for anxiety and depression in gastric cancer because of their negative prognostic impact on the patients.

                Over the past decade, the statistical and reliability literature has seen an enormous rise in the number of various probability distributions. Many of them are designed to integrate, enhance, or add to traditional models. This rise shows that people are becoming more aware of empirical integrity, flexibility, and adaptability, especially when it comes to modeling income distributions, dependability difficulties, and longevity statistics. In this paper, more general and flexible distributions are provided by employing a technique that generates the T−R {Y} family distributions as well as a brief overview for this kind of family. This technique may be applied to agree with certain data distribution types, including very left, right, thin or heavy tailed distribution, or to develop new distributions that are very applicable and flexible. In this context, produces a distinct member of a new sub-family called the IDNAI distribution, which is referred to the Lomax–Rayleigh {Exponential} distribution. The most important statistical and mathematical characteristics of the new family distribution are discussed. In order to estimate the parameters of the new class distribution, two estimation techniques will be additionally presented: the maximum likelihood method (MLE) and the least square method (LS). In order to analyze the effectiveness of suggested estimation techniques, simulation tools have been constructed. The results of the comparison indicated that the maximum likelihood method performed better than the least squares approach in terms of bias and mean squared error criteria. However, the application of a real dataset showed that, depending on several kinds of information criteria, the new class distribution fit the data more effectively than the specific classical and moderate distributions.

                Objective To evaluate the association between Fusobacterium nucleatum and c-Myc expression in Oral Potentially Malignant Disorders (OPMDs) and Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) and to explore its potential role in oral carcinogenesis. Materials and Methods A total of 32 histopathologically confirmed cases (18 OPMDs and 14 OSCC) were analyzed. Anaerobic cultures and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to detect F. nucleatum. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to assess c-Myc expression. Statistical analysis was conducted using Mann-Whitney and Chi-square tests, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Results F. nucleatum was detected in eight OSCC and two OPMD cases, with higher colony counts in OSCC. All samples were positive for c-Myc, but their expression levels varied. In OPMDs, positivity was mainly observed in the basal and suprabasal epithelial layers, whereas OSCC showed both peripheral and central tumor cell localization. F. nucleatum–positive OSCC cases demonstrated strong nuclear c-Myc staining (50–75% positive cells). Tobacco habits, particularly combined smoking and smokeless use, were more common in F. nucleatum–positive OSCC cases. Conclusion F. nucleatum colonization correlates with increased c-Myc expression in OPMDs and OSCC, supporting its possible role in microbially driven oral carcinogenesis. These findings suggest its potential as a prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target.

                Background Environmental Awareness (EA) research is part of character education that is still ignored by most students in the era of globalization. The purpose of this research is to analyze the effectiveness and contribution of the Javanese Culture Ethno-Socioscientific Issues (Ethno-SSI) Learning Model in strengthening the EA of high school students. Methods The Design-based Research (DBR) with quantitaive and qualitative approaches. The research subjects were high school students in Wonosobo (Area 1), Boyolali (Area 2), and Temanggung Regency (Area 3) Central Java Province, Indonesia with a purposive sampling technique based on the distance of the district area to the city center (City, Middle, and Village Categories) (N = 9 high schools = 241 students). The data collection methods were standardized Fischer EA tests and questionnaires. The analysis techniques using Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) 25.0 Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test. Results The results of the study show that differences in school background are not the main factor in strengthening environmental awareness, but rather based on character and science learning habits. Based on the highest average EA, the Senior high schools (SMA) Village 2 Group (SMA-V2) of 85.0068, and the lowest group is SMA village 3 (SMA-V3) of 75.5648. Based on the ANOVA test, there are significant differences and influences between each SMA category. R Squared The multiple determination value of all high school groups with EA shows an R Squared value of 0.60, meaning that the size of the independent variable can influence EA by 60%. Conclusions The Javanese Ethno-SSI Cultural Model contributes to EA through learning designs that emphasize concern for respecting, being responsive, and preserving traditions and culture. The Ethno-SSI model is able to contribute to preserving traditions and culture by providing students with the opportunity to respond and find solutions to environmental problems.

                Background Data on Canalis Sinuosus (CS) morphology in South Asian populations remain limited, despite frequent anterior maxillary implant placements. This study aimed to evaluate the occurrence, positional characteristics, and morphometric features of the CS in Indian adults using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and to assess sex-related differences. Methods A cross-sectional analysis was conducted on 245 CBCT scans with intact maxillary incisors and canines. Multiplanar reconstructions were used to identify the CS and document its laterality, tooth relationship, and orientation. Measurements included canal diameter at the alveolar crest and distances to the alveolar crest, buccal cortical plate, and nasal floor. Inter-observer agreement was assessed using Cohen’s κ. Sex differences were analyzed using χ2 and independent-samples t-tests (α = 0.05). Results CS was detected in 67.3% of individuals, with bilateral presentation in 55.9% and unilateral in 11.4%. Detection rates were similar between sides (left: 62.4%, right: 60.8%). The canal was most frequently adjacent to the lateral incisor (44.7% left, 50.3% right), and approximately half of the canals showed palatal orientation. The mean canal diameter was 0.8 mm. Mean distances to the alveolar crest, buccal cortical plate, and nasal floor were 9.2 mm, 7.0 mm, and 11.5 mm, respectively. Males showed significantly larger canal diameters on the left side (p = 0.008), greater buccal cortical distances bilaterally (p < 0.001), and larger right nasal floor distances (p = 0.011). Conclusions The CS is a frequently observed, typically bilateral anatomical structure in the anterior maxilla of Indian adults, mostly located palatal adjacent the lateral incisor. The morphometric and sex-specific data obtained provide valuable reference parameters for implant planning and minimizing surgical complications.

                Objective Physiologic gingival pigmentation may negatively impact smile esthetics, particularly in individuals with high smile lines. This randomized clinical trial aimed to compare the clinical effectiveness of three minimally invasive depigmentation techniques: microneedling with Triphala Curna, microneedling with vitamin C, and 445-nm diode laser ablation. Materials and Methods Eighteen systemically healthy patients with physiologic gingival pigmentation were enrolled and allocated into three groups (n = 6 each) via block randomization. Group 1 received microneedling followed by topical Triphala Curna application; Group 2 received microneedling with vitamin C; and Group 3 underwent diode laser depigmentation at a wavelength of 445 nm. In Groups 1 and 2, the procedure was repeated after two weeks. Clinical assessments were performed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months for gingival pigmentation (Peeran Index), gingival thickness, and patient satisfaction (VAS scores). Statistical analysis included paired and independent t tests, chi-square tests, and descriptive statistics, with significance set at p < 0.05. Results All the groups showed progressive clinical improvement. Complete depigmentation (grade 0) at 6 months was observed in 66.7% of patients in the Triphala group, 50.0% in the vitamin C group, and 33.3% in the laser group. Gingival thickness increased significantly in all groups, with the greatest increase observed in the Triphala group (from 1.10 ± 0.36 mm to 1.95 ± 0.41 mm, p < 0.001). Patient satisfaction also improved across all groups, with Triphala receiving the highest mean VAS score. No adverse events or pigmentation relapses were reported during study period. Conclusion Microneedling-assisted gingival depigmentation using Triphala Curna demonstrated the most favourable clinical and esthetic outcomes among the tested modalities. Results of vitamin C treatment were comparable to those of diode laser therapy, suggesting that herbal therapies combined with microneedling can serve as viable, biologically compatible alternatives to conventional laser techniques.

                This article analyzes the determinants of consumers’ purchase and consumption of geographical indication (GI) agricultural products through a ten-year systematic review. There exist growing concerns about food safety, quality, and health, increasing consumer attention to origin labelled foods. GI agricultural products have gained a stable position in global food markets. This study pursues two objectives. First, it identifies and classifies the key determinants of GI agricultural product consumption reported in the literature. Second, it compares insights from five existing review studies on closely related themes to clarify what is already established and what remains contested. Following the PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a transparent and reproducible systematic literature review, including structured searching, screening, and data extraction procedures. The results summarize how consumers respond to GI cues and identify factors associated with heterogeneous responses across contexts. By integrating fragmented evidence, this review clarifies consumption relevant mechanisms and offers implications for GI governance and marketing, helping firms better understand consumer decision making and supporting value capture for farmers, producers, and regional stakeholders.

                Background Recent advances in computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) have ushered in a new era of restorative dentistry, facilitating the utilization of innovative materials such as polyether ether ketone (PEEK) in lieu of conventional metal alloys for removable partial dentures (RPDs). Methods This study aimed to scrutinize the retentive efficacy of RPD clasps fabricated from PEEK and cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) alloy through Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Employing in vitro experimentation on Maxillary Kennedy Class I cases, two distinct experimental models were devised, each representing varying degrees of retentive undercuts to simulate diverse clinical scenarios. Employing the Rest Proximal Aker (RPA) clasp design for both materials, this investigation integrates a comprehensive consideration of material properties, FEA modelling, and meticulous data analysis to evaluate the mechanical performance of PEEK clasps within a simulated oral environment. These models were systematically refined using optimization algorithms to enhance the design of PEEK clasps. Results Extensive stress analysis, strain distribution mapping, and deformation profiling were performed under diverse loading conditions. The FEA outcomes reveal that both PEEK and Co-Cr alloys are suitable as materials for RPD clasps, each presenting distinct advantages; however, PEEK demonstrates a more promising prospect as a superior alternative to the Co-Cr alloy. Conclusions Material selection should be tailored to individual patient-specific considerations and clinician expertise. The analysis of the stress distribution, strain patterns, and deformation tendencies aids in pinpointing potential weak areas or failure zones, thereby guiding future design enhancements and clinical applications.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1324/v2?src=rss">Integrating Palliative Care into the Indonesia Health System: A Policy Brief to Enhance Accessibility, Quality, and Sustainability [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract* Background Indonesia faces a growing double burden of non-communicable diseases, particularly cancer. The latest data from the Global Cancer Observatory (Globocan) indicates over 408,661 new cases and 242,099 cancer-related deaths in 2022, with a projected 63% increase in the case burden between 2025 and 2040 without strategic intervention. Although a new legal framework through Health Law No. 17 of 2023 and the Minister of Health Decree (KMK) No. HK.01.07/MENKES/2180/2023 has mandated palliative care as an integral component of health services, its implementation still faces significant systemic barriers. Policy and Implications This policy brief analyzes the disconnection between the policy mandate and on-the-ground reality, identifying critical gaps in accessibility, healthcare workforce capacity particularly among nursesand financing mechanisms through the National Health Insurance (JKN) program. The failure to effectively integrate palliative care not only causes unnecessary suffering for millions of patients but also burdens the health system with inefficient costs and suboptimal end-of-life care, reflected in the high “financial toxicity” experienced by patients. Recommendations We recommend a four-pillar strategy: (1) Formalize and standardize palliative services within the JKN benefits package with a clear financing model to address regulatory ambiguity; (2) Develop a national competency-based palliative education and training strategy for all health workers, with a focus on empowering nurses in primary care; (3) Implement a decentralized and tiered palliative care delivery model centered on Community Health Centers (Puskesmas) to ensure equitable access; and (4) Launch a national public education campaign to destigmatize palliative care and increase awareness. Conclusion The integration of palliative care is not merely an option but a strategic and ethical imperative for achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in Indonesia. It is a cost-effective investment to improve patients’ quality of life, support families, and ensure the sustainability of the national health system in facing future non-communicable disease challenges.

Abstract: Neural coupling in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence emerges as dynamic oscillatory patterns that encode abstract concepts. To this end, we hypothesize that a deeper understanding of the neural mechanisms governing brain rhythms can inspire next-generation design principles for machine learning algorithms, leading to improved efficiency and robustness. Building on this idea, we first model evolving brain rhythms through the interference of spontaneously synchronized neural oscillations, termed HoloBrain. The success of modeling brain rhythms using an artificial dynamical system of coupled oscillations motivates a "first principle" for brain-inspired machine intelligence based on a shared synchronization mechanism, termed HoloGraph. This principle enables graph neural networks to move beyond conventional heat diffusion paradigms toward modeling oscillatory synchronization. Our HoloGraph framework not only effectively mitigates the over-smoothing problem in graph neural networks but also demonstrates strong potential for reasoning and solving challenging problems on graphs.

                arXiv:2602.01019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) underpins neuroscience, clinical neurophysiology, and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), yet pronounced inter- and intra-subject variability limits reliability, reproducibility, and translation. This systematic review studies that quantified or modeled EEG variability across resting-state, event-related potentials (ERPs), and task-related/BCI paradigms (including motor imagery and SSVEP) in healthy and clinical cohorts. Across paradigms, inter-subject differences are typically larger than within-subject fluctuations, but both affect inference and model generalization. Stability is feature-dependent: alpha-band measures and individual alpha peak frequency are often relatively reliable, whereas higher-frequency and many connectivity-derived metrics show more heterogeneous reliability; ERP reliability varies by component, with P300 measures frequently showing moderate-to-good stability. We summarize major sources of variability (biological, state-related, technical, and analytical), review common quantification and modeling approaches (e.g., ICC, CV, SNR, generalizability theory, and multivariate/learning-based methods), and provide recommendations for study design, reporting, and harmonization. Overall, EEG variability should be treated as both a practical constraint to manage and a meaningful signal to leverage for precision neuroscience and robust neurotechnology.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01347">Vulnerability-Amplifying Interaction Loops: a systematic failure mode in AI chatbot mental-health interactions</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.01347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millions of users turn to consumer AI chatbots to discuss behavioral and mental health concerns. While this presents unprecedented opportunities to deliver population-level support, it also highlights an urgent need to develop rigorous and scalable safety evaluations. Here we introduce SIM-VAIL, an AI chatbot auditing framework that captures how harmful AI chatbot responses manifest across a range of mental-health contexts. SIM-VAIL pairs a simulated human user, harboring a distinct psychiatric vulnerability and conversational intent, with an audited frontier AI chatbot. It scores conversation turns on 13 clinically relevant risk dimensions, enabling context-dependent, temporally resolved assessment of mental-health risk. Across 810 conversations, encompassing over 90,000 turn-level ratings and 30 psychiatric user profiles, we find that significant risk occurs across virtually all user phenotypes. Risk manifested across most of the 9 consumer AI chatbot models audited, albeit mitigated in more modern variants. Rather than arising abruptly, risk accumulated over multiple turns. Risk profiles were phenotype-dependent, indicating that behaviors that appear supportive in general settings are liable to be maladaptive when they align with mechanisms that sustain a user's vulnerability. Multivariate risk patterns revealed trade-offs across dimensions, suggesting that mitigation targeting one harm domain can exacerbate others. These findings identify a novel failure mode in human-AI interactions, which we term Vulnerability-Amplifying Interaction Loops (VAILs), and underscore the need for multi-dimensional approaches to risk quantification. SIM-VAIL provides a scalable evaluation framework for quantifying how mental-health risk is distributed across user phenotypes, conversational trajectories, and clinically grounded behavioral dimensions, offering a foundation for targeted safety improvements.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01482">Community-Level Modeling of Gyral Folding Patterns for Robust and Anatomically Informed Individualized Brain Mapping</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.01482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cortical folding exhibits substantial inter-individual variability while preserving stable anatomical landmarks that enable fine-scale characterization of cortical organization. Among these, the three-hinge gyrus (3HG) serves as a key folding primitive, showing consistent topology yet meaningful variations in morphology, connectivity, and function. Existing landmark-based methods typically model each 3HG independently, ignoring that 3HGs form higher-order folding communities that capture mesoscale structure. This simplification weakens anatomical representation and makes one-to-one matching sensitive to positional variability and noise. We propose a spectral graph representation learning framework that models community-level folding units rather than isolated landmarks. Each 3HG is encoded using a dual-profile representation combining surface topology and structural connectivity. Subject-specific spectral clustering identifies coherent folding communities, followed by topological refinement to preserve anatomical continuity. For cross-subject correspondence, we introduce Joint Morphological-Geometric Matching, jointly optimizing geometric and morphometric similarity. Across over 1000 Human Connectome Project subjects, the resulting communities show reduced morphometric variance, stronger modular organization, improved hemispheric consistency, and superior alignment compared with atlas-based and landmark-based or embedding-based baselines. These findings demonstrate that community-level modeling provides a robust and anatomically grounded framework for individualized cortical characterization and reliable cross-subject correspondence.

Abstract: Hyperkinetic movement disorders (HMDs) such as dystonia, tremor, chorea, myoclonus, and tics are disabling motor manifestations across childhood and adulthood. Their fluctuating, intermittent, and frequently co-occurring expressions hinder clinical recognition and longitudinal monitoring, which remain largely subjective and vulnerable to inter-rater variability. Objective and scalable methods to distinguish overlapping HMD phenotypes from routine clinical videos are still lacking. Here, we developed a pose-based machine-learning framework that converts standard outpatient videos into anatomically meaningful keypoint time series and computes kinematic descriptors spanning statistical, temporal, spectral, and higher-order irregularity-complexity features.

                arXiv:2602.02494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clinical brain-to-text interfaces are designed for paralysed patients who cannot provide extensive training recordings. Pre-training improves data-efficient generalisation by learning statistical priors across subjects, but these priors critically depend on context. While natural speech might unfold gradually over minutes, most methods pre-train with only a few seconds of context. Thus, we propose MEG-XL, a model pre-trained with 2.5 minutes of MEG context per sample, 5-300x longer than prior work, and equivalent to 191k tokens, capturing extended neural context. Fine-tuning on the task of word decoding from brain data, MEG-XL matches supervised performance with a fraction of the data (e.g. 1hr vs 50hrs) and outperforms brain foundation models. We find that models pre-trained with longer contexts learn representations that transfer better to word decoding. Our results indicate that long-context pre-training helps exploit extended neural context that other methods unnecessarily discard. Code, model weights, and instructions are available at https://github.com/neural-processing-lab/MEG-XL .

                arXiv:2509.14053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Music is a structured and perceptually rich sequence of sounds in time with well-defined symbolic features, whose perception is shaped by the interplay of expectation and uncertainty. Network science offers a powerful framework for studying its structural organization and communication efficiency. However, it remains unclear how feature selection affects the properties of reconstructed networks and perceptual alignment. Here, we systematically compare eight encodings of musical sequences, ranging from single-feature descriptions to richer multi-feature combinations. We show that representational choices fundamentally shape network topology, the distribution of uncertainty, and the estimated communication efficiency under perceptual constraints. Single-feature representations compress sequences into dense transition structures that support efficient communication, yielding high entropy rates with low modeled perceptual error, but they discard structural richness. By contrast, multi-feature representations preserve descriptive detail and structural specificity, expanding the state space and producing sharper transition profiles and lower entropy rates, which leads to higher modeled perceptual error. Across representations, we found that uncertainty increasingly concentrates in nodes with higher diffusion-based centrality while their perceptual error remains low, unveiling an interplay between predictable structure and localized surprise. Together, these results show that feature choice directly shapes music network representation, describing trade-offs between descriptive richness and communication efficiency and suggesting structural conditions that may support efficient learning and prediction.

                arXiv:2509.15748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Because of the variabilities of real-world image structures under the natural image transformations that arise when observing similar objects or spatio-temporal events under different viewing conditions, the receptive field responses computed in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy may be strongly influenced by such geometric image transformations. One way of handling this variability is by basing the vision system on covariant receptive field families, which expand the receptive field shapes over the degrees of freedom in the image transformations.
  This paper addresses the problem of deriving relationships between spatial and spatio-temporal receptive field responses obtained for different values of the shape parameters in the resulting multi-parameter families of receptive fields. For this purpose, we derive both (i) infinitesimal relationships, roughly corresponding to a combination of notions from semi-groups and Lie groups, as well as (ii) macroscopic cascade smoothing properties, which describe how receptive field responses at coarser spatial and temporal scales can be computed by applying smaller support incremental filters to the output from corresponding receptive fields at finer spatial and temporal scales, structurally related to the notion of Lie algebras, although with directional preferences.
  The presented results provide (i) a deeper understanding of the relationships between spatial and spatio-temporal receptive field responses for different values of the filter parameters, which can be used for both (ii) designing more efficient schemes for computing receptive field responses over populations of multi-parameter families of receptive fields, as well as (iii)~formulating idealized theoretical models of the computations of simple cells in biological vision.

                arXiv:2409.13669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal flows of neural activity, such as traveling waves, have been observed throughout the brain since the earliest recordings; yet there is still little consensus on their functional role. Recent experiments and models have linked traveling waves to visual and physical motion, but these observations have been difficult to reconcile with standard accounts of topographically organized selectivity and feedforward receptive fields. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework that formalizes and generalizes the connection between 'motion' and flowing neural dynamics in the language of equivariant neural network theory. We consider 'motion' not only in physical or visual spaces, but also in more abstract representational spaces, and we argue that recurrent traveling-wave-like dynamics are not just useful but necessary for accurate and stable processing of any signal undergoing such motion. Formally, we show that for any non-trivial recurrent neural network to process a sequence undergoing a flow transformation (such as visual motion) in a structured equivariant manner, its hidden state dynamics must actively realize a homomorphic representation of the same flow through recurrent connectivity. In this ''spatiotemporal perspective on dynamical computation'', traveling waves and related flows are best understood as faithful dynamic representations of stimulus flows; and consequently the natural inclination of biological systems towards such dynamics may be viewed as an innate inductive bias towards efficiency and generalization in the spatiotemporally-structured dynamical world they inhabit.

                arXiv:2506.17310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance across domains, their long-context capabilities are limited by transient neural activations causing information decay and unstructured feed-forward network (FFN) weights leading to semantic fragmentation. Inspired by the brain's working memory and cortical modularity, we propose PaceLLM, featuring two innovations: (1) a Persistent Activity (PA) Mechanism that mimics prefrontal cortex (PFC) neurons' persistent firing by introducing an activation-level memory bank to dynamically retrieve, reuse, and update critical FFN states, addressing contextual decay; and (2) Cortical Expert (CE) Clustering that emulates task-adaptive neural specialization to reorganize FFN weights into semantic modules, establishing cross-token dependencies and mitigating fragmentation. Extensive evaluations show that PaceLLM achieves 6% improvement on LongBench's Multi-document QA and 12.5-17.5% performance gains on Infinite-Bench tasks, while extending measurable context length to 200K tokens in Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH) tests.

Abstract: We consider a neural network (NN) that may experience memory faults and computational errors. In this paper, we propose a novel real-number-based error correction code (ECC) capable of detecting and correcting both memory errors and computational errors. The proposed approach introduces structures in the form of real-number-based linear constraints on the NN weights to enable error detection and correction, without sacrificing classification performance or increasing the number of real-valued NN parameters.

                arXiv:2602.00098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated Algorithm Selection (AAS) is a popular meta-algorithmic approach and has demonstrated to work well for single-objective optimisation in combination with exploratory landscape features (ELA), i.e., (numerical) descriptive features derived from sampling the black-box (continuous) optimisation problem. In contrast to the abundance of features that describe single-objective optimisation problems, only a few features have been proposed for multi-objective optimisation so far. Building upon recent work on exploratory landscape features for box-constrained continuous multi-objective optimization problems, we propose a novel and complementary set of additional features (MO-ELA). These features are based on a random sample of points considering both the decision and objective space. The features are divided into 5 feature groups depending on how they are being calculated: non-dominated-sorting, descriptive statistics, principal component analysis, graph structures and gradient information. An AAS study conducted on well-established multi-objective benchmarks demonstrates that the proposed features contribute to successfully distinguishing between algorithm performance and thus adequately capture problem hardness resulting in models that come very close to the virtual best solver. After feature selection, the newly proposed features are frequently among the top contributors, underscoring their value in algorithm selection and problem characterisation.

                arXiv:2602.00532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraint handling plays a key role in solving realistic complex optimization problems. Though intensively discussed in the last few decades, existing constraint handling techniques predominantly rely on human experts' designs, which more or less fall short in utility towards general cases. Motivated by recent progress in Meta-Black-Box Optimization where automated algorithm design can be learned to boost optimization performance, in this paper, we propose learning effective, adaptive and generalizable constraint handling policy through reinforcement learning. Specifically, a tailored Markov Decision Process is first formulated, where given optimization dynamics features, a deep Q-network-based policy controls the constraint relaxation level along the underlying optimization process. Such adaptive constraint handling provides flexible tradeoff between objective-oriented exploitation and feasible-region-oriented exploration, and hence leads to promising optimization performance. We train our approach on CEC 2017 Constrained Optimization benchmark with limited evaluation budget condition (expensive cases) and compare the trained constraint handling policy to strong baselines such as recent winners in CEC/GECCO competitions. Extensive experimental results show that our approach performs competitively or even surpasses the compared baselines under either Leave-one-out cross-validation or ordinary train-test split validation. Further analysis and ablation studies reveal key insights in our designs.

                arXiv:2602.00540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surrogate-assisted Evolutionary Algorithms~(SAEAs) have shown promising robustness in solving expensive optimization problems. A key aspect that impacts SAEAs' effectiveness is surrogate model selection, which in existing works is predominantly decided by human developer. Such human-made design choice introduces strong bias into SAEAs and may hurt their expected performance on out-of-scope tasks. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-assisted ensemble framework, termed as SEEMOO, which is capable of scheduling different surrogate models within a single optimization process, hence boosting the overall optimization performance in a cooperative paradigm. Specifically, we focus on expensive multi-objective optimization problems, where multiple objective functions shape a compositional landscape and hence challenge surrogate selection. SEEMOO comprises following core designs: 1) A pre-collected model pool that maintains different surrogate models; 2) An attention-based state-extractor supports universal optimization state representation of problems with varied objective numbers; 3) a deep Q-network serves as dynamic surrogate selector: Given the optimization state, it selects desired surrogate model for current-step evaluation. SEEMOO is trained to maximize the overall optimization performance under a training problem distribution. Extensive benchmark results demonstrate SEEMOO's surrogate ensemble paradigm boosts the optimization performance of single-surrogate baselines. Further ablation studies underscore the importance of SEEMOO's design components.

Abstract: Negabent Boolean functions are defined by having a flat magnitude spectrum under the nega-Hadamard transform. They exist in both even and odd dimensions, and the subclass of functions that are simultaneously bent and negabent (bent-negabent) has attracted interest due to the combined optimal periodic and negaperiodic spectral properties. In this work, we investigate how evolutionary algorithms can be used to evolve (bent-)negabent Boolean functions. Our experimental results indicate that evolutionary algorithms, especially genetic programming, are a suitable approach for evolving negabent Boolean functions, and we successfully evolve such functions in all dimensions we consider.

                arXiv:2602.00978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary success depends on the capacity to adapt: organisms must respond to environmental challenges through both genetic innovation and lifetime learning. The gene-centric paradigm attributes evolutionary causality exclusively to genes, while Denis Noble's phenotype-first framework argues that organisms are active agents capable of interpreting genetic resources, learning from experience, and shaping their own development. However, this framework has remained philosophically intuitive but algorithmically opaque.
  We show for the first time that organismal agency can be implemented as a concrete computational process through heritable phenotypic patterns. We introduce the Phenopoiesis Algorithm, where organisms inherit not just genes but also successful phenotypic patterns discovered during lifetime learning. Through experiments in changing environments, these pattern-inheriting organisms achieve 3.4 times faster adaptation compared to gene-centric models. Critically, these gains require cross-generational inheritance of learned patterns rather than within-lifetime learning alone.
  We conclude that organismal agency is not a philosophical abstraction but an algorithmic mechanism with measurable adaptive value. The mechanism works through compositional reuse: organisms discover how to compose primitive elements into solutions, encode those compositional recipes, and transmit them to offspring. Evolution operates across multiple timescales -- fast, reversible phenotypic inheritance and slow, permanent genetic inheritance -- providing adaptive flexibility that single-channel mechanisms cannot achieve.

                arXiv:2602.01026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel theoretical framework, the Stacked Autoencoder Evolution Hypothesis, which proposes that biological evolutionary systems operate through multi-layered self-encoding and decoding processes, analogous to stacked autoencoders in deep learning. Rather than viewing evolution solely as gradual changes driven by mutation and selection, this hypothesis suggests that self-replication inherently compresses and reconstructs genetic information across hierarchical layers of abstraction. This layered structure enables evolutionary systems to explore diverse possibilities not only at the sequence level but also across progressively more abstract layers of representation, making it possible for even simple mutations to navigate these higher-order spaces.Such a mechanism may explain punctuated evolutionary patterns and changes that can appear as if they are goal-directed in natural evolution, by allowing mutations at deeper latent layers to trigger sudden, large-scale phenotypic shifts. To illustrate the plausibility of this mechanism, artificial chemistry simulations were conducted, demonstrating the spontaneous emergence of hierarchical autoencoder structures. This framework offers a new perspective on the informational dynamics underlying both continuous and discontinuous evolutionary change.

                arXiv:2602.01133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bio-inspired integrate-fire-reset mechanism of spiking neurons constitutes the foundation for efficient processing in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Recent progress in large models demands that spiking neurons support highly parallel computation to scale efficiently on modern GPUs. This work proposes a novel functional perspective that provides general guidance for designing parallel spiking neurons. We argue that the reset mechanism, which induces complex temporal dependencies and hinders parallel training, should be removed. However, any such modification should satisfy two principles: 1) preserving the functions of reset as a core biological mechanism; and 2) enabling parallel training without sacrificing the serial inference ability of spiking neurons, which underpins their efficiency at test time. To this end, we identify the functions of the reset and analyze how to reconcile parallel training with serial inference, upon which we propose a dynamic decay spiking neuron. We conduct comprehensive testing of our method in terms of: 1) Training efficiency and extrapolation capability. On 16k-length sequences, we achieve a 25.6x training speedup over the pioneering parallel spiking neuron, and our models trained on 2k-length can stably perform inference on sequences as long as 30k. 2) Generality. We demonstrate the consistent effectiveness of the proposed method across five task categories (image classification, neuromorphic event processing, time-series forecasting, language modeling, and reinforcement learning), three network architectures (spiking CNN/Transformer/SSMs), and two spike activation modes (spike/integer activation). 3) Energy consumption. The spiking firing of our neuron is lower than that of vanilla and existing parallel spiking neurons.

                arXiv:2602.01147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since Differential Evolution (DE) is sensitive to strategy choice, most existing variants pursue performance through adaptive mechanisms or intricate designs. While these approaches focus on adjusting strategies over time, the structural benefits that static strategy diversity may bring remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we study the impact of individual-level strategy diversity on DE's search dynamics and performance, and introduce iStratDE (DE with individual-level strategies), a minimalist variant that assigns mutation and crossover strategies independently to each individual at initialization and keeps them fixed throughout the evolutionary process. By injecting diversity at the individual level without adaptation or feedback, iStratDE cultivates persistent behavioral heterogeneity that is especially effective with large populations. Moreover, its communication-free construction possesses intrinsic concurrency, thereby enabling efficient parallel execution and straightforward scaling for GPU computing. We further provide a convergence analysis of iStratDE under standard reachability assumptions, which establishes the almost-sure convergence of the best-so-far fitness. Extensive experiments on the CEC2022 benchmark suite and robotic control tasks demonstrate that iStratDE matches or surpasses established adaptive DE variants. These results highlight individual-level strategy assignment as a straightforward yet effective mechanism for enhancing DE's performance. The source code of iStratDE is publicly accessible at: https://github.com/EMI-Group/istratde.

Abstract: We propose a neuromorphic solver for the NP-hard Edge User Allocation problem using an attractor network with Winner-Takes-All (WTA) mechanism implemented with the Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) framework. Unlike previous energy-based attractor networks, our solver uses dynamic heuristic biasing to guide allocations in real time and introduces a "no allocation" state to each WTA motif, achieving near-optimal performance with an empirically upper-bounded number of time steps. The approach is compatible with neuromorphic architectures and may offer improvements in energy efficiency.

                arXiv:2602.01978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic hardware implementations of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient, low-latency AI through sparse, event-driven computation. Yet, training SNNs under fine temporal discretization remains a major challenge, hindering both low-latency responsiveness and the mapping of software-trained SNNs to efficient hardware. In current approaches, spiking neurons are modeled as self-recurrent units, embedded into recurrent networks to maintain state over time, and trained with BPTT or RTRL variants based on surrogate gradients. These methods scale poorly with temporal resolution, while online approximations often exhibit instability for long sequences and tend to fail at capturing temporal patterns precisely. To address these limitations, we develop spiking neurons with internal recursive memory structures that we combine with sigma-delta spike-coding. We show that this SpikingGamma model supports direct error backpropagation without surrogate gradients, can learn fine temporal patterns with minimal spiking in an online manner, and scale feedforward SNNs to complex tasks and benchmarks with competitive accuracy, all while being insensitive to the temporal resolution of the model. Our approach offers both an alternative to current recurrent SNNs trained with surrogate gradients, and a direct route for mapping SNNs to neuromorphic hardware.

A reconstruction experiment demonstrates the feasibility of the approach and warrants further analysis to mitigate current approximation errors. Our work suggests a novel spiking signal representation that could enable more energy-efficient signal processing algorithms.

                arXiv:2602.02306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, neural networks act as a synonym for artificial intelligence. Present neural network models, although remarkably powerful, are inefficient both in terms of data and energy. Several alternative forms of neural networks have been proposed to address some of these problems. Specifically, spiking neural networks are suitable for efficient hardware implementations. However, effective learning algorithms for spiking networks remain elusive, although it is suspected that effective plasticity mechanisms could alleviate the problem of data efficiency. Here, we present a new framework for spiking neural networks - Spark - built upon the idea of modular design, from simple components to entire models. The aim of this framework is to provide an efficient and streamlined pipeline for spiking neural networks. We showcase this framework by solving the sparse-reward cartpole problem with simple plasticity mechanisms. We hope that a framework compatible with traditional ML pipelines may accelerate research in the area, specifically for continuous and unbatched learning, akin to the one animals exhibit.

                arXiv:2602.02311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GP-GOMEA is among the state-of-the-art for symbolic regression, especially when it comes to finding small and potentially interpretable solutions. A key mechanism employed in any GOMEA variant is the exploitation of linkage, the dependencies between variables, to ensure efficient evolution. In GP-GOMEA, mutual information between node positions in GP trees has so far been used to learn linkage. For this, a fixed expression template is used. This however leads to introns for expressions smaller than the full template. As introns have no impact on fitness, their occurrences are not directly linked to selection. Consequently, introns can adversely affect the extent to which mutual information captures dependencies between tree nodes. To overcome this, we propose two new measures for linkage learning, one that explicitly considers introns in mutual information estimates, and one that revisits linkage learning in GP-GOMEA from a grey-box perspective, yielding a measure that needs not to be learned from the population but is derived directly from the template. Across five standard symbolic regression problems, GP-GOMEA achieves substantial improvements using both measures. We also find that the newly learned linkage structure closely reflects the template linkage structure, and that explicitly using the template structure yields the best performance overall.

                arXiv:2602.02439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge AI applications increasingly require ultra-low-power, low-latency inference. Neuromorphic computing based on event-driven spiking neural networks (SNNs) offers an attractive path, but practical deployment on resource-constrained devices is limited by training difficulty, hardware-mapping overheads, and sensitivity to temporal dynamics. We present NeuEdge, a framework that combines adaptive SNN models with hardware-aware optimization for edge deployment. NeuEdge uses a temporal coding scheme that blends rate and spike-timing patterns to reduce spike activity while preserving accuracy, and a hardware-aware training procedure that co-optimizes network structure and on-chip placement to improve utilization on neuromorphic processors. An adaptive threshold mechanism adjusts neuron excitability from input statistics, reducing energy consumption without degrading performance. Across standard vision and audio benchmarks, NeuEdge achieves 91-96% accuracy with up to 2.3 ms inference latency on edge hardware and an estimated 847 GOp/s/W energy efficiency. A case study on an autonomous-drone workload shows up to 312x energy savings relative to conventional deep neural networks while maintaining real-time operation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), trained solely on massive text data, have achieved high performance on the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC), a benchmark proposed to measure commonsense knowledge and reasoning abilities about the real world. This suggests that the language produced by humanity describes a significant portion of the world with considerable nuance. In this study, we attempt to harness the high expressive power of language within cellular automata. Specifically, we express cell states and rules in natural language and delegate their updates to an LLM. Through this approach, cellular automata can transcend the constraints of merely numerical states and fixed rules, providing us with a richer platform for simulation. Here, we propose LOGOS-CA (Language Oriented Grid Of Statements - Cellular Automaton) as a natural framework to achieve this and examine its capabilities. We confirmed that LOGOS-CA successfully performs simple forest fire simulations and also serves as an intriguing subject for investigation from an Artificial Life (ALife) perspective. In this paper, we report the results of these experiments and discuss directions for future research using LOGOS-CA.

                arXiv:2602.00478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Quality-Diversity (QD) optimization aims to discover a collection of high-performing solutions that simultaneously exhibit diverse behaviors within a user-defined behavior space. This paradigm has stimulated significant research interest and demonstrated practical utility in domains including robot control, creative design, and adversarial sample generation. A variety of QD algorithms with distinct design principles have been proposed in recent years. Instead of proposing a new QD algorithm, this work introduces a novel reformulation by casting the QD optimization as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem with a huge number of optimization objectives. By establishing this connection, we enable the direct adoption of well-established MOO methods, particularly set-based scalarization techniques, to solve QD problems through a collaborative search process. We further provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that our approach inherits theoretical guarantees from MOO while providing desirable properties for the QD optimization. Experimental studies across several QD applications confirm that our method achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art QD algorithms.

Abstract: Constitutional AI has focused on single-model alignment using fixed principles. However, multi-agent systems create novel alignment challenges through emergent social dynamics. We present Constitutional Evolution, a framework for automatically discovering behavioral norms in multi-agent LLM systems. Using a grid-world simulation with survival pressure, we study the tension between individual and collective welfare, quantified via a Societal Stability Score S in [0,1] that combines productivity, survival, and conflict metrics. Adversarial constitutions lead to societal collapse (S= 0), while vague prosocial principles ("be helpful, harmless, honest") produce inconsistent coordination (S = 0.249). Even constitutions designed by Claude 4.5 Opus with explicit knowledge of the objective achieve only moderate performance (S= 0.332). Using LLM-driven genetic programming with multi-island evolution, we evolve constitutions maximizing social welfare without explicit guidance toward cooperation. The evolved constitution C* achieves S = 0.556 +/- 0.008 (123% higher than human-designed baselines, N = 10), eliminates conflict, and discovers that minimizing communication (0.9% vs 62.2% social actions) outperforms verbose coordination. Our interpretable rules demonstrate that cooperative norms can be discovered rather than prescribed.

                arXiv:2602.00837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Idempotent Boolean functions form a highly structured subclass of Boolean functions that is closely related to rotation symmetry under a normal-basis representation and to invariance under a fixed linear map in a polynomial basis. These functions are attractive as candidates for cryptographic design, yet their additional algebraic constraints make the search for high nonlinearity substantially more difficult than in the unconstrained case. In this work, we investigate evolutionary methods for constructing highly nonlinear idempotent Boolean functions for dimensions $n=5$ up to $n=12$ using a polynomial basis representation with canonical primitive polynomials. Our results show that the problem of evolving idempotent functions is difficult due to the disruptive nature of crossover and mutation operators. Next, we show that idempotence can be enforced by encoding the truth table on orbits, yielding a compact genome of size equal to the number of distinct squaring orbits.

Abstract: Visual robustness and neural alignment remain critical challenges in developing artificial agents that can match biological vision systems. We present the winning approaches from Team HCMUS_TheFangs for both tracks of the NeurIPS 2025 Mouse vs. AI: Robust Visual Foraging Competition. For Track 1 (Visual Robustness), we demonstrate that architectural simplicity combined with targeted components yields superior generalization, achieving 95.4% final score with a lightweight two-layer CNN enhanced by Gated Linear Units and observation normalization. For Track 2 (Neural Alignment), we develop a deep ResNet-like architecture with 16 convolutional layers and GLU-based gating that achieves top-1 neural prediction performance with 17.8 million parameters. Our systematic analysis of ten model checkpoints trained between 60K to 1.14M steps reveals that training duration exhibits a non-monotonic relationship with performance, with optimal results achieved around 200K steps. Through comprehensive ablation studies and failure case analysis, we provide insights into why simpler architectures excel at visual robustness while deeper models with increased capacity achieve better neural alignment. Our results challenge conventional assumptions about model complexity in visuomotor learning and offer practical guidance for developing robust, biologically-inspired visual agents.

                arXiv:2602.01510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Genetic programming-based feature construction has achieved significant success in recent years as an automated machine learning technique to enhance learning performance. However, overfitting remains a challenge that limits its broader applicability. To improve generalization, we prove that vicinal risk, estimated through noise perturbation or mixup-based data augmentation, is bounded by the sum of empirical risk and a regularization term-either finite difference or the vicinal Jensen gap. Leveraging this decomposition, we propose an evolutionary feature construction framework that jointly optimizes empirical risk and the vicinal Jensen gap to control overfitting. Since datasets may vary in noise levels, we develop a noise estimation strategy to dynamically adjust regularization strength. Furthermore, to mitigate manifold intrusion-where data augmentation may generate unrealistic samples that fall outside the data manifold-we propose a manifold intrusion detection mechanism. Experimental results on 58 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Jensen gap minimization compared to other complexity measures. Comparisons with 15 machine learning algorithms further indicate that genetic programming with the proposed overfitting control strategy achieves superior performance.

Abstract: Deploying pretrained policies in real-world applications presents substantial challenges that fundamentally limit the practical applicability of learning-based control systems. When autonomous systems encounter environmental changes in system dynamics, sensor drift, or task objectives, fixed policies rapidly degrade in performance. We show that employing Real-Time Recurrent Reinforcement Learning (RTRRL), a biologically plausible algorithm for online adaptation, can effectively fine-tune a pretrained policy to improve autonomous agents' performance on driving tasks. We further show that RTRRL synergizes with a recent biologically inspired recurrent network model, the Liquid-Resistance Liquid-Capacitance RNN. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this closed-loop approach in a simulated CarRacing environment and in a real-world line-following task with a RoboRacer car equipped with an event camera.

                arXiv:2602.02281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backpropagation, the foundational algorithm for training neural networks, is typically understood as a symbolic computation that recursively applies the chain rule. We show it emerges exactly as the finite-time relaxation of a physical dynamical system. By formulating feedforward inference as a continuous-time process and applying Lagrangian theory of non-conservative systems to handle asymmetric interactions, we derive a global energy functional on a doubled state space encoding both activations and sensitivities. The saddle-point dynamics of this energy perform inference and credit assignment simultaneously through local interactions. We term this framework ''Dyadic Backpropagation''. Crucially, we prove that unit-step Euler discretization, the natural timescale of layer transitions, recovers standard backpropagation exactly in precisely 2L steps for an L-layer network, with no approximations. Unlike prior energy-based methods requiring symmetric weights, asymptotic convergence, or vanishing perturbations, our framework guarantees exact gradients in finite time. This establishes backpropagation as the digitally optimized shadow of a continuous physical relaxation, providing a rigorous foundation for exact gradient computation in analog and neuromorphic substrates where continuous dynamics are native.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24161">Proxy Target: Bridging the Gap Between Discrete Spiking Neural Networks and Continuous Control</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.24161v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer low-latency and energy-efficient decision making on neuromorphic hardware, making them attractive for Reinforcement Learning (RL) in resource-constrained edge devices. However, most RL algorithms for continuous control are designed for Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), particularly the target network soft update mechanism, which conflicts with the discrete and non-differentiable dynamics of spiking neurons. We show that this mismatch destabilizes SNN training and degrades performance. To bridge the gap between discrete SNNs and continuous-control algorithms, we propose a novel proxy target framework. The proxy network introduces continuous and differentiable dynamics that enable smooth target updates, stabilizing the learning process. Since the proxy operates only during training, the deployed SNN remains fully energy-efficient with no additional inference overhead. Extensive experiments on continuous control benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently improves stability and achieves up to $32\%$ higher performance across various spiking neuron models. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that enables SNNs with simple Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) neurons to surpass their ANN counterparts in continuous control. This work highlights the importance of SNN-tailored RL algorithms and paves the way for neuromorphic agents that combine high performance with low power consumption.

                arXiv:2508.19548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Routing, switching, and the interconnect fabric are essential for large-scale neuromorphic computing. While this fabric only plays a supporting role in the process of computing, for large AI workloads it ultimately determines energy consumption and speed. In this paper, we address this bottleneck by asking: (a) What computing paradigms are inherent in existing routing, switching, and interconnect systems, and how can they be used to implement a processing-in-Interconnect (\pi^2) computing paradigm? and (b) leveraging current and future interconnect trends, how will a \pi^2 system's performance scale compared to other neuromorphic architectures? For (a), we show that operations required for typical AI workloads can be mapped onto delays, causality, time-outs, packet drop, and broadcast operations -- primitives already implemented in packet-switching and packet-routing hardware. We show that existing buffering and traffic-shaping embedded algorithms can be leveraged to implement neuron models and synaptic operations. Additionally, a knowledge-distillation framework can train and cross-map well-established neural network topologies onto $\pi^2$ without degrading generalization performance. For (b), analytical modeling shows that, unlike other neuromorphic platforms, the energy scaling of $\pi^2$ improves with interconnect bandwidth and energy efficiency. We predict that by leveraging trends in interconnect technology, a \pi^2 architecture can be more easily scaled to execute brain-scale AI inference workloads with power consumption levels in the range of hundreds of watts.

                arXiv:2510.08582v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a modular and scalable design optimization framework for the wing design process that enables faster early-phase design while ensuring aerodynamic stability. The pipeline starts with the generation of initial wing geometries and then proceeds to optimize the wing using several algorithms. Aerodynamic performance is assessed using a Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) applied to a carefully selected dataset of wing configurations. These results are employed to develop surrogate neural network models, which can predict lift and drag rapidly and accurately. The stability evaluation is implemented by setting the control surfaces and components to fixed positions in order to have realistic flight dynamics. The approach unifies and compares several optimization techniques, including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithms (GA), gradient-based MultiStart methods, Bayesian optimization, and Lipschitz optimization. Each method ensures constraint management via adaptive strategies and penalty functions, where the targets for lift and design feasibility are enforced. The progression of aerodynamic characteristics and geometries over the optimization iterations will be investigated in order to clarify each algorithm's convergence characteristics and performance efficiency. Our results show improvement in aerodynamic qualities and robust stability properties, offering a mechanism for wing design at speed and precision. In the interest of reproducibility and community development, the complete implementation is publicly available at Github.

Abstract: We present a novel predict-then-optimize framework for maritime search operations that integrates trajectory forecasting with UAV deployment optimization-an end-to-end approach not addressed in prior work. A large language model predicts the drifter's trajectory, and spatial uncertainty is modeled using Gaussian-based particle sampling. Unlike traditional static deployment methods, we dynamically adapt UAV detection radii based on distance and optimize their placement using meta-heuristic algorithms. Experiments on real-world data from the Korean coastline demonstrate that our method, particularly the repair mechanism designed for this problem, significantly outperforms the random search baselines. This work introduces a practical and robust integration of trajectory prediction and spatial optimization for intelligent maritime rescue.

                arXiv:2601.06758v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feedback-rich neural architectures can regenerate earlier representations and inject temporal context, making them a natural setting for strictly local synaptic plasticity. Existing literature raises doubt about whether a minimal, backpropagation-free feedback-Hebbian system can already express interpretable continual-learning-relevant behaviors under controlled training schedules. In this work, we introduce a compact prediction-reconstruction architecture with a dedicated feedback pathway providing lightweight, locally trainable temporal context for continual adaptation. All synapses are updated by a unified local rule combining centered Hebbian covariance, Oja-style stabilization, and a local supervised drive where targets are available. With a simple two-pair association task, learning is characterized through layer-wise activity snapshots, connectivity trajectories (row and column means of learned weights), and a normalized retention index across phases. Under sequential A to B training, forward output connectivity exhibits a long-term depression (LTD)-like suppression of the earlier association, while feedback connectivity preserves an A-related trace during acquisition of B. Under an alternating sequence, both associations are concurrently maintained rather than sequentially suppressed. Architectural controls and rule-term ablations isolate the role of dedicated feedback in regeneration and co-maintenance, alongside the role of the local supervised term in output selectivity and unlearning. Together, the results show that a compact feedback pathway trained with local plasticity can support regeneration and continual-learning-relevant dynamics in a minimal, mechanistically transparent setting.

                arXiv:2601.17899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neighborhood search operators are critical to the performance of Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) and rely heavily on expert design. Although recent LLM-based Automated Heuristic Design (AHD) methods have made notable progress, they primarily optimize individual heuristics or components independently, lacking explicit exploration and exploitation of dynamic coupling relationships between operators. In this paper, multi-operator optimization in MOEAs is formulated as a Markov decision process, enabling the improvement of interdependent operators through sequential decision-making. To address this, we propose the Evolution of Operator Combination (E2OC) framework for MOEAs, which achieves the co-evolution of design strategies and executable codes. E2OC employs Monte Carlo Tree Search to progressively search combinations of operator design strategies and adopts an operator rotation mechanism to identify effective operator configurations while supporting the integration of mainstream AHD methods as the underlying designer. Experimental results across AHD tasks with varying objectives and problem scales show that E2OC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AHD and other multi-heuristic co-design frameworks, demonstrating strong generalization and sustained optimization capability.

                arXiv:2601.21877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Benchmark Design in Black-Box Optimization (BBO) is a fundamental yet open-ended topic. Early BBO benchmarks are predominantly human-crafted, introducing expert bias and constraining diversity. Automating this design process can relieve the human-in-the-loop burden while enhancing diversity and objectivity. We propose Evolution of Benchmark (EoB), an automated BBO benchmark designer empowered by the large language model (LLM) and its program evolution capability. Specifically, we formulate benchmark design as a bi-objective optimization problem towards maximizing (i) landscape diversity and (ii) algorithm-differentiation ability across a portfolio of BBO solvers. Under this paradigm, EoB iteratively prompts LLM to evolve a population of benchmark programs and employs a reflection-based scheme to co-evolve the landscape and its corresponding program. Comprehensive experiments validate our EoB is a competitive candidate in multi-dimensional usages: 1) Benchmarking BBO algorithms; 2) Training and testing learning-assisted BBO algorithms; 3) Extending proxy for expensive real-world problems.

                arXiv:2601.22241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gradient-free black-box optimization (BBO) is widely used in engineering design and provides a flexible framework for topology optimization (TO), enabling the discovery of high-performing structural designs without requiring gradient information from simulations. Yet, its success depends on two key choices: the geometric parameterization defining the search space and the optimizer exploring it.
  This study investigates this interplay through a compliance minimization problem for a cantilever beam subject to a connectivity constraint. We benchmark three geometric parameterizations, each combined with three representative BBO algorithms: differential evolution, covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy, and heteroscedastic evolutionary Bayesian optimization, across 10D, 20D, and 50D design spaces.
  Results reveal that parameterization quality has a stronger influence on optimization performance than optimizer choice: a well-structured parameterization enables robust and competitive performance across algorithms, whereas weaker representations increase optimizer dependency. Overall, this study highlights the dominant role of geometric parameterization in practical BBO-based TO and shows that algorithm performance and selection cannot be fairly assessed without accounting for the induced design space.

Abstract: The optimization problems in realistic world present significant challenges onto optimization algorithms, such as the expensive evaluation issue and complex constraint conditions. COBRA optimizer (including its up-to-date variants) is a representative and effective tool for addressing such optimization problems, which introduces 1) RBF surrogate to reduce online evaluation and 2) bi-stage optimization process to alternate search for feasible solution and optimal solution. Though promising, its design space, i.e., surrogate model pool and selection standard, is still manually decided by human expert, resulting in labor-intensive fine-tuning for novel tasks. In this paper, we propose a learning-based adaptive strategy (COBRA++) that enhances COBRA in two aspects: 1) An augmented surrogate pool to break the tie with RBF-like surrogate and hence enhances model diversity and approximation capability; 2) A reinforcement learning-based online model selection policy that empowers efficient and accurate optimization process. The model selection policy is trained to maximize overall performance of COBRA++ across a distribution of constrained optimization problems with diverse properties. We have conducted multi-dimensional validation experiments and demonstrate that COBRA++ achieves substantial performance improvement against vanilla COBRA and its adaptive variant. Ablation studies are provided to support correctness of each design component in COBRA++.

                arXiv:2410.05882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Respiratory motion complicates accurate irradiation of thoraco-abdominal tumors in radiotherapy, as treatment-system latency entails target-location uncertainties. This work addresses frame forecasting in chest and liver cine MRI to compensate for such delays. We investigate RNNs trained with online learning algorithms, enabling adaptation to changing respiratory patterns via on-the-fly parameter updates, and transformers, increasingly common in time series forecasting for their ability to capture long-term dependencies. Experiments were conducted using 12 sagittal thoracic and upper-abdominal cine-MRI sequences from ETH Z\"urich and OvGU. PCA decomposes the Lucas-Kanade optical-flow field into static deformations and low-dimensional time-dependent weights. We compare various methods forecasting the latter: linear filters, population and sequence-specific encoder-only transformers, and RNNs trained with real-time recurrent learning (RTRL), unbiased online recurrent optimization, decoupled neural interfaces, and sparse one-step approximation (SnAp-1). Predicted displacements were used to warp the reference frame and generate future images. Prediction accuracy decreased with the horizon h. Linear regression performed best at short horizons (1.3mm geometrical error at h=0.32s, ETH Z\"urich data), while RTRL and SnAp-1 outperformed the other algorithms at medium-to-long horizons, with geometrical errors below 1.4mm and 2.8mm on the sequences from ETH Z\"urich and OvGU (the latter featuring higher motion variability, noise, and lower contrast), respectively. The sequence-specific transformer was competitive for low-to-medium horizons, but transformers remained overall limited by data scarcity and domain shift between datasets. Predicted frames visually resembled the ground truth, with notable errors occurring near the diaphragm at end-inspiration and regions affected by out-of-plane motion.

                arXiv:2507.22832v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Post-hoc explainability methods typically associate each output score of a deep neural network with an input-space direction, most commonly instantiated as the gradient and visualized as a saliency map. However, these approaches often yield explanations that are noisy, lack perceptual alignment and, thus, offer limited interpretability. While many explanation methods attempt to address this issue via modified backward rules or additional heuristics, such approaches are often difficult to justify theoretically and frequently fail basic sanity checks. We introduce Semantic Pullbacks (SP), a faithful and effective post-hoc explanation method for deep neural networks. Semantic Pullbacks address the limitations above by isolating the network's effective linear action via a principled pullback formulation and refining it to recover coherent local structures learned by the target neuron. As a result, SP produces perceptually aligned, class-conditional explanations that highlight meaningful features, support compelling counterfactual perturbations, and admit a clear theoretical motivation. Across standard faithfulness benchmarks, Semantic Pullbacks significantly outperform established attribution methods on both classical convolutional architectures (ResNet50, VGG) and transformer-based models (PVT), while remaining general and computationally efficient. Our method can be easily plugged into existing deep learning pipelines and extended to other modalities.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06243">SCAR: State-Space Compression for Scalable AI-Based Network Management of Vehicular Services</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.06243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand for connected vehicular services poses significant challenges for AI-based network and service management due to the high volume and rapid variability of network state information. Traditional management and control mechanisms struggle to scale when processing fine-grained metrics such as Channel Quality Indicators (CQIs) in dynamic vehicular environments. To address this challenge, we propose SCAR (State-Space Compression for AI-Based Network Management), an edge-assisted framework that improves scalability and fairness in vehicular services through network state abstraction. SCAR employs machine-learning (ML)-based compression techniques, including clustering and radial basis function (RBF) networks, to reduce the dimensionality of CQI-derived state information while preserving essential features relevant to management decisions. The resulting compressed states are used to train reinforcement learning (RL)-based management policies that aim to maximize network efficiency while satisfying service-level fairness objectives defined by the NGMN. Simulation results show that SCAR increases the time spent in feasible management regions by 14% and reduces unfair service allocation time by 15% compared to reinforcement learning baselines operating on uncompressed state information. Furthermore, simulated annealing with stochastic tunneling (SAST)-based clustering reduces state compression distortion by 10%, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed approach. These results demonstrate that SCAR enables scalable and fair AI-assisted network and service management in dynamic vehicular systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13843">QUASAR: An Evolutionary Algorithm to Accelerate High-Dimensional Numerical Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.13843v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional numerical optimization presents a persistent challenge in computational science. This paper introduces Quasi-Adaptive Search with Asymptotic Reinitialization (QUASAR), an evolutionary algorithm to accelerate convergence in complex, non-differentiable problems afflicted by the curse of dimensionality. QUASAR expands upon the core principles of Differential Evolution (DE), introducing quasi-adaptive mechanisms to dynamically balance exploration and exploitation in its search. Inspired by the behavior of quantum particles, the algorithm utilizes three highly stochastic mechanisms that augment standard DE: 1) probabilistic mutation strategies and scaling factors; 2) rank-based crossover rates; 3) asymptotically decaying covariance reinitializations.
  Evaluated on the notoriously difficult CEC2017 benchmark suite of 29 test functions, QUASAR achieved the lowest overall rank sum (367) using the Friedman test, outperforming DE (735) and L-SHADE (452). Geometric mean comparisons show average final solution quality improvements of $3.85 \times$ and $2.07 \times$ compared to DE and L-SHADE, respectively ($p \ll 0.001$), with average optimization speed averaging $1.40 \times$ and $5.16 \times$ faster. QUASAR's performance establishes it as an effective, efficient, and user-friendly evolutionary algorithm for complex high-dimensional problems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01082">Discount Model Search for Quality Diversity Optimization in High-Dimensional Measure Spaces</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.01082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quality diversity (QD) optimization searches for a collection of solutions that optimize an objective while attaining diverse outputs of a user-specified, vector-valued measure function. Contemporary QD algorithms are typically limited to low-dimensional measures because high-dimensional measures are prone to distortion, where many solutions found by the QD algorithm map to similar measures. For example, the state-of-the-art CMA-MAE algorithm guides measure space exploration with a histogram in measure space that records so-called discount values. However, CMA-MAE stagnates in domains with high-dimensional measure spaces because solutions with similar measures fall into the same histogram cell and hence receive the same discount value. To address these limitations, we propose Discount Model Search (DMS), which guides exploration with a model that provides a smooth, continuous representation of discount values. In high-dimensional measure spaces, this model enables DMS to distinguish between solutions with similar measures and thus continue exploration. We show that DMS facilitates new capabilities for QD algorithms by introducing two new domains where the measure space is the high-dimensional space of images, which enables users to specify their desired measures by providing a dataset of images rather than hand-designing the measure function. Results in these domains and on high-dimensional benchmarks show that DMS outperforms CMA-MAE and other existing black-box QD algorithms.

">Emergent blink rate in early childhood is associated with neural origins of executive function</a></h4>

              
                Executive function develops rapidly in early childhood and predicts later success in life, yet its neurobiological correlates during this period remain poorly understood. In adults, executive function is supported by prefrontal-striatal circuits under neuromodulatory control, including dopamine. Here, we show that spontaneous eye-blink rate (sEBR), a physiological output influenced by neuromodulatory systems, is associated with the developmental trajectory of executive function and prefrontal functional differentiation. We used fNIRS to monitor prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation in 113 children (35-80 months) during a cognitive flexibility task. With increasing age, the children's task performance improved, and their PFC activation showed greater right-hemisphere and dorsal bias, reflecting functional differentiation. Importantly, higher sEBR was also associated with this right-dorsal PFC activation and with better task performance. The current findings demonstrate that emergent sEBR is associated with the neural origins of executive function development in young children. This highlights the potential of sEBR to serve as a unique and previously unrecognised indicator of this critical developmental neural mechanism.

">Cerebellar circuits anticipate dopamine rewards</a></h4>

              
                Predicting rewards is critical for learning. Although the cerebellum predicts rewards like water and food, it also famously coordinates physical actions like drinking and eating. To disentangle reward prediction from the movements to consume reward, we trained mice to push for delayed dopamine rewards delivered directly into the brain. Via two-photon imaging, we found that many cerebellar granule cells (GrCs) anticipated dopamine with sustained activity that terminated at reward delivery. GrC activity also "stretched" to match 1- or 2-s intervals before dopamine, thereby linking the action to the expected reward time. By contrast, most cerebellar climbing fibers (CFs) spiked just after dopamine delivery. GrC-CF activity also generalized between dopamine versus water rewards, both in individual mice and many individual neurons. Finally, naive mice 'rewarded' only with CF stimulation also learned to execute a modest number of pushing movements, with similar predictive GrC activity. Thus, cerebellar circuits help animals learn to anticipate rewards even when no consummatory action is needed, suggesting deeper cerebellar integration in brain reward prediction networks.

                Throughout this paper our study focuses on transformation semigroups. These kinds of semigroups are the corner stone of semigroup theory. This is because every semigroup is isomorphic to transformation semigroup. The (total) transformation monoid T X n on a finite set X n = { 1 , 2 , … , n } where n ≥ 0 , n ∈ Z , is a semigroup of mapping that takes a set X n into itself, under the operation of composition of mapping with identity I X n . In this paper, we use an algebraic method for considering the monoid T ( Fl ) n ( G ) , where an independence algebra ( Fl ) n ( G ) is a disjointed union of sets of the form G x i for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n . Firstly, particular attention is paid to find the isomorphism between T ( Fl ) n ( G ) and the endomorphism monoid End ( F ℓ ) n ( G ) . Secondly, the embeddedness of T ( Fl ) n ( G ) in (full) wreath product of T n by G n has been found. Finally, the description of Green’s relation of T ( Fl ) n ( G ) has been provided.

                <p>There is a critical need for robust and reliable preclinical models for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to better understand pathophysiological mechanisms and support the development of novel treatments. The single prolonged stress (SPS) model has been previously utilized to investigate various acute behavioral effects and stress hormone changes in rodents. This study paired anxiety-like and social behavioral evaluations with corticosterone assessment as a complementary physiological biomarker to determine the presence of robust and intervenable phenotypes following SPS. Sprague Dawley rats (<I>N</I> = 36, 30 male and 6 female) received SPS model induction (e.g., restraint with odorant, forced-swim, diethyl ether exposure, and isolation) or control handling. Serum corticosterone and behavioral assessments, including the open field test (OFT) and a social motivation test (SMT), were investigated at 1 and 2 weeks following SPS induction. This SPS model did not induce anxiety-like or locomotive differences assessed in the OFT (<I>p</I>'s &gt; 0.05). Similarly, SPS did not appear to alter social preference or avoidance in the SMT (<I>p</I>'s &gt; 0.05), as groups had similar novel social and novel object interaction levels. SPS-paired cue re-exposure did not unmask group differences in these behaviors. Corticosterone levels were also unaltered between groups in the weeks following SPS (<I>p</I> = 0.178). In the absence of other stressors or modifications, the null behavioral and corticosterone findings in the weeks following SPS suggest that this SPS protocol may not reliably produce adequately robust or intervenable phenotypes.</p>

                Background Generation Alpha (born after 2010) requires pedagogical approaches aligned with their digital-native characteristics and Society 5.0 demands. Although digital integration advances in curriculum, many Indonesian vocational schools persist with teacher-centered methods that prioritize technical skills while neglecting essential soft skills teamwork, creativity, and adaptability. This study developed and validated the Alpha Generation Learning Style Scale (ALSS), the first instrument measuring Generation Alpha’s integrated learning preferences in digital vocational settings. Grounded in social constructivism, connectivism, heutagogy, and cybergogy, ALSS comprises four interconnected dimensions: Visual-Digital Learning (VDL), Collaborative Learning (CL), Self-Directed Learning (SDL), and Gamified Learning (GL). Methods Using Cantabrana et al.’s (2019) four-phase framework, the study executed expert validation (n=5), pre-testing (n=35), and empirical testing with 285 stratified vocational students using Classical Test Theory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). Results ALSS demonstrated excellent content validity (S-CVI/Ave = 0.981; Aiken’s V > 0.85) and high internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.96). CFA confirmed a strong second-order factor structure (CFI = 0.996; TLI = 0.996; RMSEA = 0.020; SRMR = 0.030), with all dimensions significantly loading onto ALSS (λ = 0.59–0.65, p < 0.001). Self-Directed Learning showed the strongest influence (0.645), followed by Collaborative Learning (0.640) and Visual-Digital Learning (0.627), explaining 35–42% of variance per dimension. Convergent validity (AVE = 0.821–0.864), discriminant validity, and composite reliability (CR > 0.96) were confirmed. Conclusions ALSS is a valid, reliable instrument capturing Generation Alpha’s technology-mediated learning identity. It provides an evidence-based diagnostic framework for personalizing Cooperative Project-Based Learning (Co-PjBL) and transforming Indonesian vocational education toward adaptive, student-centered methods. Integration with computational thinking skills including algorithmic thinking, decomposition, pattern recognition, and abstraction strengthens pedagogical effectiveness. This approach aligns TVET with Society 5.0 demands, enhancing preparation of digitally proficient, computationally literate, collaborative, and autonomous learners.

                Background Behavioral expression rarely depends on a single determinant; instead, it emerges from the convergence of neural architecture, neurohumoral state, and contextual input. The lordosis reflex in female rats is a well-characterized model requiring intact hypothalamic circuitry, ovarian steroid signaling, and somatosensory stimulation. Despite decades of empirical study, these dependencies have largely been described qualitatively, without a formal specification of how multiple necessary factors combine to permit or suppress behavioral execution. Methods We apply the ARCH × Φ framework to lordosis, modeling behavioral expression as Φ × (A × D × C), a multiplicative interaction among neural archetype (A), neurohumoral drive (D), and contextual sensory input (C), scaled by a threshold field (Φ) reflecting arousal, neuromodulatory tone, stress, and developmental state. Drawing on lesion, hormone-manipulation, and sensory-deprivation studies, we examine three canonical necessity tests: disruption of the ventromedial hypothalamus (A), ovariectomy without neurohumoral replacement (D), and removal of somatosensory context (C). We additionally perform a quantitative reanalysis of published lordosis quotient data from 10, contrasting additive, threshold-linear, and multiplicative threshold models. Results Across necessity tests, lordosis fails when any single component is reduced below threshold, even when remaining components are intact, supporting conjunctive necessity rather than additive sufficiency. Quantitative fits to classic dose–response data reveal sharp threshold transitions in expression probability that are poorly captured by additive models but well described by multiplicative formulations. Notably, probability of expression saturates rapidly once threshold is crossed, whereas magnitude measures such as lordosis duration continue to increase with hormone dose, demonstrating a dissociation between execution probability and response robustness. Progesterone selectively shifts expression probability more than magnitude, consistent with threshold modulation. Conclusions Lordosis provides a canonical testbed for conjunctive, threshold-governed behavioral control. ARCH × Φ formalizes behavioral convergence, yields falsifiable predictions, and establishes a quantitative framework for statistical model comparison.

                This study investigates the key factors influencing the strengthening empowerment within environmental volunteer networks, with a focus on Thailand’s sustainability context. Environmental volunteer groups, such as Trash Hero Thailand, play an increasingly critical role in addressing ecological challenges, yet their effectiveness is shaped by complex interactions among external factors, individual and community needs, and achievements. A quantitative methods design employed a structured questionnaire distributed among 390 participants from Trash Hero Thailand followers and local volunteer groups in Rayong and Chonburi Provinces, Thailand. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to analyze relationships among variables. Findings reveal that external factors, including political, economic, social, technological, environmental, and legal dimensions, significantly impact strenthening empowerment both directly and indirectly through achievement. Achievement was confirmed as a strong mediator, highlighting stratab;tegy, organizational structure, and communication style as critical success dimensions. Interestingly, needs negatively influenced strengthening empowerment, suggesting that unmet or excessive needs may undermine self-sufficiency unless translated into concrete achievements. The study concludes that sustainable empowerment requires a balance of external support, organizational achievement, and capacity building. Recommendations include achievement-driven empowerment strategies, graduated support models to reduce dependency, and adaptive monitoring systems. These insights contribute to advancing resilient, self-sustaining environmental volunteer networks aligned with national sustainability goals.

                Background Electronic payment methods have experienced tremendous global growth in recent years, facilitating numerous commercial transactions and making them more convenient and efficient, thereby saving time and money. This is particularly true for commercial banks, which can improve their financial and operational performance and reduce risks if used correctly. Aim The objective of this study was to examine the effect of electronic payment systems on reducing liquidity risk in Iraqi commercial banks. To achieve this objective and test its hypotheses, a descriptive-analytical approach was used. The theoretical frameworks related to electronic payment methods and banking liquidity risk were reviewed. Methods The effect of electronic payment methods on the liquidity of Iraqi banks was measured by applying the ARDL model using Eviews 10 software. Results Evidence from econometric analysis suggests a direct relationship between the total number of electronic cards and the bank liquidity risk index, which contradicts theoretical frameworks and empirical studies. The analysis also showed an inverse relationship between the number of electronic wallets and the liquidity risk index, which aligns with economic theory. Conclusion Despite the spread of electronic payment methods in the world, their role in the Iraqi economy is still limited, which necessitates working to enhance customer confidence in the banking sector and providing financial and banking awareness programs to educate them about banking services and how to use them, as well as reducing withdrawals and renewals of personal accounts, which helps banks to provide the necessary liquidity to sustain their operations.

                Background Flooding in rural areas, particularly during the northeast monsoon in Malaysia, is common; however, urban flooding, especially in densely populated areas, is unexpected. The 2021 Taman Sri Muda flood was unusual, due to an eruption of heavy rainfall from a tropical depression and the inadequacy of the drainage infrastructure to manage the water influx, further aggravated by upstream development. This challenge has severe impact on the disaster response specifically humanitarian logistics operations. Since this is the worst after 1995 flood, where the population of this area has been greater after 7 years, this study attempts to explores why the logistics issues were reported as slow and uncoordinated and to explores the critical success factors affecting disaster relief logistics. Methods This study has conducted a semi-structured interview with the Social Welfare Department officers involved directly in the distribution of aid relief during the flood disaster. NVivo software was used to analyse the data thematically. Results Five important factors were found to have an impact on logistics performance during the flood response which is the 5M consist of man (personnel), material (humanitarian aid), mechanism (coordination), machinery (asset) and monetary. To provide an organized explanation of their impact, the findings were later linked with the 5M framework. Conclusions By applying the 5M framework to an actual flood disaster, this study provides new insights which assist Malaysia plan for disaster logistics more effectively.

                Background As lung cancer treatment has progressed, there has been an increase in awareness of the short- and long-term adverse effects of targeted cancer therapies of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, particularly cardiovascular toxicities. Methods The current study assessed the potential drug-drug interactions using interaction checkers (IBM Micromedex and Drugs.com). Molecular docking was employed to further investigate the involvement of human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) proteins to elucidate their potential interactions and their underlying mechanisms. Results A total of 74 pharmacokinetic and 105 pharmacodynamic interactions were detected between tyrosine kinase inhibitors and cardiovascular drugs, along with a report on the severity and level of documentation. A considerable fraction of molecular modelling outcomes concurred with information from drug-drug interaction checkers. The binding energies of tyrosine kinase inhibitors with hERG and PXR were high, indicating significant interactions. The cardiovascular drug class encompasses calcium channel blockers, antiarrhythmic medicines, and statins, which were observed to exhibit synergistic interactions. The identification of these potential drug-drug interactions involving CYP3A4, P-gp, and hERG proteins can be utilized in therapy optimization in clinical settings. Conclusion This study will aid clinicians in designing safe dosage regimens for patients with lung cancer. In cases where patients have multiple comorbidities, it is essential to study the clinical aspects to design efficient chemotherapy and manage adverse effects and toxicities.

                Background Dysregulation of the HPG axis in PCOS causes increased frequency and amplitude of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulsatility in the hypothalamus. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the KISS1 gene may be associated with altered neuroendocrine signaling in PCOS. The present study aims to evaluate the association between two KISS1 polymorphisms (rs4889 and rs5780218), their haplotypes, and the odds of PCOS in Indonesian women. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at Yasmin Clinic, dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital, Indonesia, involving 60 women with PCOS and 60 healthy controls. Hormonal levels were assessed using ELISA, and genomic DNA was analyzed by Sanger sequencing. Demographic data were compared using independent t-tests, and chi-square tests were used for genotype and allele frequency analysis. Results The genotypic distribution of rs4889 was significantly different between the PCOS and control groups (p<0.05), where the distribution of mutant genotype GG was higher in PCOS than in control (18.3% and 1.7%, respectively). The allele distribution of rs4889 and rs5782018 KISS1 SNPs were significantly different between both groups (p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively). The rs4889 polymorphism was significantly different between the PCOS and control groups for the codominant and recessive models (p<0.01). Moreover, the rs5780218 polymorphism was significantly different between the PCOS and control groups for the codominant and dominant models (p<0.05). From the haplotype analysis, the G-CT haplotype was significantly different, with an OR value of 2.57 (1.33–4.96, p=0.0057). Conclusions KISS1 rs4889 and rs5780218 polymorphisms, as well as the G–CT haplotype, are associated with increased odds of PCOS in Indonesian women. These findings support a potential role of upstream neuroendocrine genetic variation in PCOS susceptibility; however, causal inferences cannot be drawn from this cross-sectional study.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1379/v2?src=rss">Capturing Material Thermal Responses under RF-Induced Hyperthermia: An Experimental Imaging Database [version 2; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background thermography is widely used to quantify surface temperature distributions during radiofrequency heating in biomedical, material, and industrial contexts. However, reproducible datasets capturing thermal responses of biological and inert materials under controlled RF excitation are scarce. This limitation hinders the validation of electromagnetic–thermal models, the benchmarking of image-based temperature estimation techniques, and the development of super-resolution and reconstruction algorithms. To address this gap, we generated a curated thermal image dataset that documents how different materials absorb and dissipate RF energy within an ISM band. Methods We constructed a controlled RF heating system consisting of a signal generator, a 6 W power amplifier, a circulator with matched load, and a unidirectional applicator antenna operating near 2.5 GHz. Biological tissues (pork, beef, chicken) and inert materials (foam, wood, phantom) were exposed to continuous-wave RF excitation while surface temperature was monitored using three infrared cameras with low, medium, and high resolution. Thermal images were acquired under systematically varied conditions, including RF power (0–5.5 dBm, extended to 6.5 dBm for low-loss materials), camera-to-sample distance (20–30 cm), and observation angle (0°, 30°, 60°). Each recording was captured after stabilization periods to ensure repeatability, and all images were exported as calibrated per-pixel temperature maps. Metadata documenting material type, acquisition geometry, and temperature range were embedded following a standardized naming structure. A complementary data-augmentation pipeline generated resolution-specific synthetic variations, yielding additional controlled perturbations for algorithm development. Conclusions The dataset comprises 3,600 original and 600 augmented thermal images spanning nine material categories and three spatial resolutions. Its standardized acquisition protocol and comprehensive metadata enable reproducible studies on RF–material interactions, temperature-field reconstruction, geometric correction, and super-resolution enhancement. This resource is expected to support research in computer vision, hyperthermia modelling, and the development of machine learning methods for thermal imaging under controlled RF exposure.

Biomedical systems span multiple spatial scales, encompassing tiny functional units to entire organs. Interpreting these systems through image segmentation requires the effective propagation and integration of information across different scales. However, most existing segmentation methods are optimised for single-scale imaging modalities, limiting their ability to capture and analyse small functional units throughout complete human organs. To facilitate multiscale biomedical image segmentation, we utilised Hierarchical Phase-Contrast Tomography (HiP-CT), an advanced imaging modality that can generate 3D multiscale datasets from high-resolution volumes of interest (VOIs) at ca. 1 μm/voxel to whole-organ scans at ca. 20 μm/voxel. Building on these hierarchical multiscale datasets, we developed a deep learning-based segmentation pipeline that is initially trained on manually annotated high-resolution HiP-CT data and then extended to lower-resolution whole-organ scans using pseudo-labels generated from high-resolution predictions and multiscale image registration. As a case study, we focused on glomeruli in human kidneys, benchmarking four 3D deep learning models for biomedical image segmentation on a manually annotated high-resolution dataset extracted from VOIs, at 2.58 to ca. 5 μm/voxel, of four human kidneys. Among them, nnUNet demonstrated the best performance, achieving an average test Dice score of 0.906, and was subsequently used as the baseline model for multiscale segmentation in the pipeline. Applying this pipeline to two low-resolution full-organ data at ca. 25 μm/voxel, the model identified 1,019,890 and 231,179 glomeruli in a 62-year-old donor without kidney diseases and a 94-year-old hypertensive donor, enabling comprehensive morphological analyses, including cortical spatial statistics and glomerular distributions, which aligned well with previous anatomical studies. Our results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline for segmenting small functional units in multiscale bioimaging datasets and suggest its broader applicability to other organ systems.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013918">Cluster dispersal shapes microbial diversity during community assembly</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Loïc Marrec, Sonja Lehtinen</p>

Identifying the drivers of diversity remains a central challenge in microbial ecology. In microbiota, within-community diversity is often linked to host health, which makes it all the more important to understand. Since many communities assemble de novo, microbial dispersal plays a critical role in shaping community structure during the early stages of assembly. While theoretical models typically assume microbes disperse individually, this overlooks cases where microbes disperse in clusters, such as, for example, during host feeding. Here, we investigate how cluster dispersal impacts species richness, between-community dissimilarity, and species abundance in the initial steps of microbial community assembly. We developed a model in which microbes disperse from a pool into communities as clusters and then replicate locally. Using both analytical and numerical approaches, we show that cluster dispersal promotes community homogenization by increasing within-community richness and reducing dissimilarity across communities, even at low dispersal rates. Moreover, it modulates the influence of local selection on microbial community assembly and, consequently, on species abundance. Our results demonstrate that cluster dispersal has distinct effects from simply increasing the dispersal rate. This work reveals new evidence for the role of cluster dispersal in the early dynamics of microbial community assembly.

                <p>by Anna Shafer-Skelton, Timothy F. Brady, John T. Serences</p>

Understanding 3D representations of spatial information, particularly in naturalistic scenes, remains a significant challenge in vision science. This is largely because of conceptual difficulties in disentangling higher-level 3D information from co-occurring features and cues (e.g., the 3D shape of a scene image is necessarily defined by “low-level” spatial frequency and orientation information). Recent work has employed newer models and analysis techniques that attempt to mitigate these difficulties within a model-comparison framework. For example, one such study reported 3D-surface features were uniquely present in areas OPA, PPA, and MPA/RSC (areas typically referred to as ‘scene-selective’), above and beyond a Gabor-wavelet baseline model. Here, we tested whether these findings generalized to a new stimulus set that, on average, dissociated static Gabor-wavelet baseline features from 3D scene-surface features. Surprisingly, we found evidence that a Gabor-wavelet baseline model—commonly thought of as a “low-level” or “2D” model—better fit voxel responses in areas OPA, PPA and MPA/RSC compared to a model with 3D-surface information. We highlight that this difference in results could be due to differences in the baseline conditions used across studies. These findings emphasize that much of the information in “scene-selective” regions—potentially even information about 3D surfaces—may be in the form of spatial frequency and orientation information often considered 2D or low-level. Disentangling lower-level and higher-level visual information is a continuing fundamental challenge for model-comparison approaches in visual cognition, and it motivates future work investigating which visual features could cue higher-level properties in our real-world visual experience—both within and beyond current model comparison frameworks.

                <p>by Sean R. Maulhardt, Alec Solway, Caroline J. Charpentier</p>

When receiving a reward after a sequence of multiple events, how do we determine which event caused the reward? This problem, known as temporal credit assignment, can be difficult for humans to solve given the temporal uncertainty in the environment. Research to date has attempted to isolate dimensions of delay and reward during decision-making, but algorithmic solutions to temporal learning problems and the effect of uncertainty on learning remain underexplored. To further our understanding, we adapted a reward learning task that creates a temporal credit assignment problem by combining sequentially delayed rewards, intervening events, and varying uncertainty via the amount of information presented during feedback. Using computational modeling, two learning strategies were developed: an eligibility trace, whereby previously selected actions are updated as a function of the temporal sequence, and a tabular update, whereby only systematically related past actions (rather than unrelated intervening events) are updated. We hypothesized that reduced information uncertainty would correlate with increased use of the tabular strategy, given the model’s capacity to incorporate additional feedback information. Both models effectively learned the task, and predicted choices made by participants (N = 142) as well as specific behavioral signatures of credit assignment. Consistent with our hypothesis, the tabular model outperformed the eligibility model under low information uncertainty, as evidenced by more accurate predictions of participants’ behavior and an increase in tabular weight. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms implemented by humans to solve temporal credit assignment and adapt their strategy in varying environments.

                <p>by Emily Liu, Jiaqi Zhang, Caroline Uhler</p>

Advances in sequencing technologies have enhanced the understanding of gene regulation in cells. In particular, Perturb-seq has enabled high-resolution profiling of the transcriptomic response to genetic perturbations at the single-cell level. This understanding has implications in functional genomics and potentially for identifying therapeutic targets. Various computational models have been developed to predict perturbational effects. While deep learning models excel at interpolating observed perturbational data, they tend to overfit in the lack of enough data and may not generalize well to unseen perturbations. In contrast, mechanistic models, such as linear causal models based on gene regulatory networks, hold greater potential for extrapolation, as they encapsulate regulatory information that can predict responses to unseen perturbations. However, their application has been limited to small studies due to overly simplistic assumptions, making them less effective in handling noisy, large-scale single-cell data. We propose a hybrid approach that combines a mechanistic causal model with variational deep learning, termed Single Cell Causal Variational Autoencoder (SCCVAE). The mechanistic model employs a learned regulatory network to represent perturbational changes as shift interventions that propagate through the learned network. SCCVAE integrates this mechanistic causal model into a variational autoencoder, generating rich, comprehensive transcriptomic responses. Our results indicate that SCCVAE exhibits superior performance over current state-of-the-art baselines for extrapolating to predict unseen perturbational responses. Additionally, for the observed perturbations, the latent space learned by SCCVAE allows for the identification of functional perturbation modules and simulation of single-gene knockdown experiments of varying penetrance, presenting a robust tool for interpreting and interpolating perturbational responses at the single-cell level.

                <p>by Xin Zhou, Audrey Hilk, Norma V. Solis, Nancy Scott, Christopher Zajac, Scott G. Filler, Anna Selmecki</p>

Drug resistance is a critical challenge in treating life-threatening fungal infections. Here, we uncover a mechanism of acquired azole resistance in <i>Candida albicans</i> through mutations in <i>CAP1</i>, encoding a conserved fungal transcription factor that mediates the oxidative stress response. We analyzed 300 clinical isolates and identified 25 distinct <i>CAP1</i> missense or nonsense mutations, with many occurring within the DNA-binding domain. We identified two nearly identical <i>CAP1</i> heterozygous nonsense mutations, one in an isolate obtained from a bloodstream infection and one in a population of cells undergoing adaptation to fluconazole in vitro. Both <i>CAP1</i> nonsense mutations resulted in loss of the C-terminal nuclear export signal, leading to nuclear retention of Cap1 and subsequent activation of genes associated with the oxidative stress response and drug transport. The <i>CAP1</i> C-terminal truncations conferred significant fitness advantages in the presence of fluconazole, both in vitro and in a murine model of candidiasis. Strikingly, we discovered a therapeutic vulnerability: azole concentrations above the minimal inhibitory concentration were fungicidal to mutants with the <i>CAP1</i> C-terminal truncation. The fungicidal effect was attributed to both elevated azole-induced reactive oxygen species and a compromised oxidative stress response in Cap1-truncated cells. Our results provide novel characterization of de novo <i>CAP1</i> point mutations emerging in both laboratory and clinical contexts, elucidate the mechanisms underlying Cap1-regulated stress responses, and reveal a potential therapeutic target for overcoming drug resistance in <i>C. albicans</i> infections.

Hijacking of host DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways to facilitate virus replication is broadly conserved amongst diverse viral families. It has been well established that the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpr induces constitutive DDR signaling and G2/M cell cycle arrest, but the virologic function of this activity remains unclear. Here, we use a combination of functional, pharmacologic, biochemical, and genetic approaches to establish that virion-associated and de novo Vpr proteins induce DDR responses that trigger global epigenetic remodeling and activation of transcription programs to enhance HIV-1 promoter activity during acute infection and reactivation from latency. Functional, genetic, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments reveal that Vpr segregates into two functionally discrete pools—a multimeric pool in the nucleus associated with chromatin and a monomeric pool in the cytoplasm associated with a host E3-ubiquitin ligase. Vpr-induced DDR and epigenetic remodeling activities are present in common HIV-1 subtypes circulating globally and in patient-derived isolates.

                <p>by Morgan E. McNellis, Gonzalo González-Del Pino, Juan A. Serrano-Jiménez, Emily R. Forster, A. Ioana Stoica, Ekaterina E. Heldwein, Aimee Shen</p>

The clinically significant pathogen <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> lacks the transmembrane nutrient germinant receptors conserved in almost all spore-forming bacteria. Instead, <i>C. difficile</i> initiates spore germination using a unique mechanism that requires two signals: a bile acid germinant and a co-germinant, which can be either an amino acid or a divalent cation. While two soluble pseudoproteases, CspC and CspA, were initially identified as the germinant and co-germinant receptors, respectively, in <i>C. difficile</i>, we previously identified residues in an unstructured region of CspC that regulate the sensitivity of <i>C. difficile</i> spores to both signals. However, the mechanism by which CspC transduces these signals remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that CspC forms a stable complex with CspA and determine the crystal structure of the CspC:CspA heterodimer. The structure reveals extensive interactions along the binding interface, including direct interactions between the unstructured region of CspC and CspA. Using structure-function analyses, we identify CspC:CspA interactions that regulate the sensitivity of <i>C. difficile</i> spores to germinant signals and show that CspA regulates the response of <i>C. difficile</i> to not only co-germinant but also germinant signals. While we show that CspA can form a homodimer and determine its crystal structure, CspA homodimerization appears unimportant for <i>C. difficile</i> spore germination. Collectively, our analyses establish the CspC:CspA heterodimer, rather than its individual constituents, as a critical signaling node for sensing both germinant and co-germinant signals. They also suggest a new mechanistic model for how <i>C. difficile</i> transduces germinant signals, which could guide the development of therapeutics against this important pathogen.

                <p>by Bin Liu, Jingwei Yang, Long Ye, Yang Xiao, Guohong Luo, Muyang He, Guy Smagghe, Yongyue Lu, Daifeng Cheng</p>

Oviposition holds crucial significance for insect reproduction. Nevertheless, the research on the neural conduction mechanism of oviposition is still rather limited in most agricultural pests. Here, we demonstrate that the conserved Kainate receptors (KARs) expressed in the glutamatergic neurons (GNs) and the ovipositor neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) regulate the oviposition behavior in <i>Bactrocera dorsalis</i>. We identified two KARs (Grik2b and Grik2c), which control the oviposition behavior by influencing both oviposition preference and egg-laying quantity. Protein-ligand interaction indicated that glutamate serves as the neurotransmitter of Grik2b and Grik2c. Knockdown glutamate-coding genes adversely impacted oviposition preference and egg-laying quantity. Specific knockdown Grik2b (or Grik2c) in the GNs and NMJs could respectively influence oviposition preference and egg-laying quantity. Finally, inhibitors of KARs were screened for their ability to inhibit oviposition. Our study provides strong supporting evidence that a novel neural conduction mechanism for oviposition by uncovering the diverse roles of KARs and provides potential molecular target controlling insect oviposition.

                <p>by Ye-Eun Son, Carlos Pérez-Arques, Joseph Heitman</p>

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health threat emerging through microbe adaptation, driven by genetic variation, genome plasticity or epigenetic processes. In this study, we investigated how the <i>Mucor circinelloides</i> species complex adapts to the antifungal natural product FK506, which binds to FKBP12 and inhibits calcineurin-dependent hyphal growth. In <i>Mucor bainieri</i>, most FK506-resistant isolates (90%) were found to be unstable and transient, readily reverting to being drug sensitive when passaged without drug, and with no associated DNA mutations. In half of the isolates (50%), FK506-resistance was conferred by RNAi-dependent epimutation in which small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) silenced the <i>fkbA</i> encoding FKBP12 post-transcriptionally. In contrast, most of the remaining FK506-resistant isolates (40%) were found to have undergone heterochromatin-mediated silencing via H3K9 dimethylation, transcriptionally repressing <i>fkbA</i> and neighboring genes. In these heterochromatic epimutants, only minimal enrichment of siRNA to the <i>fkbA</i> locus was observed, but in three of the four examples, siRNA was significantly enriched at a locus distant from <i>fkbA</i>. A similar mechanism operates in <i>Mucor atramentarius</i>, where FK506 resistance was mediated by ectopic heterochromatin silencing of <i>fkbA</i> and associated genes with siRNA spreading across the region. Heterochromatin-mediated <i>fkbA</i> epimutants exhibited stability during in vivo infection, suggesting epimutation could impact pathogenesis. These findings reveal that antifungal resistance arising through distinct, transient epimutation pathways involving RNAi or heterochromatin, highlighting adaptive AMR strategies employed by ubiquitous eukaryotic microbes.

                <p>by Katie L. Flanagan, Sabra L. Klein</p>

Differences in immunity in males and females throughout the life span manifest as differences in susceptibility to chronic diseases, infections, cancer, and responses to therapeutic interventions such as immunomodulatory drugs and vaccines. Sex steroids and sex chromosome-linked immune response genes have major roles in driving these differences, but the cells and signaling pathways governing these are disease-specific and often not known. Such knowledge is required to better understand sex differences in disease incidence and clinical course, and to provide treatments tailored to sex-divergent pathways underlying specific diseases. This Essay explores the major areas where further research is required to determine sex-differential mechanisms.

                Sewage sludge (SS) management has evolved from conventional disposal practices toward resource-oriented and environmentally conscious solutions. This study investigates the thematic structure of global SS research, with a focus on green technological pathways for resource recovery and the environmental risks associated with SS utilisation. A systematic bibliometric approach was adopted using the Web of Science Core Collection, targeting publications from 2015 to 2024 that included the terms “sludge” AND (“recycl*” OR “reuse” OR “treatment” OR “reduc*” OR “management”) within their titles, abstracts, or keywords. The final dataset consisted of 12,666 eligible articles that met all screening criteria. VOSviewer (version 1.6.20) was used for science mapping, including keyword co-occurrence and cluster analysis. Six thematic clusters were identified, representing dominant research trajectories: (i) microbial processes for nutrient recovery, (ii) biological conversion to bioenergy, (iii) thermochemical transformation and material reuse, (iv) heavy metal bioavailability and ecological risk, (v) emerging contaminant (EC) fate and mitigation, and (vi) dye removal mechanisms. Results indicate a shift toward circular-economy-aligned SS management, emphasising bioconversion, hydrothermal technologies, and biochar valorisation. Research gaps relate to large-scale deployment, EC remediation, and commercialization constraints. The findings provide a structured knowledge base for guiding future research, policy formulation, and investment in sustainable sludge-to-resource systems.

                Background Classical fuzzy sets have been generalized to better model uncertainty, leading to developments such as intuitionistic, pythagorean, and fermatean fuzzy sets. fermatean fuzzy sets (ffss), characterized by the cube sum constraint on membership and non-membership degrees, provide a more flexible framework for handling complex uncertainty. bn-algebras are important algebraic structures with applications in logic and information theory. Methods This study integrates fermatean fuzzy sets with bn-algebras by introducing the notions of fermatean fuzzy subalgebras and fermatean fuzzy ideals. level cuts of fermatean fuzzy sets are defined and analyzed, and algebraic techniques are employed to investigate their structural properties. Results It is shown that fermatean fuzzy level subalgebras and fermatean fuzzy level ideals correspond to classical subalgebras and ideals of bn-algebras. several characterizations and closure properties are established, supported by illustrative examples and rigorous proofs. Conclusions The results demonstrate that fermatean fuzzy sets significantly enrich the theory of bn-algebras by accommodating higher degrees of uncertainty. this framework provides a solid theoretical foundation for further studies and potential applications in algebraic logic and uncertainty-based systems.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Goniomonads are heterotrophic members of a major group of eukaryotes called Cryptista and branch sister to the photosynthetic Cryptophyta. Goniomonads are poorly investigated and have recently been reclassified, dividing a single genus into ten new genera. In single-gene phylogenies, all three freshwater genera branch in a monophyletic group distinct from marine goniomonads, suggesting that a single event led to goniomonads transitioning from marine to freshwater environments. Here, we use light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and single cell genomics to describe and determine the molecular phylogenetic placement of a new freshwater genus of goniomonad. Methods Light and scanning electron microscopy were used to validate the morphological characteristics of a new goniomonad. We used whole genome amplification to generate a goniomonad single-cell amplified genome. We reconstructed the phylogenetic placement of this goniomonad using single-gene and multi-gene analyses. Results We characterized and established a new genus of goniomonad, named Naiadagoniomonas ponderosa n. gen. n. sp. In single-gene phylogenetic analyses, N. ponderosa branches within the freshwater clade that forms the sister to Limnogoniomonas. In multi-gene phylogenetic analyses, N. ponderosa branches with the only other representative of goniomonads available. We recovered a fragmented but high-quality single-amplified genome including a complete circular-mapping mitochondrial genome. Conclusions We conclude that diverse goniomonads are likely present in freshwater environments and single-cell genomics is an excellent tool for probing their phylogenomic diversity and mitochondrial gene content.

                This study aims to develop, validate, and test the reliability of a social competency assessment instrument for proficient teachers in Indonesia. The development method adopts the ADDIE (Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, and Evaluate) stages. Based on the analysis of teacher competency model documents, seven statement items were formulated using three social competency indicators representing the core abilities of proficient teachers. These items were validated by six experts and pilot-tested on teachers from various educational levels. Content validity results showed that all items were valid with Aiken-V values between 0.78 and 1.00. Intraclass correlation (ICC) analysis revealed an increase in inter-rater consistency from the validation stage to the revalidation stage, indicating high rater reliability (0.870). In the construct testing using CB-SEM, all items met the validity and reliability criteria, with loading factors of 0.765-0.930, Cronbach’s alpha of 0.798-0.895, composite reliability of 0.796-0.898, and AVE of 0.670-0.779. Discriminant validity was achieved (0.818-0.883), and the goodness-of-fit test showed a reasonable to very good model (SRMR = 0.032; NFI = 0.960; TLI = 0.934; CFI = 0.965). The Mann-Whitney U test showed no significant differences based on gender (p> 0.05). Thus, this instrument has been demonstrated to be valid, reliable, and inclusive, making it suitable for use in evaluating the social competence of proficient teachers in Indonesia.

                Dai et al. show that MS therapeutics paradoxically worsen NMOSD-like pathology via astrocytic injury, whereas agents promoting astrocytic activation confer protection. This work bridges fundamental mechanisms to clinical strategy by establishing a framework for astrocyte-centered drug screening for NMOSD.

Using brain imaging and deep neural networks, we found that in 2-month-old infants the visual system represented not only how things looked but also what category they belonged to. This showed that features sufficient for object recognition are already important in early life.

                <p>Nature Physics, Published online: 02 February 2026; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-025-03164-5">doi:10.1038/s41567-025-03164-5</a></p>Spin-polarized electron beams are important for fundamental physics, but they could only be generated using DC electron guns. Now, a radiofrequency electron gun for polarized electrons has been realized, promising to overcome beam quality limitations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102999">Mixture discrimination training induces durable and generalizable olfactory learning independent of odorant structure and concentration</a></h4>

              
                Previously, we showed that adult human olfaction retains plasticity in the unilateral processing of molecular chirality (Feng and Zhou, 2019). Using a similar unilateral discrimination protocol across three experiments with human adults (n = 96; 1,295 sessions), we now reveal distinct patterns of specificity, generalization, and persistence in olfactory learning, independent of adaptation or task difficulty. Training with binary odor mixtures at varying ratios consistently produced durable gains that transferred across nostrils and generalized to novel mixtures differing in both structure and perceptual quality. Conversely, training with odor enantiomers or concentration differences yielded neither transfer nor generalization, and concentration discrimination learning was short-lived. These results indicate that mixture configural quality is a distinct olfactory attribute from chirality or relative concentration, and that discrimination learning engages plasticity at different stages of olfactory processing depending on the task-relevant attribute. Moreover, they identify mixture discrimination training as a promising strategy for rehabilitating smell loss and cultivating olfactory expertise.

                More than four decades ago, Gibbon and Balsam (1981) showed that the acquisition of Pavlovian conditioning in pigeons is directly related to the informativeness of the conditioning stimulus (CS) about the unconditioned stimulus (US), where informativeness is defined as the ratio of the US-US interval (<i>C</i>) to the CS-US interval (<i>T</i>). However, the evidence for this relationship in other species has been equivocal. Here, we describe an experiment that measured the acquisition of appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in 14 groups of rats trained with different <i>C</i>/<i>T</i> ratios (ranging from 1.5 to 300) to establish how learning is related to informativeness. We show that the number of trials required for rats to start responding to the CS is determined by the <i>C</i>/<i>T</i> ratio, and the specific scalar relationship between the rate of learning and informativeness is similar to that previously obtained with pigeons. We also found that the response rate after extended conditioning is strongly related to <i>T</i>, with the terminal CS response rate being a scalar function of the CS reinforcement rate (1 <i>/T</i>). Moreover, this same scalar relationship extended to the rats’ response rates during the inter-trial interval, which was directly proportional to the overall rate of reinforcement in the context (1 <i>/C</i>). The findings establish that animals encode rates of reinforcement, and that conditioning is directly related to how much information the CS provides about the US. The consistency of these observations across species, captured by a simple regression function, suggests a universal model of conditioning.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89068">Polymorphisms in intron 1 of HLA-DRA differentially associate with type 1 diabetes and celiac disease and implicate involvement of complement system genes C4A and C4B</a></h4>

              
                Polymorphisms in genes in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II region comprise the most important inherited risk factors for many autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes (T1D) and celiac disease (CD): both diseases are positively associated with the HLA-DR3 haplotype (<i>DRB1*03:01-DQA1*05:01-DQB1*02:01</i>). Studies of two different populations have recently documented that T1D susceptibility in HLA-DR3 homozygous individuals is stratified by a haplotype consisting of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (‘tri-SNP’) in intron 1 of the <i>HLA-DRA</i> gene. In this study, we use a large cohort from the longitudinal ‘The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young’ (TEDDY) study to further refine the tri-SNP association with T1D and with autoantibody-defined T1D endotypes. We found that the tri-SNP association is primarily in subjects whose first-appearing T1D autoantibody is to insulin. In addition, we discovered that the tri-SNP is also associated with CD, and that the particular tri-SNP haplotype (‘101’) that is negatively associated with T1D risk is positively associated with risk for CD. The opposite effect of the tri-SNP haplotype on two DR3-associated diseases can enhance and refine current models of disease prediction based on genetic risk. Finally, we investigated possible functional differences between the individuals carrying high and low-risk tri-SNP haplotypes and found that differences in complement system genes C4A and C4B may underlie the observed divergence in disease risk.

                Tendons and ligaments are crucial connective tissues linking bones and muscles, yet achieving full functional recovery after injury remains challenging. We investigated the characteristics of tendon stem/progenitor cells (TSPCs) by focusing on the declining tendon repair capacity with growth. Using single-cell RNA sequencing on Achilles tendon cells from 2- and 6-week-old mice, we identified <i>Cd55</i> and <i>Cd248</i> as novel surface antigen markers for TSPCs. Combining single-cell RNA sequencing with single-nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing analyses revealed that <i>Cd55-</i> and <i>Cd248</i>-positive fractions in tendon tissue represent TSPCs, as confirmed by their expression of established TSPC markers, with this population decreasing at 6 weeks. We also identified candidate upstream transcription factors regulating these fractions. Functional analyses of isolated CD55/CD248-positive cells demonstrated high clonogenic potential and tendon differentiation capacity, forming functional tendon-like tissue in vitro. This study establishes CD55 and CD248 as novel TSPC surface antigens, potentially advancing tendon regenerative medicine and contributing to the development of new treatment strategies for tendon and ligament injuries.

">Developing a self-reflective mind: infants' error-detection at 12 months predicts self-awareness at 18 months</a></h4>

              
                Self-reflection is central to human cognition and has been proposed as one of the key drivers of our progress as a species, yet the development of self-reflective capacities is unknown. Using a novel gaze-contingent match-to-sample paradigm with concurrent eye-tracking and EEG recordings, we find evidence of self-reflective capacities in 12-month-old infants: they exhibit a neural response signature of error-tracking (the error-related negativity, ERN) when they make incorrect as opposed to correct choices and before receiving any feedback. Remarkably, the magnitude of the ERN at 12 months developmentally predicted the emergence of conceptual self-representation (mirror-self-recognition) in the same infants six months later. This relationship was specific to internal error-monitoring and not to external feedback processing, and could not be explained by infants' age or general cognitive development. Moreover, infants did not simply detect their errors: the group of infants who passed the mirror test at 18 months (S) also adapted their behaviour post-error at 12 months. Following mistakes, S infants slowed their decisions and increased their visual exploration, demonstrating not only rudimentary metacognitive monitoring but also metacognitive control at 1 year of age. These findings provide the first empirical evidence that self-awareness may be rooted in earlier self-monitoring abilities, and reveal how a self-reflective mind can emerge from implicit cognitive monitoring mechanisms within the first years of life.

">Modularity-dependent storage of dynamic spiking patterns: bridging micro- and mesoscopic representations</a></h4>

              
                Biological systems rely on asynchronous and temporally overlapping dynamics, allowing for the concurrent activation of multiple processes. This principle is particularly evident in brain function, where cognitive tasks engage distributed, interacting regions rather than sequentially isolated ones. To investigate the mechanisms enabling such coordination, we study a modular spiking neural network composed of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons and governed by spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). Our model stores modular spatiotemporal patterns both at the mesoscopic level (sequences of modules) and at the microscopic level (precise spike timings) and includes a parameter, , which regulates the degree of temporal overlap between modules' activations. By tuning , the network transitions from sequential to overlapping regimes, ranging from synfire chain-like dynamics to fully co-activated modules. We investigate how the temporal structure influences the network's capacity to encode and selectively retrieve multiple dynamical patterns while considering biological constraints such as the cost of long-range connectivity. Our results offer insight into how spatiotemporal coding and network organisation support robust, large-scale memory storage and replay.

">Developmental dysregulation of chandelier cell excitability in a mouse model of Dravet Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Chandelier cells (ChCs) are a rare and highly specialized subtype of inhibitory neuron in the cerebral cortex that specifically and exclusively form synapses onto the axon initial segment of excitatory neurons and thereby exert powerful control of excitability. We applied a newly developed, cell type-specific enhancer element to label ChCs and assess their electrophysiological and morphological properties across development in Dravet Syndrome (Scn1a+/- mice), a prominent neurodevelopmental disorder defined by epilepsy and features of autism spectrum disorder. Dravet Syndrome is known to predominantly impact GABAergic interneurons. We found that ChCs from juvenile Scn1a+/- mice (postnatal day, P18-21) exhibit impaired excitability, and that deficits largely persist in young adulthood (P35-56). These findings are distinct from prior observations in the more common subtype of parvalbumin-positive interneurons, basket cells. We found no differences in the axonal or dendritic morphology of ChCs at either time point. Our results suggest a role for ChCs in the pathogenesis of Dravet Syndrome and constitute the first targeted study of ChC function in a specific genetically-defined neurodevelopmental disorder.

">Tracking bilingual brain processing at high spatiotemporal resolution reveals where and when second language slows down</a></h4>

              
                A central question in bilingualism research is whether challenges in a second language (L2) reflect a fundamentally different processing route from the first language (L1), or slower processing at particular stages. Although functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) revealed substantial cortical overlap between L1 and L2, different processing mechanisms may interleave within the overlap. Conventional fMRI methods lack the combined spatial and temporal resolution needed to determine precisely where and when L1 and L2 dissociations occur. Here, we used rapid phase-encoded fMRI to track L1 and L2 processing within overlapping cortical regions. Thirty-one Chinese-English bilinguals completed sentence-level reading, listening, reading-aloud, and shadowing tasks in both Chinese (L1) and English (L2). By analyzing hemodynamic traveling waves along sample paths through the visual, auditory, and motor systems, we identified temporal dissociations between L1 and L2 processing. Compared with L1, L2 exhibited significant and consistent delays along dorsal and ventral visual streams during reading and reading aloud. Along auditory streams, L2 delays differed between externally presented speech (listening) and self-generated speech (reading aloud). In the frontal cortex, reading aloud and shadowing exhibited similar progression patterns, but with different temporal offsets between L1 and L2 in the dorsal and ventral motor streams. These findings reveal task- and modality-dependent differences between L1 and L2 processing, and pinpoint the exact locations for delayed L2 processing across multimodal streams. This study suggests that L2 disadvantage is often a matter of timing and efficiency within largely shared brain networks, rather than due to the use of different brain regions.

">Visuomotor learning is determined by the tonic component of feedback responses</a></h4>

              
                When a movement error occurs, the motor system updates its commands to improve performance on subsequent trials. A prominent feedback error learning hypothesis proposes that the feedback response that corrects movement within a trial serves as a teaching signal for the learning response, observed as changes in motor commands on the next trial. However, how the temporal pattern of the feedback response influences the learning response remains unclear. Here, we introduce an experimental paradigm that directly compares the temporal patterns of feedback and learning responses across different patterns of visual error. We show that although the feedback response closely tracks the temporal pattern of the visual error, this temporal pattern is not transferred to the learning response. Instead, the amplitude of the feedback response during the holding period, reflecting the temporal pattern of the visual error, primarily determines the magnitude of the learning response. These findings reveal how the motor learning system selectively extracts specific components of feedback responses to update future motor commands.

">Longitudinal whole-human-brain quantitative MRI study on autolysis, fixation, rehydration, and shrinkage effects</a></h4>

              
                Post mortem MRI studies of formalin-fixed brain tissue are essential for linking in vivo MRI contrast to underlying microstructure measured with ex vivo histology, yet formalin not only preserves tissue but also systematically alters MRI-relevant physical properties. To systematically quantify and model these effects, we longitudinally characterized multi-parametric mapping (MPM) measures - longitudinal (R1) and effective transverse (R2*) relaxation rates, proton density proxy (NA), and magnetization transfer saturation ratio (MTsat) - across the different post mortem processes, i.e. autolysis, fixation, and hydration. Five whole-human brains were scanned longitudinally during fixation (and in situ-after rehydration, when available), and compared with an independent in vivo cohort of 25 younger healthy participants. Each MPM parameter followed a distinct trajectory across different post mortem processes. The largest changes were found for R1 during fixation relative to in situ values (more than 250%), followed by R2* with an almost 60% increase, and MTsat with a 26% reduction from in vivo to in situ. NA showed no detectable change during fixation. We developed models describing fixation-induced changes and tissue shrinkage. The R1 changes and tissue shrinkage were closely aligned, reflecting a likely common mechanism. MTsat largely preserved tissue contrast during fixation and rehydration, supporting its use for spatial alignment between in vivo MRI, fixed-tissue MRI, and histology. With our quantitative assessment of post mortem process-dependent changes we provide a unique resource for future studies to better link in vivo to fixed post mortem MRI data and thereby bridge the gap to ex vivo histology.

">A Quality Measure for Repeating Multiple-Unit Spike Patterns</a></h4>

              
                We propose a quality measure for spatio-temporal spike patterns (STPs) in multiple-neuron recordings. In such recordings, repeating STPs or pattern repetitions (PRs) are often found, with many of these generated by chance. To rule those out, statistical tests have been developed to discriminate the unlikely from the more likely PRs. This statistical problem is complicated by the fact that there are several obvious quality criteria for a PR, such as the size (the number of spikes) of the pattern and the number of its occurrences. Here, we propose a canonical way of combining several criteria (which we collect in the so-called signature of the pattern) into a single quality measure, based on the 'unlikeliness' of the pattern. This measure is defined mathematically, and a formula for its computation is derived for stationary spike trains. It can be used to compare PRs. Since spike trains are not stationary in practice, we discuss, for two experimental data sets, how well the stationary formula correlates with the defined quality measure as determined from simulations. The results encourage the use of the stationary formula or also some simpler, related formulas as 'proxies' for the quality, for the comparison of PRs and also for statistical tests that avoid the multiple testing problem incurred by using several quality criteria. Based on our results, we propose a few test statistics, i.e., random variables on the space of multi-unit spike trains with an appropriate null-hypothesis distribution, to evaluate STPs with less computational and sampling efforts.

">Do GLP-1 Receptor Agonists Alter Brain Responses to Reward-Related Cues? A Systematic Review</a></h4>

              
                Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are approved for treating type 2 diabetes and obesity and are under investigation as potential treatments for substance use disorders (SUD). GLP-1 RA-induced weight loss is thought to arise from both peripheral effects on gastrointestinal function and central modulation of appetite and reward circuits, though the exact mechanisms are unclear. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies examining brain responses to reward-related cues can help clarify the central mechanisms through which GLP-1 RAs influence reward-seeking behavior. We systematically reviewed the fMRI literature examining how GLP-1 RAs affect brain responses to reward-related cues. We identified 1,209 records through a comprehensive literature search. After screening, only 11 studies met eligibility criteria. The vast majority assessed reactivity to food-related cues, with only one examining drug-related cues (alcohol), leaving neural mechanisms relevant to SUD largely unexplored. None included non-food emotional stimuli as control conditions. Several methodological limitations emerged. Most studies enrolled 20 or fewer participants per group, limiting statistical power. Treatment protocols varied substantially, with some assessing cue responses after single-dose administration and others after chronic treatment. Heterogeneity in medications used further confounds interpretation. The limited evidence tentatively suggests that acute GLP-1 RA administration may reduce brain reactivity to food cues in appetite and reward regions. However, effects appear inconsistent and may attenuate over time. Future studies should recruit larger samples, standardize agents and dosing, and assess responses to diverse motivationally relevant stimuli.

">On the limit: Working memory capacity constrains learning of complex visuomotor mappings</a></h4>

              
                Human sensorimotor adaptation critically depends on the ability to map sensory inputs onto motor outputs. While this process was once thought to rely primarily on cerebellar-dependent implicit recalibration, recent work has revealed that explicit, cognitive strategies, relying on working memory and executive function, play a substantial role. However, it remains unclear whether explicit strategies can scale to support learning of complex sensorimotor mappings. Here, we parametrically tested the capacity of explicit strategies to solve a complex visuomotor rotation task by varying the number of target-rotation pairings that participants had to acquire. In experiment 1, participants were tasked with learning four visuomotor mappings-well within working memory capacity, based on prior studies. We found that participants achieved near-perfect compensation, which was best explained by the retrieval of stored target rotation associations, rather than by computationally demanding algorithmic strategies. In experiment 2, in an attempt to push beyond working memory capacity, participants were tasked with learning eight mappings. Unlike in experiment 1, here we found that participants failed to fully compensate for the rotations, reaching asymptotic performance of only ~50%, despite evidence of continued strategic engagement. This performance limit was fully predicted by a parameter-free working-memory model where performance is a mixture of a fixed number of stored target-rotation associations and random guessing. These findings reveal a cognitive bandwidth limit on the effectiveness of strategies for sensorimotor adaptation: when task complexity exceeds this limit, adaptation plateaus, defining a fundamental constraint on how far higher-order cognition can go to support learning.

">Natural scene segmentation dynamics reveal iterative Bayesian inference</a></h4>

              
                The visual system operates by segmenting visual inputs into distinct perceptual objects. Segmentation is dynamic, as revealed by the tempo of perceptual choices and neural activity in visual cortex. Dynamics for natural stimuli however, are poorly understood because natural scene segmentation is ambiguous and subjective. We measured subjective human segmentation maps for natural images using an innovative paradigm, and uncovered richer spatiotemporal dynamics than predicted by current theories of segmentation. To explain these dynamics, we introduced Iterative Bayesian Inference algorithms for segmentation that iteratively integrate visual inputs with the prior expectation that objects are spatially compact. When visual inputs were consistent with such a spatial prior, iterative inference was faster. This predicted relationship between spatial prior and inferential dynamics was evident in our data, and correctly reflected each individual participant's spatial biases. We conclude that iterative Bayesian inference sets the tempo for a fundamental function of natural vision.

">Odor and bacterial signatures for humans that attract different mosquito species</a></h4>

              
                Humans are not equally attractive to mosquitoes, leaving some individuals more vulnerable to mosquito-borne illnesses than others. The risk of a mosquito biting a human depends on multiple cues, with body odor amongst the most crucial. In this study, we measured the attraction of Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus,and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes in a uniport olfactometer to determine species-specific attraction rates for each of our 119 human participants. Mosquito species typically did not favor the same participants. Each species attraction to participants was associated with distinct odor and bacterial signatures. For example, Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus attraction was associated with the absence of repulsive odors like cyclic alcohols and monoterpenes, while Ae. albopictus attraction was associated with the presence of attractive odors like ketones. In addition, Ae. aegypti, but not other species tested, were more attracted to male than female participants. We show that mosquito species respond differently to individual humans and highlight cues that may regulate mosquito behavior.

">Stability of neural manifolds at minimal dimensionality despite motor representational drift</a></h4>

              
                Recent work has modeled the generation of movement as emerging from a latent dynamical system. While the relationship between recorded neural populations and latent variables is non-stationary, latent trajectories populate low-dimensional manifolds that appear stable over time. However, the dimensionality of these manifolds and their relationship to motor cortical circuitry remains unclear. We propose a simple framework for extracting labeled latent vari- ables that maintain a fixed relationship to movement parameters in a two-dimensional reaching task. Despite only capturing 3-7% of total variance and spanning two dimensions, this super- vised method outperforms other common methods at an offline decoding task, and explains the long-term stability of neural manifolds observed in previous literature. We demonstrate that changes in the encoding map (from neurons to latents) is the dominant source of drift in motor cortex, while the latent map (from latents to behavior) remains stable over years. Additionally, we find that, for a two-dimensional task, neural structure is constrained by task complexity, limiting the insights that neural manifolds offer onto underlying circuitry. Our results motivate future studies to uncover causal relationships between neural computation and behavior.

">Ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate restores neuronal Tau proteostasis via ketolysis-independent mechanism</a></h4>

              
                Metabolic interventions that induce ketosis, including ketogenic diets, caloric restriction, intermittent fasting, and exercise, show promise in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related tauopathies. Beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), the primary ketone body produced during ketosis, reproduces key features of these metabolic interventions, but the molecular mechanism underlying its neuroprotective properties is not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that a BHB precursor diet is sufficient to ameliorate Tau pathophysiology in a tauopathy mouse model. Furthermore, across in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo models, we find that BHB enhances neuronal Tau proteostasis and reduces Tau aggregation and secretion. Importantly, these effects are independent of BHB's oxidation for ATP production, as its ketolysis-resistant enantiomer reproduces these benefits, indicating that ketolysis is dispensable for these effects. Overall, these data position BHB as a novel therapeutic avenue for AD and tauopathy and elucidate a novel mechanism of action of metabolic interventions in neurodegenerative disease.

">Sex-specific associations between astrocytic reactivity and cognitive decline in unimpaired elderly</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION: Astrocyte reactivity may contribute to the increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in women. Plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker of astrocytic reactivity, has been associated with AD pathology and cognitive decline. Although higher GFAP levels have been reported in women, few studies have investigated sex-specific relationships with other plasma AD biomarkers and cognition. METHODS: Participants were enrolled in the Memory Education and Research Initiative, a longitudinal community-based cohort, and underwent comprehensive evaluation including blood biomarker sampling. RESULTS: Cognitively unimpaired women exhibited higher plasma GFAP levels than men (N=548). Higher baseline GFAP was associated with worse longitudinal episodic memory performance, exclusively in women. In addition, both higher baseline GFAP and increasing GFAP levels over time were associated with lower longitudinal plasma A{beta}42/40 ratio. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that astrocytic reactivity is more pronounced in women and may contribute to sex-specific vulnerability to AD-related pathology and cognitive decline.

">Noisy models of the ventral stream reveal the impact of recurrence and learned representations on information processing timescales</a></h4>

              
                In vision neuroscience, the temporal dynamics of the sensory stream and of its neural representations are thought to be deeply linked to the function of the hierarchy of cortical areas that deal with object recognition, known as the visual ventral stream. Neural representations that are invariant under identity-preserving object transformations, and therefore allow for efficient learning of object identity, are theorized to emerge from a self-supervised learning process that attempts to extract ''temporally stable'' features from the sensory input. Conversely, invariance increases along the hierarchy, putatively implying progressively slower codes in higher-level areas. Recent neurophysiological evidence shows that indeed, as one moves along this cortical hierarchy, neural representations of dynamic stimuli become slower, and additionally the temporal scales of the within-trial fluctuations of these representations (called ''intrinsic timescales'') increase starkly. However, the network determinants of these timescale hierarchies are not understood in realistic systems, as the classical theory is based on models without noise, recurrence, or adaptive mechanisms. Here we investigate the temporal structure of the neural code in a noisy, recurrent and adaptive model of the ventral visual stream. We show that, surprisingly, the organization of the representation timescales is set by the broad architectural features of the network, regardless of training, while the intrinsic timescales depend on the details of the functions implemented on each layer. Our work underscores the importance of the temporal structure of the neural code as a probe for the link between structure and function in models of the vertebrate visual system.

">Distinct cortical excitability and connectivity profiles within the human SMA complex</a></h4>

              
                Introduction and aim: Understanding brain functions increasingly relies on a network- based perspective, emphasizing interactions across distributed regions. High-order cognitive functions, like language and executive processes, engage such networks rather than isolated cortical areas, yet mapping their dynamics in humans remains challenging. The supplementary motor area (SMA) complex serves as a crucial hub, functioning as an interface between cognitive and sensorimotor processing. Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) enables causal, time-resolved assessment of cortical excitability and connectivity with high temporal and spatial precision. Extending prior proof-of-concept work, this study aims to provide normative neurophysiological signatures of the SMA complex (pre-SMA and SMA). Methods: Twenty-one healthy subjects underwent a TMS-EEG session where six stimulation targets over the SMA complex (three in pre-SMA, one in the border between pre-SMA and SMA, two in SMA) were recorded. Global cortical excitability via global mean field power (GMFP) was computed over three time-windows (10-50, 50-100, and 100-200 ms) and compared across targets. Normalized power in different frequency bands (, {beta}1, {beta}2, {gamma}) and natural frequency (NF) were also computed and compared across stimulation sites. Then, we calculated tractography-derived connectivity metrics to examine corticothalamic projections from each stimulation site. Apparent fiber density (AFD)-derived connection strength quantified intra-axonal fibre volume along pathways to the whole thalamus, whereas fibre bundle capacity (FBC) assessed the aggregate intra-axonal cross-sectional area at pathway endpoints, providing an estimate of information transmission capacity to each of the 23 thalamic nuclei. Results: Cortical excitability and oscillatory properties varied significantly across TMS targets. A gradient in cortical excitability was observed, where anterior and middle portions of pre-SMA exhibited significantly lower GMFP in the early post-stimulus phase (i.e., 10-50 ms) than SMA portions; interestingly, these differences were clearly dampened in a later time-window (50-100 ms) and disappeared after this period. Furthermore, higher  and lower {beta}2 power were observed in anterior pre-SMA than posterior pre-SMA portions. No differences were observed in NF. Crucially, we also observed significant differences in whole- and single-nuclei thalamic structural connectivity. Discussion: These findings provide direct human in vivo evidence for distinct neurophysiological and structural connectivity profiles of the pre-SMA and SMA, possibly reflecting their different cytoarchitectonic, myeloarchitectonic and connectivity properties. Variations in cortical excitability, oscillatory dynamics, and FBC along the rostro-caudal axis may mirror functional specialization, with pre-SMA supporting cognitive control processes and SMA engaging motor-related thalamocortical networks. Together, the results demonstrate the sensitivity of TMS-EEG and diffusion-weighted connectomics to measure fine-grained neurophysiological differences of corticothalamic projections, which can lead to individualized neuromodulation targeting.

">An in vivo model of Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities (ARIA) predicts ARIA incidence of anti-Aβ antibodies seen in clinical trials</a></h4>

              
                Amyloid-related imaging abnormality (ARIA) is the most common adverse event associated with amyloid-beta (A{beta}) immunotherapy. The neuropathology underlying active ARIA lesions has been studied in only a few rare fatal cases. A faithful translational model of ARIA should allow a better understanding of pathogenic mechanisms and enable development of mitigation strategies. Since bapineuzumab induced the most frequent and severe forms of ARIA in humans, we assessed the ability of its murine precursor, 3D6, to induce ARIA-like lesions by applying clinically-validated MRI sequences in a mouse model with extensive amyloid deposition. Using this paradigm we documented ARIA-like changes based on their imaging features, location, and temporal evolution and established postmortem histopathologic correlates. We observed that ARIA-like lesions were ubiquitously induced with 3D6, including T2-hyperintense leptomeningeal effusions, T2-hyperintense parenchymal lesions and T2* hypointense parenchymal lesions. Histological assays demonstrated meningovascular inflammation as well as vascular mural permeation and microvascular lesions, including microhemorrhages and microinfarcts. Compared to 3D6-treated mice, animals treated with mouse analogues of aducanumab and gantenerumab showed less frequent radiologic and histopathologic ARIA-like lesions with delayed onset. Our results align well with the differential incidence of ARIA observed in humans treated with different anti-A{beta} antibodies. Collectively, our studies demonstrate that: i) anti-A{beta} antibodies chronically administered to 5xFAD mice can induce MRI lesions reminiscent of human ARIA; ii) this paradigm allows identification of transient lesions other than microhemorrhages, and (iii) the incidence and severity of ARIA-like lesions induced with three clinically tested antibodies faithfully recapitulates that seen in humans.

">Divergent mitochondrial and metabolic adaptations shape selective vulnerability in ALS</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) exhibit striking cell-type selectivity, yet the basis for this vulnerability remains elusive. Here, we uncover that even closely related neurons can harbor distinct mitochondrial properties that shape their response to disease. Using TOM-Tag, a circuit-based AA-based strategy for cell type-specific mitochondrial immunopurification from projection neurons, we performed integrative proteomic, metabolomic, transcriptomic, and functional analyses of mitochondria from ALS-vulnerable corticospinal projection neurons (CSPNs) and resilient corticothalamic projection neurons (CTPNs) in vivo. We discovered that CSPNs and CTPNs exhibit divergent mitochondrial profiles at baseline, despite sharing cortical layer and developmental origin. CTPNs were primed for antioxidant buffering and fatty acid metabolism, whereas CSPNs were enriched for oxidative phosphorylation components. In ALS, CTPNs employed mitochondrial flexibility and redox defense, whereas CSPNs exhibited respiratory failure and metabolic stress. These findings reveal that intrinsic mitochondrial programs vary even between similar neurons, and that this hidden layer of diversity may critically shape susceptibility to neurodegeneration. By enabling high-resolution access to mitochondria in defined neuronal circuits, TOM-Tag offers a powerful new lens for dissecting disease mechanisms and identifying cell-specific therapeutic targets.

">Infraslow modulation of theta synchrony in the hippocampus circuit during REM sleep</a></h4>

              
                Sleep dynamically reorganizes hippocampal activity, but how this reconfiguration supports large-scale coordination across the hippocampal circuit remains unclear. We performed simultaneous recordings from dorsal (CA1d) and ventral (CA1v) hippocampus, retrosplenial cortex (RSC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), and dorsal thalamus in rats across brain states. Theta oscillations dominated hippocampal activity during active behaviour and REM sleep, while delta oscillations prevailed during nREM and quiet waking. Phase synchrony between CA1d and CA1v varied across states, peaking during REM sleep and exhibiting infraslow fluctuations (0.02 Hz) unique to this stage. These slow modulations persisted after controlling for theta power, suggesting a genuine modulation of interregional synchrony. Transitions into REM were marked by rising CA1d-CA1v synchrony and widespread neuronal activation, with thalamic activity most strongly predicting coupling dynamics. During REM sleep, neuronal firing across hippocampal-cortical-thalamic circuits was phase-locked to the infraslow theta coupling cycle, indicating gain modulation at the network level. Such entrainment was strongest and most consistent in REM and aligned near a common phase, revealing temporally structured communication at multiple scales. Our findings identify an infraslow modulation of hippocampal theta coherence that temporally organizes neuronal excitability across brain regions during REM sleep, offering a systems-level mechanism for regulating inter-regional communication during sleep.

">cGAS-mediated IFN-I signaling contributes to disease progression in drug-refractory epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disease with a third of patients becoming non-responsive to antiepileptic drugs and developing drug-refractory epilepsy (DRE). Here we report that DRE disease progression is contributed by overactive cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), a double-stranded DNA sensor that induces type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling. In human DRE microglia, we observe a robust IFN-I signature and the activation of upstream cGAS-STING signaling. Further, in mouse models of Dravet syndrome, a genetic form of DRE, we observe the activation of the cGAS pathway. We show that microglial cGAS can be activated by DNA released from hyperexcitable neurons. Genetic reduction and pharmacological inhibition of cGAS reduces epileptic phenotypes, glial inflammatory signatures, and neuronal transcriptomic changes, underscoring the therapeutic potential of targeting cGAS for DRE treatment.

">Individualized Mapping of Functional Brain Networks in Older Adulthood</a></h4>

              
                The functional network architecture of the aging brain undergoes significant systematic and idiosyncratic changes. Emergent individualized network mapping approaches may yield better or more sensitive explanatory insight about age-related neural and behavioral variability, although most applications have focused on young adults. In the current study, we tested the validity and impact of mapping individual-specific topography in two fMRI datasets comprising 112 young (18-35 years) and 176 older adults (60-92 years). Older adults had more idiosyncratic network topography than young adults. Individualized maps from resting-state fMRI improved network homogeneity and fidelity to task fMRI activations, while also exhibiting intra-individual reliability and inter-individual discriminability over a 2-year interval. Last, traditional group-averaged (vs. individualized) network mapping had a moderate-to-large impact on individual-level estimates of network segregation, a widely-studied measure of functional brain aging. Therefore, individualized network mapping captures important heterogeneity in older adulthood and may yield more precise characterization of neurocognitive aging.

">Cortex-specific inversion of visual responses during sleep</a></h4>

              
                During sleep, we functionally disengage from our external environment. Our eyes close, profoundly reducing visual input to the brain. However, some light passes through the eyelid, and luminance changes are perceived even through closed eyes during wakefulness. Although the relay of sensory information is thought to be gated by the thalamus during sleep, sensory information can still reach the cortex. To elucidate how visual inputs are modulated at each stage of thalamic and cortical processing during sleep, we used simultaneous EEG-fMRI while presenting luminance-modulated visual stimuli to sleeping humans. We discovered that responses to light remained intact in the visual thalamus during N1 and N2 sleep. However, stimulus-evoked responses in early visual cortex were profoundly suppressed, exhibiting an inverted pattern in which high-intensity visual stimulation evoked visual cortical deactivation. These findings suggest a cortical mechanism where inhibitory circuits regulate stimulus-driven deactivation in visual cortex, facilitating sensory isolation during early stages of sleep.

">Choosing the best motion artefact correction: simplified and advanced how-to guides using QT-NIRS</a></h4>

              
                Significance: Selecting the appropriate motion artefact (MA) correction method for functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data is quite challenging, particularly in light of the need for standardised practice, replication, and transparency in the field. A clear framework for making measurable and replicable decisions is therefore essential. Aim: This paper proposes a guide based on an open-source data quality assessment tool (QT-NIRS) that enables a transparent and evidence-driven choice of MA correction method. Approach: We present the guide in two approaches: a simplified version that is easy to run for beginners, and an advanced version providing more informative output at the cost of additional computations and minor changes to the original QT-NIRS code. Due to its high flexibility and within-subject nature, the method is applicable across samples with varied characteristics. Results: We applied the guide to two challenging datasets from 60 British preschoolers (mean age = 3.94 years, SD = 0.49) and 39 South African school children (mean age = 12.00 years, SD = 0.51). Both simplified and advanced approaches supported similar MA correction methods. Conclusions: While both approaches can be used interchangeably, we recommend the advanced approach when possible due to its more informative and straightforward output, and advise caution when using the simplified version.

">Are Synaptic Clefts Directionally Oriented?</a></h4>

              
                Synapses are fundamental building blocks of cortical circuits, yet their geometry is typically regarded as a local property, independent of mesoscale architecture. The prevailing assumption is that synaptic clefts are isotropically oriented in space. Here, this assumption was tested by analyzing approximately 117 million synaptic clefts from two independent 1 mm3 electron microscopy datasets: the human H01 middle temporal gyrus and the mouse MICrONS primary visual cortex. Across both volumes, synaptic cleft orientations are not randomly distributed, but instead show statistically significant and spatially coherent directional biases across cortical layers. This mesoscale anisotropy is conserved across species, yet is stronger and more consistent in human association cortex than in mouse sensory cortex. These findings reveal an unrecognized dimension of cortical microarchitecture and suggest that synaptic geometry contributes to circuit organization, mesoscale connectivity, and interactions with endogenous or externally applied electric fields.

">SELECTIVE ACTIVATION OF GIRK POTASSIUM CHANNELS REDUCES BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN RESPONSES TO ETHANOL IN MICE</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a chronic relapsing condition with limited pharmacological treatments. Ethanol modulates neuronal excitability in part through activation of G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK/Kir3) channels, which dampen neuronal activity in reward- and stress-related circuits implicated in AUD pathophysiology. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of targeting activation of GIRK channels in mouse models of ethanol intoxication. GiGA1 (G protein-independent GIRK activator type 1) is a selective activator of GIRK1/GIRK2 channels and has good brain bioavailability. Systemic GiGA1 administration prevented acquisition of ethanol-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in both male and female mice. GiGA1 also significantly reduced voluntary ethanol intake and decreased blood alcohol concentrations, when administered to mice after they developed high preference and consumption of ethanol. Similarly, Baclofen, a GABAB receptor agonist that leads to activation of GIRK channels also decreased ethanol consumption. However, systemic Baclofen did not prevent acquisition of ethanol-dependent CPP, suggesting a broader efficacy of direct GIRK1/GIRK2 activation by GiGA1. Whole-brain c-Fos mapping as a proxy for neuronal activity revealed that GiGA1 blunted ethanol-induced neuronal activation in several AUD-relevant brain regions, including the central amygdala, paraventricular thalamus, paraventricular hypothalamus, and Edinger-Westphal nucleus. These findings demonstrate that pharmacological activation of GIRK channels modulates key neural circuits involved in ethanol reward and intake, supporting GiGA1 as a promising lead compound for targeted AUD therapy.

">Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor acts through calcium-permeable AMPA receptors to potentiate cocaine reward</a></h4>

              
                Neuroimmune interactions have emerged as critical modulators of substance use disorders and may represent promising translational therapeutic targets. In prior work, we demonstrated that the cytokine granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is elevated in mice following cocaine exposure, with circulating levels correlating with cocaine intake and locomotor sensitization. Additionally, exogenous G-CSF enhances cocaine reward and increases low-dose cocaine self-administration. We have further shown that repeated G-CSF administration alters expression of glutamatergic synapse-associated proteins following cocaine-seeking behavior. Building on these findings, the present studies examined the molecular consequences of repeated administration of G-CSF, cocaine, or their combination, with a focus on glutamatergic signaling pathways. We also tested whether altered glutamate receptor expression contributes to G-CSF-mediated enhancement of cocaine reward. Repeated combined administration of G-CSF and cocaine produced robust changes in glutamate-associated and synapse-related protein expression within the nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex. These molecular adaptations were accompanied by increased synaptic density in the nucleus accumbens. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors within the nucleus accumbens reversed the G-CSF-induced enhancement of cocaine conditioned place preference. Together, these findings indicate that G-CSF enhances cocaine reward at least in part by promoting glutamatergic synaptic remodeling in the nucleus accumbens, identifying a neuroimmune-glutamate mechanism that may be leveraged for therapeutic intervention.

">Innate development of cognitive functions and motor programs by chemoaffinity</a></h4>

              
                Humans and animals are equipped with a rich innate repertoire of cognitive and behavioral skills. Yet, the developmental programs that establish the underlying neural structures are unknown. During early development, neural connectivity is shaped by molecular axon guidance and cell adhesion programs that connect neurons based on the affinity between presynaptic receptors and postsynaptic ligands. Here, we show how such chemoaffinity-based connectivity rules can also establish innate cognitive functions and motor programs by structuring recurrent neuronal networks prior to experience. Different networks develop depending on the statistics of receptor and ligand expression. We illustrate this mechanism in computational models of chemoaffinity-based development that establish i) continuous attractor networks for path integration with a toroidal grid cell topology, ii) networks with an exponentially large number of discrete attractors and sequences as categorical, hierarchical, or temporal priors, and iii) networks for arbitrary innate motor trajectories. Hence, chemoaffinity may shape not only the anatomical organization of the brain but also its innate cognitive and motor functions.

">Systemic and Local Delivery of siRNA to the CNS and Periphery via Anti-IGF1R Antibody Conjugation</a></h4>

              
                siRNA delivery platforms capable of accessing both central and peripheral tissues are critically needed to expand the therapeutic potential of oligonucleotides. To address this, we developed a novel siRNA-antibody conjugate by attaching an Hprt-targeting siRNA to an engineered antibody shuttle. This shuttle targets the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) using a fused antibody fragment (Clone F) and utilizes an antibody backbone with no tissue-relevant binding in this study. The resulting conjugate, designated Clone F-Hprt, demonstrated robust in vivo knockdown across multiple tissues. Clone F-Hprt demonstrated enhanced penetration into central nervous system (CNS) tissues compared to unconjugated siRNA following intracerebroventricular (ICV) and intravenous (IV) administration. In peripheral tissues, Clone F-Hprt achieved widespread knockdown in muscle, heart, and lung, consistent with IGF1R expression. The conjugate was well tolerated across all routes, including with repeated dosing. Although several receptor-mediated approaches for CNS delivery are progressing to the clinic (e.g., targeting the transferrin receptor), clinical validation remains to be demonstrated. Our findings highlight IGF1R as an alternative receptor capable of supporting delivery across both central and peripheral tissues, offering a complementary strategy for expanding the therapeutic landscape of oligonucleotide delivery.

<p>Our findings demonstrate that the human nodose ganglion expresses <i>Glp1r</i> mRNA and reveal species similarities and differences in <i>Glp1r</i> expression between humans and mice.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Given the rapidly expanding clinical use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) agonists—well-known for their antidiabetic and antiobesity effects—it is increasingly important to understand the precise distribution of GLP1R expression in the human body, as this knowledge is crucial for elucidating both their therapeutic effects and side effects. In this study, we investigated <i>Glp1r</i> mRNA expression in the human nodose ganglion, a key sensory relay between the periphery and the brain. We analyzed postmortem paraffin-embedded nodose ganglia sections from 10 human donors, using RNAscope analysis. We found that optimal tissue required fixation times under 48 h and postmortem intervals of approximately 10 h or less. Ultimately, nine nodose ganglia from six donors met quality standards for analysis. Using multiplex RNAscope, we detected moderate to high levels of <i>Glp1r</i> expression in approximately 7% of all nodose neurons, with no clear differences between sides, sex, or age. The proportion of neurons with low <i>Glp1r</i> expression rose to nearly 28%. Notably, <i>Glp1r</i> expression was also observed in nonneuronal cells within the perineurium, epineurium, and fascicles of the human vagus nerve. As a point of comparison, we also examined <i>Glp1r</i> expression in mice, where 17.9%–29.1% of nodose neurons were positive, with slightly higher expression on the right side. In mice, <i>Glp1r</i> expression was strictly neuronal. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the human nodose ganglion is a potential target for GLP1R-based therapeutics and reveal species similarities and differences in <i>Glp1r</i> expression between humans and mice.</p>

<p>Axons expressing the adrenaline-synthesizing enzyme, phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT), project widely throughout the spinal cord. Many of these axons are from C1 neurons of the rostral ventrolateral medulla. We confirm that dense arrays of PNMT-expressing, C1-derived axons surround thoracolumbar sympathetic preganglionic neurons, many of which are putative vasomotor neurons. The C1/PNMT axons are also more widespread, innervating sacral preganglionic neurons activated by the micturition reflex and, very sparsely, somatic motor neurons in the ventral horn.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>We examined the distribution of axons throughout the spinal cord of the rat that were either immunoreactive for the adrenaline-synthesizing enzyme, phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT), or derived from medullary C1 neurons, one of the three groups of neurons in the brain that synthesize PNMT. We observed that PMNT-immunoreactive axons, as well as C1 axons labelled with GFP from viral transduction, innervate most, but not all, sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the thoracolumbar spinal cord. GFP-positive C1 axons provided innervation to sympathetic preganglionic neurons that expressed cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript, an accepted marker of sympathetic vasomotor neurons. In addition, we observed axons from PNMT-containing and C1 neurons caudal to the distribution of sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the sacral spinal cord where they closely apposed parasympathetic preganglionic neurons retrogradely labelled from the major pelvic ganglion. We also found close appositions from PNMT-immunoreactive or GFP-labelled C1 axons on choline acetyltransferase-stained parasympathetic preganglionic neurons activated by the micturition reflex, thus providing clear evidence of a non-cardiovascular target for RVLM C1 neurons. Furthermore, we observed a few PNMT-positive and GFP-positive C1 axons making close appositions with somatic motor neurons in Onuf's nucleus in the sacral cord and in the ventral horn at more rostral levels. These data provide a comprehensive map of the distribution of adrenergic inputs to the spinal cord and identify parasympathetic preganglionic neurons, including those involved in the micturition reflex, as well as sympathetic preganglionic neurons as the major targets for these inputs.</p>

                Background Sensorineural hearing loss in children, when associated with specific risk factors, can negatively affect language development, which in turn impacts their quality of life as well as their family and social environment. Objective To determine the association between risk factors for severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss and auditory performance in post–cochlear implant patients at Instituto Nacional de Salud del Niño, San Borja, during the period from 2021 to 2024. Methods An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted. Data collection was performed through a review of medical records; information was obtained from children treated between 2021 and 2024, including sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of post–cochlear implant patients. Auditory performance was assessed using the PEACH test. Results Medical records from 100 children who underwent cochlear implant surgery were reviewed. Preterm children showed poorer auditory performance (52.8%) compared with those born at term (70.5%). Children with low birth weight recorded a PEACH score of 51.4%, whereas those with normal birth weight reached higher values (71.8%). Additionally, children implanted before their first year of life presented a lower rate of suboptimal performance (40%), while those implanted after the age of three reached 56.5% performance. Analysis of risk factors associated with auditory outcomes revealed that prematurity, low birth weight, severe asphyxia, and hydrocephalus were significantly associated with poorer auditory performance. Conclusions There is a significant association between risk factors and reduced auditory performance in children with sensorineural hearing loss who underwent cochlear implant surgery, particularly among those born prematurely, with low birth weight, severe asphyxia, or hydrocephalus.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-384/v4?src=rss">Integrated water quality assessment and health risk analysis of heavy metal and microbial contamination in the Ichu River, Peru [version 4; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background The Ichu River serves as the primary water source for urban consumption, agricultural irrigation, and several local industrial operations in the Huancavelica region; however, increasing anthropogenic pressures including untreated municipal wastewater, mining effluents, agricultural runoff, and expanding urbanization have significantly deteriorated its water quality. These combined stressors highlight the need for an integrated assessment to understand the extent of contamination and associated human health risks. Methods The investigation measured water quality and health-related risks by analyzing physicochemical parameters, heavy metals, and microbial pollutants at eight sampling points, site 1 (S1) through (S8). Results The research data showed that water quality worsened progressively from upstream to downstream locations such as turbidity, TDS, conductivity, and BOD levels increased. Oil pollution and oxygen depletion arose from a reduction in dissolved oxygen from 6.3 to 4.5 mg/L at the different sampling sites (S1 to S8). Heavy metals (As, Pb, Cd, and Cr) in the samples exceeded the standards established by the World Health Organization (WHO) established standards because of mining and industrial wastewater and local wastewater discharge. The presence of excessive Escherichia coli (E. coli) and total coliforms in microbial tests proved that the water was severely contaminated by fecal matter. Principal Component Analysis showed that heavy metals exist with microbial pollution and organic load as the main sources of water quality decline, and pollution indicators were found to establish powerful relationships with depleted oxygen levels. Conclusion The severe contamination risks found in this study justify immediate pollution control measures, wastewater treatment enforcement, and sustainable watershed management practices. Urgent action is necessary because vital parameters surpass the standards set by the WHO and (United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to avoid enduring environmental damage and health problems. This research demonstrates the value of continuing water quality assessments while enforcing policies and raising public awareness to improve the water quality of the Ichu River.

                Background Neglect is the most prevalent manifestation of maltreatment of a child, which can have severe long-term and short-term consequences. The negative consequences of childhood neglect are not just limited to childhood but are found to be related to minor to major emotional issues during adulthood. Methods The study employs a cross-sectional research design to explore the effects of childhood neglect on difficulties in emotional regulation and a preference for solitude among young adults, using path analysis. Using the purposive sampling method, 209 young adults aged 19 to 30 years were selected. The Multidimensional Neglectful Behaviour Scale Form A, which measures neglect of physical needs (PN), supervisory needs (SN), cognitive needs (CN), and emotional needs (EN), as well as the Preference for Solitude scale and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale-Short Form I, were utilised for data collection. Result Path analysis revealed a significant direct effect of experiencing childhood emotional and supervisory neglect on difficulties in emotional regulation among young adults. A preference for solitude was not significantly predicted by childhood neglect or difficulties in emotional regulation. Conclusion The study signifies that the experience of various forms of childhood neglect does not occur in isolation and is not limited to troubled childhood, but can echo into adulthood, resulting in deprived emotional capacities.

                Objective The study aims to explore how the features and components of digital maturity influence the enhancement of e-service quality at Al-Rafidain Bank – Fallujah Branch. Design/Methodology The study employed a descriptive-analytical methodology, utilizing a questionnaire as the primary tool to measure the relationships between variables. Theoretical/Framework This study investigates the impact of digital maturity on e-service quality (reliability, trust, security, responsiveness, ease of invective, data confidentiality, etc.) to find out if Al-Rafidain Bank will be able to serve its customers more efficiently and effectively in the coming years Findings The findings showed a strong correlation and a significant impact of digital maturity on the quality of e-services offered. It was also established that digital maturity explained between 53% and 56% of the service quality variance. The strongest drivers in this regard included technological culture, organizational structures, and visions and perceptions, while the impact of technological tools was weak in the absence of effective implementation. These findings suggest that to achieve superior quality in e-services, having technology available is a prerequisite. However, having technology is not enough; it should be combined with organizational elements, staff empowerment, and a predominant digital vision. Thus, digital maturity is an essential determinant for performance improvement and institutional digital transformation. Conclusions The results showed that Al-Rafidain Bank – Fallujah Branch, Al-Rafidain Bank in the Fallujah branch, maintains a high level of digital maturity, which is a result of advanced technology coupled with quality e-services. The technological culture organization, and digital vision framework uniquely enhance service quality, demonstrating the need to provide all the digital components in order to attain a tangible transformation that is viable and efficient.

                Background Immune dysregulation—particularly involving cytokines and chemokines—contributes to breast cancer progression and metastasis. To compare circulating levels of interleukin-17 (IL-17), interleukin-34 (IL-34), and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) between premenopausal and postmenopausal women with breast cancer and age-matched healthy controls. Methods In this case–control study, 130 women were enrolled: 90 patients with breast cancer (45 premenopausal; 45 postmenopausal) and 40 healthy controls (20 premenopausal; 20 postmenopausal). Serum IL-17, IL-34, and CXCL12 concentrations were quantified by ELISA. Group differences were assessed using independent-samples t-tests. Results Mean serum levels of IL-17, IL-34, and CXCL12 were significantly higher in patients than in controls across both menopausal strata (all p < 0.001). The pattern of elevation was consistent in premenopausal and postmenopausal subgroups, indicating that the observed immune perturbations are not restricted by menopausal status. Conclusions IL-17, IL-34, and CXCL12 are markedly elevated in women with breast cancer irrespective of menopausal state and may serve as accessible immune biomarkers for disease detection and monitoring. Validation in larger, longitudinal cohorts is warranted to evaluate diagnostic performance and potential therapeutic relevance.

                Background Myocardial ischemia is a dynamic, complex process characterized by hyperkalemia, acidosis, and ATP depletion. While these three conditions alter cardiomyocyte electrophysiology, it is difficult to discern how much each one individually contributes to the resulting changes in action potential (AP). In this study, we test whether machine learning can deconvolute these distinct ischemic patterns within a single AP. Methods We developed a multi-target regression model trained on data generated by the Luo-Rudy (1991) computational model of a ventricular cardiomyocyte, simulating a wide range of ischemic conditions. The model was designed to predict two continuous variables: extracellular potassium concentration ([K+]o) and intracellular pH (pHi). Results The model achieved high accuracy on a held-out test set, with mean squared errors (MSE) below 0.25 for [K+]o and below 0.01 for pHi. To further generalize this model, we applied this trained model to a structurally distinct model, the Ten Tusscher (2006) framework. We were able to accurately predict [K+]o and pHi from APs, demonstrating that the learned principles are robust. A feature importance analysis revealed that resting membrane potential (RMP) was the strongest predictor for [K+]o, while action potential duration (APD) is most important for predicting pHi, underscoring these distinct cardiomyocyte electrophysiological patterns Conclusions Our approach can distinguish distinct ischemic drivers and has potential for in silico drug screening and mechanistic analysis.

                <p>by Jian Miao, Dawei Li</p>

Transposable element (TE) variants, the presence or absence of TE sequences such as LINE-1, Alu, SVA, and endogenous retroviruses, are a major source of genomic diversity and play critical roles in human health, evolution, and disease. As interest in TE variants grows, developing related methods and tools for detection has become increasingly important. However, rigorous benchmarking of TE variant detection methods remains limited due to the lack of accurate and scalable TE variant simulation platforms and the absence of reliable ground truth data. Here, we developed TEvarSim, a novel TE variant simulator that generates TE-containing genomic data in multiple formats, including genomes, short- and long-read sequencing data, and VCF files. TEvarSim supports both random and real-world TE insertions and deletions, including variants derived from pangenome graphs. It can rapidly simulate hundreds to thousands of synthetic chromosomes or genomes and model natural variation at the haplotype, individual, and population levels, making it well suited for large-scale studies. In addition, TEvarSim can directly compare simulated VCF files with TEs reported by TE detection tools, streamlining the benchmarking of TE genotyping methods. TEvarSim provides an all-in-one toolkit for simulating, evaluating, and improving TE variant detection, advancing our ability to accurately study TEs in health and disease in various species.

Human brain dynamics are highly unique between individuals: functional neuroimaging studies have recently described functional features that can be used as neural fingerprints. However, the stability of these fingerprints is affected by aging and disease. As such, the stability of brain fingerprints may be a useful metric when studying normal and pathological neurodevelopment. Before examining clinically relevant deviations, the individual stability and variation of neuroimaging features across brain maturation in normally developing children need to be addressed with real clinical data. Here we applied Bayesian reduced-rank regression (BRRR) to extract low-dimensional representations of electroencephalography (EEG) power spectra measured during different non-REM sleep stages (N1 and N2) from 782 normally developing children aged between 6 weeks to 19 years. The representations learned within specific sleep stages successfully separated between subjects and generalized across sleep stages. Fingerprint stability increased with the age of the subjects. Compared to correlation-based fingerprinting methods, the BRRR model performed better, especially in fingerprinting across sleep stages, highlighting the usefulness of dimensionality reduction when the noise and signal of interest are correlated. While further studies are needed to address the possible non-linear maturation effects over developmental periods, our results demonstrate the existence of stable within-session neurofunctional fingerprints in pediatric populations.

The superficial white matter (SWM), immediately beneath the cortical mantle, is thought to play a major role in cortico-cortical connectivity as well as large-scale brain function. Yet, this compartment remains rarely studied due to its complex organization. Our objectives were to develop and disseminate a robust computational framework to study SWM organization based on 3D histology and high-field 7T MRI. Using data from the BigBrain and Ahead 3D histology initiatives, we first interrogated variations in cell staining intensities across different cortical regions and different SWM depths. These findings were then translated to in vivo 7T quantitative myelin-sensitive MRI, including T1 relaxometry (T1 map) and magnetization transfer saturation (MTsat). As indicated by the statistical moments of the SWM intensity profiles, the first 2 mm below the cortico-subcortical boundary were characterized by high structural complexity. We quantified SWM microstructural variation using a nonlinear dimensionality reduction method and examined the relationship of the resulting microstructural gradients with indices of cortical geometry, as well as structural and functional connectivity. Our results showed correlations between SWM microstructural gradients, as well as curvature and cortico-cortical functional connectivity. Our study provides novel insights into the organization of SWM in the human brain and underscores the potential of SWM mapping to advance fundamental and applied neuroscience research.

                <p>by Yu Sang, Jie Ren, Alejandro Aballay</p>

Neurodegenerative diseases are often associated with oxidative stress, and while probiotics may influence neuronal health, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using the <i>sod-1</i> A4V<sup>M</sup> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) model in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, we investigated the protective effects of the probiotic <i>Enterococcus faecium</i> against oxidative stress-induced neurodegeneration. Animals fed <i>E. faecium</i> showed reduced motor neuron degeneration under oxidative stress compared to those maintained on a standard <i>Escherichia coli</i> diet. Transcriptome analysis revealed a significant enrichment of oxidoreductase genes, including cytochrome P450 (<i>cyp</i>) genes. RNAi-mediated knockdown of <i>cyp</i> genes impaired <i>E. faecium</i>-mediated neuroprotection, and this loss correlated with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. We identified the conserved nuclear hormone receptor NHR-86 as a key regulator of <i>cyp</i> gene expression and neuroprotection. Loss of <i>nhr-86</i> abolished the probiotic’s protective benefits, while transgenic expression of <i>nhr-86</i> restored <i>cyp</i> induction and neuronal resilience. Importantly, intestinal expression of NHR-86 was sufficient to restore CYP induction and neuronal resilience, whereas neuronal knockdown had no effect, indicating that gut NHR-86 activity is essential for this protective pathway. These findings reveal a previously uncharacterized NHR-CYP regulatory axis activated by an intestinal probiotic, highlighting a mechanistic link between microbial signals and host neuroprotection.

                <p>by Moohebat Pourmajidian, Justine Y. Hansen, Golia Shafiei, Bratislav Misic, Alain Dagher</p>

Energy metabolism involves a series of biochemical reactions that generate ATP, utilizing substrates such as glucose and oxygen supplied via cerebral blood flow. Energy substrates are metabolized in multiple interrelated pathways that are cell- and organelle-specific. These pathways not only generate energy but are also fundamental to the production of essential biomolecules required for neuronal function and survival. How these complex biochemical processes are spatially distributed across the cortex is integral to understanding the structure and function of the brain. Here, using curated gene sets and whole-brain transcriptomics, we generate maps of five fundamental energy metabolic pathways: glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation and lactate metabolism. We find consistent divergence between primarily energy-producing and anabolic pathways, particularly in unimodal sensory cortices. We then explore the spatial alignment of these maps with multi-scale structural and functional attributes, including metabolic uptake, neurophysiological oscillations, cell type composition, laminar organization and macro-scale connectivity. We find that energy pathways exhibit unique relationships with the cellular and laminar organization of the cortex, pointing to the higher energy demands of large pyramidal cells and efferent projections. Finally, we show that metabolic pathways exhibit distinct developmental trajectories from the fetal stage to adulthood. The primary energy-producing pathways peak in childhood, while the anabolic pentose phosphate pathway shows greater prenatal expression and declines throughout life. Together, these results highlight the rich biochemical complexity of energy metabolism organization in the brain.

                This essay compares how Ngugi wa Thiong’o and Abdulrazak Gurnah, two leading East African writers, represent postcolonial identity and historical trauma through fiction. It examines their contrasting approaches to literary resistance: Ngugi embraces radical language politics and collective cultural reclamation, while Gurnah employs narrative ambiguity, exile experiences, and linguistic hybridity. The analysis reveals how intergenerational trauma operates in their works, with memory functioning as a morally charged force shaping identity and narrative authority. Despite their differences, Ngugi prioritizing political clarity and revolutionary consciousness, Gurnah exploring subtle psychological details and narrative dissonance, both authors demonstrate literature’s ethical power to contest historical erasure and reimagine postcolonial futures with compassion and complexity.

                Background This study examines how voucher systems compare to traditional redistributive policies—such as progressive taxation, subsidies, and public spending—in reducing income inequality. Methods We apply a counterfactual analysis approach, using panel data from twelve countries over 22 years. By employing econometric modelling, we simulate a series of “what-if” scenarios to assess the impact of each policy on the Gini coefficient, a key measure of income inequality. Results The results suggest that voucher systems can be particularly effective at targeting essential services, like education and healthcare, improving access for lower-income groups, and helping to reduce inequality. Public spending on education and healthcare proves to be incredibly potent in narrowing income disparities. These sectors are vital for addressing systemic inequalities, improving overall access and providing long-term benefits to disadvantaged groups. In contrast, progressive taxation and subsidies show mixed effectiveness. While higher tax revenues often correlate with reduced inequality, their impacts vary across countries and contexts. The effectiveness of progressive taxation depends on factors such as the efficiency of tax systems and the political environment, which can influence how well these policies work. Similarly, subsidies generally produce only modest or inconsistent reductions in income gaps, suggesting that while they provide temporary relief, they do not always address the root causes of inequality. Conclusions These findings suggest that well-designed voucher programs, when combined with progressive taxation and strategic public spending, can play a key role in enhancing redistribution efforts. By improving access to essential services and targeting lower-income groups, vouchers have the potential to reduce income inequality. However, achieving equitable economic outcomes requires careful policy design and attention to the broader economic context.
