<p>The NK model has been used widely to explore aspects of natural evolution and
complex systems. This paper introduces a modified form of the NK model for
exploring distributed control in complex systems such as organisations, social
networks, collective robotics, etc. Initial results show how varying the size
and underlying functional structure of a given system affects the performance
of different distributed control structures and decision making, including
within dynamically formed structures and those with differing numbers of
control nodes.

<p>This paper characterizes and discusses devolutionary genetic algorithms and
evaluates their performances in solving the minimum labeling Steiner tree
(MLST) problem. We define devolutionary algorithms as the process of reaching a
feasible solution by devolving a population of super-optimal unfeasible
solutions over time. We claim that distinguishing them from the widely used
evolutionary algorithms is relevant. The most important distinction lies in the
fact that in the former type of processes, the value function decreases over
successive generation of solutions, thus providing a natural stopping condition
for the computation process. We show how classical evolutionary concepts, such
as crossing, mutation and fitness can be adapted to aim at reaching an optimal
or close-to-optimal solution among the first generations of feasible solutions.
We additionally introduce a novel integer linear programming formulation of the
MLST problem and a valid constraint used for speeding up the devolutionary
process. Finally, we conduct an experiment comparing the performances of
devolutionary algorithms to those of state of the art approaches used for
solving randomly generated instances of the MLST problem. Results of this
experiment support the use of devolutionary algorithms for the MLST problem and
their development for other NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems.

<p>Classical benchmark problems utilize multiple transformation techniques to
increase optimization difficulty, e.g., shift for anti centering effect and
rotation for anti dimension sensitivity. Despite testing the transformation
invariance, however, such operations do not really change the landscape's
"shape", but rather than change the "view point". For instance, after rotated,
ill conditional problems are turned around in terms of orientation but still
keep proportional components, which, to some extent, does not create much
obstacle in optimization. In this paper, inspired from image processing, we
investigate a novel graphic conformal mapping transformation on benchmark
problems to deform the function shape. The bending operation does not alter the
function basic properties, e.g., a unimodal function can almost maintain its
unimodality after bent, but can modify the shape of interested area in the
search space. Experiments indicate the same optimizer spends more search budget
and encounter more failures on the conformal bent functions than the rotated
version. Several parameters of the proposed function are also analyzed to
reveal performance sensitivity of the evolutionary algorithms.

<p>Bio-inspired optimization (including Evolutionary Computation and Swarm
Intelligence) is a growing research topic with many competitive bio-inspired
algorithms being proposed every year. In such an active area, preparing a
successful proposal of a new bio-inspired algorithm is not an easy task. Given
the maturity of this research field, proposing a new optimization technique
with innovative elements is no longer enough. Apart from the novelty, results
reported by the authors should be proven to achieve a significant advance over
previous outcomes from the state of the art. Unfortunately, not all new
proposals deal with this requirement properly. Some of them fail to select an
appropriate benchmark or reference algorithms to compare with. In other cases,
the validation process carried out is not defined in a principled way (or is
even not done at all). Consequently, the significance of the results presented
in such studies cannot be guaranteed. In this work we review several
recommendations in the literature and propose methodological guidelines to
prepare a successful proposal, taking all these issues into account. We expect
these guidelines to be useful not only for authors, but also for reviewers and
editors along their assessment of new contributions to the field.

<p>Dynamic linear functions on the hypercube are functions which assign to each
bit a positive weight, but the weights change over time. Throughout
optimization, these functions maintain the same global optimum, and never have
defecting local optima. Nevertheless, it was recently shown [Lengler, Schaller,
FOCI 2019] that the $(1+1)$-Evolutionary Algorithm needs exponential time to
find or approximate the optimum for some algorithm configurations. In this
paper, we study the effect of larger population sizes for Dynamic BinVal, the
extremal form of dynamic linear functions. We find that moderately increased
population sizes extend the range of efficient algorithm configurations, and
that crossover boosts this positive effect substantially. Remarkably, similar
to the static setting of monotone functions in [Lengler, Zou, FOGA 2019], the
hardest region of optimization for $(\mu+1)$-EA is not close the optimum, but
far away from it. In contrast, for the $(\mu+1)$-GA, the region around the
optimum is the hardest region in all studied cases.

<p>The recent spreading of coronavirus made many countries impose restrictions
in order to control its dangerous effect on the citizens. We developed a
theoretical dynamical model based on compartmental SIR system with additional
adjustment taken from Flow network and Markov chain frameworks to illustrate
developments and trends based on publicly available data. Based on this Model,
code in R was written and fed by stamped publicly available data from
authorized governmental websites in Spain and in the Nederlands, to compare
trends. Our results show that the 'peak' of infection is already behind us in
both countries, but also demonstrate that there is a danger of rebound of a
spread. It is obvious that measures imposed are giving the results, but we
should be precarious of near future practices and developments since the
majority of population will still be without immunity.

<p>A multi-modal multi-objective optimization problem is a special kind of
multi-objective optimization problem with multiple Pareto subsets. In this
paper, we propose an efficient multi-modal multi-objective optimization
algorithm based on the widely used MOEA/D algorithm. In our proposed algorithm,
each weight vector has its own sub-population. With a clearing mechanism and a
greedy removal strategy, our proposed algorithm can effectively preserve
equivalent Pareto optimal solutions (i.e., different Pareto optimal solutions
with same objective values). Experimental results show that our proposed
algorithm can effectively preserve the diversity of solutions in the decision
space when handling large-scale multi-modal multi-objective optimization
problems.

<p>Runtime analysis aims at contributing to our understanding of evolutionary
algorithms through mathematical analyses of their runtimes. In the context of
discrete optimization problems, runtime analysis classically studies the time
needed to find an optimal solution. However, both from a practical and a
theoretical viewpoint, more fine-grained performance measures are needed. Two
complementary approaches have been suggested: fixed-budget analysis and
fixed-target analysis.
</p>
<p>In this work, we conduct an in-depth study on the advantages and limitations
of fixed-target analyses. We show that, different from fixed-budget analyses,
many classical methods from the runtime analysis of discrete evolutionary
algorithms yield fixed-target results without greater effort. We use this to
conduct a number of new fixed-target analyses. However, we also point out
examples where an extension of the existing runtime result to a fixed-target
result is highly non-trivial.

<p>We consider the expected runtime of non-elitist evolutionary algorithms
(EAs), when they are applied to a family of fitness functions with a plateau of
second-best fitness in a Hamming ball of radius r around a unique global
optimum. On one hand, using the level-based theorems, we obtain polynomial
upper bounds on the expected runtime for some modes of non-elitist EA based on
unbiased mutation and the bitwise mutation in particular. On the other hand, we
show that the EA with fitness proportionate selection is inefficient if the
bitwise mutation is used with the standard settings of mutation probability.

well-aligned with the underlying chemical hardware and do not attempt to
shoehorn ill-fitting electronics paradigms. We discover a surprisingly tight
connection between a popular class of neural networks (Binary-weight ReLU aka
BinaryConnect) and a class of coupled chemical reactions that are absolutely
robust to reaction rates. The robustness of rate-independent chemical
computation makes it a promising target for bioengineering implementation. We
show how a BinaryConnect neural network trained in silico using well-founded
deep learning optimization techniques, can be compiled to an equivalent
chemical reaction network, providing a novel molecular programming paradigm. We
illustrate such translation on the paradigmatic IRIS and MNIST datasets. Toward
intended applications of chemical computation, we further use our method to
generate a CRN that can discriminate between different virus types based on
gene expression levels. Our work sets the stage for rich knowledge transfer
between neural network and molecular programming communities.

<p>Binary neural networks improve computationally efficiency of deep models with
a large margin. However, there is still a performance gap between a successful
full-precision training and binary training. We bring some insights about why
this accuracy drop exists and call for a better understanding of binary network
geometry. We start with analyzing full-precision neural networks with ReLU
activation and compare it with its binarized version. This comparison suggests
to initialize networks with random bias, a counter-intuitive remedy.

<p>Robotic vision is a field where continual learning can play a significant
role. An embodied agent operating in a complex environment subject to frequent
and unpredictable changes is required to learn and adapt continuously. In the
context of object recognition, for example, a robot should be able to learn
(without forgetting) objects of never before seen classes as well as improving
its recognition capabilities as new instances of already known classes are
discovered. Ideally, continual learning should be triggered by the availability
of short videos of single objects and performed on-line on on-board hardware
with fine-grained updates. In this paper, we introduce a novel continual
learning protocol based on the CORe50 benchmark and propose two rehearsal-free
continual learning techniques, CWR* and AR1*, that can learn effectively even
in the challenging case of nearly 400 small non-i.i.d. incremental batches. In
particular, our experiments show that AR1* can outperform other
state-of-the-art rehearsal-free techniques by more than 15% accuracy in some
cases, with a very light and constant computational and memory overhead across
training batches.

Background and Purpose<p>Chronic inflammation is involved in the formation and enlargement of cerebral aneurysms (CAs), with macrophages playing a key role in the process. The present study evaluated visualization of macrophages present in CAs using an activatable fluorescent probe (IONP-ICG) comprising an iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) conjugated with indocyanine green (ICG).</p>Methods<p>IONP-ICG was intravenously administered to 15-week-old CA model rats (n = 8), and ex vivo near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging and histological assessment of exposed CAs and cerebral arteries were performed 48 h later. Similar evaluations were performed in the control group, which included CA model rats given IONPs or ICG (n = 8 each).</p>Results<p>ICG-derived NIRF signals were detected in three IONP-ICG group rats but not in IONP or ICG control groups. Among the three rats that exhibited signals, NIRF signal accumulation was observed in the CA of two rats and at the site of hemodynamic stress in the left posterior cerebral artery in one rat. Histologically, NIRF signals correlated strongly with macrophage localization. A total of 13 CAs formed in the IONP-ICG group. The number of macrophages in the CA wall was significantly greater in the two CAs that exhibited NIRF signals compared to the remaining 11 CAs that did not (P = 0.037). Moreover, all 11 CAs that did not exhibit NIRF signals were iron-negative, while the two CAs that exhibited NIRF signals were both iron-positive (P = 0.013).</p>Conclusion<p>NIRF imaging using an activatable IONP-ICG probe is feasible for detecting the macrophage-rich regions in CAs and the cerebral artery wall, which is considered an early lesion in the process of CA formation.</p>

<p>It is a commonplace that some people may adopt a controlling style, which brings about autonomy frustration to others. Existing studies on autonomy frustration mainly examined its effect in the primary thwarting context, ignoring its potential spillover to subsequent activities. In this study, we examined whether prior autonomy frustration would have a sustaining negative impact on one’s motivation in another autonomy-supportive activity that follows. In this electrophysiological study, participants worked on two irrelevant tasks organized by two different experimenters. We adopted a between-group design and manipulated participants’ autonomy frustration by providing varied audio instructions during Session 1. In Session 2, all participants were instructed to complete a moderately difficult task that is autonomy-supportive instead, and we observed a less pronounced reward positivity (RewP) difference wave and a smaller P300 in the autonomy-frustration group compared with the control group. These findings suggested that the negative influence of autonomy frustration is longstanding and that it can undermine one’s motivation and attention in a following activity that is autonomy-supportive itself. Thus, our findings provided original neutral evidence for the adverse intertemporal effect of autonomy frustration, and suggested important practical implications.</p>

<p>Spatio-temporal brain activities with variable delay detectable in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) give rise to highly reproducible structures, termed cortical lag threads, that propagate from one brain region to another. Using a computational topology of data approach, we found that persistent, recurring blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals in triangulated rs-fMRI videoframes display previously undetected topological findings, i.e., vortex structures that cover brain activated regions. Measure of persistence of vortex shapes in BOLD signal propagation is carried out in terms of Betti numbers that rise and fall over time during spontaneous activity of the brain. Importantly, a topology of data given in terms of geometric shapes of BOLD signal propagation offers a practical approach in coping with and sidestepping massive noise in neurodata, such as unwanted dark (low intensity) regions in the neighborhood of non-zero BOLD signals. Our findings have been codified and visualized in plots able to track the non-trivial BOLD signals that appear intermittently in a sequence of rs-fMRI videoframes. The end result of this tracking of changing lag structures is a so-called persistent barcode, which is a pictograph that offers a convenient visual means of exhibiting, comparing, and classifying brain activation patterns.</p>

<p>This paper offers a prospectus of what might be achievable in the development of emotional recognition devices. It provides a conceptual overview of the free energy principle; including Markov blankets, active inference, and—in particular—a discussion of selfhood and theory of mind, followed by a brief explanation of how these concepts can explain both neural and cultural models of emotional inference. The underlying hypothesis is that emotion recognition and inference devices will evolve from state-of-the-art deep learning models into active inference schemes that go beyond marketing applications and become adjunct to psychiatric practice. Specifically, this paper proposes that a second wave of emotion recognition devices will be equipped with an emotional lexicon (or the ability to epistemically search for one), allowing the device to resolve uncertainty about emotional states by actively eliciting responses from the user and learning from these responses. Following this, a third wave of emotional devices will converge upon the user's generative model, resulting in the machine and human engaging in a reciprocal, prosocial emotional interaction, i.e., sharing a generative model of emotional states.</p>

<p>The Subthalamic Nucleus (STh) is an oval-shaped diencephalic structure located ventrally to the thalamus, playing a fundamental role in the circuitry of the basal ganglia. In addition to being involved in the pathophysiology of several neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntington’s and Parkinson’s disease, the STh is one of the target nuclei for deep brain stimulation. However, most of the anatomical evidence available derives from non-human primate studies. In this review, we will present the topographical and morphological organization of the nucleus and its connections to structurally and functionally related regions of the basal ganglia circuitry. We will also highlight the importance of additional research in humans focused on validating STh connectivity, cytoarchitectural organization, and its functional subdivision.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54445">Nodal and Planar Cell Polarity signaling cooperate to regulate zebrafish convergence and extension gastrulation movements</a></h4>

During vertebrate gastrulation, convergence &amp; extension (C&amp;E) of the primary anteroposterior (AP) embryonic axis is driven by polarized mediolateral (ML) cell intercalations and is influenced by AP axial patterning. Nodal signaling is essential for patterning of the AP axis while Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) signaling polarizes cells with respect to this axis, but how these two signaling systems interact during C&amp;E is unclear. We find that the neuroectoderm of Nodal-deficient zebrafish gastrulae exhibits reduced C&amp;E cell behaviors, which require Nodal signaling in both cell- and non-autonomous fashions. PCP signaling is partially active in Nodal-deficient embryos and its inhibition exacerbates their C&amp;E defects. Within otherwise naïve zebrafish blastoderm explants, however, Nodal induces C&amp;E in a largely PCP-dependent manner, arguing that Nodal acts both upstream of and in parallel with PCP during gastrulation to cooperatively regulate embryonic axis extension.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54183">Spatiotemporally precise optogenetic activation of sensory neurons in freely walking <i>Drosophila</i></a></h4>

Previous work has characterized how walking <i>Drosophila</i> coordinate the movements of individual limbs (DeAngelis, Zavatone-Veth, and Clark, 2019). To understand the circuit basis of this coordination, one must characterize how sensory feedback from each limb affects walking behavior. However, it has remained difficult to manipulate neural activity in individual limbs of freely moving animals. Here, we demonstrate a simple method for optogenetic stimulation with body side-, body segment-, and limb-specificity that does not require real-time tracking. Instead, we activate at random, precise locations in time and space and use post hoc analysis to determine behavioral responses to specific activations. Using this method, we have characterized limb coordination and walking behavior in response to transient activation of mechanosensitive bristle neurons and sweet-sensing chemoreceptor neurons. Our findings reveal that activating these neurons has opposite effects on turning, and that activations in different limbs and body regions produce distinct behaviors.

The growth of the malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> in human blood causes all the symptoms of malaria. To proliferate, non-motile parasites must have access to susceptible red blood cells, which they invade using pairs of parasite ligands and host receptors that define invasion pathways. Parasites can switch invasion pathways, and while this flexibility is thought to facilitate immune evasion, it may also reflect the heterogeneity of red blood cell surfaces within and between hosts. Host genetic background affects red blood cell structure, for example, and red blood cells also undergo dramatic changes in morphology and receptor density as they age. The <i>in vivo</i> consequences of both the accessibility of susceptible cells, and their heterogeneous susceptibility, remain unclear. Here, we measured invasion of laboratory strains of <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum</i> relying on distinct invasion pathways into red blood cells of different ages. We estimated invasion efficiency while accounting for red blood cell accessibility to parasites. This approach revealed different tradeoffs made by parasite strains between the fraction of cells they can invade and their invasion rate into them, and we distinguish “specialist” strains from “generalist” strains in this context. We developed a mathematical model to show that generalist strains would lead to higher peak parasitemias <i>in vivo</i> compared to specialist strains with similar overall proliferation rates. Thus, the ecology of red blood cells may play a key role in determining the rate of <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum</i> parasite proliferation and malaria virulence.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EkcZZAKB4Vg" width="1" />

<p>by Juhwan Lee, Mooseok Kang, Sangyeol Kim, Iksoo Chang</p>

Understanding the gating mechanism of ion channel proteins is key to understanding the regulation of cell signaling through these channels. Channel opening and closing are regulated by diverse environmental factors that include temperature, electrical voltage across the channel, and proton concentration. Low permeability in voltage-gated potassium ion channels (Kv) is intimately correlated with the prolonged action potential duration observed in many acidosis diseases. The Kv channels consist of voltage-sensing domains (S1–S4 helices) and central pore domains (S5–S6 helices) that include a selectivity filter and water-filled cavity. The voltage-sensing domain is responsible for the voltage-gating of Kv channels. While the low permeability of Kv channels to potassium ion is highly correlated with the cellular proton concentration, it is unclear how an intracellular acidic condition drives their closure, which may indicate an additional pH-dependent gating mechanism of the Kv family. Here, we show that two residues E327 and H418 in the proximity of the water cavity of Kv1.2 play crucial roles as a pH switch. In addition, we present a structural and molecular concept of the pH-dependent gating of Kv1.2 in atomic detail, showing that the protonation of E327 and H418 disrupts the electrostatic balance around the S6 helices, which leads to a straightening transition in the shape of their axes and causes dewetting of the water-filled cavity and closure of the channel. Our work offers a conceptual advancement to the regulation of the pH-dependent gating of various voltage-gated ion channels and their related biological functions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5aEdI3jnfI8" width="1" />

<p>by Jeremy J. Grubbs, Lindsey E. Lopes, Alexander M. van der Linden, David M. Raizen</p>

Many lines of evidence point to links between sleep regulation and energy homeostasis, but mechanisms underlying these connections are unknown. During <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> sleep, energetic stores are allocated to nonneural tasks with a resultant drop in the overall fat stores and energy charge. Mutants lacking KIN-29, the <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> homolog of a mammalian Salt-Inducible Kinase (SIK) that signals sleep pressure, have low ATP levels despite high-fat stores, indicating a defective response to cellular energy deficits. Liberating energy stores corrects adiposity and sleep defects of <i>kin-29</i> mutants. <i>kin-29</i> sleep and energy homeostasis roles map to a set of sensory neurons that act upstream of fat regulation as well as of central sleep-controlling neurons, suggesting hierarchical somatic/neural interactions regulating sleep and energy homeostasis. Genetic interaction between <i>kin-29</i> and the histone deacetylase <i>hda-4</i> coupled with subcellular localization studies indicate that KIN-29 acts in the nucleus to regulate sleep. We propose that KIN-29/SIK acts in nuclei of sensory neuroendocrine cells to transduce low cellular energy charge into the mobilization of energy stores, which in turn promotes sleep.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/WJY3KcJFlug" width="1" />

<p>Synodontid catfishes use an Elastic Spring Apparatus, including protractor muscles, to produce electric discharges or sounds. Anatomical characterization, together with motoneuron patch‐clamp recordings and protractor muscle EMGs suggest that adaptive changes in peripheral and central characters underlie the transition from an ancestral sound to a derived electric discharge producing system.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>To what extent do modifications in the nervous system and peripheral effectors contribute to novel behaviors? Using a combination of morphometric analysis, neuroanatomical tract‐tracing, and intracellular neuronal recording, we address this question in a sound‐producing and a weakly electric species of synodontid catfish, <i>Synodontis grandiops</i>, and <i>Synodontis nigriventris</i>, respectively. The same peripheral mechanism, a bilateral pair of protractor muscles associated with vertebral processes (elastic spring mechanism), is involved in both signaling systems. Although there were dramatic species differences in several morphometric measures, electromyograms provided strong evidence that simultaneous activation of paired protractor muscles accounts for an individual sound and electric discharge pulse. While the general architecture of the neural network and the intrinsic properties of the motoneuron population driving each target was largely similar, differences could contribute to species‐specific patterns in electromyograms and the associated pulse repetition rate of sounds and electric discharges. Together, the results suggest that adaptive changes in both peripheral and central characters underlie the transition from an ancestral sound to a derived electric discharge producing system, and thus the evolution of a novel communication channel among synodontid catfish. Similarities with characters in other sonic and weakly electric teleost fish provide a striking example of convergent evolution in functional adaptations underlying the evolution of the two signaling systems among distantly related taxa.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To evaluate disease symptoms, clinical and MRI findings and to perform longitudinal volumetric MRI analyses in a European multi‐center cohort of pediatric anti‐NMDAR encephalitis (NMDARE) patients.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied 38 children with NMDARE (median age 12.9years, range:1‐18) and a total of 82 MRI scans for volumetric MRI analyses compared to matched healthy controls. Mixed‐effect models and brain volume z‐scores were applied to estimate longitudinal brain volume development. Ordinal logistic regression and ordinal mixed models were used to predict disease outcome and severity.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Initial MRI scans showed abnormal findings in 15/38(39.5%) patients, mostly white matter T2/FLAIR hyperintensities. Volumetric MRI analyses revealed reductions of whole brain, grey matter as well as hippocampal and basal ganglia volumes in NMDARE children. Longitudinal mixed‐effect models and z‐score transformation showed failure of age‐expected brain growth in patients. Importantly, patients with abnormal MRI findings at onset were more likely to have poor outcome (PCPC score&gt;1, incidence rate ratio (IIR)[95%CI]: 3.50[1.31‐9.31], p=0.012) compared to patients with normal MRI. Ordinal logistic regression models corrected for time from onset confirmed abnormal MRI at onset OR[95%CI]: 9.90[2.51, 17.28]; p=0.009), a presentation with sensorimotor deficits (13.71[2.68, 24.73]; p=0.015), and a treatment delay &gt;4 weeks (5.15[0.47, 9.82]; p=0.031) as independent predictors of poor clinical outcome.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Children with NMDARE exhibit significant brain volume loss and failure of age‐expected brain growth. Abnormal MRI findings, a clinical presentation with sensorimotor deficits, and a treatment delay &gt;4 weeks are associated with worse clinical outcome. These characteristics represent promising prognostic biomarkers in pediatric NMDARE.</p>

Abstract
<p>Serial section electron microscopy (ssEM), a technique where volumes of tissue can be anatomically reconstructed by imaging consecutive tissue slices, has proven to be a powerful tool for the investigation of brain anatomy. Between the process of cutting the slices, or "sections," and imaging them, however, handling 10°–10<sup>6</sup> delicate sections remains a bottleneck in ssEM, especially for batches in the "mesoscale" regime, i.e., 10<sup>2</sup>–10<sup>3</sup> sections. We present a tissue section handling device that transports and positions sections, accurately and repeatability, for automated, robotic section pick-up and placement onto an imaging substrate. The device interfaces with a conventional ultramicrotomy diamond knife, accomplishing in-line, exact-constraint trapping of sections with 100-μm repeatability. An associated mathematical model includes capillary-based and Stokes-based forces, accurately describing observed behavior and fundamentally extends the modeling of water-air interface forces. Using the device, we demonstrate and describe the limits of reliable handling of hundreds of slices onto a variety of electron and light microscopy substrates without significant defects (<i>n</i> = 8 datasets composed of 126 serial sections in an automated fashion with an average loss rate and throughput of 0.50% and 63 s/section, respectively. In total, this work represents an automated mesoscale serial sectioning system for scalable 3D-EM connectomics.</p>

Abstract
<p>Neuroplasticity forms the basis for neuronal circuit complexity and differences between otherwise similar circuits. We show that the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (<i>Mitf</i>) plays a central role in intrinsic plasticity of olfactory bulb (OB) projection neurons. Mitral and tufted (M/T) neurons from <i>Mitf</i> mutant mice are hyperexcitable, have a reduced A-type potassium current (I<sub>A</sub>) and exhibit reduced expression of <i>Kcnd3</i>, which encodes a potassium voltage-gated channel subunit (Kv4.3) important for generating the I<sub>A</sub>. Furthermore, expression of the <i>Mitf</i> and <i>Kcnd3</i> genes is activity dependent in OB projection neurons and the MITF protein activates expression from <i>Kcnd3</i> regulatory elements. Moreover, <i>Mitf</i> mutant mice have changes in olfactory habituation and have increased habituation for an odorant following long-term exposure, indicating that regulation of <i>Kcnd3</i> is pivotal for long-term olfactory adaptation. Our findings show that <i>Mitf</i> acts as a direct regulator of intrinsic homeostatic feedback and links neuronal activity, transcriptional changes and neuronal function.</p>

Polyploidy, which results from whole genome duplication (WGD), has shaped the long-term evolution of eukaryotic genomes in all kingdoms. Polyploidy is also implicated in adaptation, domestication, and speciation. Yet when WGD newly occurs, the resulting neopolyploids face numerous challenges. A particularly pernicious problem is the segregation of multiple chromosome copies...<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/Ai1Ra8dEutg" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Dominant optic atrophy (DOA) is the most common inherited optic neuropathy, with a prevalence of 1:12,000 to 1:25,000. <i>OPA1</i> mutations are found in 70% of DOA patients, with a significant number remaining undiagnosed.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We screened 286 index cases presenting optic atrophy, negative for <i>OPA1</i> mutations, by targeted next generation sequencing or whole exome sequencing. Pathogenicity and molecular mechanisms of the identified variants were studied in yeast and patient‐derived fibroblasts.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Twelve cases (4%) were found to carry novel variants in <i>AFG3L2,</i> a gene that has been associated with autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia 28 (SCA28). Half of cases were familial with a dominant inheritance, whereas the others were sporadic, including <i>de novo</i> mutations. Biallelic mutations were found in 3 probands with severe syndromic optic neuropathy, acting as recessive or phenotype‐modifier variants. All the DOA‐associated <i>AFG3L2</i> mutations were clustered in the ATPase domain, whereas SCA28‐associated mutations mostly affect the proteolytic domain. The pathogenic role of DOA‐associated <i>AFG3L2</i> mutations was confirmed in yeast, unraveling a mechanism distinct from that of SCA28‐associated <i>AFG3L2</i> mutations. Patients' fibroblasts showed abnormal OPA1 processing, with accumulation of the fission‐inducing short forms leading to mitochondrial network fragmentation, not observed in SCA28 patients' cells.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study demonstrates that mutations in <i>AFG3L2</i> are a relevant cause of optic neuropathy, broadening the spectrum of clinical manifestations and genetic mechanisms associated with <i>AFG3L2</i> mutations, and underscores the pivotal role of OPA1 and its processing in the pathogenesis of DOA.

<p>In this paper, we aim to integrate findings from the fields of machine
learning and network science to argue that organisms can be modeled as
hierarchical Bayesian control systems with small world and bottleneck (bow tie)
network structure. The nested hierarchical organization of such networks allows
organisms to form increasingly integrated percepts and concepts of their inner
and outer context, which can be compared to increasingly encompassing
predictive models of the world (goal states), to allow for an optimal control
of actions. We argue that hierarchical Bayesian inference produces a hierarchy
of goal states, from which it follows that organisms must have some form of
`highest goals'. For all organisms, these predictive models involve interior
(self) models, exterior (social) models and overarching (normative) models. We
show how such goals are constructed from progressively lesser goal states and
that goal hierarchies tend to decompose in a top-down manner under severe and
prolonged levels of stress. This loss of high-level control leads to a
disinhibition of subordinate hierarchical levels, producing `critical' behavior
and tipping points (a sudden loss of homeostasis). Such phase transitions
amount either to disease or the death of the organism. This model can be used
to model organisms of any type, including humans. In humans, learning
higher-level world models corresponds to personality development. A top-down
collapse of high-level integrative goal states under stress is identified as a
common factor in all forms of mental disease (psychopathology). The paper
concludes by discussing ways of testing these hypotheses empirically.

<p>With the rise of machines to human-level performance in complex recognition
tasks, a growing amount of work is directed towards comparing information
processing in humans and machines. These works have the potential to deepen our
understanding of the inner mechanisms of human perception and to improve
machine learning. Drawing robust conclusions from comparison studies, however,
turns out to be difficult. Here, we highlight common shortcomings that can
easily lead to fragile conclusions. First, if a model does achieve high
performance on a task similar to humans, its decision-making process is not
necessarily human-like. Moreover, further analyses can reveal differences.
Second, the performance of neural networks is sensitive to training procedures
and architectural details. Thus, generalizing conclusions from specific
architectures is difficult. Finally, when comparing humans and machines,
equivalent experimental settings are crucial in order to identify innate
differences. Addressing these shortcomings alters or refines the conclusions of
studies. We show that, despite their ability to solve closed-contour tasks, our
neural networks use different decision-making strategies than humans. We
further show that there is no fundamental difference between same-different and
spatial tasks for common feed-forward neural networks and finally, that neural
networks do experience a "recognition gap" on minimal recognizable images. All
in all, care has to be taken to not impose our human systematic bias when
comparing human and machine perception.

<p>The Dendritic Cell Algorithm (DCA) as one of the emerging evolutionary
algorithms is based on the behavior of the specific immune agents; known as
Dendritic Cells (DCs). DCA has several potentially beneficial features for
binary classification problems. In this paper, we aim at providing a new
version of this immune-inspired mechanism acts as a semi-supervised classifier
which can be a defensive shield in network intrusion detection problem. Till
now, no strategy or idea has already been adopted on the GetAntigen() function
on detection phase, but randomly sampling entails the DCA to provide
undesirable results in several cycles in each time. This leads to uncertainty.
Whereas it must be accomplished by biological behaviors of DCs in tissues, we
have proposed a novel strategy which exactly acts based on its immunological
functionalities of dendritic cells. The proposed mechanism focuses on two
items: First, to obviate the challenge of needing to have a preordered antigen
set for computing danger signal, and the second, to provide a novel
immune-inspired idea in order to non-random data sampling. A variable
functional migration threshold is also computed cycle by cycle that shows
necessity of the Migration threshold (MT) flexibility. A significant criterion
so called capability of intrusion detection (CID) used for tests. All of the
tests have been performed in a new benchmark dataset named UNSW-NB15.
Experimental consequences demonstrate that the present schema dominates the
standard DCA and has higher CID in comparison with other approaches found in
literature.

<p>Evolving diverse sets of high quality solutions has gained increasing
interest in the evolutionary computation literature in recent years. With this
paper, we contribute to this area of research by examining evolutionary
diversity optimisation approaches for the classical Traveling Salesperson
Problem (TSP). We study the impact of using different diversity measures for a
given set of tours and the ability of evolutionary algorithms to obtain a
diverse set of high quality solutions when adopting these measures. Our studies
show that a large variety of diverse high quality tours can be achieved by
using our approaches. Furthermore, we compare our approaches in terms of
theoretical properties and the final set of tours obtained by the evolutionary
diversity optimisation algorithm.

<p>Social, supervised, learning from others might amplify individual, possibly
unsupervised, learning by individuals, and might underlie the development and
evolution of culture. We studied a minimal model of the interaction of
individual unsupervised and social supervised learning by interacting agents.
Agents attempted to learn to track a hidden fluctuation "source", which,
linearly mixed with other masking fluctuations, generated observable input
vectors. Learning was driven either solely by direct observation of inputs
(unsupervised, Hebbian) or, in addition, by observation of another agent's
output (supervised, Delta rule). To enhance biological realism, the learning
rules were made slightly connection-inspecific, so that incorrect learning
sometimes occurs. We found that social interaction can foster both correct and
incorrect learning. Useful social learning therefore presumably involves
additional factors some of which we outline.

<p>A significant challenge in developing AI that can generalize well is
designing agents that learn about their world without being told what to learn,
and apply that learning to challenges with sparse rewards. Moreover, most
traditional reinforcement learning approaches explicitly separate learning and
decision making in a way that does not correspond to biological learning. We
implement an architecture founded in principles of experimental neuroscience,
by combining computationally efficient abstractions of biological algorithms.
Our approach is inspired by research on spike-timing dependent plasticity, the
transition between short and long term memory, and the role of various
neurotransmitters in rewarding curiosity. The Neurons-in-a-Box architecture can
learn in a wholly generalizable manner, and demonstrates an efficient way to
build and apply representations without explicitly optimizing over a set of
criteria or actions. We find it performs well in many environments including
OpenAI Gym's Mountain Car, which has no reward besides touching a hard-to-reach
flag on a hill, Inverted Pendulum, where it learns simple strategies to improve
the time it holds a pendulum up, a video stream, where it spontaneously learns
to distinguish an open and closed hand, as well as other environments like
Google Chrome's Dinosaur Game.

<p>Neural Architecture Search (NAS), i.e., the automation of neural network
design, has gained much popularity in recent years with increasingly complex
search algorithms being proposed. Yet, solid comparisons with simple baselines
are often missing. At the same time, recent retrospective studies have found
many new algorithms to be no better than random search (RS). In this work we
consider, for the first time, a simple Local Search (LS) algorithm for NAS. We
particularly consider a multi-objective NAS formulation, with network accuracy
and network complexity as two objectives, as understanding the trade-off
between these two objectives is arguably the most interesting aspect of NAS.
The proposed LS algorithm is compared with RS and two evolutionary algorithms
(EAs), as these are often heralded as being ideal for multi-objective
optimization. To promote reproducibility, we create and release two benchmark
datasets containing 200K saved network evaluations for two established image
classification tasks, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Our benchmarks are designed to be
complementary to existing benchmarks, especially in that they are better suited
for multi-objective search. We additionally consider a version of the problem
with a much larger architecture space. While we find and show that the
considered algorithms explore the search space in fundamentally different ways,
we also find that LS substantially outperforms RS and even performs nearly as
good as state-of-the-art EAs. We believe that this provides strong evidence
that LS is truly a competitive baseline for NAS against which new NAS
algorithms should be benchmarked.

<p>The objective of the present work is to measure postural kinematics and power
spectral variation from HD-EEG to assess changes in cortical activity during
adaptation and habituation to postural perturbation. To evoke proprioceptive
postural perturbation, vibratory stimulation at 85 Hz was applied to the calf
muscles of 33 subjects over four 75-second stimulation periods. Stimulation was
performed according to a pseudorandom binary sequence. Vibratory impulses were
synchronized to high-density electroencephalography (HD-EEG, 256 channels).
Changes in absolute spectral power (ASP) were analyzed over four frequency
bands (Delta: 0.5-3.5 Hz; theta: 3.5-7.5 Hz; alpha: 7.5-12.5 Hz; beta:12.5-30
Hz). A force platform recorded torque actuated by the feet, and normalized sway
path length (SPL) was computed as a construct for postural performance during
each period. SPL values indicated improvement in postural performance over the
trial periods. Significant variation in absolute power values (ASP) was found
in assessing postural adaptation: an increase in theta band ASP in the
frontal-central region for closed-eyes trials, an increase in theta and beta
band ASP in the parietal region for open-eyes trials. In habituation, no
significant variations in ASP were observed during closed-eyes trials, whereas
an increase in theta, alpha, and beta band ASP was observed with open eyes.
Furthermore, open-eyed trials generally yielded a greater number of significant
ASP differences across all bands during both adaptation and habituation,
suggesting that following cortical activity during postural perturbation may be
up-regulated with the availability of visual feedback. Results provide deeper
insight into pathological postural control failure by exploring the dynamic
changes in both cortical activity and postural kinematics during adaptation and
habituation to proprioceptive postural perturbation.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08925">Tree Echo State Autoencoders with Grammars. (arXiv:2004.08925v1 [cs.NE])</a></h4>

<p>Tree data occurs in many forms, such as computer programs, chemical
molecules, or natural language. Unfortunately, the non-vectorial and discrete
nature of trees makes it challenging to construct functions with tree-formed
output, complicating tasks such as optimization or time series prediction.
Autoencoders address this challenge by mapping trees to a vectorial latent
space, where tasks are easier to solve, and then mapping the solution back to a
tree structure. However, existing autoencoding approaches for tree data fail to
take the specific grammatical structure of tree domains into account and rely
on deep learning, thus requiring large training datasets and long training
times. In this paper, we propose tree echo state autoencoders (TES-AE), which
are guided by a tree grammar and can be trained within seconds by virtue of
reservoir computing. In our evaluation on three datasets, we demonstrate that
our proposed approach is not only much faster than a state-of-the-art deep
learning autoencoding approach (D-VAE) but also has less autoencoding error if
little data and time is given.

<p>Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a common method for transferring the
``knowledge'' learned by one machine learning model (the \textit{teacher}) into
another model (the \textit{student}), where typically, the teacher has a
greater capacity (e.g., more parameters or higher bit-widths). To our
knowledge, existing methods overlook the fact that although the student absorbs
extra knowledge from the teacher, both models share the same input data -- and
this data is the only medium by which the teacher's knowledge can be
demonstrated. Due to the difference in model capacities, the student may not
benefit fully from the same data points on which the teacher is trained. On the
other hand, a human teacher may demonstrate a piece of knowledge with
individualized examples adapted to a particular student, for instance, in terms
of her cultural background and interests. Inspired by this behavior, we design
data augmentation agents with distinct roles to facilitate knowledge
distillation. Our data augmentation agents generate distinct training data for
the teacher and student, respectively. We find empirically that specially
tailored data points enable the teacher's knowledge to be demonstrated more
effectively to the student. We compare our approach with existing KD methods on
training popular neural architectures and demonstrate that role-wise data
augmentation improves the effectiveness of KD over strong prior approaches. The
code for reproducing our results can be found at

<p>The $(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$ genetic algorithm is a bright example of an
evolutionary algorithm which was developed based on the insights from
theoretical findings. This algorithm uses crossover, and it was shown to
asymptotically outperform all mutation-based evolutionary algorithms even on
simple problems like OneMax. Subsequently it was studied on a number of other
problems, but all of these were pseudo-Boolean.
</p>
<p>We aim at improving this situation by proposing an adaptation of the
$(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$ genetic algorithm to permutation-based problems. Such
an adaptation is required, because permutations are noticeably different from
bit strings in some key aspects, such as the number of possible mutations and
their mutual dependence. We also present the first runtime analysis of this
algorithm on a permutation-based problem called Ham whose properties resemble
those of OneMax. On this problem, where the simple mutation-based algorithms
have the running time of $\Theta(n^2 \log n)$ for problem size $n$, the
$(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$ genetic algorithm finds the optimum in $O(n^2)$ fitness
queries. We augment this analysis with experiments, which show that this
algorithm is also fast in practice.

<p>In this paper a new population update rule for population based ant colony
optimization (PACO) is proposed. PACO is a well known alternative to the
standard ant colony optimization algorithm. The new update rule allows to
weight different parts of the solutions. PACO with the new update rule is
evaluated for the example of the single machine total weighted tardiness
problem (SMTWTP). This is an $\mathcal{NP}$-hard optimization problem where the
aim is to schedule jobs on a single machine such that their total weighted
tardiness is minimized. PACO with the new population update rule is evaluated
with several benchmark instances from the OR-Library. Moreover, the impact of
the weights of the jobs on the solutions in the population and on the
convergence of the algorithm are analyzed experimentally. The results show that
PACO with the new update rule has on average better solution quality than PACO
with the standard update rule.

<p>Adolescents with Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have
difficulty processing speech with background noise due to reduced inhibitory
control and working memory capacity (WMC). This paper presents a pilot study of
an audiovisual Speech-In-Noise (SIN) task for young adults with ADHD compared
to age-matched controls using eye-tracking measures. The audiovisual SIN task
consists of varying six levels of background babble, accompanied by visual
cues. A significant difference between ADHD and neurotypical (NT) groups was
observed at 15 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). These results contribute to the
literature of young adults with ADHD.

<p>The Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm is an evolutionary optimization
algorithm based on swarm intelligence and inspired by the honey bees' food
search behavior. Since the ABC algorithm has been developed to achieve optimal
solutions by searching in the continuous search space, modification is required
to apply this method to binary optimization problems. In this paper, we improve
the ABC algorithm to solve binary optimization problems and call it the
improved binary Artificial Bee Colony (ibinABC). The proposed method consists
of an update mechanism based on fitness values and processing different number
of decision variables. Thus, we aim to prevent the ABC algorithm from getting
stuck in a local minimum by increasing its exploration ability. We compare the
ibinABC algorithm with three variants of the ABC and other meta-heuristic
algorithms in the literature. For comparison, we use the wellknown OR-Library
dataset containing 15 problem instances prepared for the uncapacitated facility
location problem. Computational results show that the proposed method is
superior to other methods in terms of convergence speed and robustness. The
source code of the algorithm will be available on GitHub after reviewing

<p>The human brain contains approximately $10^9$ neurons, each with
approximately $10^3$ connections, synapses, with other neurons. Most sensory,
cognitive and motor functions of our brains depend on the interaction of a
large population of neurons. In recent years, many technologies are developed
for recording large numbers of neurons either sequentially or simultaneously.
An increase in computational power and algorithmic developments have enabled
advanced analyses of neuronal population parallel to the rapid growth of
quantity and complexity of the recorded neuronal activity. Recent studies made
use of dimensionality and model order reduction techniques to extract coherent
features which are not apparent at the level of individual neurons. It has been
observed that the neuronal activity evolves on low-dimensional subspaces. The
aim of model reduction of large-scale neuronal networks is an accurate and fast
prediction of patterns and their propagation in different areas of the brain.
Spatiotemporal features of the brain activity are identified on low dimensional
subspaces with methods such as dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), proper
orthogonal decomposition (POD), discrete empirical interpolation (DEIM) and
combined parameter and state reduction. In this paper, we give an overview of
the currently used dimensionality reduction and model order reduction
techniques in neuroscience.

<p>In this paper, we propose a method to solve a bi-objective variant of the
well-studied Traveling Thief Problem (TTP). The TTP is a multi-component
problem that combines two classic combinatorial problems: Traveling Salesman
Problem (TSP) and Knapsack Problem (KP). We address the BI-TTP, a bi-objective
version of the TTP, where the goal is to minimize the overall traveling time
and to maximize the profit of the collected items. Our proposed method is based
on a biased-random key genetic algorithm with customizations addressing
problem-specific characteristics. We incorporate domain knowledge through a
combination of near-optimal solutions of each subproblem in the initial
population and use a custom repair operator to avoid the evaluation of
infeasible solutions. The bi-objective aspect of the problem is addressed
through an elite population extracted based on the non-dominated rank and
crowding distance. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive study showing the
influence of each parameter on the performance. Finally, we discuss the results
of the BI-TTP competitions at \textit{EMO-2019} and \textit{GECCO-2019}
conferences where our method has won first and second places, respectively,
thus proving its ability to find high-quality solutions consistently.

<p>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have demonstrated their ability to
learn patterns in data and produce new exemplars similar to, but different
from, their training set in several domains, including video games. However,
GANs have a fixed output size, so creating levels of arbitrary size for a
dungeon crawling game is difficult. GANs also have trouble encoding semantic
requirements that make levels interesting and playable. This paper combines a
GAN approach to generating individual rooms with a graph grammar approach to
combining rooms into a dungeon. The GAN captures design principles of
individual rooms, but the graph grammar organizes rooms into a global layout
with a sequence of obstacles determined by a designer. Room data from The
Legend of Zelda is used to train the GAN. This approach is validated by a user
study, showing that GAN dungeons are as enjoyable to play as a level from the
original game, and levels generated with a graph grammar alone. However, GAN
dungeons have rooms considered more complex, and plain graph grammar's dungeons
are considered least complex and challenging. Only the GAN approach creates an
extensive supply of both layouts and rooms, where rooms span across the
spectrum of those seen in the training set to new creations merging design
principles from multiple rooms.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00015">Gelatinase Biosensor Reports Cellular Remodeling During Epileptogenesis</a></h4>

<p>Epileptogenesis is the gradual process responsible for converting a healthy brain into an epileptic brain. This process can be triggered by a wide range of factors, including brain injury or tumors, infections, and status epilepticus. Epileptogenesis results in aberrant synaptic plasticity, neuroinflammation and seizure-induced cell death. As Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a crucial role in cellular plasticity by remodeling the extracellular matrix (ECM), gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) were recently highlighted as key players in epileptogenesis. In this work, we engineered a biosensor to report in situ gelatinase activity in a model of epileptogenesis. This biosensor encompasses a gelatinase-sensitive activatable cell penetrating peptide (ACPP) coupled to a TAMRA fluorophore, allowing fluorescence uptake in cells displaying endogenous gelatinase activities. In a preclinical mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the intrahippocampal kainate injection, ACPPs revealed a localized distribution of gelatinase activities, refining temporal cellular changes during epileptogenesis. The activity was found particularly but not only in the ipsilateral hippocampus, starting from the CA1 area and spreading to dentate gyrus from the early stages throughout chronic epilepsy, notably in neurons and microglial cells. Thus, our work shows that ACPPs are suitable molecular imaging probes for detecting the spatiotemporal pattern of gelatinase activity during epileptogenesis, suggesting their possible use as vectors to target cellular reactive changes with treatment for epileptogenesis.</p>

<p>The research on laminin α2 chain-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy (LAMA2-CMD) advanced rapidly in the last few decades, largely due to availability of good mouse models for the disease and a strong interest in preclinical studies from scientists all over the world. These mouse models continue to provide a solid platform for understanding the LAMA2-CMD pathology. In addition, they enable researchers to test laborious, necessary routines, but also the most creative scientific approaches in order to design therapy for this devastating disorder. In this review we present animals belonging to the laminin α2 chain-deficient “dy/dy” mouse family (dy/dy, dy<sup>2J</sup>/dy<sup>2J</sup>, dy<sup>3K</sup>/dy<sup>3K</sup>, dy<sup>W</sup>/dy<sup>W</sup>, et al.) and a summary of the scientific progress they facilitated. We also raise a few questions that need to be addressed in order to maximize the usefulness of laminin α2 murine mutants and to further advance the LAMA2-CMD studies. We believe that research opportunities offered by the mouse models for LAMA2-CMD will continuously support our efforts to find a treatment for the disease.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00018">Experience Creates the Multisensory Transform in the Superior Colliculus</a></h4>

<p>Although the ability to integrate information across the senses is compromised in some individuals for unknown reasons, similar defects have been observed when animals are reared without multisensory experience. The experience-dependent development of multisensory integration has been studied most extensively using the visual-auditory neuron of the cat superior colliculus (SC) as a neural model. In the normally-developed adult, SC neurons react to concordant visual-auditory stimuli by integrating their inputs in real-time to produce non-linearly amplified multisensory responses. However, when prevented from gathering visual-auditory experience, their multisensory responses are no more robust than their responses to the individual component stimuli. The mechanisms operating in this defective state are poorly understood. Here we examined the responses of SC neurons in “naïve” (i.e., dark-reared) and “neurotypic” (i.e., normally-reared) animals on a millisecond-by-millisecond basis to determine whether multisensory experience changes the operation by which unisensory signals are converted into multisensory outputs (the “multisensory transform”), or whether it changes the dynamics of the unisensory inputs to that transform (e.g., their synchronization and/or alignment). The results reveal that the major impact of experience was on the multisensory transform itself. Whereas neurotypic multisensory responses exhibited non-linear amplification near their onset followed by linear amplification thereafter, the naive responses showed no integration in the initial phase of the response and a computation consistent with competition in its later phases. The results suggest that multisensory experience creates an entirely new computation by which convergent unisensory inputs are used cooperatively to enhance the physiological salience of cross-modal events and thereby facilitate normal perception and behavior.</p>

<p>Despite being a popular neuromodulation technique, clinical translation of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is hampered by variable responses observed within treatment cohorts. Addressing this challenge has been difficult due to the lack of an effective means of mapping the neuromodulatory electromagnetic fields together with the brain’s response. In this study, we present a novel imaging technique that provides the capability of concurrently mapping markers of tDCS currents, as well as the brain’s response to tDCS. A dual-echo echo-planar imaging (DE-EPI) sequence is used, wherein the phase of the acquired MRI-signal encodes the tDCS current induced magnetic field, while the magnitude encodes the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast. The proposed technique was first validated in a custom designed phantom. Subsequent test–retest experiments in human participants showed that tDCS-induced magnetic fields can be detected reliably in vivo. The concurrently acquired BOLD data revealed large-scale networks characteristic of a brain in resting-state as well as a ‘cathodal’ and an ‘anodal’ resting-state component under each electrode. Moreover, ‘cathodal’s BOLD-signal was observed to significantly decrease with the applied current at the group level in all datasets. With its ability to image markers of electromagnetic cause as well as neurophysiological changes, the proposed technique may provide an effective means to visualize neural engagement in tDCS at the group level. Our technique also contributes to addressing confounding factors in applying BOLD fMRI concurrently with tDCS.</p>

Objectives<p>The frontal-striatum-thalamus pathway is important in the glutamic neural circuit. The hypofunction of GRIN1 and GRIA2 subunits from glutamic receptors has been hypothesized as the primary process in the etiology of schizophrenia.

<p>The cochlea “translates” the in-air vibrational acoustic “language” into the spikes of neural “language” that are then transmitted to the brain for auditory understanding and/or perception. During this intracochlear “translation” process, high resolution in time–frequency–intensity domains guarantees the high quality of the input neural information for the brain, which is vital for our outstanding hearing abilities. However, cochlear implants (CIs) have coarse artificial coding and interfaces, and CI users experience more challenges in common acoustic environments than their normal-hearing (NH) peers. Noise from sound sources that a listener has no interest in may be neglected by NH listeners, but they may distract a CI user. We discuss the CI noise-suppression techniques and introduce noise management for a new implant system. The monaural signal-to-noise ratio estimation-based noise suppression algorithm “eVoice,” which is incorporated in the processors of Nurotron<sup>®</sup> Enduro<sup>TM</sup>, was evaluated in two speech perception experiments. The results show that speech intelligibility in stationary speech-shaped noise can be significantly improved with eVoice. Similar results have been observed in other CI devices with single-channel noise reduction techniques. Specifically, the mean speech reception threshold decrease in the present study was 2.2 dB. The Nurotron society already has more than 10,000 users, and eVoice is a start for noise management in the new system. Future steps on non-stationary-noise suppression, spatial-source separation, bilateral hearing, microphone configuration, and environment specification are warranted. The existing evidence, including our research, suggests that noise-suppression techniques should be applied in CI systems. The artificial hearing of CI listeners requires more advanced signal processing techniques to reduce brain effort and increase intelligibility in noisy settings.</p>

<p>Human cerebrospinal fluid (hCSF) has proven advantageous over conventional medium for culturing both rodent and human brain tissue. In addition, increased activity and synchrony, closer to the dynamic states exclusively recorded in vivo, were reported in rodent slices and cell cultures switching from artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) to hCSF. This indicates that hCSF possesses properties that are not matched by the aCSF, which is generally used for most electrophysiological recordings. To evaluate the possible significance of using hCSF as an electrophysiological recording medium, also for human brain tissue, we compared the network and single-cell firing properties of human brain slice cultures during perfusion with hCSF and aCSF. For measuring the overall activity from a majority of neurons within neocortical and hippocampal human slices, we used a microelectrode array (MEA) recording technique with 252 electrodes covering an area of 3.2 × 3.2 mm<sup>2</sup>. A second CMOS-based MEA with 4225 sensors on a 2 × 2 mm<sup>2</sup> area was used for detailed mapping of action potential waveforms and cell identification. We found that hCSF increased the number of active electrodes and neurons and the firing rate of the neurons in the slices and induced an increase in the numbers of single channel and population bursts. Interestingly, not only an increase in the overall activity in the slices was observed, but a reconfiguration of the network could also be detected with specific activation and inactivation of subpopulations of neuronal ensembles. In conclusion, hCSF is an important component to consider for future human brain slice studies, especially for experiments designed to mimic parts of physiology and disease observed in vivo.</p>

<p>Gut integrity impairment leading to increased intestinal permeability (IP) is hypothesized to be a trigger of critically illness. Approximately 15–20% of human ischemic stroke (IS) victims require intensive care, including patients with impaired level of consciousness or a high risk for developing life-threatening cerebral edema. Local and systemic inflammatory reactions are a major component of the IS pathophysiology and can significantly aggravate brain tissue damage. Intracerebral inflammatory processes following IS have been well studied. Until now, less is known about systemic inflammatory responses and IS consequences apart from a frequently observed post-IS immunosuppression. Here, we provide a hypothesis of a crosstalk between systemic acute phase response (APR), IP and potential secondary brain damage during acute and subacute IS stages supported by preliminary experimental data. Alterations of the acute phase proteins (APPs) C-reactive protein and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein and serum level changes of antibodies directed against Escherichia coli-cell extract antigen (IgA-, IgM-, and IgG-anti-E. coli) were investigated at 1, 2, and 7 days following IS in ten male sheep. We found an increase of both APPs as well as a decrease of all anti-E. coli antibodies within 48 h following IS. This may indicate an early systemic APR and increased IP, and underlines the importance of the increasingly recognized gut-brain axis and of intestinal antigen release for systemic immune responses in acute and subacute stroke stages.</p>

<p>Ferroptosis is a kind of regulated cell death (RCD) caused by the redox state disorder of intracellular microenvironment controlled by glutathione (GSH) peroxidase 4 (GPX4), which is inhibited by iron chelators and lipophilic antioxidants. In addition to classical regulatory mechanisms, new regulatory factors for ferroptosis have been discovered in recent years, such as the P53 pathway, the activating transcription factor (ATF)3/4 pathway, Beclin 1 (BECN1) pathway, and some non-coding RNA. Ferroptosis is closely related to cancer treatment, neurodegenerative diseases, ischemia–reperfusion of organ, neurotoxicity, and others, in particular, in the field of neurodegenerative diseases treatment has aroused people’s interest. The nuclear factor E2 related factor 2 (Nrf2/NFE2L2) has been proved to play a key role in neurodegenerative disease treatment and ferroptosis regulation. Ferroptosis promotes the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, while the expression of Nrf2 and its target genes (Ho-1, Nqo-1, and Trx) has been declined with aging; therefore, there is still insufficient evidence for ferroptosis and Nrf2 regulatory networks in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we will provide a brief overview of ferroptosis regulatory mechanisms, as well as an emphasis on the mechanism of Nrf2 regulating ferroptosis. We also highlight the role of ferroptosis and Nrf2 during the process of neurodegenerative diseases and investigate a theoretical basis for further research on the relationship between Nrf2 and ferroptosis in the process of neurodegenerative diseases treatment.</p>

<p>Amyloids are fibrillar protein aggregates associated with diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), type II diabetes and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. The process of amyloid polymerization involves three pathological protein transformations; from natively folded conformation to the cross-β conformation, from biophysically soluble to insoluble, and from biologically functional to non-functional. While amyloids share a similar cross-β conformation, the biophysical transformation can either take place spontaneously via a homogeneous nucleation mechanism (HON) or catalytically on an exogenous surface via a heterogeneous nucleation mechanism (HEN). Here, we postulate that the different nucleation pathways can serve as a mechanistic basis for an etiological classification of amyloidopathies, where hereditary forms generally follow the HON pathway, while sporadic forms follow seed-induced (prions) or surface-induced (including microbially induced) HEN pathways. Critically, the conformational and biophysical amyloid transformation results in loss-of-function (LOF) of the original natively folded and soluble protein. This LOF can, at least initially, be the mechanism of amyloid toxicity even before amyloid accumulation reaches toxic levels. By highlighting the important role of non-protein species in amyloid formation and LOF mechanisms of toxicity, we propose a generalized mechanistic framework that could help better understand the diverse etiology of amyloid diseases and offer new opportunities for therapeutic interventions, including replacement therapies.</p>

<p>α-Synuclein (α-syn) has been genetically and biochemically linked to the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). There is accumulating evidence that misfolded α-syn species spread between cells in a prion-like manner and seed the aggregation of endogenous protein in the recipient cells. Exosomes have been proposed to mediate the transfer of misfolded α-syn and thus facilitate disease transmission, although the pathological mechanism remains elusive. Here, we investigated the seeding capacity of exosome-associated α-syn, in vivo. Disease-associated α-syn was present in exosome fractions isolated from transgenic A53T mouse brain. However, following intrastriatal injection of such exosomes in wild-type (wt) mice, we were not able to detect any accumulation of endogenous α-syn. In addition, recombinant fibrillar α-syn, when loaded to isolated brain exosomes, induced minor pathological α-syn brain accumulation at 7 months post injection. These data suggest that exosomes neutralize the effect of toxic α-syn species and raise additional questions on their paracrine modulatory role in disease transmission.</p>

<p>Adolescence is an essential developmental period characterized by reward-related processes. The current study investigated the development of monetary and social reward processes in adolescents compared with that in children and adults; furthermore, it assessed whether adolescents had different levels of sensitivity to various types of rewards. Two adapted incentive delay tasks were employed for each participant, and event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. The behavioral results showed that both monetary and social rewards could motivate response speed, and participants were more accurate under the monetary reward condition than under the social reward condition. The behavioral performances of individuals increased with age. For the ERP data, the cue-P3, target-P2, target-P3 and feedback-related negativity (FRN) components were investigated to identify reward motivation, emotional arousal, attention allocation and feedback processing. Children and adolescents showed higher motivation (larger cue-P3) to rewards than adults. Adolescents showed larger emotional responses to rewards; that is, they had larger target-P2 amplitudes than adults and shorter target-P2 latencies than children. Children showed stronger emotional reactivity for monetary rewards than for social rewards. All age groups had stronger attentional control (larger target-P3) under the monetary reward condition than under the social reward condition. The present study sheds light on the neurodevelopment of reward processes in children, adolescents and adults and shows that various reward process stages demonstrate different age-related and reward-type-related characteristics.</p>

<p>Path integration spatial navigation processes are emerging as promising cognitive markers for prodromal and clinical Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, such path integration changes have been less explored in Vascular Cognitive Impairment (VCI), despite neurovascular change being a major contributing factor to dementia and potentially AD. In particular, the sensitivity and specificity of path integration impairments in VCI compared to AD is unclear. In the current pilot study, we explore path integration performance in early-stage AD and VCI patient groups and hypothesize that: (i) medial parietal mediated egocentric processes will be more affected in VCI; and (ii) medial temporal mediated allocentric processes will be more affected in AD. This cross-sectional study included early-stage VCI patients (n = 9), AD patients (n = 10) and healthy age-matched controls (n = 20). All participants underwent extensive neuropsychological testing, as well as spatial navigation testing. The spatial navigation tests included the virtual reality “Supermarket” task assessing egocentric (body-based) and allocentric (map-based) navigation as well as the “Clock Orientation” test assessing egocentric and path integration processes. Results showed that egocentric integration processes are only impaired in VCI, potentially distinguishing it from AD. However, in contrast to our prediction, allocentric integration was not more impaired in AD compared to VCI. These preliminary findings suggest limited specificity of allocentric integration deficits between VCI and AD. By contrast, egocentric path integration deficits emerge as more specific to VCI, potentially allowing for more specific diagnostic and treatment outcome measures for vascular impairment in dementia.</p>

<p>Large-scale neuroscience literature call for effective methods to mine the knowledge from species perspective to link the brain and neuroscience communities, neurorobotics, computing devices, and AI research communities. Structured knowledge can motivate researchers to better understand the functionality and structure of the brain and link the related resources and components. However, the abstracts of massive scientific works do not explicitly mention the species. Therefore, in addition to dictionary-based methods, we need to mine species using cognitive computing models that are more like the human reading process, and these methods can take advantage of the rich information in the literature. We also enable the model to automatically distinguish whether the mentioned species is the main research subject. Distinguishing the two situations can generate value at different levels of knowledge management. We propose SpecExplorer project which is used to explore the knowledge associations of different species for brain and neuroscience. This project frees humans from the tedious task of classifying neuroscience literature by species. Species classification task belongs to the multi-label classification which is more complex than the single-label classification due to the correlation between labels. To resolve this problem, we present the sequence-to-sequence classification framework to adaptively assign multiple species to the literature. To model the structure information of documents, we propose the hierarchical attentive decoding (HAD) to extract span of interest (SOI) for predicting each species. We create three datasets from PubMed and PMC corpora. We present two versions of annotation criteria (mention-based annotation and semantic-based annotation) for species research. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves improvements in the final results. Finally, we perform species-based analysis of brain diseases, brain cognitive functions, and proteins related to the hippocampus and provide potential research directions for certain species.</p>

<p>Sensory conflict among visual, vestibular, and somatosensory information induces vertiginous sensation and postural instability. To elucidate the cognitive mechanisms of the integration between the visual and vestibular cues in humans, we analyzed the cortical hemodynamic responses during sensory conflict between visual and horizontal rotatory vestibular stimulation using a multichannel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) system. The subjects sat on a rotatory chair that was accelerated at 3°/s<sup>2</sup> for 20 s to the right or left, kept rotating at 60°/s for 80 s, and then decelerated at 3°/s<sup>2</sup> for 20 s. The subjects were instructed to watch white stripes projected on a screen surrounding the chair during the acceleration and deceleration periods. The white stripes moved in two ways; in the “congruent” condition, the stripes moved in the opposite direction of chair rotation at 3°/s<sup>2</sup> (i.e., natural visual stimulation), whereas in the “incongruent” condition, the stripes moved in the same direction of chair rotation at 3°/s<sup>2</sup> (i.e., conflicted visual stimulation). The cortical hemodynamic activity was recorded from the bilateral temporoparietal regions. Statistical analyses using NIRS-SPM software indicated that hemodynamic activity increased in the bilateral temporoparietal junctions (TPJs) and human MT+ complex, including the medial temporal (MT) area and medial superior temporal (MST) area in the incongruent condition. Furthermore, the subjective strength of the vertiginous sensation was negatively correlated with hemodynamic activity in the dorsal part of the supramarginal gyrus (SMG) in and around the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). These results suggest that sensory conflict between the visual and vestibular stimuli promotes cortical cognitive processes in the cortical network consisting of the TPJ, the medial temporal gyrus (MTG), and IPS, which might contribute to self-motion perception to maintain a sense of balance or equilibrioception during sensory conflict.</p>

Aim<p>Electrodes that provide brain to machine or computer interfacing must survive the lifetime of the person to be considered an acceptable prosthetic. The electrodes may be external such as with electroencephalographic (EEG), internal extracortical such as electrocorticographic (ECoG) or intracortical.</p>Methods<p>Most intracortical electrodes are placed close to the neuropil being recorded and do not survive years of recording. However, the Neurotrophic Electrode is placed within the cortex and the neuropil grows inside and through the hollow tip of the electrode and is thus trapped inside. Highly flexible coiled lead wires minimize the strain on the electrode tip. Histological analysis includes immunohistochemical detection of neurofilaments and the absence of gliosis.</p>Results<p>This configuration led to a decade long recording in this locked-in person. At year nine, the neural activity underwent conditioning experiments indicating that the neural activity was functional and not noise. This paper presents data on the histological analysis of the tissue inside the electrode tip after 13 years of implantation.</p>Conclusion<p>This paper is a singular example of histological analysis after a decade of recording. The histological analysis laid out herein is strong evidence that the brain can grow neurites into the electrode tip and record for a decade. This is profoundly important in the field of brain to machine or computer interfacing by implying that long term electrodes should incorporate some means of growing the neuropil into the electrode rather than placing the electrode into the neuropil.</p>

<p>Cross-subject variability problems hinder practical usages of Brain-Computer Interfaces. Recently, deep learning has been introduced into the BCI community due to its better generalization and feature representation abilities. However, most studies currently only have validated deep learning models for single datasets, and the generalization ability for other datasets still needs to be further verified. In this paper, we validated deep learning models for eight MI datasets and demonstrated that the cross-dataset variability problem weakened the generalization ability of models. To alleviate the impact of cross-dataset variability, we proposed an online pre-alignment strategy for aligning the EEG distributions of different subjects before training and inference processes. The results of this study show that deep learning models with online pre-alignment strategies could significantly improve the generalization ability across datasets without any additional calibration data.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00026">Intrinsic and Synaptic Properties Shaping Diverse Behaviors of Neural Dynamics</a></h4>

<p>The majority of neurons in the neuronal system of the brain have a complex morphological structure, which diversifies the dynamics of neurons. In the granular layer of the cerebellum, there exists a unique cell type, the unipolar brush cell (UBC), that serves as an important relay cell for transferring information from outside mossy fibers to downstream granule cells. The distinguishing feature of the UBC is that it has a simple morphology, with only one short dendritic brush connected to its soma. Based on experimental evidence showing that UBCs exhibit a variety of dynamic behaviors, here we develop two simple models, one with a few detailed ion channels for simulation and the other one as a two-variable dynamical system for theoretical analysis, to characterize the intrinsic dynamics of UBCs. The reasonable values of the key channel parameters of the models can be determined by analysis of the stability of the resting membrane potential and the rebound firing properties of UBCs. Considered together with a large variety of synaptic dynamics installed on UBCs, we show that the simple-structured UBCs, as relay cells, can extend the range of dynamics and information from input mossy fibers to granule cells with low-frequency resonance and transfer stereotyped inputs to diverse amplitudes and phases of the output for downstream granule cells. These results suggest that neuronal computation, embedded within intrinsic ion channels and the diverse synaptic properties of single neurons without sophisticated morphology, can shape a large variety of dynamic behaviors to enhance the computational ability of local neuronal circuits.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00091">Distinct Synchronous Network Activity During the Second Postnatal Week of Medial Entorhinal Cortex Development</a></h4>

<p>The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) contains specialized cell types whose firing is tuned to aspects of an animal’s position and orientation in the environment, reflecting a neuronal representation of space. The spatially tuned firing properties of these cells quickly emerge during the third postnatal week of development in rodents. Spontaneous synchronized network activity (SSNA) has been shown to play a crucial role in the development of neuronal circuits prior to week 3. SSNA in MEC is well described in rodents during the first postnatal week, but there are little data about its development immediately prior to eye opening and spatial exploration. Furthermore, existing data lack single-cell resolution and are not integrated across layers. In this study, we addressed the question of whether the characteristics and underlying mechanisms of SSNA during the second postnatal week resemble that of the first week or whether distinct features emerge during this period. Using a combined calcium imaging and electrophysiology approach in vitro, we confirm that in mouse MEC during the second postnatal week, SSNA persists and in fact peaks, and is dependent on ionotropic glutamatergic signaling. However, SSNA differs from that observed during the first postnatal week in two ways: First, EC does not drive network activity in the hippocampus but only in neighboring neocortex (NeoC). Second, GABA does not drive network activity but influences it in a manner that is dependent both on age and receptor type. Therefore, we conclude that while there is a partial mechanistic overlap in SSNA between the first and second postnatal weeks, unique mechanistic features do emerge during the second week, suggestive of different or additional functions of MEC within the hippocampal-entorhinal circuitry with increasing maturation.</p>

<p>Genetically encoded nanosensors such as the FRET-based adenosine triphosphate (ATP) sensor ATeam enable the measurement of changes in ATP levels inside cells, promoting our understanding of metabolic interactions between astrocytes and neurons. The sensors are usually well characterized in vitro but display altered properties when expressed inside cells, precluding a meaningful conversion of changes in FRET ratios into changes in intracellular ATP concentrations ([ATP]) on the basis of their in vitro properties. Here, we present an experimental strategy for the intracellular calibration of two different variants of ATeam in organotypic tissue slice culture of the mouse brain. After cell-type-specific expression of the sensors in astrocytes or neurons, slices were first perfused with a saline containing the saponin β-escin to permeabilize plasma membranes for ATP. Next, cells were depleted of ATP by perfusion with ATP-free saline containing metabolic inhibitors. Finally, ATP was re-added at defined concentrations and resulting changes in the FRET ratio recorded. When employing this protocol, ATeam1.03 expressed in astrocytes reliably responds to changes in [ATP], exhibiting an apparent K<sub>D</sub> of 9.4 mM. The high-affinity sensor ATeam1.03<sup>YEMK</sup> displayed a significantly lower intracellular K<sub>D</sub> of 2.7 mM. On the basis of these calibrations, we found that induction of a recurrent neuronal network activity resulted in an initial transient increase in astrocytic [ATP] by ~0.12 mM as detected by ATeam1.03<sup>YEMK</sup>, a result confirmed using ATeam1.03. In neurons, in contrast, [ATP] immediately started to decline upon initiation of a network activity, amounting to a decrease by an average of 0.29 mM after 2 min. Taken together, our results demonstrate that ATeam1.03<sup>YEMK</sup> and ATeam1.03 display a significant increase in their apparent K<sub>D</sub> when expressed inside cells as compared with in vitro. Moreover, they show that both ATeam variants enable the quantitative detection of changes of astrocytic and neuronal [ATP] in the physiological range. ATeam1.03<sup>YEMK</sup>, however, seems preferable because its K<sub>D</sub> is close to baseline ATP levels. Finally, our data support the idea that synchronized neuronal activity initially stimulates the generation of ATP in astrocytes, presumably through increased glycolysis, whereas ATP levels in neurons decline.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00076">Stability in the Face of Change: Lifelong Experience-Dependent Plasticity in the Sensory Cortex</a></h4>

<p>Plasticity is a fundamental property of the nervous system that enables its adaptations to the ever-changing environment. Heightened plasticity typical for developing circuits facilitates their robust experience-dependent functional maturation. This plasticity wanes during adolescence to permit the stabilization of mature brain function, but abundant evidence supports that adult circuits exhibit both transient and long-term experience-induced plasticity. Cortical plasticity has been extensively studied throughout the life span in sensory systems and the main distinction between development and adulthood arising from these studies is the concept that passive exposure to relevant information is sufficient to drive robust plasticity early in life, while higher-order attentional mechanisms are necessary to drive plastic changes in adults. Recent work in the primary visual and auditory cortices began to define the circuit mechanisms that govern these processes and enable continuous adaptation to the environment, with transient circuit disinhibition emerging as a common prerequisite for both developmental and adult plasticity. Drawing from studies in visual and auditory systems, this review article summarizes recent reports on the circuit and cellular mechanisms of experience-driven plasticity in the developing and adult brains and emphasizes the similarities and differences between them. The benefits of distinct plasticity mechanisms used at different ages are discussed in the context of sensory learning, as well as their relationship to maladaptive plasticity and neurodevelopmental brain disorders. Knowledge gaps and avenues for future work are highlighted, and these will hopefully motivate future research in these areas, particularly those about the learning of complex skills during development.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00021">Distinct Components in the Right Extended Frontal Aslant Tract Mediate Language and Working Memory Performance: A Tractography-Informed VBM Study</a></h4>

<p>The extended frontal aslant tract (exFAT) is a tractography-based extension of the frontal aslant tract (FAT) which has been shown to be related with language and working memory performance in healthy human adults, but whether those functional implications map to structurally separate regions along its trajectory is still an open question. We present a tractography-informed Voxel-Based Morphometry procedure capable of detecting local tract-specific structural differences in white matter regions and apply it in two maximum variation sampling studies by comparing local differences in diffusion-derived microstructural parameters and fiber density along the exFAT territory between top performers and bottom performers in language and working memory tasks. In the right hemisphere we were able to detect, without prior constraints, a vertical frontal aslant component approximating the original FAT trajectory whose fiber density was significantly correlated with language (but not working memory) performance and an anterior cluster component corresponding to a distinct anterior frontal aslant component whose fiber density was significantly correlated with working memory (but not language) performance. The reported sub-division of the exFAT territory describes a set of frontal connections that are compatible with previously reported results on the Broca’s territory and frontal cortex hierarchical organization along an anterior-posterior gradient, suggesting that the exFAT could be part of a common neuroanatomical scaffold where language and working memory functions are integrated in the healthy human brain.</p>

<p>Calcium stores in neurons are heterogeneous in compartmentalization and molecular composition. Danio rerio (zebrafish) is an animal model with a simply folded cerebellum similar in cellular organization to that of mammals. The aim of the study was to identify new endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium store markers in zebrafish adult brain with emphasis on cerebellum and optic tectum. By quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we found three RNA transcripts coding for the intra-ER calcium binding protein calsequestrin: casq1a, casq1b, and casq2. In brain homogenates, two isoforms were detected by mass spectrometry and western blotting. Fractionation experiments of whole brain revealed that Casq1a and Casq2 were enriched in a heavy fraction containing ER microsomes and synaptic membranes. By in situ hybridization, we found the heterogeneous expression of casq1a and casq2 mRNA to be compatible with the cellular localization of calsequestrins investigated by immunofluorescence. Casq1 was expressed in neurogenic differentiation 1 expressing the granule cells of the cerebellum and the periventricular zone of the optic tectum. Casq2 was concentrated in parvalbumin expressing Purkinje cells. At a subcellular level, Casq1 was restricted to granular cell bodies, and Casq2 was localized in cell bodies, dendrites, and axons. Data are discussed in relation to the differential cellular and subcellular distribution of other cerebellum calcium store markers and are evaluated with respect to the putative relevance of calsequestrins in the neuron-specific functional activity.</p>

<p>People with Down syndrome, which is a trisomy of chromosome 21, exhibit intellectual disability from infancy and neuropathology similar to Alzheimer’s disease, such as amyloid plaques, from an early age. Recently, we showed that cilostazol, a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase (PDE) 3, promotes the clearance of amyloid β and rescues cognitive deficits in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. The objective of the present study was to examine whether cilostazol improves behaviors in the most widely used animal model of Down syndrome, i.e., Ts65Dn mice. Mice were supplemented with cilostazol from the fetal period until young adulthood. Supplementation significantly ameliorated novel-object recognition in Ts65Dn females and partially ameliorated sensorimotor function as determined by the rotarod test in Ts65Dn females and hyperactive locomotion in Ts65Dn males. Cilostazol supplementation significantly shortened swimming distance in Ts65Dn males in the Morris water maze test, suggesting that the drug improved cognitive function, although it did not shorten swimming duration, which was due to decreased swimming speed. Thus, this study suggests that early supplementation with cilostazol partially rescues behavioral abnormalities seen in Down syndrome and indicates that the effects are sex-dependent.</p>

<p>The loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra leads to a progressive, long-term decline of movement and other non-motor deficits. The symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD) often appear later in the course of the disease, when most of the functional dopaminergic neurons have been lost. The late onset of the disease, the severity of the illness, and its impact on the global health system demand earlier diagnosis and better targeted therapy. PD etiology and pathogenesis are largely unknown. There are mutations in genes that have been linked to PD and, from these complex phenotypes, mitochondrial dysfunction emerged as central in the pathogenesis and evolution of PD. In fact, several PD-associated genes negatively impact on mitochondria physiology, supporting the notion that dysregulation of mitochondrial signaling and homeostasis is pathogenically relevant. Derangement of mitochondrial homeostatic controls can lead to oxidative stress and neuronal cell death. Restoring deranged signaling cascades to and from mitochondria in PD neurons may then represent a viable opportunity to reset energy metabolism and delay the death of dopaminergic neurons. Here, we will highlight the relevance of dysfunctional mitochondrial homeostasis and signaling in PD, the molecular mechanisms involved, and potential therapeutic approaches to restore mitochondrial activities in damaged neurons.</p>

<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a sequence of pathological changes, which are commonly assessed in vivo using various brain imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). Currently, the most approaches to analyze statistical associations between regions and imaging modalities rely on Pearson correlation or linear regression models. However, these models are prone to spurious correlations arising from uninformative shared variance and multicollinearity. Notably, there are no appropriate multivariate statistical models available that can easily integrate dozens of multicollinear variables derived from such data, being able to utilize the additional information provided from the combination of data sources. Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) can estimate the conditional dependency from given data, which is conceptually expected to closely reflect the underlying causal relationships between various variables. Hence, we applied GGMs to assess multimodal regional brain alterations in AD. We obtained data from N = 972 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. The mean amyloid load (AV45-PET), glucose metabolism (FDG-PET), and gray matter volume (MRI) were calculated for each of the 108 cortical and subcortical brain regions. GGMs were estimated using a Bayesian framework for the combined multimodal data and the resulted conditional dependency networks were compared to classical covariance networks based on Pearson correlation. Additionally, graph-theoretical network statistics were calculated to determine network alterations associated with disease status. The resulting conditional dependency matrices were much sparser (≈10% density) than Pearson correlation matrices (≈50% density). Within imaging modalities, conditional dependency networks yielded clusters connecting anatomically adjacent regions. For the associations between different modalities, only few region-specific connections were detected. Network measures such as small-world coefficient were significantly altered across diagnostic groups, with a biphasic u-shape trajectory, i.e., increased small-world coefficient in early mild cognitive impairment (MCI), similar values in late MCI, and decreased values in AD dementia patients compared to cognitively normal controls. In conclusion, GGMs removed commonly shared variance among multimodal measures of regional brain alterations in MCI and AD, and yielded sparser matrices compared to correlation networks based on the Pearson coefficient. Therefore, GGMs may be used as alternative to thresholding-approaches typically applied to correlation networks to obtain the most informative relations between variables.</p>

<p>Heterozygous mutations of the GBA1 gene, encoding for lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase), occur in a considerable percentage of all patients with sporadic Parkinson’s disease (PD), varying between 8% and 12% across the world. Genome wide association studies have confirmed the strong correlation between PD and GBA1 mutations, pointing to this element as a major risk factor for PD, possibly the most important one after age. The pathobiological mechanisms underlying the link between a defective function of GCase and the development of PD are still unknown and are currently the focus of intense investigation in the community of pre-clinical and clinical researchers in the PD field. A major controversy regards the fact that, despite the unequivocal correlation between the presence of GBA1 mutations and the risk of developing PD, only a minority of asymptomatic carriers with GBA1 mutations convert to PD in their lifetime. GBA1 mutations reduce the enzymatic function of GCase, impairing lysosomal efficiency and the cellular ability to dispose of pathological alpha-synuclein. Changes in the cellular lipidic content resulting from the accumulation of glycosphingolipids, triggered by lysosomal dysfunction, may contribute to the pathological modification of alpha-synuclein, due to its ability to interact with cell membrane lipids. Mutant GCase can impair mitochondrial function and cause endoplasmic reticulum stress, thereby impacting on cellular energy production and proteostasis. Importantly, reduced GCase activity is associated with clear activation of microglia, a major mediator of neuroinflammatory response within the brain parenchyma, which points to neuroinflammation as a major consequence of GCase dysfunction. In this present review article, we summarize the current knowledge on the role of GBA1 mutations in PD development and their phenotypic correlations. We also discuss the potential role of the GCase pathway in the search for PD biomarkers that may enable the development of disease modifying therapies. Answering these questions will aid clinicians in offering more appropriate counseling to the patients and their caregivers and provide future directions for PD preclinical research.</p>

<p>There is currently a need for engaging, user-friendly, and repeatable tasks for assessment of cognitive and motor function in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. This study evaluated the feasibility of a maze-like Numberlink puzzle game in assessing differences in game-based measures of cognition and motor function due to age and neurodegenerative diseases. Fifty-five participants, including young (18–31 years, n = 18), older (64–79 years, n = 14), and oldest adults (86–98 years, n = 14), and patients with Parkinson’s (59–76 years, n = 4) and Huntington’s disease (HD; 35–66 years, n = 5) played different difficulty levels of the Numberlink puzzle game and completed usability questionnaires and tests for psychomotor, attentional, visuospatial, and constructional and executive function. Analyses of Numberlink game-based cognitive (solving time and errors) and motor [mean velocity and movement direction changes (MDC)] performance metrics revealed statistically significant differences between age groups and between patients with HD and older adults. However, patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) did not differ from older adults. Correlational analyses showed significant associations between game-based performance and movement metrics and performance on neuropsychological tests for psychomotor, attentional, visuospatial, and constructional and executive function. Furthermore, varying characteristics of the Numberlink puzzle game succeeded in creating graded difficulty levels. Findings from this study support recent suggestions that data from a maze-like puzzle game provide potential “digital biomarkers” to assess changes in psychomotor, visuoconstructional, and executive function related to aging and neurodegeneration. In particular, game-based movement measures from the maze-like puzzle Numberlink games are promising as a tool to monitor the progression of motor impairment in neurodegenerative diseases. Further studies are needed to more comprehensively establish the cognitive validity and test–retest reliability of using Numberlink puzzles as a valid cognitive assessment tool.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56053">Population coupling predicts the plasticity of stimulus responses in cortical circuits</a></h4>

Some neurons have stimulus responses that are stable over days, whereas other neurons have highly plastic stimulus responses. Using a recurrent network model, we explore whether this could be due to an underlying diversity in their synaptic plasticity. We find that, in a network with diverse learning rates, neurons with fast rates are more coupled to population activity than neurons with slow rates. This plasticity-coupling link predicts that neurons with high population coupling exhibit more long-term stimulus response variability than neurons with low population coupling. We substantiate this prediction using recordings from the Allen Brain Observatory, finding that a neuron's population coupling is correlated with the plasticity of its orientation preference. Simulations of a simple perceptual learning task suggest a particular functional architecture: a stable 'backbone' of stimulus representation formed by neurons with low population coupling, on top of which lies a flexible substrate of neurons with high population coupling.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55943">A single power stroke by ATP binding drives substrate translocation in a heterodimeric ABC transporter</a></h4>

ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters constitute the largest family of primary active transporters, responsible for many physiological processes and human maladies. However, the mechanism how chemical energy of ATP facilitates translocation of chemically diverse compounds across membranes is poorly understood. Here, we advance the quantitative mechanistic understanding of the heterodimeric ABC transporter TmrAB, a functional homolog of the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) by single-turnover analyses at single-liposome resolution. We reveal that a single conformational switch by ATP binding drives unidirectional substrate translocation. After this power stroke, ATP hydrolysis and phosphate release launch the return to the resting state, which facilitates nucleotide exchange and a new round of substrate binding and translocation. In contrast to hitherto existing steady-state assays, our single-turnover approach uncovers the power stroke in substrate translocation and the tight chemomechanical coupling in these molecular machines.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55368">Centering and symmetry breaking in confined contracting actomyosin networks</a></h4>

Centering and decentering of cellular components is essential for internal organization of cells and their ability to perform basic cellular functions such as division and motility. How cells achieve proper localization of their organelles is still not well-understood, especially in large cells such as oocytes. Here, we study actin-based positioning mechanisms in artificial cells with persistently contracting actomyosin networks, generated by encapsulating cytoplasmic <i>Xenopus</i> egg extracts into cell-sized ‘water-in-oil’ droplets. We observe size-dependent localization of the contraction center, with a symmetric configuration in larger cells and a polar one in smaller cells. Centering is achieved via a hydrodynamic mechanism based on Darcy friction between the contracting network and the surrounding cytoplasm. During symmetry breaking, transient attachments to the cell boundary drive the contraction center to a polar location. The centering mechanism is cell-cycle dependent and weakens considerably during interphase. Our findings demonstrate a robust, yet tunable, mechanism for subcellular localization.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54873">A discrete subtype of neural progenitor crucial for cortical folding in the gyrencephalic mammalian brain</a></h4>

An increase in the diversity of neural progenitor subtypes and folding of the cerebral cortex are characteristic features which appeared during the evolution of the mammalian brain. Here, we show that the expansion of a specific subtype of neural progenitor is crucial for cortical folding. We found that outer radial glial (oRG) cells can be subdivided by HOPX expression in the gyrencephalic cerebral cortex of ferrets. Compared with HOPX-negative oRG cells, HOPX-positive oRG cells had high self-renewal activity and were accumulated in prospective gyral regions. Using our in vivo genetic manipulation technique for ferrets, we found that the number of HOPX-positive oRG cells and their self-renewal activity were regulated by sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling. Importantly, suppressing Shh signaling reduced HOPX-positive oRG cells and cortical folding, while enhancing it had opposing effects. Our results reveal a novel subtype of neural progenitor important for cortical folding in gyrencephalic mammalian cerebral cortex.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54462">The evolutionary history and genomics of European blackcap migration</a></h4>

Seasonal migration is a taxonomically widespread behaviour that integrates across many traits. The European blackcap exhibits enormous variation in migration and is renowned for research on its evolution and genetic basis. We assembled a reference genome for blackcaps and obtained whole genome resequencing data from individuals across its breeding range. Analyses of population structure and demography suggested divergence began ~30,000 ya, with evidence for one admixture event between migrant and resident continent birds ~5000 ya. The propensity to migrate, orientation and distance of migration all map to a small number of genomic regions that do not overlap with results from other species, suggesting that there are multiple ways to generate variation in migration. Strongly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were located in regulatory regions of candidate genes that may serve as major regulators of the migratory syndrome. Evidence for selection on shared variation was documented, providing a mechanism by which rapid changes may evolve.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54275">Dual orexin and MCH neuron-ablated mice display severe sleep attacks and cataplexy</a></h4>

Orexin/hypocretin-producing and melanin-concentrating hormone-producing (MCH) neurons are co-extensive in the hypothalamus and project throughout the brain to regulate sleep/wakefulness. Ablation of orexin neurons decreases wakefulness and results in a narcolepsy-like phenotype, whereas ablation of MCH neurons increases wakefulness. Since it is unclear how orexin and MCH neurons interact to regulate sleep/wakefulness, we generated transgenic mice in which both orexin and MCH neurons could be ablated. Double-ablated mice exhibited increased wakefulness and decreased both rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep. Double-ablated mice showed severe cataplexy compared with orexin neuron-ablated mice, suggesting that MCH neurons normally suppress cataplexy. Double-ablated mice also showed frequent sleep attacks with elevated spectral power in the delta and theta range, a unique state that we call ‘delta-theta sleep’. Together, these results indicate a functional interaction between orexin and MCH neurons in vivo that suggests the synergistic involvement of these neuronal populations in the sleep/wakefulness cycle.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54229">A neuropeptide regulates fighting behavior in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i></a></h4>

Aggressive behavior is regulated by various neuromodulators such as neuropeptides and biogenic amines. Here we found that the neuropeptide <i>Drosulfakinin (Dsk</i>) modulates aggression in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Knock-out of <i>Dsk</i> or <i>Dsk</i> receptor <i>CCKLR-17D1</i> reduced aggression. Activation and inactivation of Dsk-expressing neurons increased and decreased male aggressive behavior, respectively. Moreover, data from transsynaptic tracing, electrophysiology and behavioral epistasis reveal that Dsk-expressing neurons function downstream of a subset of P1 neurons (<i>P1<sup>a</sup>-splitGAL4</i>) to control fighting behavior. In addition, winners show increased calcium activity in Dsk-expressing neurons. Conditional overexpression of Dsk promotes social dominance, suggesting a positive correlation between Dsk signaling and winning effects. The mammalian ortholog CCK has been implicated in mammal aggression, thus our work suggests a conserved neuromodulatory system for the modulation of aggressive behavior.

The <i>Drosophila</i> ventral nerve cord (VNC) receives and processes descending signals from the brain to produce a variety of coordinated locomotor outputs. It also integrates sensory information from the periphery and sends ascending signals to the brain. We used single-cell transcriptomics to generate an unbiased classification of cellular diversity in the VNC of five-day old adult flies. We produced an atlas of 26,000 high-quality cells, representing more than 100 transcriptionally distinct cell types. The predominant gene signatures defining neuronal cell types reflect shared developmental histories based on the neuroblast from which cells were derived, as well as their birth order. The relative position of cells along the anterior-posterior axis could also be assigned using adult Hox gene expression. This single-cell transcriptional atlas of the adult fly VNC will be a valuable resource for future studies of neurodevelopment and behavior.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54056">Vascular permeability in retinopathy is regulated by VEGFR2 Y949 signaling to VE-cadherin</a></h4>

Edema stemming from leaky blood vessels is common in eye diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Whereas therapies targeting vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) can suppress leakage, side-effects include vascular rarefaction and geographic atrophy. By challenging mouse models representing different steps in VEGFA/VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2)-induced vascular permeability, we show that targeting signaling downstream of VEGFR2 pY949 limits vascular permeability in retinopathy induced by high oxygen or by laser-wounding. Although suppressed permeability is accompanied by reduced pathological neoangiogenesis in oxygen-induced retinopathy, similarly sized lesions leak less in mutant mice, separating regulation of permeability from angiogenesis,. Strikingly, vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin phosphorylation at the Y685, but not Y658, residue is reduced when VEGFR2 pY949 signaling is impaired. These findings support a mechanism whereby VE-cadherin Y685 phosphorylation is selectively associated with excessive vascular leakage. Therapeutically, targeting VEGFR2-regulated VE-cadherin phosphorylation could suppress edema while leaving other VEGFR2-dependent functions intact.

Slo2 potassium channels play important roles in neuronal function, and their mutations in humans may cause epilepsies and cognitive defects. However, it is largely unknown how Slo2 is regulated by other proteins. Here we show that the function of <i>C. elegans</i> Slo2 (SLO-2) depends on <i>adr-1</i>, a gene important to RNA editing. ADR-1 promotes SLO-2 function not by editing the transcripts of <i>slo-2</i> but those of <i>scyl-1</i>, which encodes an orthologue of mammalian SCYL1. Transcripts of <i>scyl-1</i> are greatly decreased in <i>adr-1</i> mutants due to deficient RNA editing at a single adenosine in their 3'-UTR. SCYL-1 physically interacts with SLO-2 in neurons. Single-channel open probability (<i>P<sub>o</sub></i>) of neuronal SLO-2 is ~50% lower in <i>scyl-1 </i>knockout mutant than wild type. Moreover, human Slo2.2/Slack <i>P<sub>o</sub></i> is doubled by SCYL1 in a heterologous expression system. These results suggest that SCYL-1/SCYL1 is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of Slo2 channels.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53689">EphA7 promotes myogenic differentiation via cell-cell contact</a></h4>

The conversion of proliferating skeletal muscle precursors (myoblasts) to terminally-differentiated myocytes is a critical step in skeletal muscle development and repair. We show that EphA7, a juxtacrine signaling receptor, is expressed on myocytes during embryonic and fetal myogenesis and on nascent myofibers during muscle regeneration in vivo. In <i>EphA7</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice, hindlimb muscles possess fewer myofibers at birth, and those myofibers are reduced in size and have fewer myonuclei and reduced overall numbers of precursor cells throughout postnatal life. Adult <i>EphA7</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice have reduced numbers of satellite cells and exhibit delayed and protracted muscle regeneration, and satellite cell-derived myogenic cells from <i>EphA7</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice are delayed in their expression of differentiation markers in vitro. Exogenous EphA7 extracellular domain will rescue the null phenotype in vitro, and will also enhance commitment to differentiation in WT cells. We propose a model in which EphA7 expression on differentiated myocytes promotes commitment of adjacent myoblasts to terminal differentiation.

Platelet-neutrophil interactions are important for innate immunity, but also contribute to the pathogenesis of deep vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction and stroke. Here we report that, under flow, von Willebrand factor/glycoprotein Iba-dependent platelet 'priming' induces integrin a<sub>IIb</sub>b<sub>3</sub> activation that, in turn, mediates neutrophil and T-cell binding. Binding of platelet a<sub>IIb</sub>b<sub>3</sub> to SLC44A2 on neutrophils leads to mechanosensitive-dependent production of highly prothrombotic neutrophil extracellular traps. A polymorphism in <i>SLC44A2</i> (rs2288904-A) present in 22% of the population causes an R154Q substitution in an extracellular loop of SLC44A2 that is protective against venous thrombosis results in severely impaired binding to both activated a<sub>IIb</sub>b<sub>3 </sub>and<sub> </sub>VWF-primed platelets. This was confirmed using neutrophils homozygous for the <i>SLC44A2</i> R154Q polymorphism. Taken together, these data reveal a previously unreported mode of platelet-neutrophil crosstalk, mechanosensitive NET production, and provide mechanistic insight into the protective effect of the <i>SLC44A2</i> rs2288904-A polymorphism in venous thrombosis.

HLA-restricted T cell responses can induce antitumor effects in cancer patients. Previous human T cell research has largely focused on the few HLA alleles prevalent in a subset of ethnic groups. Here, using a panel of newly developed peptide-exchangeable peptide/HLA multimers and artificial antigen-presenting cells for 25 different class I alleles and greater than 800 peptides, we systematically and comprehensively mapped shared antigenic epitopes recognized by tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs) from eight melanoma patients for all their class I alleles. We were able to determine the specificity, on average, of 12.2% of the TILs recognizing a mean of 3.1 shared antigen-derived epitopes across HLA-A, B, and C. Furthermore, we isolated a number of cognate T cell receptor genes with tumor reactivity. Our novel strategy allows for a more complete examination of the immune response and development of novel cancer immunotherapy not limited by HLA allele prevalence or tumor mutation burden.

The World Health Organization has included three bunyaviruses posing an increasing threat to human health on the Blueprint list of viruses likely to cause major epidemics and for which no, or insufficient countermeasures exist. Here, we describe a broadly applicable strategy, based on llama-derived single-domain antibodies (VHHs), for the development of bunyavirus biotherapeutics. The method was validated using the zoonotic Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and Schmallenberg virus (SBV), an emerging pathogen of ruminants, as model pathogens. VHH building blocks were assembled into highly potent neutralizing complexes using bacterial superglue technology. The multimeric complexes were shown to reduce and prevent virus-induced morbidity and mortality in mice upon prophylactic administration. Bispecific molecules engineered to present two different VHHs fused to an Fc domain were further shown to be effective upon therapeutic administration. The presented VHH-based technology holds great promise for the development of bunyavirus antiviral therapies.

Inter-male aggressive behavior is a prominent sexually dimorphic behavior. Neural circuits that underlie aggressive behavior are therefore likely under the control of sex-determining genes. However, the neurogenetic mechanism that generates sex-specific aggressive behavior remains largely unknown. Here, we found that a neuronal class specified by one of the <i>Drosophila</i> sex determining genes, <i>fruitless</i> (<i>fru</i>), belongs to the neural circuit that generates male-type aggressive behavior. This neuronal class can promote aggressive behavior independent of another sex determining gene, <i>doublesex</i> (<i>dsx</i>), although <i>dsx</i> is involved in ensuring that aggressive behavior is performed only toward males. We also found that three <i>fru</i> isoforms with different DNA binding domains show a division of labor on male aggressive behaviors. A dominant role of <i>fru</i> in specifying sex-specific aggressive behavior may underscore a genetic mechanism that allows male-type aggressive behavior to evolve at least partially independently from courtship behavior, which is under different selective pressures.

Whether the courtship execution capability and upregulation of courtship toward females are specified through separable sex-determining genetic pathways remains uncharacterized. Here, we found that one of the two <i>Drosophila</i> sex-determining genes, <i>doublesex</i> (<i>dsx</i>), specifies a male-specific neuronal component that serves as an execution mechanism for courtship behavior, whereas <i>fruitless</i> (<i>fru</i>) is required for enhancement of courtship behavior toward females. The <i>dsx</i>-dependent courtship execution mechanism includes a specific subclass within a neuronal cluster that co-express <i>dsx</i> and <i>fru</i>. This cluster contains at least another subclass that is specified cooperatively by both <i>dsx</i> and <i>fru</i>. Although these neuronal populations can also promote aggressive behavior toward male flies, this capacity requires <i>fru</i>-dependent mechanisms. Our results uncover how sex-determining genes specify execution capability and female-specific enhancement of courtship behavior through separable yet cooperative neurogenetic mechanisms.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52525">Shape selection and mis-assembly in viral capsid formation by elastic                    frustration</a></h4>

The successful assembly of a closed protein shell (or capsid) is a key step in                    the replication of viruses and in the production of artificial viral cages for                    bio/nanotechnological applications. During self-assembly, the favorable binding                    energy competes with the energetic cost of the growing edge and the elastic                    stresses generated due to the curvature of the capsid. As a result, incomplete                    structures such as open caps, cylindrical or ribbon-shaped shells may emerge,                    preventing the successful replication of viruses. Using elasticity theory and                    coarse-grained simulations, we analyze the conditions required for these                    processes to occur and their significance for empty virus self-assembly. We find                    that the outcome of the assembly can be recast into a universal phase diagram                    showing that viruses with high mechanical resistance cannot be self-assembled                    directly as spherical structures. The results of our study justify the need of a                    maturation step and suggest promising routes to hinder viral infections by                    inducing mis-assembly.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52511">ERK3/MAPK6 controls IL-8 production and chemotaxis</a></h4>

ERK3 is a ubiquitously expressed member of the atypical mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and the physiological significance of its short half-life remains unclear. By employing gastrointestinal 3D organoids, we detect that ERK3 protein levels steadily decrease during epithelial differentiation. ERK3 is not required for 3D growth of human gastric epithelium. However, ERK3 is stabilized and activated in tumourigenic cells, but deteriorates over time in primary cells in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). ERK3 is necessary for production of several cellular factors including interleukin-8 (IL-8), in both, normal and tumourigenic cells. Particularly, ERK3 is critical for AP-1 signaling through its interaction and regulation of c-Jun protein. The secretome of ERK3 deficient cells is defective in chemotaxis of neutrophils and monocytes both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Further, knockdown of ERK3 reduces metastatic potential of invasive breast cancer cells. We unveil an ERK3-mediated regulation of IL-8 and epithelial secretome for chemotaxis.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52443">Reconfiguration of functional brain networks and metabolic cost converge during task performance</a></h4>

The ability to solve cognitive tasks depends upon adaptive changes in the organization of whole-brain functional networks. However, the link between task-induced network reconfigurations and their underlying energy demands is poorly understood. We address this by multimodal network analyses integrating functional and molecular neuroimaging acquired concurrently during a complex cognitive task. Task engagement elicited a marked increase in the association between glucose consumption and functional brain network reorganization. This convergence between metabolic and neural processes was specific to feedforward connections linking the visual and dorsal attention networks, in accordance with task requirements of visuo-spatial reasoning. Further increases in cognitive load above initial task engagement did not affect the relationship between metabolism and network reorganization but only modulated existing interactions. Our findings show how the upregulation of key computational mechanisms to support cognitive performance unveils the complex, interdependent changes in neural metabolism and neuro-vascular responses.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/51830">Phenotypic plasticity as a mechanism of cave colonization and adaptation</a></h4>

A widely accepted model for the evolution of cave animals posits colonization by surface ancestors followed by the acquisition of adaptations over many generations. However, the speed of cave adaptation in some species suggests mechanisms operating over shorter timescales. To address these mechanisms, we used <i>Astyanax mexicanus</i>, a teleost with ancestral surface morphs (surface fish, SF) and derived cave morphs (cavefish, CF). We exposed SF to completely dark conditions and identified numerous altered traits at both the gene expression and phenotypic levels. Remarkably, most of these alterations mimicked CF phenotypes. Our results indicate that many cave-related traits can appear within a single generation by phenotypic plasticity. In the next generation, plasticity can be further refined. The initial plastic responses are random in adaptive outcome but may determine the subsequent course of evolution. Our study suggests that phenotypic plasticity contributes to the rapid evolution of cave-related traits in <i>A. mexicanus</i>.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/51019">Replication Study: A coding-independent function of gene and pseudogene mRNAs regulates tumour biology</a></h4>

As part of the <a href="https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/home/">Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</a> we published a Registered Report (Khan et al., 2015), that described how we intended to replicate selected experiments from the paper "A coding-independent function of gene and pseudogene mRNAs regulates tumour biology" (Poliseno et al., 2010). Here we report the results. We found <i>PTEN</i> depletion in the prostate cancer cell line DU145 did not detectably impact expression of the corresponding pseudogene <i>PTENP1</i>. Similarly, depletion of <i>PTENP1</i> did not impact <i>PTEN</i> mRNA levels. The original study reported <i>PTEN</i> or <i>PTENP1</i> depletion statistically reduced the corresponding pseudogene or gene (Figure 2G; Poliseno et al., 2010). <i>PTEN</i> and/or <i>PTENP1</i> depletion in DU145 cells decreased PTEN protein expression, which was similar to the original study (Figure 2H; Poliseno et al., 2010). Further, depletion of <i>PTEN</i> and/or <i>PTENP1</i> increased DU145 proliferation compared to non-targeting siRNA, which was in the same direction as the original study (Figure 2F; Poliseno et al., 2010), but not statistically significant. We found <i>PTEN</i> 3'UTR overexpression in DU145 cells did not impact <i>PTENP1</i> expression, while the original study reported <i>PTEN</i> 3'UTR increased <i>PTENP1</i> levels (Figure 4A; Poliseno et al., 2010). Overexpression of <i>PTEN</i> 3'UTR also statistically decreased DU145 proliferation compared to controls, which was similar to the findings reported in the original study (Figure 4A; Poliseno et al., 2010). Differences between the original study and this replication attempt, such as level of knockdown efficiency and cellular confluence, are factors that might have influenced the results. Finally, where possible, we report meta-analyses for each result.

Astrocytes play essential roles in brain function by supporting synaptic connectivity and associated circuits. We found the transcription factor NFIA is required to maintain astrocyte function in the hippocampus through region-specific DNA binding mechanisms. Alterations in astrocyte-neuron communication disrupt hippocampal circuit function, resulting in impaired learning and memory behaviors.

Thiele et al. show that importin-α3 is one of the major nuclear transporters of NF-κB in the mammalian lung. High-level TNF-α-inducing HPAIVs inhibit importin-α3 mRNA transcription by interfering with its promoter activity. Thus, HPAIVs may evade antiviral immunity in the respiratory tract by generating a bottleneck in importin-α3 availability.

Borner et al. show that the visceral malaise (i.e., pica) that accompanies GDF15-induced anorexia persists after prolonged exposure, denoting the lack of improved tolerance. Further, the food-GDF15 pairing conditions a disgust/aversive response that contributes to anorexia and lasts beyond GDF15’s acute action. Reduced gastric emptying is not required for GDF15-induced anorexia/malaise.

Although modulating the neuronal cytoskeleton has been deemed a promising approach to enhance mammalian axon regeneration, only a few studies have shown convincing results, especially in the central nervous system. Wang et al. demonstrate that the deletion of non-muscle myosin II sufficiently induces significant mammalian CNS axon regeneration in vivo.

Chromosome 16p11.2 duplications dramatically increase schizophrenia risk. In this study, Bristow et al. show that the mutation in mice suppresses GABAergic neuron gene expression, disrupts activity in hippocampal-orbitofrontal-amygdaloid circuitry, and compromises sociability and cognitive function. This supports the concept that impairment of this network is a core component of schizophrenia.

Giess et al. introduce RCP-seq, a method to study small ribosomal subunit (SSU) dynamics in zebrafish. It reveals threading as the main mode of recruitment to the mRNA and quantifies the impact of sequence features that affect SSU processivity. By contrasting scanning to translating ribosomes, the study calculates initiation rates and redefines the optimal translation initiation context for zebrafish.

Venegas et al. employ an auxin-inducible degron system for different subunits of the SMC5/6 complex to interrogate the short- and long-term effects of SMC5/6 impairment in human cells. Degradation of SMC5/6’s subunits at different cell cycle stages places the essential role of the complex during S phase.

Ovarian tumors acquire new phenotypic features when exposed to anticancer therapy, which helps them endure the struggle for survival and increase malignancy. Using a six-layered multiomic approach, Ma et al. find that selective super-enhancer redistribution is a major driver of the acquisition of new phenotypic features.

The molecular chaperone TRAP1 regulates energy metabolism, and its activity is relevant in cancer and degenerative diseases. Here, Sanchez-Martin et al. identify highly selective allosteric inhibitors of TRAP1. These compounds revert biochemical and pro-neoplastic effects of TRAP1 and could both enlighten its mode of action and disclose novel therapeutic strategies.

Lau et al. show that interleukin-33 (IL-33) enhances microglial amyloid-beta clearance by inducing a subpopulation of MHC-II+ phagocytic microglia, which is, in turn, controlled by PU.1-dependent transcriptome reprogramming. Thus, the authors reveal an IL-33-PU.1 axis involved in transcriptional regulation that promotes beneficial microglial functions in Alzheimer’s disease.

Gravitropism and phototropism are important for sessile plants to adapt to various environments. Wang et al. show that gravity- or light-triggered asymmetric distribution of auxin induces the asymmetric expression of SAUR19 subfamily genes by ARF7 and ARF19, which directs the bending growth of Arabidopsis hypocotyls.

Zhang et al. find that a NR2F1-R112K mutation promotes inhibitory neuron differentiation by activating the Hedgehog signaling pathway, and corresponding mutant mice display behavioral deficits related to neurodevelopmental disorders, including autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), which could be partially alleviated by antagonizing the inhibitory synaptic transmission.

Early neuronal development is a well-coordinated process in which neuronal stem cells differentiate into polarized neurons. This process has been well studied in classical non-human model systems, but to what extent this is recapitulated in human neurons remains unclear. To study neuronal polarization in human neurons, we cultured human iPSC-derived neurons, characterized early developmental stages, measured electrophysiological responses, and systematically profiled transcriptomic and proteomic dynamics during these steps. We found extensive remodeling of the neuron transcriptome and proteome, with altered mRNA expression of ~1,100 genes and different expression profiles of ~1,500 proteins during neuronal differentiation and polarization. We also identified a distinct stage in axon development marked by an increase in microtubule remodeling and apparent relocation of the axon initial segment from the distal to proximal axon. Our comprehensive characterization and quantitative map of transcriptome and proteome dynamics provides a solid framework for studying polarization in human neurons.

In theory, neurons can compute all threshold functions, but in practice, synaptic weight resolution limits their computing capacity. Here, we study how dendrites alleviate this practical limitation by demonstrating a computation where dendrites considerably decrease the necessary synaptic weights resolution. We show how a biophysical neuron model with two passive dendrites and a soma that can implement this computation more efficiently than a point neuron. The latter requires synaptic weight orders of magnitudes larger than the others, the former implement the computation with equivalent synaptic weights. This work paves the way for a new generation of neuromorphic chips composed of dendritic neurons. These chips will require less space and less energy to function.

Although visual awareness of an object typically increases neural responses, we identify a neural response that increases prior to perceptual disappearances, and that scales with the amount of invisibility reported during perceptual filling-in. These findings challenge long-held assumptions regarding the neural correlates of consciousness and entrained visually evoked potentials, by showing that the strength of stimulus-specific neural activity can encode the conscious absence of a stimulus.

Peripheral and central administration of glucose potently enhance cognitive functions. The present experiments examined changes in brain extracellular glucose levels while rats were trained to solve hippocampus-sensitive place or striatum-sensitive response learning tasks for food or water reward. During the first minutes of either place or response training, extracellular glucose levels declined in both the hippocampus and striatum, an effect not seen in untrained, rewarded rats. Subsequently, glucose increased in both brain areas under all training conditions, approaching asymptotic levels ~15-25 min into training. Compared to untrained-food controls, training with food reward resulted in significant increases in the hippocampus but not striatum; striatal levels exhibited large increases to food intake in both trained and untrained groups. In the rats trained to find water, glucose levels increased significantly above the values seen in untrained rats in both hippocampus and striatum. The present findings suggest that decreases in glucose early in training might reflect an increase in brain glucose consumption, perhaps triggering increased brain uptake of glucose from blood, as evident in the increases in glucose late in training. Together with past findings measuring lactate levels under the same conditions, the initial decreases in glucose may also stimulate increased production of lactate from astrocytes to support neural metabolism directly and/or to act as a signal to increase blood flow and glucose uptake into the brain.

The cerebral cortex contains neurons that express choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and are a potential local source of acetylcholine. However, the neurotransmitters released by cortical ChAT+ neurons and their synaptic connectivity are unknown. We show that the nearly all cortical ChAT+ neurons are specialized VIP+ interneurons that release GABA strongly onto other inhibitory interneurons and acetylcholine sparsely onto layer 1 interneurons and other VIP+/ChAT+ interneurons. This differential transmission of ACh and GABA based on the postsynaptic target neuron is reflected in VIP+/ChAT+ interneuron pre-synaptic terminals, as quantitative molecular analysis shows that only a subset of these are specialized to release acetylcholine. In addition, we identify a separate, sparse population of non-VIP ChAT+ neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex with a distinct developmental origin that robustly release acetylcholine in layer 1. These results demonstrate both cortex-region heterogeneity in cortical ChAT+ interneurons and target-specific co-release of acetylcholine and GABA.

Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and is characterized by the loss of ability to control voluntary movements. Predictive biomarkers of progression in Parkinson's Disease are urgently needed to expedite the development of neuroprotective treatments and facilitate discussions about disease prognosis between clinicians and patients. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) shows promise in predicting progression, with derived measures, including regional homogeneity (ReHo) and fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF), having been previously been associated with current disease severity. In this work, ReHo and fALFF features from 82 Parkinson's Disease subjects are used to train machine learning predictors of baseline clinical severity and progression at 1 year, 2 years, and 4 years follow-up as measured by the Movement Disorder Society Unified Depression Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) score. This is the first time that rs-fMRI and machine learning have been combined to predict future disease progression. The machine learning models explain up to 30.4% (R^2 = 0.304) of the variance in baseline MDS-UPDRS scores, 55.8% (R^2 = 0.558) of the variance in year 1 scores, and 47.1% (R^2 = 0.471) of the variance in year 2 scores with high statistical significance (p &lt; 0.0001). For distinguishing high- and low-progression individuals (MDS-UPDRS score above or below the median), the models achieve positive predictive values of up to 71% and negative predictive values of up to 84%. The models learn patterns of ReHo and fALFF measures that predict better and worse prognoses. Higher ReHo and fALFF in regions of the default motor network predicted lower current severity and lower future progression. The rs-fMRI features in the temporal lobe, limbic system, and motor cortex were also identified as predictors. These results present a potential neuroimaging biomarker that accurately predicts progression, which may be useful as a clinical decision-making tool and in future trials of neuroprotective treatments.

Pathogenic germline mutations in PIGV lead to glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis deficiency. Individuals with pathogenic biallelic mutations in genes of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor pathway show cognitive impairments, a motor delay and in many cases epilepsy. Thus far, the pathophysiology underlying the disease remains unclear and suitable rodent models that mirror human pathophysiology have not been available. We therefore generated a mouse model using CRISPR-Cas9 to introduce the most prevalent hypomorphic missense mutation in European patients, at a site that is also conserved in mice, Pigv:c.1022C&gt;A (p.A341E). Reflecting the human pathology mutant Pigv341E mice showed deficits in motor coordination and cognitive impairment with poorer long-term spatial memory than wild-type mice, as well as alterations in sociability and sleep patterns. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry showed decreased synaptophysin-immunoreactivity and electrophysiology recordings demonstrated reduced hippocampal synaptic transmission in Pigv341E mice that may underlie impaired memory formation. To gain a deeper and broader molecular understanding of the consequences of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor deficiency, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on acutely isolated hippocampal cells of Pigv341E and wild-type mice. We found that hippocampal cells from adult Pigv341E mice exhibited changes in gene expression, most prominently in a subtype of microglia and subicular neurons. A significant reduction of Abl1 transcripts in several cell clusters suggests a link to the signaling pathway of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored ephrins. We also observed increased levels of Hdc that might affect histamine metabolism with consequences in circadian rhythm. In summary, we present here the first mouse model with a patient-specific hypomorphic mutation that mirrors the human phenotype and shows a hippocampal synaptic defect. This new mouse model will not only open the doors for further investigation into the pathophysiology of glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis deficiency in future studies, but will also deepen our understanding in the role of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor related pathways in brain development.

The sodium channel NaV1.7 is a master regulator of nociceptive neuronal firing. Mutations in this channel can result in painful conditions as well as produce insensitivity to pain. Despite being recognized as a 'poster child' for nociceptive signaling and human pain, targeting NaV1.7 has not yet produced a clinical drug. Recent work has illuminated the NaV1.7 interactome, offering insights into the regulation of these channels and identifying potentially new druggable targets. Amongst the regulators of NaV1.7 is the cytosolic collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2). CRMP2, modified at Lysine 374 (K374) by addition of a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO), bound NaV1.7 to regulate its membrane localization and function. Corollary to this, preventing CRMP2 SUMOylation was sufficient to reverse mechanical allodynia in rats with neuropathic pain. Notably, loss of CRMP2 SUMOylation did not compromise other innate functions of CRMP2. To further elucidate the in vivo role of CRMP2 SUMOylation in pain, we generated CRMP2 K374A knock-in (CRMP2K374A/K374A) mice in which Lys374 was replaced with Ala. CRMP2K374A/K374A mice had reduced NaV1.7 membrane localization and function in female, but not male, sensory neurons. Behavioral appraisal of CRMP2K374A/K374A mice demonstrated no changes in depressive or repetitive, compulsive-like behaviors, and a decrease in noxious thermal sensitivity. No changes were observed in CRMP2K374A/K374A mice to inflammatory, acute, or visceral pain. In contrast, in a neuropathic model, CRMP2K374A/K374A mice failed to develop persistent mechanical allodynia. Our study suggests that CRMP2 SUMOylation-dependent control of peripheral NaV1.7 is a hallmark of chronic, but not physiological, neuropathic pain.

Classical systems neuroscience positions primary sensory areas as early feed-forward processing stations for refining incoming sensory information. This view may oversimplify their role given extensive bi-directional connectivity with multimodal cortical and subcortical regions. Here we show that single units in human primary somatosensory cortex encode imagined reaches centered on imagined limb positions in a cognitive motor task. This result suggests a broader role of primary somatosensory cortex in cortical function than previously demonstrated.

<p>by Semidán Robaina-Estévez, Zoran Nikoloski</p>

Biological networks across scales exhibit hierarchical organization that may constrain network function. Yet, understanding how these hierarchies arise due to the operational constraint of the networks and whether they impose limits to molecular phenotypes remains elusive. Here we show that metabolic networks include a hierarchy of reactions based on a natural flux ordering that holds for every steady state. We find that the hierarchy of reactions is reflected in experimental measurements of transcript, protein and flux levels of <i>Escherichia coli</i> under various growth conditions as well as in the catalytic rate constants of the corresponding enzymes. Our findings point at resource partitioning and a fine-tuning of enzyme levels in <i>E. coli</i> to respect the constraints imposed by the network structure at steady state. Since reactions in upper layers of the hierarchy impose an upper bound on the flux of the reactions downstream, the hierarchical organization of metabolism due to the flux ordering has direct applications in metabolic engineering.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qQph3EDddVU" width="1" />

<p>by Lisa-Katrin Schätzle, Ali Hadizadeh Esfahani, Andreas Schuppert</p>

Translational models directly relating drug response specific processes that can be observed <i>in vitro</i> to their <i>in vivo</i> role in cancer patients constitute a crucial part of the development of personalized medication. Unfortunately, current studies often focus on the optimization of isolated model characteristics instead of examining the overall modeling workflow and the interplay of the individual model components. Moreover, they are often limited to specific data sets only. Therefore, they are often confined by the irreproducibility of the results and the non-transferability of the approaches into other contexts. In this study, we present a thorough investigation of translational models and their ability to predict the drug responses of cancer patients originating from diverse data sets using the R-package FORESEE. By systematically scanning the modeling space for optimal combinations of different model settings, we can determine models of extremely high predictivity and work out a few modeling guidelines that promote simplicity. Yet, we identify noise within the data, sample size effects, and drug unspecificity as factors that deteriorate the models’ robustness. Moreover, we show that cell line models of high accuracy do not necessarily excel in predicting drug response processes in patients. We therefore hope to motivate future research to consider <i>in vivo</i> aspects more carefully to ultimately generate deeper insights into applicable precision medicine.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IvU2KaKPQNI" width="1" />

<p>by Weimin Wu, Norman R. Watts, Naiqian Cheng, Rick Huang, Alasdair C. Steven, Paul T. Wingfield</p>

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a leading cause of liver disease. The capsid is an essential component of the virion and it is therefore of interest how it assembles and disassembles. The capsid protein is unusual both for its rare fold and that it polymerizes according to two different icosahedral symmetries, causing the polypeptide chain to exist in seven quasi-equivalent environments: A, B, and C in AB and CC dimers in T = 3 capsids, and A, B, C, and D in AB and CD dimers in T = 4 capsids. We have compared the two capsids by cryo-EM at 3.5 Å resolution. To ensure a valid comparison, the two capsids were prepared and imaged under identical conditions. We find that the chains have different conformations and potential energies, with the T = 3 C chain having the lowest. Three of the four quasi-equivalent dimers are asymmetric with respect to conformation and potential energy; however, the T = 3 CC dimer is symmetrical and has the lowest potential energy although its intra-dimer interface has the least free energy of formation. Of all the inter-dimer interfaces, the CB interface has the least area and free energy, in both capsids. From the calculated energies of higher-order groupings of dimers discernible in the lattices we predict early assembly intermediates, and indeed we observe such structures by negative stain EM of <i>in vitro</i> assembly reactions. By sequence analysis and computational alanine scanning we identify key residues and motifs involved in capsid assembly. Our results explain several previously reported observations on capsid assembly, disassembly, and dimorphism.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1gKDlqd1oAs" width="1" />

Recent years have seen rising incidence of dengue and large outbreaks of Zika and chikungunya, which are all caused by viruses transmitted by <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquitoes. In most settings, the primary intervention against <i>Aedes</i>-transmitted viruses is vector control, such as indoor, ultra-low volume (ULV) spraying. Targeted indoor residual spraying (TIRS) has the potential to more effectively impact <i>Aedes</i>-borne diseases, but its implementation requires careful planning and evaluation. The optimal time to deploy these interventions and their relative epidemiological effects are, however, not well understood. We used an agent-based model of dengue virus transmission calibrated to data from Iquitos, Peru to assess the epidemiological effects of these interventions under differing strategies for deploying them. Specifically, we compared strategies where spray application was initiated when incidence rose above a threshold based on incidence in recent years to strategies where spraying occurred at the same time(s) each year. In the absence of spraying, the model predicted 361,000 infections [inter-quartile range (IQR): 347,000–383,000] in the period 2000–2010. The ULV strategy with the fewest median infections was spraying twice yearly, in March and October, which led to a median of 172,000 infections [IQR: 158,000–183,000], a 52% reduction from baseline. Compared to spraying once yearly in September, the best threshold-based strategy utilizing ULV had fewer median infections (254,000 vs. 261,000), but required more spraying (351 vs. 274 days). For TIRS, the best strategy was threshold-based, which led to the fewest infections of all strategies tested (9,900; [IQR: 8,720–11,400], a 94% reduction), and required fewer days spraying than the equivalent ULV strategy (280). Although spraying twice each year is likely to avert the most infections, our results indicate that a threshold-based strategy can become an alternative to better balance the translation of spraying effort into impact, particularly if used with a residual insecticide.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QKd-nkAFWE0" width="1" />

<p>by Jan Peters, Mark D’Esposito</p>

Sequential sampling models such as the drift diffusion model (DDM) have a long tradition in research on perceptual decision-making, but mounting evidence suggests that these models can account for response time (RT) distributions that arise during reinforcement learning and value-based decision-making. Building on this previous work, we implemented the DDM as the choice rule in inter-temporal choice (temporal discounting) and risky choice (probability discounting) using hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation. We validated our approach in data from nine patients with focal lesions to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex / medial orbitofrontal cortex (vmPFC/mOFC) and nineteen age- and education-matched controls. Model comparison revealed that, for both tasks, the data were best accounted for by a variant of the drift diffusion model including a non-linear mapping from value-differences to trial-wise drift rates. Posterior predictive checks confirmed that this model provided a superior account of the relationship between value and RT. We then applied this modeling framework and 1) reproduced our previous results regarding temporal discounting in vmPFC/mOFC patients and 2) showed in a previously unpublished data set on risky choice that vmPFC/mOFC patients exhibit increased risk-taking relative to controls. Analyses of DDM parameters revealed that patients showed substantially increased non-decision times and reduced response caution during risky choice. In contrast, vmPFC/mOFC damage abolished neither scaling nor asymptote of the drift rate. Relatively intact value processing was also confirmed using DDM mixture models, which revealed that in both groups &gt;98% of trials were better accounted for by a DDM with value modulation than by a null model without value modulation. Our results highlight that novel insights can be gained from applying sequential sampling models in studies of inter-temporal and risky decision-making in cognitive neuroscience.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4-f6shlX5Ys" width="1" />

<p>by Robert P. Gowers, Yulia Timofeeva, Magnus J. E. Richardson</p>

Analytical forms for neuronal firing rates are important theoretical tools for the analysis of network states. Since the 1960s, the majority of approaches have treated neurons as being electrically compact and therefore isopotential. These approaches have yielded considerable insight into how single-cell properties affect network activity; however, many neuronal classes, such as cortical pyramidal cells, are electrically extended objects. Calculation of the complex flow of electrical activity driven by stochastic spatio-temporal synaptic input streams in these structures has presented a significant analytical challenge. Here we demonstrate that an extension of the level-crossing method of Rice, previously used for compact cells, provides a general framework for approximating the firing rate of neurons with spatial structure. Even for simple models, the analytical approximations derived demonstrate a surprising richness including: independence of the firing rate to the electrotonic length for certain models, but with a form distinct to the point-like leaky integrate-and-fire model; a non-monotonic dependence of the firing rate on the number of dendrites receiving synaptic drive; a significant effect of the axonal and somatic load on the firing rate; and the role that the trigger position on the axon for spike initiation has on firing properties. The approach necessitates only calculating the mean and variances of the non-thresholded voltage and its rate of change in neuronal structures subject to spatio-temporal synaptic fluctuations. The combination of simplicity and generality promises a framework that can be built upon to incorporate increasing levels of biophysical detail and extend beyond the low-rate firing limit treated in this paper.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/y8Nf5bPog3Y" width="1" />

<p>by Wei Shi, Yanan Jiang, Yibin Deng, Zigang Dong, Bin Liu</p>

Transcription activation by cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein (CAP) is the classic paradigm of transcription regulation in bacteria. CAP was suggested to activate transcription on class-II promoters via a recruitment and isomerization mechanism. However, whether and how it modifies RNA polymerase (RNAP) to initiate transcription remains unclear. Here, we report cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of an intact <i>Escherichia coli</i> class-II CAP-dependent transcription activation complex (CAP-TAC) with and without de novo RNA transcript. The structures reveal two distinct architectures of TAC and raise the possibility that CAP binding may induce substantial conformational changes in all the subunits of RNAP and transiently widen the main cleft of RNAP to facilitate DNA promoter entering and formation of the initiation open complex. These structural changes vanish during further RNA transcript synthesis. The observations in this study may reveal a possible on-pathway intermediate and suggest a possibility that CAP activates transcription by inducing intermediate state, in addition to the previously proposed stabilization mechanism.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/IL2sq4EEp9s" width="1" />

<p>by Florence Kermen, Pradeep Lal, Nicholas G. Faturos, Emre Yaksi</p>

Interhemispheric connections enable interaction and integration of sensory information in bilaterian nervous systems and are thought to optimize sensory computations. However, the cellular and spatial organization of interhemispheric networks and the computational properties they mediate in vertebrates are still poorly understood. Thus, it remains unclear to what extent the connectivity between left and right brain hemispheres participates in sensory processing. Here, we show that the zebrafish olfactory bulbs (OBs) receive direct interhemispheric projections from their contralateral counterparts in addition to top-down inputs from the contralateral zebrafish homolog of olfactory cortex. The direct interhemispheric projections between the OBs reach peripheral layers of the contralateral OB and retain a precise topographic organization, which directly connects similarly tuned olfactory glomeruli across hemispheres. In contrast, interhemispheric top-down inputs consist of diffuse projections that broadly innervate the inhibitory granule cell layer. Jointly, these interhemispheric connections elicit a balance of topographically organized excitation and nontopographic inhibition on the contralateral OB and modulate odor responses. We show that the interhemispheric connections in the olfactory system enable the modulation of odor response and contribute to a small but significant improvement in the detection of a reproductive pheromone when presented together with complex olfactory cues by potentiating the response of the pheromone selective neurons. Taken together, our data show a previously unknown function for an interhemispheric connection between chemosensory maps of the olfactory system.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Jo-Gyw42cMs" width="1" />

Countering the rise of antibiotic-resistant pathogens requires improved understanding of how resistance emerges and spreads in individual species, which are often embedded in complex microbial communities such as the human gut microbiome. Interactions with other microorganisms in such communities might suppress growth and resistance evolution of individual species (e.g., via resource competition) but could also potentially accelerate resistance evolution via horizontal transfer of resistance genes. It remains unclear how these different effects balance out, partly because it is difficult to observe them directly. Here, we used a gut microcosm approach to quantify the effect of three human gut microbiome communities on growth and resistance evolution of a focal strain of <i>Escherichia coli</i>. We found the resident microbial communities not only suppressed growth and colonisation by focal <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> but also prevented it from evolving antibiotic resistance upon exposure to a beta-lactam antibiotic. With samples from all three human donors, our focal <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> strain only evolved antibiotic resistance in the absence of the resident microbial community, even though we found resistance genes, including a highly effective resistance plasmid, in resident microbial communities. We identified physical constraints on plasmid transfer that can explain why our focal strain failed to acquire some of these beneficial resistance genes, and we found some chromosomal resistance mutations were only beneficial in the absence of the resident microbiota. This suggests, depending on in situ gene transfer dynamics, interactions with resident microbiota can inhibit antibiotic-resistance evolution of individual species.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/7BukWKQPzEA" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To explore the prevalence of the perfusion‐weighted imaging (PWI)–diffusion‐weighted imaging (DWI) mismatch and response to intravenous thrombolysis in the WAKE‐UP trial.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a prespecified post hoc analysis of ischemic stroke patients screened for DWI–fluid‐attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) mismatch in WAKE‐UP who underwent PWI. We defined PWI‐DWI mismatch as ischemic core volume &lt; 70ml, mismatch volume &gt; 10ml, and mismatch ratio &gt; 1.2. Primary efficacy end point was a modified Rankin Scale score of 0–1 at 90 days, adjusted for age and symptom severity.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 1,362 magnetic resonance imaging–screened patients, 431 underwent PWI. Of these, 57 (13%) had a double mismatch, 151 (35%) only a DWI‐FLAIR mismatch, and 54 (13%) only a PWI‐DWI mismatch. DWI‐FLAIR mismatch was more prevalent than PWI‐DWI mismatch (48%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 43–53% vs 26%, 95% CI = 22–30%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Screening for either one of the mismatch profiles resulted in a yield of 61% (95% CI = 56–65%). Prevalence of PWI‐DWI mismatch was similar in patients with (27%) or without (24%) DWI‐FLAIR mismatch (<i>p</i> = 0.52). In an exploratory analysis in the small subgroup of 208 randomized patients with PWI, PWI‐DWI mismatch status did not modify the treatment response (<i>p</i> for interaction = 0.73).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Evaluating both the DWI‐FLAIR and PWI‐DWI mismatch patterns in patients with unknown time of stroke onset will result in the highest yield of thrombolysis treatment. The treatment benefit of alteplase in patients with a DWI‐FLAIR mismatch seems to be driven not merely by the presence of a PWI‐DWI mismatch, although this analysis was underpowered.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>There is much controversy about the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the effects of sleep‐disordered breathing on the brain. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between markers of sleep‐related hypoxemia and brain anatomy.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used data from a large‐scale cohort from the general population (n = 775, 50.6% males, age range = 45–86 years, mean age = 60.3 ± 9.9) that underwent full polysomnography and brain magnetic resonance imaging to correlate respiratory variables with regional brain volume estimates.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>After adjusting for age, gender, and cardiovascular risk factors, only mean oxygen saturation during sleep was associated with bilateral volume of hippocampus (right: <i>p</i> = 0.001; left: <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), thalamus (right: <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001; left: <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), putamen (right: <i>p</i> = 0.001; left: <i>p</i> = 0.001), and angular gyrus (right: <i>p</i> = 0.011; left: <i>p</i> = 0.001). We observed the same relationship in left hemispheric amygdala (<i>p</i> = 0.010), caudate (<i>p</i> = 0.008), inferior frontal gyrus (<i>p</i> = 0.004), and supramarginal gyrus (<i>p</i> = 0.003). The other respiratory variables—lowest oxygen saturation, percentage of sleep time with oxygen saturation &lt; 90%, apnea–hypopnea index, and oxygen desaturation index—did not show any significant association with brain volumes.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Lower mean oxygen saturation during sleep was associated with atrophy of cortical and subcortical brain areas known for high sensitivity to oxygen supply. Their vulnerability to hypoxemia may contribute to behavioral phenotype and cognitive decline in patients with sleep‐disordered breathing. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) regulates life‐sustaining functions ranging from appetite and digestion to heart rate and breathing. It is also the brain’s primary sensory nucleus for visceral sensations relevant to symptoms in medical and psychiatric disorders. To better understand which neurons may exert top‐down control over the NTS, here we provide a brain‐wide map of all neurons that project axons directly to the caudal, viscerosensory NTS, focusing on a medial subregion with aldosterone‐sensitive HSD2 neurons. Injecting an axonal tracer (cholera toxin b) into the NTS produces a similar pattern of retrograde labeling in rats and mice. The paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH), lateral hypothalamic area, and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) contain the densest concentrations of NTS‐projecting neurons. PVH afferents are glutamatergic (express <i>Slc17a6</i>/Vglut2) and are distinct from neuroendocrine PVH neurons. CeA afferents are GABAergic (express <i>Slc32a1</i>/Vgat) and are distributed largely in the medial CeA subdivision. Other retrogradely labeled neurons are located in a variety of brain regions, including the cerebral cortex (insular and infralimbic areas), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, periaqueductal gray, Barrington’s nucleus, Kölliker‐Fuse nucleus, hindbrain reticular formation, and rostral NTS. Similar patterns of retrograde labeling result from tracer injections into different NTS subdivisions, with dual retrograde tracing revealing that many afferent neurons project axon collaterals to both the lateral and medial NTS subdivisions. This information provides a roadmap for studying descending axonal projections that may influence visceromotor systems and visceral “mind–body” symptoms.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Prospectively characterize changes in serum proteins following sport‐related concussion and determine whether candidate biomarkers discriminate concussed athletes from controls and are associated with duration of symptoms following concussion.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>High school and collegiate athletes were enrolled between 2015 and 2018. Blood was collected at preinjury baseline and within 6 hours (early acute) and at 24 to 48 hours (late acute) following concussion in football players (n = 106), matched uninjured football players (n = 84), and non–contact‐sport athletes (n = 50). Glial fibrillary acidic protein, ubiquitin c‐terminal hydrolase‐L1, S100 calcium binding protein B, alpha‐II‐spectrin breakdown product 150, interleukin 6, interleukin 1 receptor antagonist, and c‐reactive protein were measured in serum. Linear models assessed changes in protein concentrations over time. Receiver operating curves quantified the discrimination of concussed athletes from controls. A Cox proportional hazard model determined whether proteins were associated with symptom recovery.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>All proteins except glial fibrillary acidic protein and c‐reactive protein were significantly elevated at the early acute phase postinjury relative to baseline and both control groups and discriminated concussed athletes from controls with areas under the curve of 0.68 to 0.84. The candidate biomarkers also significantly improved the discrimination of concussed athletes from noncontact controls compared to symptom severity alone. Glial fibrillary acidic protein was elevated postinjury relative to baseline in concussed athletes with a loss of consciousness or amnesia. Finally, early acute levels of interleukin 1 receptor antagonist were associated with the number of days to symptom recovery.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Brain injury and inflammatory proteins show promise as objective diagnostic biomarkers for sport‐related concussion, and inflammatory markers may provide prognostic value. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

Abstract
<p>The ability to mentally travel to specific events from one’s past, dubbed episodic autobiographical memory (E-AM), contributes to adaptive functioning. Nonetheless, the mechanisms underlying its typical interindividual variation remain poorly understood. To address this issue, we capitalize on existing evidence that successful performance on E-AM tasks draws on the ability to visualize past episodes and reinstate their unique spatiotemporal context. Hence, here, we test whether features of the brain’s functional architecture relevant to perceptual versus conceptual processes shape individual differences in both self-rated E-AM and laboratory-based episodic memory (EM) for random visual scene sequences (visual EM). We propose that superior subjective E-AM and visual EM are associated with greater similarity in static neural organization patterns, potentially indicating greater efficiency in switching, between rest and mental states relevant to encoding perceptual information. Complementarily, we postulate that impoverished subjective E-AM and visual EM are linked to dynamic brain organization patterns implying a predisposition towards semanticizing novel perceptual information. Analyses were conducted on resting state and task-based fMRI data from 329 participants (160 women) in the Human Connectome Project (HCP) who completed visual and verbal EM assessments, and an independent gender diverse sample (<i>N</i> = 59) who self-rated their E-AM. Interindividual differences in subjective E-AM were linked to the same neural mechanisms underlying visual, but not verbal, EM, in general agreement with the hypothesized static and dynamic brain organization patterns. Our results suggest that higher E-AM entails more efficient processing of temporally extended information sequences, whereas lower E-AM entails more efficient semantic or gist-based processing.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57892">Improving on legacy conferences by moving online</a></h4>

Scientific conferences and meetings have an important role in research, but they also suffer from a number of disadvantages: in particular, they can have a massive carbon footprint, they are time-consuming, and the high costs involved in attending can exclude many potential participants. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the cancellation of many conferences, forcing the scientific community to explore online alternatives. Here, we report on our experiences of organizing an online neuroscience conference, neuromatch, that attracted some 3000 participants and featured two days of talks, debates, panel discussions, and one-on-one meetings facilitated by a matching algorithm. By offering most of the benefits of traditional conferences, several clear advantages, and with fewer of the downsides, we feel that online conferences have the potential to replace many legacy conferences.

The human fungal pathogen <i>Cryptococcus deuterogattii</i> is RNAi-deficient and lacks active transposons in its genome. <i>C. deuterogattii</i> has regional centromeres that contain only transposon relics. To investigate impact of centromere loss on the <i>C. deuterogattii</i> genome, either centromere 9 or 10 was deleted. Deletion of either centromere resulted in neocentromere formation and interestingly, the genes covered by these neocentromeres maintained wild-type expression levels. In contrast to <i>cen9</i>∆ mutants, <i>cen10</i>Δ mutant strains exhibited growth defects and were aneuploid for chromosome 10. At an elevated growth temperature (37°C), the <i>cen10</i>Δ chromosome was found to have undergone fusion with another native chromosome in some isolates and this fusion restored wild-type growth. Following chromosomal fusion, the neocentromere was inactivated, and the native centromere of the fused chromosome served as the active centromere. The neocentromere formation and chromosomal fusion events observed in this study in <i>C. deuterogattii</i> may be similar to events that triggered genomic changes within the <i>Cryptococcus</i>/<i>Kwoniella</i> species complex and may contribute to speciation throughout the eukaryotic domain.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55613">Low-frequency neural activity reflects rule-based chunking during speech listening</a></h4>

Chunking is a key mechanism for sequence processing. Studies on speech sequences have suggested low-frequency cortical activity tracks spoken phrases, i.e., chunks of words defined by tacit linguistic knowledge. Here we investigate whether low-frequency cortical activity reflects a general mechanism for sequence chunking and can track chunks defined by temporarily learned artificial rules. The experiment records magnetoencephalographic (MEG) responses to a sequence of spoken words. To dissociate word properties from the chunk structures, two tasks separately require listeners to group pairs of semantically similar or semantically dissimilar words into chunks. In the MEG spectrum, a clear response is observed at the chunk rate. More importantly, the chunk-rate response is task-dependent. It is phase locked to chunk boundaries, instead of the semantic relatedness between words. The results strongly suggest that cortical activity can track chunks constructed based on task-related rules and potentially reflects a general mechanism for chunk-level representations.

Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) play an important role in synaptic plasticity and memory and are largely classified based on amino acid sequence homology and pharmacological properties. Among group III metabotropic glutamate receptors, mGluR7 and mGluR4 show high relative expression in the rat hippocampal area CA2. Group III metabotropic glutamate receptors are known to down-regulate cAMP-dependent signaling pathways via the activation of G<sub>i/o</sub> proteins. Here, we provide evidence that inhibition of group III mGluRs by specific antagonists permits an NMDA receptor- and protein synthesis-dependent long-lasting synaptic potentiation in the apparently long-term potentiation (LTP)-resistant Schaffer collateral (SC)-CA2 synapses. Moreover, long-lasting potentiation of these synapses transforms a transient synaptic potentiation of the entorhinal cortical (EC)-CA2 synapses into a stable long-lasting LTP, in accordance with the synaptic tagging/capture hypothesis (STC). Furthermore, this study also sheds light on the role of ERK/MAPK protein signaling and the downregulation of STEP protein in the group III mGluR inhibition-mediated plasticity in the hippocampal CA2 region, identifying them as critical molecular players. Thus, the regulation of group III mGluRs provides a conducive environment for the SC-CA2 synapses to respond to events that could lead to activity-dependent synaptic plasticity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54519">Behavioral evidence for memory replay of video episodes in the macaque</a></h4>

Humans recall the past by replaying fragments of events temporally. Here, we demonstrate a similar effect in macaques. We trained six rhesus monkeys with a temporal-order judgement (TOJ) task and collected 5000 TOJ trials. In each trial, they watched a naturalistic video of about 10 s comprising two across-context clips, and after a 2-s delay, performed TOJ between two frames from the video. The data is suggestive of a non-linear, time-compressed forward memory replay mechanism in the macaque. In contrast with humans, such compression of replay is however not sophisticated enough to allow them to skip over irrelevant information by compressing the encoded video globally. We also reveal that the monkeys detect event contextual boundaries and such detection facilitates recall by an increased rate of information accumulation. Demonstration of a time-compressed, forward replay-like pattern in the macaque provides insights into the evolution of episodic memory in our lineage.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54304">Progenitors oppositely polarize WNT activators and inhibitors to orchestrate tissue development</a></h4>

To spatially co-exist and differentially specify fates within developing tissues, morphogenetic cues must be correctly positioned and interpreted. Here, we investigate mouse hair follicle development to understand how morphogens operate within closely spaced, fate-diverging progenitors. Coupling transcriptomics with genetics, we show that emerging hair progenitors produce both WNTs and WNT inhibitors. Surprisingly, however, instead of generating a negative feedback loop, the signals oppositely polarize, establishing sharp boundaries and consequently a short-range morphogen gradient that we show is essential for three-dimensional pattern formation. By establishing a morphogen gradient at the cellular level, signals become constrained. The progenitor preserves its WNT signaling identity and maintains WNT signaling with underlying mesenchymal neighbors, while its overlying epithelial cells become WNT-restricted. The outcome guarantees emergence of adjacent distinct cell types to pattern the tissue.

More often than not, action potentials fail to trigger neurotransmitter release. And even when neurotransmitter is released, the resulting change in synaptic conductance is highly variable. Given the energetic cost of generating and propagating action potentials, and the importance of information transmission across synapses, this seems both wasteful and inefficient. However, synaptic noise arising from variable transmission can improve, in certain restricted conditions, information transmission.

Bartolo and Averbeck show that primates infer changes in reward contingencies, consistent with Bayesian inference strategies, incorporating knowledge about task structure to quickly adjust their behavior. Posterior probability estimates correlate with neural ensemble activity in prefrontal cortex, suggesting that the brain implements Bayesian-like mechanisms for state inference.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.20.050864v1?rss=1">Motor and non-motor sequence prediction is equally affected in children with Developmental Coordination Disorder</a></h4>

Children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) are diagnosed based on motor difficulties. However, they also exhibit difficulties in several other cognitive domains, including visuospatial processing, executive functioning and attention. One account of the difficulties seen in DCD proposes an impairment in internal forward modelling, i.e., the ability to (i) detect regularities of a repetitive perceptual or motor pattern, (ii) ;predict future outcomes of motor actions, and (iii) adapt behaviour accordingly. Using electroencephalographic recordings, the present study aimed to delineate these different aspects of internal forward modelling across several domains. To this end, 24 children with DCD and 23 typically-developing children (aged 7-10 years) completed a serial prediction task in the visual, temporal, spatial and motor domains. This task required them to learn short sequences and to indicate whether a sequence was disrupted towards its end. Analyses revealed that, across all domains, children with DCD showed poorer discrimination between intact and disrupted sequences, accompanied by a delayed late parietal positivity elicited by disrupted sequences. These results indicate an impairment in explicit sequence discrimination in DCD across motor and cognitive domains. However, there is no evidence for an impairment in implicit performance on the motor task in DCD. These results suggest an impairment of the updating of an internal forward model in DCD resulting in a blurred representation of that model and consequently in a reduced ability to detect regularities in the environment (e.g., sequences). Such a detailed understanding of internal forward modelling in DCD could help to explain the wide range of co-occurring difficulties experienced by those with a diagnosis of DCD.

PRESENILIN 2 (PSEN2) is one of the genes mutated in early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (EOfAD). PSEN2 shares significant amino acid sequence identity with another EOfAD-related gene PRESENILIN 1 (PSEN1), and partial functional redundancy is seen between these two genes. However, the complete range of functions of PSEN1 and PSEN2 is not yet understood. In this study, we performed targeted mutagenesis of the zebrafish psen2 gene to generate a premature termination codon close downstream of the translation start with the intention of creating a null mutation. Homozygotes for this mutation, psen2S4Ter, are viable and fertile, and adults do not show any gross pigmentation defects, arguing against significant loss of {gamma}-secretase activity. Also, assessment of the numbers of Dorsal Longitudinal Ascending (DoLA) interneurons that are responsive to psen2 but not psen1 activity during embryogenesis did not reveal decreased psen2 function. Transcripts containing the S4Ter mutation show no evidence of destabilization by nonsense-mediated decay. Forced expression in zebrafish embryos of fusions of psen2S4Ter 5' mRNA sequences with sequence encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) indicated that the psen2S4Ter mutation permits utilization of cryptic, novel downstream translation start codons. These likely initiate translation of N-terminally truncated Psen2 proteins that obey the "reading frame preservation rule" of PRESENILIN EOfAD mutations. Transcriptome analysis of entire brains from a 6-month-old family of wild type, heterozygous and homozygous psen2S4Ter female siblings revealed profoundly dominant effects on gene expression likely indicating changes in ribosomal, mitochondrial, and anion transport functions.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.20.050799v1?rss=1">Efficacy and safety of decompressive craniectomy with non-suture duraplasty in patients with traumatic brain injury</a></h4>

Background Decompressive craniectomy is an important surgical treatment for patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Several reports have been published on the efficacy of non-watertight sutures in duraplasty performed in decompressive craniectomy. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of dura closure without sutures (non-suture duraplasty) in decompressive craniectomy for TBI. Methods One hundred and six patients were enrolled at a single trauma center between January 2017 and December 2018. We retrospectively collected the data and classified the patients into non-suture and suture duraplasty craniectomy groups. We compared the characteristics of patients and their intra/post-operative findings such as operative time, blood loss, imaging findings, complications, and Glasgow outcome scale. Results There were 37 patients in the non-suture group and 69 in the suture craniectomy group. There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to general characteristics. The operative time was 205 min for the suture duraplasty group and 150 min for the non-suture duraplasty group, and that for the non-suture duraplasty group was significantly lesser (p=0.002). Blood loss was significantly lesser in the non-suture duraplasty group (1000 mL) than in the suture duraplasty group (1500 mL, p=0.028). There were no other significant differences. Conclusion Non-suture duraplasty involved shorter operative time and lesser blood loss when compared to suture duraplasty. Other complications and prognosis were similar in both groups. Therefore, it can be concluded that decompressive craniectomy with non-suture duraplasty is a safe and useful surgical technique in patients with TBI.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.20.050757v1?rss=1">Constraints on the deformation of the vibrissa within the follicle</a></h4>

Nearly all mammals have a vibrissal system specialized for tactile sensation, composed of whiskers growing from sensor-rich follicles in the skin. Because a whisker has no sensors along its length, an open question is how mechanoreceptors in the follicle transduce sensory signals. These mechanoreceptors are activated by whisker deflection, so it is essential to understand how the whisker deforms within the follicle and so how it may activate different populations of mechanoreceptors in different ways. During active whisking behaviors, muscle contractions and increases in blood pressure in the ring sinus will likely affect the whisker deformation profile. Directly recording from mechanoreceptors under these conditions is difficult due to their small size, location within intricate and delicate membranes, and movement during sensation. Using data from a previous experimental study on whisker deflection, and from histological analysis of follicle tissue, we develop a mechanical model of the follicle sinus complex. With this model we first simulate passive whisker contact, replicating previous results of ex vivo experiments on deformation of a whisker within the follicle. We then simulate whisker deformation within the follicle during active whisking. Results of these simulations predict that both intrinsic muscle contraction and elevated hydrostatic pressure within the ring sinus may be regulatory mechanisms to enhance tactile sensitivity during active whisking. The mechanical model presented in this study is an important first step in simulating mechanical interactions within whisker follicles, and aids in the development of artificial robotic follicles.

Ageing is characterized by changes in sensory and cognitive abilities. While there is evidence that decline in sensory acuity and enhanced multisensory integration predict cognitive status in healthy older adults, potential mechanistic links between these age-related alterations remain unclear. In the current study, we assessed performance of younger and older healthy adults in a visuotactile delayed match-to-sample task and related indices of multisensory integration to unisensory perceptual thresholds and cognitive assessment data. Additionally, we applied transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to modulate cortical networks found to underlie visuotactile interactions and working-memory matching in our previous work. Analysing response times and signal detection measures, we found older adults to show enhanced multisensory integration and benefit more from successful working memory matching. Both measures predicted cognitive status and correlated positively with each other, suggesting that they likely reflect a common underlying tendency to integrate information. Sensory capability, however, independently predicted cognitive status. tACS with beta frequency (20 Hz) accelerated task performance and this effect was more pronounced in the older group. We conclude that sensory capability and information integration represent independent predictors of cognitive status. Finally, we discuss a potential role of the parietal cortex in mediating augmented integration in older adults.

In clinical practice, EEGs are assessed visually and recordings with reduced number of electrodes or artefacts make the assessment more difficult. Present techniques for upsampling or restoring channels utilize different interpolation strategies by taking averages of neighboring electrodes or fitting surfaces to the electrodes. These techniques usually perform better for higher electrode densities and values interpolated at areas far from electrodes can be unreliable. Using a method that instead learns the statistical distribution of the cortical electrical fields and predicts values of missing electrodes may yield better results. Generative networks based on convolutional layers were trained to upsample from 4 or 14 channels or restore single missing channels to recreate 21 channel EEGs. Roughly 5,144 hours of data from 1,385 subjects of the Temple University Hospital EEG data Corpus were used for training and evaluating the networks. The results were compared to interpolation by spherical splines and a visual evaluation by board certified clinical neurophysiologists was conducted. In addition, the effect on performance due to the number of subjects used for training was evaluated. The generative networks performed significantly better overall compared to spherical spline interpolation. There was no difference between real and network generated data in the number of examples assessed as fake by experienced EEG interpreters. On the contrary, the number was significantly higher for data generated by interpolation. Network performance improved with increasing number of included subjects, with the greatest effect seen for 100. Using neural networks to restore or upsample EEG signals is a viable alternative to existing methods.

Two-photon (2-P) all-optical approaches combine in vivo 2-P calcium imaging and 2-P optogenetic modulations and have the potential to build a framework for network-based therapies, e.g. for rebalancing maladaptive activity patterns in preclinical models of neurological disorders. Here, our goal was to tailor these approaches for this purpose: Firstly, we combined in vivo juxtacellular recordings and GCaMP6f-based 2-P calcium imaging in layer II/III of mouse visual cortex to tune our detection algorithm towards a 100 % specific identification of AP-related calcium transients. False-positive-free detection was achieved at a sensitivity of approximately 73 %. To further increase specificity, secondly, we minimized photostimulation artifacts as a potential source for false-positives by using extended-wavelength-spectrum laser sources for optogenetic stimulation of the excitatory opsin C1V1. We achieved artifact-free all-optical experiments performing photostimulations at 1100 nm or higher and simultaneous calcium imaging at 920 nm in mouse visual cortex in vivo. Thirdly, we determined the spectral range for maximizing efficacy of optogenetic control by performing 2-P photostimulations of individual neurons with wavelengths up to 1300 nm. The rate of evoked transients in GCaMP6f/C1V1-co-expressing cortical neurons peaked already at 1100 nm. By refining spike detection and defining 1100 nm as the optimal wavelength for artifact-free and effective stimulations of C1V1 in GCaMP-based all-optical interrogations, we increased the translational value of these approaches, e.g. for the use in preclinical applications of network-based therapies.

Chimpanzees are among the closest living relatives to humans and, therefore, provide a crucial comparative model for investigating primate brain evolution. In recent years, human brain research has strongly benefited from enhanced computational models and image processing pipelines that could also improve data analyses in animals by using species-specific templates. In this study, we use MRI data from the National Chimpanzee Brain Resource (NCBR) to develop the chimpanzee brain template Juna.Chimp for spatial registration and the novel macro-anatomical brain parcellation Davi130 for standardized whole-brain analysis. Additionally, we introduce a ready-to-use complete image processing pipeline built upon the CAT12 toolbox in SPM12, implementing a standard human image preprocessing framework in chimpanzees. Applying this approach to data from 178 subjects, we find strong evidence for age-related GM atrophy in multiple regions of the chimpanzee brain, as well as, a human-like anterior-posterior pattern of hemispheric asymmetry in medial chimpanzee brain regions.

High-level sensory and motor cortical areas are activated when processing the meaning of language, but it is unknown whether, and how, words share a neural substrate with corresponding sensorimotor representations. We recorded from single neurons in human posterior parietal cortex (PPC) while participants viewed action verbs and corresponding action videos from multiple views. We find that PPC neurons exhibit a common neural substrate for action verbs and observed actions. Further, videos were encoded with mixtures of invariant and idiosyncratic responses across views. Action verbs elicited selective responses from a fraction of these invariant and idiosyncratic neurons, without preference, thus associating with a statistical sampling of the diverse sensory representations related to the corresponding action concept. Controls indicated the results are not the product of visual imagery nor arbitrary learned associations. Our results suggest that language may activate the consolidated visual experience of the reader.

Motor imagery and neurofeedback have been proposed as motor training approaches, but their effects on the enhancement of motor performance are still controversial. This study aimed to enhance motor performance using a novel training protocol that combines motor imagery and neurofeedback. Seventeen participants were randomly assigned to the training or control group. The training group received real-time electroencephalography activity feedback relative to the motor imagery of the motor action. The control group reiterated the motor imagery of the intended motor action without feedback. The motor performance of the training group was enhanced significantly more than that of the control group. Subsequently, the proposed training protocol was tested in five elite male tennis players to investigate its applicability to sports activities. The motor performance was enhanced in three of these five professional tennis players. Using this novel training protocol, which combined motor imagery and neurofeedback training, we achieved enhanced motor performance.

Shape analysis has been widely used in digital image processing and computer vision, but they have not been utilized to compare the structural characteristics of the human association pathways. Here we used shape analysis to derive length, area, volume, and shape metrics from diffusion MRI tractography and utilized them to study the human association pathways. An augmented fiber tracking combined with automatic segmentation was used to improve reproducibility in tractography. The reliability analysis showed that shape descriptors achieved moderate to good test-retest reliability. Further analysis on association pathways showed left dominance in the arcuate fasciculus, cingulum, uncinate fasciculus, frontal aslant tract, and right dominance in the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and inferior longitudinal fasciculus. The superior longitudinal fasciculus has a mixed lateralization profile with different metrics showing either left or right dominance. The analysis of between-subject variations shows that the overall layout of the association pathways does not variate a lot across subjects, as shown by low between-subject variation in length, span, diameter, and radius. In contrast, the area of the pathway innervation region has a considerable between-subject variation. A follow-up analysis is warranted to thoroughly investigate the nature of population variations and their structure-function correlation.

Telomere shortening is one hallmark of cell ageing that can limit the proliferative capacity of cell populations and increase risk for age-related disease. It has been hypothesized that short telomeres, and subsequently a limited proliferative capacity of hippocampal progenitor cells, could contribute to smaller hippocampal volumes and impaired cognition, amongst psychiatric disorder patients. The current study employed a systematic, multidisciplinary approach which aimed to model the effects of telomere shortening on human hippocampal neurogenesis, and to explore its relationship with cognition and psychiatric disorder risk. We modelled telomere shortening in human hippocampal progenitor cells in vitro using a serial passaging protocol that mimics the end-replication problem. Aged progenitors demonstrated shorter telomeres (p&lt;0.05), and reduced rates of cell proliferation, as marked by bromodeoxyuridine staining (p&lt;0.001), with no changes in the ability of cells to differentiate into neurons or glia. RNA-sequencing and gene set enrichment analysis revealed an effect of cell ageing on gene networks related to neurogenesis, telomere maintenance, cell senescence and cytokine production. Downregulated transcripts showed a significant overlap with genes regulating cognitive function and risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Collectively, our results suggest that reductions in adult hippocampal neurogenesis, caused by telomere shortening, could represent a cellular mechanism contributing to age-related cognitive impairment and psychiatric disorder risk.

Protein aggregation is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Although mutations in TARDBP, encoding TDP-43, account for less than 1% of all ALS cases, TDP-43-positive aggregates are present in nearly all ALS patients, including patients with sporadic ALS (sALS) or carrying other familial ALS (fALS)-causing mutations. Interestingly, TDP-43 inclusions are also present in subsets of patients with frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease; therefore, methods of activating intracellular protein quality control machinery capable of clearing toxic cytoplasmic TDP-43 species may alleviate disease-related phenotypes. Here, we identify a novel function of Nemo-like kinase (Nlk) as a negative regulator of lysosome biogenesis. Genetic or pharmacological reduction of Nlk increased lysosome formation and improved clearance of aggregated TDP-43. Furthermore, Nlk reduction ameliorated pathological, behavioral, and lifespan deficits in two distinct mouse models of TDP-43 proteinopathy. Because many toxic proteins can be cleared along the autophagy-lysosome axis, targeted reduction of Nlk represents a viable approach to therapy development for multiple neurodegenerative disorders.

Synchronization of neuronal responses over large distances is hypothesized to be important for many cortical functions. However, no straightforward methods exist to estimate synchrony non-invasively in the living human brain. MEG and EEG measure the whole brain, but the sensors pool over large, overlapping cortical regions, obscuring the underlying neural synchrony. Here, we developed a model from stimulus to cortex to MEG sensors to disentangle neural synchrony from spatial pooling of the instrument. We find that synchrony across cortex has a surprisingly large and systematic effect on predicted MEG spatial topography. We then conducted visual MEG experiments and separated responses into stimulus-locked and broadband components. The stimulus-locked topography was similar to model predictions assuming synchronous neural sources, whereas the broadband topography was similar to model predictions assuming asynchronous sources. We infer that visual stimulation elicits two distinct types of neural responses, one highly synchronous and one largely asynchronous across cortex.

Purpose: To characterize corneal subbasal nerve plexus morphologic features using in vivo corneal confocal microscopy (IVCM) in normal and SIV-infected macaques and to implement automated assessments using novel deep learning-based methods customized for macaque studies. Methods: In vivo corneal confocal microscopy images were collected from both male and female age-matched specific-pathogen free rhesus and pigtailed macaques housed at the Johns Hopkins University breeding colony using the Heidelberg HRTIII with Rostock Corneal Module. We also obtained repeat IVCM images of 12 SIV-infected animals including pre-infection and 10 day post-SIV infection time-points. All IVCM images were analyzed using a novel deep convolutional neural network architecture developed specifically for macaque studies. Results: Deep learning-based segmentation of subbasal nerves in IVCM images from macaques demonstrated that corneal nerve fiber length (CNFL) and fractal dimension measurements did not differ between species, but pigtailed macaques had significantly higher baseline corneal nerve fiber tortuosity than rhesus macaques (P = 0.005). Neither sex nor age of macaques was associated with differences in any of the assessed corneal subbasal nerve parameters. In the SIV/macaque model of HIV, acute SIV infection induced significant decreases in both corneal nerve fiber length and fractal dimension (P= 0.01 and P= 0.008 respectively). Conclusions: The combination of IVCM and objective, robust, and rapid deep-learning analysis serves as a powerful noninvasive research and clinical tool to track sensory nerve damage, enabling early detection of neuropathy. Adapting the deep-learning analyses to human corneal nerve assessments will refine our ability to predict and monitor damage to small sensory nerve fibers in a number of clinical settings including HIV, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, and chemotherapeutic neurotoxicity.

The neocortex is composed of layers. Whether layers constitute an essential framework for the formation of functional circuits is not well understood. We investigated if neurons require the layer organization to be embedded into brain-wide circuits using the reeler mouse. This mutant is characterized by a migration deficit of cortical neurons so that no layers are formed. Still, neurons retain their properties and reeler mice show little cognitive impairment. We focused on VIP neurons because they are known to receive strong long-range inputs and have a typical laminar bias towards upper layers. In reeler these neurons are more distributed across the cortex. We mapped the brain-wide inputs of VIP neurons in barrel cortex of wildtype and reeler mice with rabies virus tracing. Innervation by subcortical inputs was not altered in reeler, in contrast to the cortical circuitry. Numbers of long-range ipsilateral cortical inputs were reduced in reeler, while contralateral inputs were strongly increased. Reeler mice had more callosal projection neurons. Hence, the corpus callosum was larger in reeler as shown by structural imaging. We argue that in the absence of cortical layers, circuits with subcortical structures are maintained but cortical neurons establish a different network capable to preserve cognitive functions.

The human visual system is capable of processing visual information from fovea to the far peripheral visual field. Recent fMRI studies have shown a full and detailed retinotopic map in area prostriata, located ventro-dorsally and anterior to the calcarine sulcus along the parieto-occipital sulcus with strong preference for peripheral and wide-field stimulation. Here, we report the anatomical pattern of white-matter connections between area prostriata and the thalamus encompassing the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). We observe a continuous and extended bundle of white matter fibers from which two subcomponents can be extracted: one passing ventrally parallel to the optic radiations (OR) and another passing dorsally circumventing the lateral ventricle. Interestingly, the loop travelling dorsally connects the thalamus with the central visual field representation of prostriata, while the other loop travelling more ventrally connects the LGN with the more peripheral visual field representation. This is consistent with a retinotopic segregation recently demonstrated in the OR, connecting the LGN and V1 in humans. Our results demonstrate for the first time a retinotopic segregation regarding the trajectory of a fiber bundle between the thalamus and an associative visual area.

Elucidating the lineage relationships among different cell types is key to understanding human brain development. Here we developed Parallel RNA and DNA analysis after Deep-sequencing (PRDD-seq), which combines RNA analysis of neuronal cell types with analysis of nested spontaneous DNA somatic mutations as cell lineage markers, identified from joint analysis of single cell and bulk DNA sequencing by single-cell MosaicHunter (scMH). PRDD-seq enables the first-ever simultaneous reconstruction of neuronal cell type, cell lineage, and sequential neuronal formation ("birthdate") in postmortem human cerebral cortex. Analysis of two human brains showed remarkable quantitative details that relate mutation mosaic frequency to clonal patterns, confirming an early divergence of precursors for excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and an "inside-out" layer formation of excitatory neurons as seen in other species. In addition our analysis allows the first estimate of excitatory neuron-restricted precursors (about 10) that generate the excitatory neurons within a cortical column. Inhibitory neurons showed complex, subtype-specific patterns of neurogenesis, including some patterns of development conserved relative to mouse, but also some aspects of primate cortical interneuron development not seen in mouse. PRDD-seq can be broadly applied to characterize cell identity and lineage from diverse archival samples with single-cell resolution and in potentially any developmental or disease condition.

Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of pyramidal cell connections are among the key mechanisms underlying learning and memory in the brain. Despite their important role, only a few of these connections have been characterized in terms of LTP/LTD dynamics, such as the one between layer 5 thick-tufted pyramidal cells (L5-TTPCs). Comparing the available evidence on different pyramidal connection types reveals a large variability of experimental outcomes, possibly indicating the presence of connection-type-specific mechanisms. Here, we show that a calcium-based plasticity rule regulating L5-TTPC synapses holds also for several other pyramidal-to-pyramidal connections in a digital model of neocortical tissue. In particular, we show that synaptic physiology, cell morphology and innervation patterns jointly determine LTP/LTD dynamics without requiring a different model or parameter set for each connection type. We therefore propose that a similar set of plasticity mechanisms is shared by seemingly very different neocortical connections and that only a small number of targeted experiments is required for generating a complete map of synaptic plasticity dynamics int he neocortex.

Visual systems can exploit spatial correlations in the visual scene by using retinotopy, the organizing principle by which neighboring cells encode neighboring spatial locations. However, retinotopy is often lost, such as when visual pathways are integrated with other sensory modalities. How is spatial information processed in the absence of retinotopy? Here, we focused on visual looming responsive LC6 cells in Drosophila, a population whose dendrites collectively tile the visual field, but whose axons form a single glomerulus--a structure lacking retinotopic organization--in the central brain. We identified multiple glomerulus neurons and found that they respond to looming in different portions of the visual field, unexpectedly preserving spatial information. Through EM reconstruction of all LC6 synaptic inputs to the glomerulus, we found that LC6 and downstream cell types form circuits within the glomerulus that establish spatial readout of visual features and contralateral suppression--mechanisms that transform visual information for behavioral control.

The ability to represent time in the brain relies on network interactions across multiple brain areas. While much attention has been paid to the role of prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia in timing, little work has been aimed towards understanding the role of the thalamus in timing. To this end, we utilized pharmacological and optogenetic techniques in mice to test the role of the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MD) in interval timing. The MD is strongly connected with the prefrontal cortex and receives major inputs from the basal ganglia output nuclei. We used an operant temporal production task, in which mice indicate their expected timing of available rewards by pressing a lever in anticipation. On probe trials, inactivation of the MD with muscimol produced rightward shifts in peak pressing as well as increases in peak spread, thus significantly altering both temporal accuracy and precision. Optogenetic inhibition of glutamatergic projection neurons in the MD resulted in similar changes in timing; the shift in peak time is proportional to the duration of inhibition. The observed effects were found to be independent of significant changes in movement. Taken together, these findings provide strong evidence for the importance of thalamo-cortical projections in timing behavior.

<p>Using a taste signal detection task with a specialized gustometer, we found that extensive lesions bilaterally in the rat gustatory cortex (BGCX), or in the right GC (not shown), impair taste sensitivity (significant shift of EC<sub>50</sub>) for NaCl but not for maltodextrin (Maltrin) or citric acid relative the sham‐operated rats (SHAM).  In addition to suggesting some degree of laterality of function in GC with respect to NaCl detection, these findings add to growing evidence suggesting that gustatory sites outside of GC can maintain normal taste sensitivity for select stimuli.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Our prior studies showed bilateral gustatory cortex (GC) lesions significantly impair taste sensitivity to salts (NaCl and KCl) and quinine (“bitter”) but not to sucrose (“sweet”). The range of qualitative tastants tested here has been extended in a theoretically relevant way to include the maltodextrin, Maltrin, a preferred stimulus by rats thought to represent a unique taste quality, and the “sour” stimulus citric acid; NaCl was also included as a positive control. Male rats (Sprague‐Dawley) with histologically confirmed neurotoxin‐induced bilateral (BGCX, n=13), or right (LGCX, n=13) or left (RGCX, n=9) unilateral GC lesions and sham‐operated controls (SHAM, n=16) were trained to discriminate a tastant from water in an operant two‐response detection task. A mapping system was used to determine placement, size, and symmetry (when bilateral) of the lesion. BGCX significantly impaired taste sensitivity to NaCl, as expected, but not to Maltrin or citric acid, emulating our prior results with sucrose. However, in the case of citric acid, there was some disruption in performance at higher concentrations. Interestingly, RGCX, but not LGCX, also significantly impaired taste sensitivity, but only to NaCl, suggesting some degree of lateralized function. Taken together with our prior findings, extensive bilateral lesions in GC do not disrupt basic taste signal detection to all taste stimuli uniformly. Moreover, GC lesions do not preclude the ability of rats to learn and perform the task, clearly demonstrating that, in its absence, other brain regions are able to maintain sensory‐discriminative taste processing, albeit with attenuated sensitivity for select stimuli.</p>

<p>by Chengwen Luo, Botao Fa, Yuting Yan, Yang Wang, Yiwang Zhou, Yue Zhang, Zhangsheng Yu</p>

Mediation analysis with high-dimensional DNA methylation markers is important in identifying epigenetic pathways between environmental exposures and health outcomes. There have been some methodology developments of mediation analysis with high-dimensional mediators. However, high-dimensional mediation analysis methods for time-to-event outcome data are still yet to be developed. To address these challenges, we propose a new high-dimensional mediation analysis procedure for survival models by incorporating sure independent screening and minimax concave penalty techniques for variable selection, with the Sobel and the joint method for significance test of indirect effect. The simulation studies show good performance in identifying correct biomarkers, false discovery rate control, and minimum estimation bias of the proposed procedure. We also apply this approach to study the causal pathway from smoking to overall survival among lung cancer patients potentially mediated by 365,307 DNA methylations in the TCGA lung cancer cohort. Mediation analysis using a Cox proportional hazards model estimates that patients who have serious smoking history increase the risk of lung cancer through methylation markers including cg21926276, cg27042065, and cg26387355 with significant hazard ratios of 1.2497(95%CI: 1.1121, 1.4045), 1.0920(95%CI: 1.0170, 1.1726), and 1.1489(95%CI: 1.0518, 1.2550), respectively. The three methylation sites locate in the three genes which have been showed to be associated with lung cancer event or overall survival. However, the three CpG sites (cg21926276, cg27042065 and cg26387355) have not been reported, which are newly identified as the potential novel epigenetic markers linking smoking and survival of lung cancer patients. Collectively, the proposed high-dimensional mediation analysis procedure has good performance in mediator selection and indirect effect estimation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tK75AlvMauI" width="1" />

Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) comprise over 90% of cells in the striatum. <i>In vivo</i> MSNs display coherent burst firing cell assembly activity patterns, even though isolated MSNs do not burst fire intrinsically. This activity is important for the learning and execution of action sequences and is characteristically dysregulated in Huntington’s Disease (HD). However, how dysregulation is caused by the various neural pathologies affecting MSNs in HD is unknown. Previous modeling work using simple cell models has shown that cell assembly activity patterns can emerge as a result of MSN inhibitory network interactions. Here, by directly estimating MSN network model parameters from single unit spiking data, we show that a network composed of much more physiologically detailed MSNs provides an excellent quantitative fit to wild type (WT) mouse spiking data, but only when network parameters are appropriate for the striatum. We find the WT MSN network is situated in a regime close to a transition from stable to strongly fluctuating network dynamics. This regime facilitates the generation of low-dimensional slowly varying coherent activity patterns and confers high sensitivity to variations in cortical driving. By re-estimating the model on HD spiking data we discover network parameter modifications are consistent across three very different types of HD mutant mouse models (YAC128, Q175, R6/2). In striking agreement with the known pathophysiology we find feedforward excitatory drive is reduced in HD compared to WT mice, while recurrent inhibition also shows phenotype dependency. We show that these modifications shift the HD MSN network to a sub-optimal regime where higher dimensional incoherent rapidly fluctuating activity predominates. Our results provide insight into a diverse range of experimental findings in HD, including cognitive and motor symptoms, and may suggest new avenues for treatment.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Te8nacmED6U" width="1" />

<p>The main neuronal population of the striatum are GABAergic medium spiny neurons. Calbindin is preferentially expressed in medium spiny neurons involved in the indirect pathway. The perinatal asphyxia (PA) group showed a significant decrease in calbindin neurons and a paradoxical increase in neurons estimated by NeuN staining. Moreover, Calretinin+ cells, a specific subpopulation of GABAergic neurons, showed an increase caused by perinatal asphyxia. Deep hypothermia reversed most of these alterations probably by protecting calbindin neurons.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Na,K‐ATPase is a ubiquitous molecule contributing to the asymmetrical distribution of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions across the plasma membrane and maintenance of the membrane potential, a prerequisite of neuronal activity. Na,K‐ATPase comprises three subunits (α, β, and FXYD). The α subunit has four isoforms in mice, with three of them (α1, α2, and α3) expressed in the brain. However, the functional and biological significances of the different brain isoforms remain to be fully elucidated. Recent studies have revealed the association of <i>Atp1a3</i>, a gene encoding α3 subunit, with neurological disorders. To map the cellular distributions of the α subunit isoforms and their coexpression patterns, we evaluated the mRNA expression of <i>Atp1a1</i>, <i>Atp1a2</i>, and <i>Atp1a3</i> by <i>in situ</i> hybridization in the mouse brain. <i>Atp1a1</i> and <i>Atp1a3</i> were expressed in neurons, whereas <i>Atp1a2</i> was almost exclusively expressed in glial cells. Most neurons coexpressed <i>Atp1a1</i> and <i>Atp1a3</i>, with highly heterogeneous expression levels across the brain regions and neuronal subtypes. We identified parvalbumin‐expressing GABAergic neurons in the hippocampus, somatosensory cortex, and retrosplenial cortex as an example of a neuronal subtype expressing low <i>Atp1a1</i> and high <i>Atp1a3</i>. The expression of <i>Atp1b</i> isoforms was also heterogeneous across brain regions and cellular subtypes. The parvalbumin‐expressing neurons expressed a high level of <i>Atp1b1</i> and a low level of <i>Atp1b2</i> and <i>Atp1b3</i>. These findings provide basic information on the region‐ and neuronal‐subtype‐dependent expression of Na,K‐ATPase α and β subunit isoforms, as well as a rationale for the selective involvement of neurons expressing high levels of <i>Atp1a3</i> in neurological disorders.</p>

Abstract
<p>Harmful environmental agents cause nasal inflammation, and chronic nasal inflammation induces a loss of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and reversible atrophy of the olfactory bulb (OB). Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying this inflammation-induced OB atrophy by histologically and biochemically comparing the OB changes in mouse models of nasal inflammation and odor deprivation. In addition, we examined whether odor stimulation is necessary for OB recovery from atrophy. One group of adult male C57BL/6 mice was administered lipopolysaccharide (LPS) unilaterally for 10 weeks to induce nasal inflammation (control animals received saline), and a second group received unilateral naris closures (NCs) for 10 weeks of odor deprivation. The OBs atrophied in both models, but odor deprivation shrank the glomerular, external plexiform, mitral, and granule cell layers (GCLs), whereas the olfactory nerve, glomerular, and external plexiform layers (EPLs) atrophied as a result of nasal inflammation. Additionally, nasal inflammation, but not odor deprivation, caused neuroinflammation in the OB, inducing glial activation and elevated expression of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and TNFα. After 10 weeks of nasal inflammation, mice were housed for another 10 weeks with no additional treatment or with unilateral NC. Nasal inflammation and glial activation subsided in both groups, but glomerular and EPLs recovered only in those with no additional treatment. Our findings demonstrate that nasal inflammation and odor deprivation differentially induce layer-specific degeneration in the OB, that loss of OSN activity rather than neuroinflammation is a major cause of inflammation-induced OB atrophy, and that odor stimulation is required for OB recovery from atrophy.</p>

<p>A variety of electrical synapses are capable of activity-dependent plasticity, including both activity-dependent potentiation and activity-dependent depression. In several types of neurons, activity-dependent electrical synapse plasticity depends on changes in the local Ca<sup>2+</sup> environment. To enable study of local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling that regulates plasticity, we developed a GCaMP Ca<sup>2+</sup> biosensor fused to the electrical synapse protein Connexin 36 (Cx36). Cx36-GCaMP transfected into mammalian cell cultures formed gap junctions at cell-cell boundaries and supported Neurobiotin tracer coupling that was regulated by protein kinase A signaling in the same way as Cx36. Cx36-GCaMP gap junctions robustly reported local Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases in response to addition of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore with increases in fluorescence that recovered during washout. Recovery was strongly dependent on Na<sup>+</sup>-Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchange activity. In cells transfected with NMDA receptor subunits, Cx36-GCaMP revealed transient and concentration-dependent increases in local Ca<sup>2+</sup> on brief application of glutamate. In HeLa cells, glutamate application increased Cx36-GCaMP tracer coupling through a mechanism that depended in part on Ca<sup>2+</sup>, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activity. This potentiation of coupling did not require exogenous expression of glutamate receptors, but could be accomplished by endogenously expressed glutamate receptors with pharmacological characteristics reminiscent of NMDA and kainate receptors. Analysis of RNA Sequencing data from HeLa cells confirmed expression of NMDA receptor subunits NR1, NR2C, and NR3B. In summary, Cx36-GCaMP is an effective tool to measure changes in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> microenvironment around Cx36 gap junctions. Furthermore, HeLa cells can serve as a model system to study glutamate receptor-driven potentiation of electrical synapses.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The intercollicular region, which lies between the inferior and superior colliculi in the midbrain, contains neurons that respond to auditory, visual, and somatosensory stimuli. Golgi studies have been used to parse this region into three distinct nuclei: the intercollicular tegmentum (ICt), the rostral pole of the inferior colliculus (ICrp), and the nucleus of the brachium of the IC (NBIC). Few reports have focused on these nuclei, especially the ICt and the ICrp, possibly due to lack of a marker that distinguishes these areas and is compatible with modern methods. Here, we found that staining for GABAergic cells and perineuronal nets differentiates these intercollicular nuclei in guinea pigs. Further, we found that the proportions of four subtypes of GABAergic cells differentiate intercollicular nuclei from each other and from adjacent inferior collicular subdivisions. Our results support earlier studies that suggest distinct morphology and functions for intercollicular nuclei, and provide staining methods that differentiate intercollicular nuclei and are compatible with most modern techniques. We hope that this will help future studies to further characterize the intercollicular region.</p>

<p>Functionally relevant network patterns form transiently in brain activity during rest, where a given subset of brain areas exhibits temporally synchronized BOLD signals. To adequately assess the biophysical mechanisms governing intrinsic brain activity, a detailed characterization of the dynamical features of functional networks is needed from the experimental side to constrain theoretical models. In this work, we use an open-source fMRI dataset from 100 healthy participants from the Human Connectome Project and analyze whole-brain activity using Leading Eigenvector Dynamics Analysis (LEiDA), which serves to characterize brain activity at each time point by its whole-brain BOLD phase-locking pattern. Clustering these BOLD phase-locking patterns into a set of k states, we demonstrate that the cluster centroids closely overlap with reference functional subsystems. Borrowing tools from dynamical systems theory, we characterize spontaneous brain activity in the form of trajectories within the state space, calculating the Fractional Occupancy and the Dwell Times of each state, as well as the Transition Probabilities between states. Finally, we demonstrate that within-subject reliability is maximized when including the high frequency components of the BOLD signal (&gt;0.1 Hz), indicating the existence of individual fingerprints in dynamical patterns evolving at least as fast as the temporal resolution of acquisition (here TR = 0.72 s). Our results reinforce the mechanistic scenario that resting-state networks are the expression of erratic excursions from a baseline synchronous steady state into weakly-stable partially-synchronized states – which we term ghost attractors. To better understand the rules governing the transitions between ghost attractors, we use methods from dynamical systems theory, giving insights into high-order mechanisms underlying brain function.</p>

<p>The ability to form memories in the brain is needed for daily functions, and its impairment is associated with human mental disorders. Evidence indicates that long-term memory (LTM)-related processes such as its consolidation, extinction and forgetting involve changes of synaptic efficacy produced by alterations in neural transmission and morphology. Modulation of the morphology and number of dendritic spines has been proposed to contribute to changes in neuronal transmission mediating such LTM-related processes. Rac GTPase activity is regulated by synaptic activation and it can affect spine morphology by controlling actin-regulatory proteins. Recent evidence shows that changes in Rac GTPase activity affect memory consolidation, extinction, erasure and forgetting and can affect spine morphology in brain areas that mediate these behaviors. Altered Rac GTPase activity is associated with abnormal spine morphology and brain disorders. By affecting Rac GTPase activity we can further understand the roles of spine morphogenesis in memory. Moreover, manipulation of Rac GTPase activity may serve as a therapeutic tool for the treatment of memory-related brain diseases.</p>

<p>The superficial dorsal horn (SDH, LI-II) of the spinal cord receives and processes multimodal sensory information from skin, muscle, joints, and viscera then relay it to the brain. Neurons within the SDH fall into two broad categories, projection neurons and interneurons. The later can be further subdivided into excitatory and inhibitory types. Traditionally, interneurons within the SDH have been divided into overlapping groups according to their neurochemical, morphological and electrophysiological properties. Recent clustering analyses, based on molecular transcript profiles of cells and nuclei, have predicted many more functional groups of interneurons than expected using traditional approaches. In this study, we used electrophysiological and morphological data obtained from genetically-identified excitatory (vGLUT2) and inhibitory (vGAT) interneurons in transgenic mice to cluster cells into groups sharing common characteristics and subsequently determined how many clusters can be assigned by combinations of these properties. Consistent with previous reports, we show differences exist between excitatory and inhibitory interneurons in terms of their excitability, nature of the ongoing excitatory drive, action potential (AP) properties, sub-threshold current kinetics, and morphology. The resulting clusters based on statistical and unbiased assortment of these data fell well short of the numbers of molecularly predicted clusters. There was no clear characteristic that in isolation defined a population, rather multiple variables were needed to predict cluster membership. Importantly though, our analysis highlighted the appropriateness of using transgenic lines as tools to functionally subdivide both excitatory and inhibitory interneuron populations.</p>

<p>The spontaneous cerebral activity that gives rise to resting-state networks (RSNs) has been extensively studied in infants in recent years. However, the influence of sleep state on the presence of observable RSNs has yet to be formally investigated in the infant population, despite evidence that sleep modulates resting-state functional connectivity in adults. This effect could be extremely important, as most infant neuroimaging studies rely on the neonate to remain asleep throughout data acquisition. In this study, we combine functional near-infrared spectroscopy with electroencephalography to simultaneously monitor sleep state and investigate RSNs in a cohort of healthy term born neonates. During active sleep (AS) and quiet sleep (QS) our newborn neonates show functional connectivity patterns spatially consistent with previously reported RSN structures. Our three independent functional connectivity analyses revealed stronger interhemispheric connectivity during AS than during QS. In turn, within hemisphere short-range functional connectivity seems to be enhanced during QS. These findings underline the importance of sleep state monitoring in the investigation of RSNs.</p>

<p>Depression is a risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease and Related Dementia (ADRD). We conducted a systematic review between 2008 and October 2018, to evaluate the evidence for a conceptual mechanistic model linking depression and ADRD, focusing on frontal-executive and corticolimbic circuits. We focused on two neuroimaging modalities: diffusion-weighted imaging measuring white matter tract disruptions and resting-state functional MRI measuring alterations in network dynamics in late-life depression (LLD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and LLD+MCI vs. healthy control (HC) individuals. Our data synthesis revealed that in some but not all studies, impairment of both frontal-executive and corticolimbic circuits, as well as impairment of global brain topology was present in LLD, MCI, and LLD+MCI vs. HC groups. Further, posterior midline regions (posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus) appeared to have the most structural and functional alterations in all patient groups. Future cohort and longitudinal studies are required to address the heterogeneity of findings, and to clarify which subgroups of people with LLD are at highest risk for developing MCI and ADRD.</p>

<p>Prism adaptation (PA) is both a model for visuomotor learning and a promising treatment for visuospatial neglect after stroke. The task involves reaching for targets while prism glasses horizontally displace the visual field. Adaptation is hypothesized to occur through two processes: strategic recalibration, a rapid self-correction of pointing errors; and spatial realignment, a more gradual adjustment of visuomotor reference frames that produce prism aftereffects (i.e., reaching errors upon glasses removal in the direction opposite to the visual shift). While aftereffects can ameliorate neglect, not all patients respond to PA, and the neural mechanisms underlying successful adaptation are unclear. We investigated the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and the P300 event-related potential (ERP) components as candidate markers of strategic recalibration and spatial realignment, respectively. Healthy young adults wore prism glasses and performed memory-guided reaching toward vertical-line targets. ERPs were recorded in response to three different between-subject error feedback conditions at screen-touch: view of hand and target (Experiment 1), view of hand only (Experiment 2), or view of lines to mark target and hand position (view of hand occluded; Experiment 3). Conditions involving a direct view of the hand-produced stronger aftereffects than indirect hand feedback, and also evoked a P300 that decreased in amplitude as adaptation proceeded. Conversely, the FRN was only seen in conditions involving target feedback, even when aftereffects were smaller. Since conditions producing stronger aftereffects were associated with a phase-sensitive P300, this component may index a “context-updating” realignment process critical for strong aftereffects, whereas the FRN may reflect an error monitoring process related to strategic recalibration.</p>

<p>Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) plays an essential role in hippocampal-dependent memory consolidation. Increased neurogenesis enhances learning, whereas its ablation causes memory impairment. In contrast, few reports suggest that neurogenesis reduces after learning. Although the interest in exploring the role of adult neurogenesis in learning has been growing, the evidence is still limited. The role of the trace- and delay-appetitive-conditioning on AHN and its underlying mechanism are not known. The consolidation of trace-conditioned memory requires the hippocampus, but delay-conditioning does not. Moreover, the dorsal hippocampus (DH) and ventral hippocampus (VH) may have a differential role in these two conditioning paradigms. Here, we have investigated the changes in: (A) hippocampal cell proliferation and their progression towards neuronal lineage; and (B) expression of Arc, Erk1, Erk2, and CREB proteins in the DH and VH after trace- and delay-conditioning in the rat. The number of newly generated cells significantly increased in the trace-conditioned but did not change in the delay-conditioned animals compared to the control group. Similarly, the expression of Arc protein significantly increased in the DH but not in the VH after trace-conditioning. Nonetheless, it remains unaltered in the delay-conditioned group. The expression of pErk1, pErk2, and pCREB also increased in the DH after trace-conditioning. Whereas, the expression of only pErk1 pErk2 and pCREB proteins increased in the VH after delay-conditioning. Our results suggest that appetitive trace-conditioning enhances AHN. The increased DH neuronal activation and pErk1, pErk2, and pCREB in the DH may be playing an essential role in learning-induced cell-proliferation after appetitive trace-conditioning.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive memory loss. Although AD neuropathological hallmarks are extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular tau tangles, the best correlate of disease progression is synapse loss. What causes synapse loss has been the focus of several researchers in the AD field. Synapses become dysfunctional before plaques and tangles form. Studies based on early-onset familial AD (eFAD) models have supported that synaptic transmission is depressed by β-amyloid (Aβ) triggered mechanisms. Since eFAD is rare, affecting only 1% of patients, research has shifted to the study of the most common late-onset AD (LOAD). Intracellular trafficking has emerged as one of the pathways of LOAD genes. Few studies have assessed the impact of trafficking LOAD genes on synapse dysfunction. Since endocytic traffic is essential for synaptic function, we reviewed Aβ-dependent and independent mechanisms of the earliest synaptic dysfunction in AD. We have focused on the role of intraneuronal and secreted Aβ oligomers, highlighting the dysfunction of endocytic trafficking as an Aβ-dependent mechanism of synapse dysfunction in AD. Here, we reviewed the LOAD trafficking genes APOE4, ABCA7, BIN1, CD2AP, PICALM, EPH1A, and SORL1, for which there is a synaptic link. We conclude that in eFAD and LOAD, the earliest synaptic dysfunctions are characterized by disruptions of the presynaptic vesicle exo- and endocytosis and of postsynaptic glutamate receptor endocytosis. While in eFAD synapse dysfunction seems to be triggered by Aβ, in LOAD, there might be a direct synaptic disruption by LOAD trafficking genes. To identify promising therapeutic targets and biomarkers of the earliest synaptic dysfunction in AD, it will be necessary to join efforts in further dissecting the mechanisms used by Aβ and by LOAD genes to disrupt synapses.</p>

<p>Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the progressive loss of neurons in different regions of the nervous system. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) are the two most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases, and the symptoms associated with these pathologies are closely related to the regions that are most affected by the process of neurodegeneration. Despite their high prevalence, currently, there is no cure or disease-modifying drugs for the treatment of these conditions. In the last decades, due to the need for the development of new treatments for neurodegenerative diseases, several authors have investigated the neuroprotective actions of naturally occurring molecules, such as resveratrol. Resveratrol is a stilbene found in several plants, including grapes, blueberries, raspberries, and peanuts. Studies have shown that resveratrol presents neuroprotective actions in experimental models of AD and PD, however, its clinical application is limited due to its rapid metabolism and low bioavailability. In this context, studies have proposed that structural changes in the resveratrol molecule, including glycosylation, alkylation, halogenation, hydroxylation, methylation, and prenylation could lead to the development of derivatives with enhanced bioavailability and pharmacological activity. Therefore, this review article aims to discuss how resveratrol derivatives could represent viable molecules in the search for new drugs for the treatment of AD and PD.</p>

Unlike in the healthy mammalian retina, macrophages in retinal degenerative states are not solely comprised of microglia but may include monocyte-derived recruits. Recent studies have applied transgenics, lineage-tracing, and transcriptomics to help decipher the distinct roles of these two cell types in the disease settings of inherited retinal degenerations and age-related macular degeneration. Literature discussed here focuses on the ectopic presence of both macrophage types in the extracellular site surrounding the outer aspect of photoreceptor cells (i.e., the subretinal space), which is crucially involved in the pathobiology.

<p>by Agustín Bruzzese, James A. R. Dalton, Jesús Giraldo</p>

The activation process of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) has been extensively studied, both experimentally and computationally. In particular, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations have proven useful in exploring GPCR conformational space. The typical behaviour of class A GPCRs, when subjected to unbiased MD simulations from their crystallized inactive state, is to fluctuate between inactive and intermediate(s) conformations, even with bound agonist. Fully active conformation(s) are rarely stabilized unless a G protein is also bound. Despite several crystal structures of the adenosine A2a receptor (A2aR) having been resolved in complex with co-crystallized agonists and G<sub>s</sub> protein, its agonist-mediated activation process is still not completely understood. In order to thoroughly examine the conformational landscape of A2aR activation, we performed unbiased microsecond-length MD simulations in quadruplicate, starting from the inactive conformation either in apo or with bound agonists: endogenous adenosine or synthetic NECA, embedded in two homogeneous phospholipid membranes: 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphoglycerol (DOPG) or 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine (DOPC). In DOPC with bound adenosine or NECA, we observe transition to an intermediate receptor conformation consistent with the known adenosine-bound crystal state. In apo state in DOPG, two different intermediate conformations are obtained. One is similar to that observed with bound adenosine in DOPC, while the other is closer to the active state but not yet fully active. Exclusively, in DOPG with bound adenosine or NECA, we reproducibly identify receptor conformations with fully active features, which are able to dock G<sub>s</sub> protein. These different receptor conformations can be attributed to the action/absence of agonist and phospholipid-mediated allosteric effects on the intracellular side of the receptor.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NukOdQKdP7w" width="1" />

Metabolism plays an essential role in cell fate decisions. However, the methods used for metabolic characterization and for finding potential metabolic regulators are still based on characterizing cellular metabolic steady-state which is dependent on the extracellular environment. In this work, we hypothesized that the response dynamics of intracellular metabolic pools to extracellular stimuli is controlled in a cell type-specific manner. We applied principles of process dynamics and control to human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) and human neural stem cells (hNSC) subjected to a sudden extracellular glutamine step. The fold-changes of steady-states and the transient profiles of metabolic pools revealed that dynamic responses were reproducible and cell type-specific. Importantly, many amino acids had conserved dynamics and readjusted their steady state concentration in response to the increased glutamine influx. Overall, we propose a novel methodology for systematic metabolic characterization and identification of potential metabolic regulators.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Vf2lqiKUr80" width="1" />

The metabolic responses of bacteria to dynamic extracellular conditions drives not only the behavior of single species, but also entire communities of microbes. Over the last decade, genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions have assisted in our appreciation of important metabolic determinants of bacterial physiology. These network models have been a powerful force in understanding the metabolic capacity that species may utilize in order to succeed in an environment. Increasingly, an understanding of context-specific metabolism is critical for elucidating metabolic drivers of larger phenotypes and disease. However, previous approaches to use network models in concert with omics data to better characterize experimental systems have met challenges due to assumptions necessary by the various integration platforms or due to large input data requirements. With these challenges in mind, we developed RIPTiDe (Reaction Inclusion by Parsimony and Transcript Distribution) which uses both transcriptomic abundances and parsimony of overall flux to identify the most cost-effective usage of metabolism that also best reflects the cell’s investments into transcription. Additionally, in biological samples where it is difficult to quantify specific growth conditions, it becomes critical to develop methods that require lower amounts of user intervention in order to generate accurate metabolic predictions. Utilizing a metabolic network reconstruction for the model organism <i>Escherichia coli</i> str. K-12 substr. MG1655 (iJO1366), we found that RIPTiDe correctly identifies context-specific metabolic pathway activity without supervision or knowledge of specific media conditions. We also assessed the application of RIPTiDe to <i>in vivo</i> metatranscriptomic data where <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> was present at high abundances, and found that our approach also effectively predicts metabolic behaviors of host-associated bacteria. In the setting of human health, understanding metabolic changes within bacteria in environments where growth substrate availability is difficult to quantify can have large downstream impacts on our ability to elucidate molecular drivers of disease-associated dysbiosis across the microbiota. Our results indicate that RIPTiDe may have potential to provide understanding of context-specific metabolism of bacteria within complex communities.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O_WMeLH3KF0" width="1" />

As biodiversity loss continues to accelerate, there is a critical need for education and biomonitoring across the globe. Portable technologies allow for in situ molecular biodiversity monitoring that has been historically out of reach for many researchers in habitat nations. In the realm of education, portable tools such as DNA sequencers facilitate in situ hands-on training in real-time sequencing and interpretation techniques. Here, we provide step-by-step protocols as a blueprint for a terrestrial conservation genetics field training program that uses low-cost, portable devices to conduct genomics-based training directly in biodiverse habitat countries.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/5UHGG07zPE8" width="1" />

Encouragement of students across all communities through scientific outreach programs is critical to engaging the next generation, exciting young minds to pursue careers in science and medicine. Herein, we present a uniquely structured and widely influential science outreach program. Founded in 2005, the Duke Chemistry Outreach (DCO) employs a pedagogical approach to outreach that aims to teach its audience a new scientific concept, while instilling a pure enjoyment of science. DCO has performed 583 events reaching over 70,000 participants throughout 2,270 hours, with the majority of events in Durham, the surrounding North Carolinian communities, and across 8 other states. The flexibility and diversity of this outreach program creates a framework amendable for others to adopt in both secondary and higher education settings.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/qXtW92bkbuE" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>The number and function of synaptic AMPA receptors (AMPARs) tightly regulates excitatory synaptic transmission. Current evidence suggests that AMPARs are inserted into the postsynaptic membrane during long-term potentiation (LTP) and are removed from the membrane during long-term depression (LTD). Dephosphorylation of GluA1 at Ser-845 and enhanced endocytosis are critical events in the modulation of LTD. Moreover, changes in scaffold proteins from the postsynaptic density (PSD) could be also related to AMPAR regulation in LTD. In the present study we analyzed the effect of chemical LTD (cLTD) on A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP)150 and AMPARs levels in mouse-cultured neurons. We show that cLTD induces AKAP150 protein degradation via proteasome, coinciding with GluA1 dephosphorylation at Ser-845 and endocytosis of GluA1-containing AMPARs. Pharmacological inhibition of proteasome activity, but not phosphatase calcineurin (CaN), reverted cLTD-induced AKAP150 protein degradation. Importantly, AKAP150 silencing induced dephosphorylation of GluA1 Ser-845 and GluA1-AMPARs endocytosis while AKAP150 overexpression blocked cLTD-mediated GluA1-AMPARs endocytosis. Our results provide direct evidence that cLTD-induced AKAP150 degradation by the proteasome contributes to synaptic AMPARs endocytosis.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00354">Circulating MicroRNAs as Diagnostic Biomarkers for Motor Neuron Disease</a></h4>

<p>Motor neuron disease (MND) is a kind of neurodegenerative disease that selectively invades spinal cord anterior horn cells, brainstem motor neurons, cortical pyramidal cells and the pyramidal tract. The main clinical features are the symptoms and signs of impaired upper and lower motor neurons, manifested as muscle weakness, atrophy and pyramidal tract signs. Histopathology has shown the disappearance of pyramidal cells in the motor cortex, loss of motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord and brainstem, and degeneration of the corticospinal tract. Due to the lack of effective treatment methods, the prognosis is generally poor, so it is of great significance to confirm the diagnosis early by various means. However, the current diagnosis of MND mainly relies on the combination of clinical manifestations and neurophysiological examinations, lacking effective means of early diagnosis. Circulating microRNA (CmiRNA) is a kind of stable miRNA molecule in serum, plasma and other body fluids, which has the characteristics of distinct differential expression, sensitive detection and convenient sample collection. As a possible new biomarker of MND, CmiRNA can not only reveal the pathophysiological process of MND, but also monitor disease progression and response to drug therapy. With the development of miRNA detection technology, more and more CmiRNAs as biomarkers with potential diagnostic value have been investigated. In this review, we explored the possibility of circulating samples as different sources of biomarkers for the diagnosis of MND, analyzing the progress of CmiRNA detection techniques, and presenting potential diagnostic MND biomarkers that have been reported.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00324">Genetic Association Between Alzheimer’s Disease Risk Variant of the PICALM Gene and EEG Functional Connectivity in Non-demented Adults</a></h4>

<p>Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified and validated the association of the PICALM genotype with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The PICALM rs3851179 A allele is thought to have a protective effect, whereas the G allele appears to confer risk for AD. The influence of the PICALM genotype on brain functional connectivity in non-demented subjects remains largely unknown. We examined the association of the PICALM rs3851179 genotype with the characteristics of lagged linear connectivity (LLC) of resting EEG sources in 104 non-demented adults younger than 60 years of age. The EEG analysis was performed using exact low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA) freeware (Pascual-Marqui et al., 2011). We found that the carriers of the A PICALM allele (PICALM AA and AG genotypes) had higher widespread interhemispheric LLC of alpha sources compared to the carriers of the GG PICALM allele. An exploratory correlation analysis showed a moderate positive association between the alpha LLC interhemispheric characteristics and the corpus callosum size and between the alpha interhemispheric LLC characteristics and the Luria word memory scores. These results suggest that the PICALM rs3851179 A allele provides protection against cognitive decline by facilitating neurophysiological reserve capacities in non-demented adults. In contrast, lower functional connectivity in carriers of the AD risk variant, PICALM GG, suggests early functional alterations in alpha rhythm networks.</p>

<p>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is the technique of choice for detecting large-scale functional brain networks and to investigate their dynamics. Because fMRI measures brain activity indirectly, electroencephalography (EEG) has been recently considered a feasible tool for detecting such networks, particularly the resting-state networks (RSNs). However, a truly unbiased validation of such claims is still missing, which can only be accomplished by using simultaneously acquired EEG and fMRI data, due to the spontaneous nature of the activity underlying the RSNs. Additionally, EEG is still poorly explored for the purpose of mapping task-specific networks, and no studies so far have been focused on investigating networks’ dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) with EEG. Here, we started by validating RSNs derived from the continuous reconstruction of EEG sources by directly comparing them with those derived from simultaneous fMRI data of 10 healthy participants, and obtaining an average overlap (quantified by the Dice coefficient) of 0.4. We also showed the ability of EEG to map the facial expressions processing network (FEPN), highlighting regions near the posterior superior temporal sulcus, where the FEPN is anchored. Then, we measured the dFC using EEG for the first time in this context, estimated dFC brain states using dictionary learning, and compared such states with those obtained from the fMRI. We found a statistically significant match between fMRI and EEG dFC states, and determined the existence of two matched dFC states which contribution over time was associated with the brain activity at the FEPN, showing that the dynamics of FEPN can be captured by both fMRI and EEG. Our results push the limits of EEG toward being used as a brain imaging tool, while supporting the growing literature on EEG correlates of (dynamic) functional connectivity measured with fMRI, and providing novel insights into the coupling mechanisms underlying the two imaging techniques.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the aggregation of α-synuclein protein and selective death of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain. Although the molecular pathogenesis of PD is not completely understood, a recent study has reported that eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A) declined in the PD-affected brain. Therefore, the roles of eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 in the prevention of DA neuronal cell death in PD are aimed to be investigated. Herein, by using Caenorhabditis elegans as a PD model, we investigated the role of eft-3/eft-4, the worm homolog of eEF1A1/eEF1A2, on 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced DA neuron degeneration. Our results demonstrated that the expressions of eft-3 and eft-4 were decreased in the 6-OHDA-induced worms. RNA interference (RNAi) of eft-3 and eft-4 resulted in dramatic exacerbation of DA neurodegeneration induced by 6-OHDA, as well as aggravated the food-sensing behavior, ethanol avoidance, and decreased lifespan when compared with only 6-OHDA-induced worms. Moreover, downregulation of eft-3/4 in 6-OHDA-induced worms suppressed the expression of the anti-apoptotic genes, including PI3K/age-1, PDK-1/pdk-1, mTOR/let-363, and AKT-1,2/akt-1,2, promoting the expression of apoptotic genes such as BH3/egl-1 and Caspase-9/ced-3. Collectively, these findings indicate that eEF1A plays an important role in the 6-OHDA-induced neurodegeneration through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/serine/threonine protein kinase (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and that eEF1A isoforms may be a novel and effective pro-survival factor in protective DA neurons against toxin-induced neuronal death.</p>

<p>External cues, such as music, improve movement performance in persons with Parkinson’s disease. However, research examining the motor cortical mechanisms by which this occurs is lacking. Research using electroencephalography in healthy young adults has revealed that moving to music can modulate motor cortical activity. Moreover, motor cortical activity is further influenced by music experience. It remains unknown whether these effects extend to corticomotor excitability. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to determine the effects of novel music on corticomotor excitability using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in a pilot study of healthy young adults. A secondary aim of this study was to determine the influence of music experience on corticomotor excitability. We hypothesized that corticomotor excitability will change during music conditions, and that it will differ in those with formal music training. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from the first dorsal interosseous using single-pulse TMS in three conditions: (1) No Music, (2) Music Condition I, and (3) Music Condition II. Both pieces were set to novel MIDI piano instrumentation and part-writing conventions typical of early nineteenth-century Western classical practices. Results revealed Music Condition II (i.e., more relaxing music) compared to rest increased MEP amplitude (i.e., corticomotor excitability). Music Condition II as compared to Music Condition I (i.e., more activating music) reduced MEP variability (i.e., corticomotor variability). Finally, years of formal music training did not significantly influence corticomotor excitability while listening to music. Overall, results revealed that unfamiliar music modulates motor cortical excitability but is dependent upon the form of music and possibly music preference. These results will be used to inform planned studies in healthy older adults and people with Parkinson’s disease.</p>

<p>Traditionally, radiologists have crudely quantified tumor extent by measuring the longest and shortest dimension by dragging a cursor between opposite boundary points across a single image rather than full segmentation of the volumetric extent. For algorithmic-based volumetric segmentation, the degree of radiologist experiential involvement varies from confirming a fully automated segmentation, to making a single drag on an image to initiate semi-automated segmentation, to making multiple drags and clicks on multiple images during interactive segmentation. An experiment was designed to test an algorithm that allows various levels of interaction. Given the ground-truth of the BraTS training data, which delimits the brain tumors of 285 patients on multi-spectral MR, a computer simulation mimicked the process that a radiologist would follow to perform segmentation with real-time interaction. Clicks and drags were placed only where needed in response to the deviation between real-time segmentation results and assumed radiologist's goal, as provided by the ground-truth. Results of accuracy for various levels of interaction are presented along with estimated elapsed time, in order to measure efficiency. Average total elapsed time, including loading the study through confirming 3D contours, was 46 s.</p>

<p>Attention is the important ability to flexibly control limited computational resources. It has been studied in conjunction with many other topics in neuroscience and psychology including awareness, vigilance, saliency, executive control, and learning. It has also recently been applied in several domains in machine learning. The relationship between the study of biological attention and its use as a tool to enhance artificial neural networks is not always clear. This review starts by providing an overview of how attention is conceptualized in the neuroscience and psychology literature. It then covers several use cases of attention in machine learning, indicating their biological counterparts where they exist. Finally, the ways in which artificial attention can be further inspired by biology for the production of complex and integrative systems is explored.</p>

<p>A general agreement in psycholinguistics claims that syntax and meaning are unified precisely and very quickly during online sentence processing. Although several theories have advanced arguments regarding the neurocomputational bases of this phenomenon, we argue that these theories could potentially benefit by including neurophysiological data concerning cortical dynamics constraints in brain tissue. In addition, some theories promote the integration of complex optimization methods in neural tissue. In this paper we attempt to fill these gaps introducing a computational model inspired in the dynamics of cortical tissue. In our modeling approach, proximal afferent dendrites produce stochastic cellular activations, while distal dendritic branches–on the other hand–contribute independently to somatic depolarization by means of dendritic spikes, and finally, prediction failures produce massive firing events preventing formation of sparse distributed representations. The model presented in this paper combines semantic and coarse-grained syntactic constraints for each word in a sentence context until grammatically related word function discrimination emerges spontaneously by the sole correlation of lexical information from different sources without applying complex optimization methods. By means of support vector machine techniques, we show that the sparse activation features returned by our approach are well suited—bootstrapping from the features returned by Word Embedding mechanisms—to accomplish grammatical function classification of individual words in a sentence. In this way we develop a biologically guided computational explanation for linguistically relevant unification processes in cortex which connects psycholinguistics to neurobiological accounts of language. We also claim that the computational hypotheses established in this research could foster future work on biologically-inspired learning algorithms for natural language processing applications.</p>

<p>Most neurological disorders seemingly have heterogenous pathogenesis, with overlapping contribution of neuronal, immune and vascular mechanisms of brain injury. The perivascular space in the brain represents a crossroad where those mechanisms interact, as well as a key anatomical component of the recently discovered glymphatic pathway, which is considered to play a crucial role in the clearance of brain waste linked to neurodegenerative diseases. The pathological interplay between neuronal, immune and vascular factors can create an environment that promotes self-perpetration of mechanisms of brain injury across different neurological diseases, including those that are primarily thought of as neurodegenerative, neuroinflammatory or cerebrovascular. Changes of the perivascular space can be monitored in humans in vivo using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In the context of glymphatic clearance, MRI-visible enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS) are considered to reflect glymphatic stasis secondary to the perivascular accumulation of brain debris, although they may also represent an adaptive mechanism of the glymphatic system to clear them. EPVS are also established correlates of dementia and cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and are considered to reflect brain inflammatory activity. In this review, we describe the “perivascular unit” as a key anatomical and functional substrate for the interaction between neuronal, immune and vascular mechanisms of brain injury, which are shared across different neurological diseases. We will describe the main anatomical, physiological and pathological features of the perivascular unit, highlight potential substrates for the interplay between different noxae and summarize MRI studies of EPVS in cerebrovascular, neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are key events in signal transduction since they affect protein function by regulating their abundance and/or activity. PTMs involve the covalent attachment of functional groups to specific amino acids. Since they tend to be generally reversible, PTMs serve as regulators of signal transduction pathways. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major signaling proteins that undergo multiple types of PTMs. In this Review, we focus on the opioid receptors, members of GPCR family A, and highlight recent advances in the field that have underscored the importance of PTMs in the functional regulation of these receptors.

Recent studies on the effects of sleep deprivation on synaptic plasticity have yielded discrepant results. Sleep deprivation studies using novelty exposure as a means to keep animals awake suggests that sleep (compared with wake) leads to widespread reductions in net synaptic strength. By contrast, sleep deprivation studies using approaches avoiding novelty-induced arousal (i.e., gentle handling) suggest that sleep can promote synaptic growth and strengthening. How can these discrepant findings be reconciled? Here, we discuss how varying methodologies for the experimental disruption of sleep (with differential introduction of novel experiences) could fundamentally alter the experimental outcome with regard to synaptic plasticity.

Evolutionarily conserved mechanisms maintain homeostasis of essential elements, and are believed to be highly time-variant. However, current approaches measure elemental biomarkers at a few discrete time-points, ignoring complex higher-order dynamical features. To study dynamical properties of elemental homeostasis, we apply laser ablation inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) to tooth samples to generate 500 temporally sequential measurements of elemental concentrations from birth to 10 years. We applied dynamical system and Information Theory-based analyses to reveal the longest-known attractor system in mammalian biology underlying the metabolism of nutrient elements, and identify distinct and consistent transitions between stable and unstable states throughout development. Extending these dynamical features to disease prediction, we find that attractor topography of nutrient metabolism is altered in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), as early as childhood, suggesting these pathways are involved in disease risk. Mechanistic analysis was undertaken in a transgenic mouse model of ALS, where we find similar marked disruptions in elemental attractor systems as in humans. Our results demonstrate the application of a phenomological analysis of dynamical systems underlying elemental metabolism, and emphasize the utility of these measures in characterizing risk of disease.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/c5YPoxjUguA" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Treatment of relapses in multiple sclerosis (MS) has not advanced beyond steroid use, which reduces acute loss of function, but has little effect on residual disability. Acute loss of function in an MS model (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; EAE) is partly due to CNS hypoxia, and function can promptly improve upon breathing oxygen. Here we investigate the cause of the hypoxia and whether it is due to a deficit in oxygen supply arising from impaired vascular perfusion. We also explore whether the CNS‐selective vasodilating agent, nimodipine, may provide a therapy to restore function, and protect from demyelination in two MS models.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A variety of methods have been employed to measure basic cardiovascular physiology, spinal oxygenation, mitochondrial function and tissue perfusion in EAE.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We report that the tissue hypoxia in EAE is associated with a profound hypoperfusion of the inflamed spinal cord. Treatment with nimodipine restores spinal oxygenation and can rapidly improve function. Nimodipine therapy also reduces demyelination in both EAE, and a model of the early MS lesion.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Loss of function in EAE, and demyelination in EAE and the model early MS lesion, appear to be due, at least in part, to tissue hypoxia due to local spinal hypoperfusion. Therapy to improve blood flow not only protects neurological function, but also reduces demyelination. We conclude that nimodipine could be repurposed to offer substantial clinical benefit in MS.</p>

<p>Songbirds are a powerful model to study vocal learning given that aspects of the underlying behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms are analogous in many ways to mechanisms involved in speech learning. Perineuronal nets (PNNs) represent one of the mechanisms controlling the closing of sensitive periods for vocal learning in the songbird brain. In zebra finches, PNN develop around parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons in selected song control nuclei during ontogeny and their development is delayed if juveniles are deprived of a tutor. However, song learning in zebra finches takes place during a relatively short period of development, and it is difficult to determine whether PNN development correlates with the end of the sensory or the sensorimotor learning period. Canaries have a longer period of sensorimotor vocal learning, spanning over their first year of life so that it should be easier to test whether PNN development correlates with the end of sensory or sensorimotor vocal learning. Here, we quantified PNN around PV-interneurons in the brain of male canaries from hatching until the first breeding season and analyzed in parallel the development of their song. PNN development around PV-interneurons specifically took place and their number reached its maximum around the end of the sensorimotor learning stage, well after the end of sensory vocal learning, and correlated with song development. This suggests that PNN are specifically involved in the termination of the sensitive period for sensorimotor vocal learning.</p>

Generalized linear models were applied to assess de novo variant burdens in children exposed prenatally to AEDs (AED‐exposed children) versus children without BDs not exposed prenatally to AEDs (AED‐unexposed unaffected children), and AED‐exposed children with BDs versus those without BDs, adjusting for confounders. Fisher exact test was used to compare categorical data.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Sixty‐seven child–parent trios were included: 10 with AED‐exposed children with BDs, 46 with AED‐exposed unaffected children, and 11 with AED‐unexposed unaffected children. The dnSNV/indel burden did not differ between AED‐exposed children and AED‐unexposed unaffected children (median dnSNV/indel number/child [range] = 3 [0–7] vs 3 [1–5], <i>p</i> = 0.50). Among AED‐exposed children, there were no significant differences between those with BDs and those unaffected. Likely deleterious dnSNVs/indels were detected in 9 of 67 (13%) children, none of whom had BDs. The proportion of cases harboring likely deleterious dnSNVs/indels did not differ significantly between AED‐unexposed and AED‐exposed children. The dnCNV burden was not associated with AED exposure or birth outcome.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study indicates that prenatal AED exposure does not increase the burden of de novo variants, and that this mechanism is not a major contributor to AED‐induced BDs. These results can be incorporated in routine patient counseling. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>There are several technical challenges to obtaining high-quality recordings of cochlear potentials in human electrocochleography (ECochG). These challenges include electrical artifacts from devices such as acoustic transducers, biological artifacts from excessive myogenic and electroencephalographic potentials, and issues associated with the placement of a tympanic membrane (TM) electrode on the eardrum. This article presents approaches for dealing with these challenges for ECochG measurement using a TM electrode. Emphasis is placed on eliminating stimulus artifact, optimizing the placement of the electrode, and comparing a custom-made electrode with a commercially-available electrode. This comparison revealed that the custom-made electrode results in greater subject comfort, superior ease of placing the electrode on the eardrum, and larger compound action potential (CAP) amplitudes.</p>

<p>Lysophospholipids (LPLs) are bioactive signaling lipids that are generated from phospholipase-mediated hydrolyzation of membrane phospholipids (PLs) and sphingolipids (SLs). Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) are two of the best-characterized LPLs which mediate a variety of cellular physiological responses via specific G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) mediated signaling pathways. Considerable evidence now demonstrates the crucial role of LPA and S1P in neurodegenerative diseases, especially in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Dysfunction of LPA and S1P metabolism can lead to aberrant accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), neuroinflammation and ultimately neuronal death. Summarizing LPA and S1P signaling profile may aid in profound health and pathological processes. In the current review, we will introduce the metabolism as well as the physiological roles of LPA and S1P in maintaining the normal functions of the nervous system. Given these pivotal functions, we will further discuss the role of dysregulation of LPA and S1P in promoting AD pathogenesis.</p>

<p>Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are a group of diseases caused by chronic and progressive degeneration of neural tissue. The main pathological manifestations are neuronal degeneration and loss in the brain and/or spinal cord. Common NDDs include Alzheimer disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD), Huntington disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The complicated pathological characteristics and different clinical manifestations of NDDs result in a lack of sensitive and efficient diagnostic methods. In addition, no sensitive biomarkers are available to monitor the course of NDDs, predict their prognosis, and monitor the therapeutic response. Despite extensive research in recent years, analysis of amyloid β (Aβ) and α-synuclein has failed to effectively improve NDD diagnosis. Although recent studies have indicated circulating miRNAs as promising diagnostic biomarkers of NDDs, the miRNA in the peripheral circulation is susceptible to interference by other components, making circulating miRNA results less consistent. Exosomes are small membrane vesicles with a diameter of approximately 30–100 nm that transport proteins, lipids, mRNA, and miRNA. Because recent studies have shown that exosomes have a double-membrane structure that can resist ribonuclease in the blood, giving exosomal miRNA high stability and making them resistant to degradation, they may become an ideal biomarker of circulating fluids. In this review, we discuss the applicability of circulating exosomal miRNAs as biomarkers, highlight the technical aspects of exosomal miRNA analysis, and review studies that have used circulating exosomal miRNAs as candidate diagnostic biomarkers of NDDs.</p>

Background<p>Activated protein C (APC), a serine protease with antithrombotic effects, protects in animal models of ischemic stroke by suppressing inflammation and enhancing vascular integrity, angiogenesis, neurogenesis and neuroprotection. A small number of animal studies suggest it might also have therapeutic potential in multiple sclerosis (MS), though results have been mixed. Based on these conflicting data, the goals of this study were to clarify the therapeutic potential of APC in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS and to determine mechanistically how APC mediates this protective effect.</p>Methods<p>The protective potential of APC was examined in a chronic progressive model of EAE. Vascular breakdown, tight junction protein expression and vascular expression of fibronectin and α5β1 integrin as well as vascularity and glial activation were analyzed using immunofluorescence (IF) of spinal cord sections taken from mice with established EAE. The direct influence of APC on microglial activation was evaluated in vitro by a combination of morphology and MMP-9 expression.</p>Results<p>APC attenuated the progression of EAE, and this was strongly associated at the histopathological level with reduced levels of leukocyte infiltration and concomitant demyelination. Further analysis revealed that APC reduced vascular breakdown which was associated with maintained endothelial expression of the tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). In addition, APC suppressed microglial activation in this EAE model and in vitro studies revealed that APC strongly inhibited microglial activation at both the morphological level and by the expression of the pro-inflammatory protease MMP-9.</p>Conclusion<p>These findings build on the work of others in demonstrating strong therapeutic potential for APC in the treatment of inflammatory demyelinating disease and suggest that enhancement of vascular integrity and suppression of microglial activation may be important mediators of this protection.</p>

<p>Retinal alterations have recently been associated with numerous neurodegenerative diseases. Rhodopsin is a G-protein coupled receptor found in the rod cells of the retina. As a biomarker associated with retinal thinning and degeneration, it bears potential in the early detection and monitoring of several neurodegenerative diseases. In this review article, we summarize the findings of correlations between rhodopsin and several neurodegenerative disorders as well as the potential of a novel technique, cSLO, in the quantification of rhodopsin.</p>

<p>Mapping the cytoarchitecture of the whole brain can reveal the organizational logic of neural systems. However, this remains a significant challenge, especially for gyrencephalic brains with a large volume. Here we propose an integrated pipeline for generating a cytoarchitectonic atlas with single-cell resolution of the whole brain. To analyze a large-volume brain, we used a modified en-bloc Nissl staining protocol to achieve uniform staining of large-scale brain specimens from ferret (Mustela putorius furo). By combining whole-brain imaging and big data processing, we established strategies for parsing cytoarchitectural information at a voxel resolution of 0.33 μm × 0.33 μm × 1 μm and terabyte-scale data analysis. Using the cytoarchitectonic datasets for adult ferret brain, we identified giant pyramidal neurons in ferret brains and provide the first report of their morphological diversity, neurochemical phenotype, and distribution patterns in the whole brain in three dimensions. This pipeline will facilitate studies on the organization and development of the mammalian brains, from that of rodents to the gyrencephalic brains of ferret and even primates.</p>

<p>Independent component analysis (ICA), being a data-driven method, has been shown to be a powerful tool for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data analysis. One drawback of this multivariate approach is that it is not, in general, compatible with the analysis of group data. Various techniques have been proposed to overcome this limitation of ICA. In this paper, a novel ICA-based workflow for extracting resting-state networks from fMRI group studies is proposed. An empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is used, in a data-driven manner, to generate reference signals that can be incorporated into a constrained version of ICA (cICA), thereby eliminating the inherent ambiguities of ICA. The results of the proposed workflow are then compared to those obtained by a widely used group ICA approach for fMRI analysis. In this study, we demonstrate that intrinsic modes, extracted by EMD, are suitable to serve as references for cICA. This approach yields typical resting-state patterns that are consistent over subjects. By introducing these reference signals into the ICA, our processing pipeline yields comparable activity patterns across subjects in a mathematically transparent manner. Our approach provides a user-friendly tool to adjust the trade-off between a high similarity across subjects and preserving individual subject features of the independent components.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00140">Cue Valence Influences the Effects of Cue Uncertainty on ERP Responses to Emotional Events</a></h4>

<p>Individuals often predict consequences, particularly emotional consequences, according to emotional or non-emotional signals conveyed by environmental cues (i.e., emotional and non-emotional cues, respectively). Some of these cues signify the consequences with certainty (i.e., certain cues), whereas others do not (i.e., uncertain cues). Several event-related potential (ERP) studies regarding non-emotional cues have suggested that the effects of cue uncertainty on attention to emotional events occur in both perception and evaluation processes. However, due to the limitations of previous studies, it is unclear what the effects of cue uncertainty would be in an emotional cue condition. Moreover, it is uncertain whether the effects of cue uncertainty are affected by cue valence (i.e., emotional and non-emotional cues). To address these questions, we asked participants to view cues and then to view emotional (positive or negative) pictures. The cues either did or did not indicate the emotional content of the picture. In the emotional cue condition, happy and fearful faces were used as certain cues indicating upcoming positive and negative pictures, respectively, and neutral faces were used as uncertain cues. In the non-emotional cue condition, scrambled faces outlined in red and blue indicated upcoming positive and negative pictures, respectively, and scrambled faces outlined in green served as uncertain cues. The results showed that for negative pictures, ERP responses in a time range between 60 and 1,000 ms were shifted to a more negative direction in a certain condition than in the uncertain condition when the cues were emotional. However, the effect was the reverse for positive pictures. This effect of cue uncertainty was similar in the non-emotional cue—negative condition. In contrast, there was no effect of cue uncertainty in the non-emotional cue—positive condition. Therefore, the findings indicate that cue uncertainty modulates attention toward emotional events when the events are signified by emotional cues. The findings may also suggest that cue valence modulates the effects of cue uncertainty on attention to emotional events.</p>

<p>Background: Abacus experts could mentally calculate fast some mathematical operations using multi-digit numbers. The temporal dynamics of abacus mental calculation are still unknown although some behavioral and neuroimaging studies have suggested a visuospatial and visuomotor neural process during abacus mental calculation. Therefore, this contribution aims to clarify the significant similarities and the differences between experts and novices by investigating calculation-induced neuromagnetic responses based on cerebral oscillatory changes.</p><p>Methods: Twelve to 13 healthy abacus experts and 17 non-experts participated in two experimental paradigms using non-invasive neuromagnetic measurements. In experiments 1 and 2, the spatial distribution of oscillatory changes presented mental calculations and temporal frequency profiles during addition while examining multiplication tasks. The MEG data were analyzed using synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM) with an adaptive beamformer to calculate the group average of the spatial distribution of oscillatory changes and their temporal frequency profiles in source-level analyses.</p><p>Results: Using a group average of the spatial distribution of oscillatory changes, we observed some common brain activities in both right-handed abacus experts and non-experts. In non-experts, we detected the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and bilateral Intraparietal sulcus (IPS); whereas in experts, detected the bilateral parieto-occipital sulcus (POS), right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and left sensorimotor areas mainly. Based on the findings generated, we could propose calculation processing models for both abacus experts and non- experts conveniently.</p><p>Conclusion: The proposed model of calculation processing in abacus experts and novices revealed that the novices could calculate logically depending on numerical processing in the left IPS. In contrast, abacus experts are utilizing spatial processing using a memorized imaginary abacus, which distributed over the bilateral hemispheres in the IFG and sensorimotor areas.</p>

<p>The theory of mind (ToM) is the ability to attribute mental states to others and is extremely important for social functioning. It has been widely examined in both behavioral and neuroimaging research, usually with the use of the many versions of the false-belief (FB) task. However, there is still not enough evidence from studies on the neurodevelopmental mechanisms of ToM mostly because of methodological limitations: lack of selectivity, mismatch of experimental and control tasks, and focusing on participants older than 6 years old. In the current study, we attempted to develop a computerized tool for ToM assessment suitable for both behavioral and neuriomaging testing in preschoolers. We designed a version of the classic change-of-location task with custom visuals and three fine-tuned conditions: FB, true-belief, and no-belief (NB). The usability of the task for further application in neurodevelopmental research was tested with three methods: first, behaviorally, with the use of a touch screen on a group of 75 children, followed by a functional MRI (fMRI) study on 13 adults, and a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) study on 19 preschool children. In line with our expectations, on the behavioral level, our task elicited the all-or-none performance in preschoolers. There was also a progression of performance with age in the FB condition. On the neural level, we observed the activation of structures involved in the ToM brain network in response to our task in both adults and children. The results therefore suggest that our task can be a useful tool for studying ToM development and its neural underpinnings.</p>

<p>“Locked-in” patients lose their ability to communicate naturally due to motor system dysfunction. Brain-computer interfacing offers a solution for their inability to communicate by enabling motor-independent communication. Straightforward and convenient in-session communication is essential in clinical environments. The present study introduces a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based binary communication paradigm that requires limited preparation time and merely nine optodes. Eighteen healthy participants performed two mental imagery tasks, mental drawing and spatial navigation, to answer yes/no questions during one of two auditorily cued time windows. Each of the six questions was answered five times, resulting in five trials per answer. This communication paradigm thus combines both spatial (two different mental imagery tasks, here mental drawing for “yes” and spatial navigation for “no”) and temporal (distinct time windows for encoding a “yes” and “no” answer) fNIRS signal features for information encoding. Participants’ answers were decoded in simulated real-time using general linear model analysis. Joint analysis of all five encoding trials resulted in an average accuracy of 66.67 and 58.33% using the oxygenated (HbO) and deoxygenated (HbR) hemoglobin signal respectively. For half of the participants, an accuracy of 83.33% or higher was reached using either the HbO signal or the HbR signal. For four participants, effective communication with 100% accuracy was achieved using either the HbO or HbR signal. An explorative analysis investigated the differentiability of the two mental tasks based solely on spatial fNIRS signal features. Using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) group single-trial accuracies of 58.33% (using 20 training trials per task) and 60.56% (using 40 training trials per task) could be obtained. Combining the five trials per run using a majority voting approach heightened these MVPA accuracies to 62.04 and 75%. Additionally, an fNIRS suitability questionnaire capturing participants’ physical features was administered to explore its predictive value for evaluating general data quality. Obtained questionnaire scores correlated significantly (r = -0.499) with the signal-to-noise of the raw light intensities. While more work is needed to further increase decoding accuracy, this study shows the potential of answer encoding using spatiotemporal fNIRS signal features or spatial fNIRS signal features only.</p>

<p>Initially developed to generate new treatments for epilepsy, gabapentin, and pregabalin (“gabapentinoids”) were engineered to mimic the action of GABA and to modulate GABA metabolism. Rather than their intended pharmacological action on GABA neurotransmission, instead, they exhibit a high affinity for the α2δ-1 and α2δ-2 subunits of voltage-activated calcium channels, wherein binding of gabapentinoids inhibits cellular calcium influx and attenuates neurotransmission. Despite a lack of activity on GABA levels, gabapentin and pregabalin are effective at suppressing seizures and subsequently approved as a new class of antiepileptic therapy for partial-onset epilepsy. Through the same hypothesized molecular mechanism and by controlling neuronal hyperexcitability, gabapentinoids demonstrate clear efficacy in pain management, which has arguably been their most extensively prescribed application to date. In this review, we focus on pregabalin as a second-generation gabapentinoid widely employed in the treatment of a variety of pain conditions. We also discuss the wider functional roles of α2δ subunits and the contributions that pregabalin might play in affecting physiological and pathophysiological processes.</p>

<p>Using behavioral, pharmacological, and molecular methods, lots of studies reveal that depression is closely related to the abnormal neural plasticity processes occurring in the prefrontal cortex and limbic system such as the hippocampus and amygdala. Meanwhile, functions of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the other neurotrophins in the pathogenesis of depression are well known. The maladaptive neuroplastic in depression may be related to alterations in the levels of neurotrophic factors, which play a central role in plasticity. Enhancement of neurotrophic factors signaling has great potential in therapy for depression. This review highlights the relevance of neurotrophic factors mediated neural plasticity and pathophysiology of depression. These studies reviewed here may suggest new possible targets for antidepressant drugs such as neurotrophins, their receptors, and relevant signaling pathways, and agents facilitating the activation of gene expression and increasing the transcription of neurotrophic factors in the brain.</p>

<p>The structure of the human brain has been studied extensively. Despite all the knowledge accrued, direct information about connections, from origin to termination, in the human brain is extremely limited. Yet there is a widespread misperception that human connectional neuroanatomy is well-established and validated. In this article, we consider what is known directly about human structural and connectional neuroanatomy. Information on neuroanatomical connections in the human brain is derived largely from studies in non-human experimental models in which the entire connectional pathway, including origins, course, and terminations, is directly visualized. Techniques to examine structural connectivity in the human brain are progressing rapidly; nevertheless, our present understanding of such connectivity is limited largely to data derived from homological comparisons, particularly with non-human primates. We take the position that an in-depth and more precise understanding of human connectional neuroanatomy will be obtained by a systematic application of this homological approach.</p>

<p>In this review article, we will describe the recent advances made towards understanding the molecular and cell biological mechanisms of electrical synapse formation. New evidence indicates that electrical synapses, which are gap junctions between neurons, can have complex molecular compositions including protein asymmetries across joined cells, diverse morphological arrangements, and overlooked similarities with other junctions, all of which indicate new potential roles in neurodevelopmental disease. Aquatic organisms, and in particular the vertebrate zebrafish, have proven to be excellent models for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of electrical synapse formation. Zebrafish will serve as our main exemplar throughout this review and will be compared with other model organisms. We highlight the known cell biological processes that build neuronal gap junctions and compare these with the assemblies of adherens junctions, tight junctions, non-neuronal gap junctions, and chemical synapses to explore the unknown frontiers remaining in our understanding of the critical and ubiquitous electrical synapse.</p>

<p>Background: Previous studies found that low blood magnesium increases the risk of several diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (CVD), diabetes, and hypertension. These ailments are associated with declined cognitive function.</p><p>Objective: We aimed to examine the association between serum magnesium and cognitive function among Qatari adults. In addition, we assessed the interaction relation between low serum magnesium, hypertension, and diabetes in relation to cognitive function.</p><p>Method: Data from 1,000 Qatari participants aged ≥20 years old who participated in the Qatar Biobank (QBB) Study were analyzed. Serum magnesium was measured by an automated calorimetric method and suboptimal magnesium was characterized by &lt;0.85 mmol/l. Cognitive function was determined by measuring the mean reaction time (MRT) based on a computer-based, self-administered test. Multivariable linear regression was used to examine the relation between serum magnesium concentrations and cognitive function.</p><p>Results: The prevalence of suboptimal magnesium was 57.1%. Across the four quartiles of serum magnesium from the lowest to the highest, the regression coefficients (95% CI) for MRT were 0 (reference), −17.8, −18.3, and −31.9 (95% CI 2.4–3.1; p for trend 0.05). The presence of hypertension and diabetes significantly increased the MRT. Women with suboptimal magnesium and hypertension had the highest MRT.</p><p>Conclusion: The prevalence of suboptimal magnesium is high in Qatar. There was a direct association between serum magnesium and cognitive function. Low magnesium concentrations were associated with a longer MRT.</p>

Objective<p>Currently, most models of vascular cognitive impairment are established by occluding the carotid arteries uni- or bilaterally to reduce the cerebral blood flow mimicking chronic cerebral hypoxia. Due to the sudden blood flow interruption, a gradual narrowing of the carotid artery cannot be completely imitated. This paper aims to establish a bilateral carotid stenosis model with mild cognitive dysfunction and mild white matter changes to simulate patients with vascular predementia.</p>Methods<p>Aged Wistar rats (18 months old) underwent either bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) or occlusion (BCAO) surgery or a sham operation (control group). The cerebral blood flow in the frontal cortex was measured using Doppler flowmetry. Thirty days after surgery, cognitive function impairments were determined with the Morris water maze; cerebral magnetic resonance imaging was performed to detect changes in fractional anisotropy to assess white matter injuries, and histological studies were performed.</p>Results<p>The aged rats in the BCAS group showed a more gradual cerebral blood flow reduction and a lower mortality rate (11%) compared to rats in the BCAO group. The water maze test revealed a more marginal impairment affecting spatial learning and memory in rats with BCAS than in rats with BCAO. Diffusion tensor imaging detected white matter injuries in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of BCAS rats. Particularly, a small portion of nerve fibers of the lateral somatosensory cortex was significantly different between rats of the BCAO and BCAS groups. In the BCAS group, the microscopic structure of the hippocampal CA1 region changed slightly after 30 days and sustained a slight mitochondrial crista crack. Fluorescence staining indicated that the number of GFAP-positive cells was increased in rat brains of the BCAS group, and this phenomenon was even more pronounced in the BCAO group. The hnRNPA2/B1 and GABA<sub>A</sub>R-α1 expression levels were significantly decreased in the hippocampus of rats with BCAS compared to those of controls.</p>Conclusion<p>Severe bilateral carotid stenosis induced mild cognitive dysfunction and slight structural changes in the brains of aged rats. Thus, a chronic cerebral hypoperfusion model was successfully established.</p>

<p>Hypertension is recognized as a risk factor for Alzheimer disease, but the causal link remains undetermined. Although astrocytes and microglia play an important role in maintaining the neurovascular unit, astrocytes and microglia have been understudied in comorbid models of hypertension and Alzheimer disease. In this study, male transgenic Fischer 344 rats (TgAPP21) overexpressing a pathogenic human amyloid precursor protein received 8 weeks of Angiotensin II infusion to increase blood pressure, and the rats were evaluated for astrocytosis, microgliosis, and cognitive function. A linear relationship between astrocytosis and blood pressure was observed in the corpus callosum and cingulum of wildtype rats, with hypertensive wildtype rats matching the elevated baseline astrocytosis seen in normotensive transgenic rats. In contrast, hypertensive transgenic rats did not demonstrate a further increase of astrocytosis, suggesting a deficient response. Angiotensin II infusion did not affect activation of microglia, which were elevated in the white matter and hippocampus of transgenic rats. Angiotensin II infusion did impair both wildtype and transgenic rats’ executive functions in the Morris Water Maze. These results present important implications for the interaction between hypertension and pathogenic human amyloid precursor protein expression, as Angiotensin II infusion produced cognitive impairments in both genotypes, but transgenic rats were additionally impaired in developing a normal astrocytic response to elevated blood pressure.</p>

A number of prenatal experiences are associated with adverse outcomes after birth, ranging from cardiovascular problems to psychiatric disease. Prenatal stress is associated with neurodevelopmental alterations that persist after birth and manifest at the behavioral level, for example, increased fearfulness, and at the physiological one, that is, brain structural and functional changes. Understanding the mechanisms that drive these lasting effects may help in preventing long-term negative outcomes of prenatal stress.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a largely heritable, multistage prenatal disorder that impacts a child’s ability to perceive and react to social information. Most ASD risk genes are expressed prenatally in many ASD-relevant brain regions and fall into two categories: broadly expressed regulatory genes that are expressed in the brain and other organs, and brain-specific genes. In trimesters one to three (Epoch-1), one set of broadly expressed (the majority) and brain-specific risk genes disrupts cell proliferation, neurogenesis, migration, and cell fate, while in trimester three and early postnatally (Epoch-2) another set (the majority being brain specific) disrupts neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis, and the ‘wiring’ of the cortex.

<p>by Olga A. Vsevolozhskaya, Min Shi, Fengjiao Hu, Dmitri V. Zaykin</p>

Historically, the majority of statistical association methods have been designed assuming availability of SNP-level information. However, modern genetic and sequencing data present new challenges to access and sharing of genotype-phenotype datasets, including cost of management, difficulties in consolidation of records across research groups, etc. These issues make methods based on SNP-level summary statistics particularly appealing. The most common form of combining statistics is a sum of SNP-level squared scores, possibly weighted, as in burden tests for rare variants. The overall significance of the resulting statistic is evaluated using its distribution under the null hypothesis. Here, we demonstrate that this basic approach can be substantially improved by decorrelating scores prior to their addition, resulting in remarkable power gains in situations that are most commonly encountered in practice; namely, under heterogeneity of effect sizes and diversity between pairwise LD. In these situations, the power of the traditional test, based on the added squared scores, quickly reaches a ceiling, as the number of variants increases. Thus, the traditional approach does not benefit from information potentially contained in any additional SNPs, while our decorrelation by orthogonal transformation (DOT) method yields steady gain in power. We present theoretical and computational analyses of both approaches, and reveal causes behind sometimes dramatic difference in their respective powers. We showcase DOT by analyzing breast cancer and cleft lip data, in which our method strengthened levels of previously reported associations and implied the possibility of multiple new alleles that jointly confer disease risk.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tWoupzt8V7I" width="1" />

<p>by Pierre Millard, Uwe Schmitt, Patrick Kiefer, Julia A. Vorholt, Stéphanie Heux, Jean-Charles Portais</p>

<sup>13</sup>C-metabolic flux analysis (<sup>13</sup>C-MFA) allows metabolic fluxes to be quantified in living organisms and is a major tool in biotechnology and systems biology. Current <sup>13</sup>C-MFA approaches model label propagation starting from the extracellular <sup>13</sup>C-labeled nutrient(s), which limits their applicability to the analysis of pathways close to this metabolic entry point. Here, we propose a new approach to quantify fluxes through any metabolic subnetwork of interest by modeling label propagation directly from the metabolic precursor(s) of this subnetwork. The flux calculations are thus purely based on information from within the subnetwork of interest, and no additional knowledge about the surrounding network (such as atom transitions in upstream reactions or the labeling of the extracellular nutrient) is required. This approach, termed ScalaFlux for SCALAble metabolic FLUX analysis, can be scaled up from individual reactions to pathways to sets of pathways. ScalaFlux has several benefits compared with current <sup>13</sup>C-MFA approaches: greater network coverage, lower data requirements, independence from cell physiology, robustness to gaps in data and network information, better computational efficiency, applicability to rich media, and enhanced flux identifiability. We validated ScalaFlux using a theoretical network and simulated data. We also used the approach to quantify fluxes through the prenyl pyrophosphate pathway of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> mutants engineered to produce phytoene, using a dataset for which fluxes could not be calculated using existing approaches. A broad range of metabolic systems can be targeted with minimal cost and effort, making ScalaFlux a valuable tool for the analysis of metabolic fluxes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/i5lyyQXk8Fc" width="1" />

<p>by Aurel A. Lazar, Chung-Heng Yeh</p>

Over the past two decades, substantial amount of work has been conducted to characterize different odorant receptors, neuroanatomy and odorant response properties of the early olfactory system of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Yet many odorant receptors remain only partially characterized, and the odorant transduction process and the axon hillock spiking mechanism of the olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) have yet to be fully determined. Identity and concentration, two key characteristics of the space of odorants, are encoded by the odorant transduction process. Detailed molecular models of the odorant transduction process are, however, scarce for fruit flies. To address these challenges we advance a comprehensive model of fruit fly OSNs as a cascade consisting of an odorant transduction process (OTP) and a biophysical spike generator (BSG). We model odorant identity and concentration using an odorant-receptor binding rate tensor, modulated by the odorant concentration profile, and an odorant-receptor dissociation rate tensor, and quantitatively describe the mechanics of the molecular ligand binding/dissociation of the OTP. We model the BSG as a Connor-Stevens point neuron. The resulting spatio-temporal encoding model of the <i>Drosophila</i> antenna provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the neural code of both odorant identity and odorant concentration and advances the state-of-the-art in a number of ways. First, it quantifies on the molecular level the spatio-temporal level of complexity of the transformation taking place in the antennae. The concentration-dependent spatio-temporal code at the output of the antenna circuits determines the level of complexity of olfactory processing in the downstream neuropils, such as odorant recognition and olfactory associative learning. Second, the model is biologically validated using multiple electrophysiological recordings. Third, the model demonstrates that the currently available data for odorant-receptor responses only enable the estimation of the affinity of the odorant-receptor pairs. The odorant-dissociation rate is only available for a few odorant-receptor pairs. Finally, our model calls for new experiments for massively identifying the odorant-receptor dissociation rates of relevance to flies.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FlzLSYrp04s" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The importance of the hippocampus in spatial learning is well established, but the precise relative contributions by the dorsal (septal) and ventral (temporal) subregions remain unresolved. One debate revolves around the extent to which the ventral hippocampus contributes to spatial navigation and learning. Here, separate small subtotal lesions of dorsal hippocampus or ventral hippocampus alone (destroying 18.9 and 28.5% of total hippocampal volume, respectively) spared reference memory acquisition in the water maze. By contrast, combining the two subtotal lesions significantly reduced the rate of acquisition across days. This constitutes evidence for synergistic integration between dorsal and ventral hippocampus in mice. Evidence that ventral hippocampus contributes to spatial/navigation learning also emerged early on during the retention probe test as search preference was reduced in mice with ventral lesions alone or combined lesions. The small ventral lesions also led to anxiolysis in the elevated plus maze and over‐generalization of the conditioned freezing response to a neutral context. Similar effects of comparable magnitudes were seen in mice with combined lesions, suggesting that they were largely due to the small ventral damage. By contrast, small dorsal lesions were uniquely associated with a severe spatial working memory deficit in the water maze. Taken together, both dorsal and ventral poles of the hippocampus contribute to efficient spatial navigation in mice: While the integrity of dorsal hippocampus is necessary for spatial working memory, the acquisition and retrieval of spatial reference memory are modulated by the ventral hippocampus. Although the impairments following ventral damage (alone or in combination with dorsal damage) were less substantial, a wider spectrum of spatial learning, including context conditioning, was implicated. Our results encourage the search for integrative mechanism between dorsal and ventral hippocampus in spatial learning. Candidate neural substrates may include dorsoventral longitudinal connections and reciprocal modulation via overlapping polysynaptic networks beyond hippocampus.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25746?af=R">Longitudinal assessment of multiple sclerosis with the brain‐age paradigm</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>During the natural course of MS, the brain is exposed to ageing as well as disease effects. Brain ageing can be modelled statistically; the so‐called ‘brain‐age’ paradigm. Here, we evaluated whether brain‐predicted age difference (brain‐PAD) was sensitive to the presence of MS, clinical progression and future outcomes.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a longitudinal, multi‐centre sample of 3,565 MRI scans, in 1,204 MS and clinically‐isolated syndrome (CIS) patients and 150 healthy controls (mean follow‐up time: patients 3.41 years, healthy controls 1.97 years), we measured ‘brain‐predicted age’ using T1‐weighted MRI. We compared brain‐PAD between MS and CIS patients and healthy controls, and between disease subtypes. Relationships between brain‐PAD and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) were explored.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>MS patients had markedly higher brain‐PAD than healthy controls (mean brain‐PAD +10.3 years [95% CI 8.5, 12.1] versus 4.3 years [−2.1, 6.4], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The highest brain‐PADs were in secondary‐progressive MS (+19.4 years [17.1, 21.9]). Brain‐PAD at study entry predicted time‐to‐disability progression (hazard ratio 1.02 [1.01, 1.03], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001); though normalised brain volume was a stronger predictor. Greater annualised brain‐PAD increases were associated with greater annualised EDSS score (r = 0.26, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The brain‐age paradigm is sensitive to MS‐related atrophy and clinical progression. A higher brain‐PAD at baseline was associated with more rapid disability progression and the rate of change in brain‐PAD related to worsening disability. Potentially, ‘brain‐age’ could be used as a prognostic biomarker in early‐stage MS, to track disease progression or stratify patients for clinical trial enrolment.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Rodent and human studies examining the relationship between aerobic exercise, brain structure, and brain function indicate that the hippocampus (HC), a brain region critical for episodic memory, demonstrates striking plasticity in response to exercise. Beyond the hippocampal memory system, human studies also indicate that aerobic exercise and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) are associated with individual differences in large‐scale brain networks responsible for broad cognitive domains. Examining network activity in large‐scale resting‐state brain networks may provide a link connecting the observed relationships between aerobic exercise, hippocampal plasticity, and cognitive enhancement within broad cognitive domains. Previously, CRF has been associated with increased functional connectivity of the default mode network (DMN), specifically in older adults. However, how CRF relates to the magnitude and directionality of connectivity, or effective connectivity, between the HC and other DMN nodes remains unknown. We used resting‐state fMRI and conditional Granger causality analysis (CGCA) to test the hypothesis that CRF positively predicts effective connectivity between the HC and other DMN nodes in healthy young adults. Twenty‐six participants (ages 18–35 years) underwent a treadmill test to determine CRF by estimating its primary determinant, maximal oxygen uptake (V<sup>.</sup>O<sub>2max</sub>), and a 10‐min resting‐state fMRI scan to examine DMN effective connectivity. We identified the DMN using group independent component analysis and examined effective connectivity between nodes using CGCA. Linear regression analyses demonstrated that CRF significantly predicts causal influence from the HC to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and lateral temporal cortex and to the HC from the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. The observed relationship between CRF and hippocampal effective connectivity provides a link between the rodent literature, which demonstrates a relationship between aerobic exercise and hippocampal plasticity, and the human literature, which demonstrates a relationship between aerobic exercise and CRF and the enhancement of broad cognitive domains including, but not limited to, memory.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The neurobiology of postnatal hippocampal development in rodents is receiving increased attention as a means to address neurodevelopmental questions and to better understand the neural code(s) for spatial navigation in adulthood. We previously showed that spontaneous alternation (SA) in a Y‐maze, which emerges at the end of the third postnatal week, was related to changes in fast glutamatergic synaptic transmission. In adults, oscillations in the hippocampal local field potential (LFP) (i.e., theta, 4–12 Hz; slow gamma, 25–55 Hz; and fast gamma, 65–100 Hz) have been shown to coordinate the activity of spatially tuned cell types in the hippocampus during route planning and execution. Other investigators have shown that theta activity matures during the first month of life. However, relationships between developmental alterations in gamma oscillations and cognitive function have not been investigated in juveniles, and the impact of developmental changes in excitatory synaptic transmission on network activity remains unclear. We implanted rats at postnatal day 14 to record LFPs from the synaptic layer of area CA1 during Y‐maze exploration at postnatal Days 18, 19, 23, and 24. The positive allosteric modulator of AMPA receptors, CX614, or vehicle was administered prior to each test. We found that slow gamma peak frequency, but not peak power, remained constant across this age range. Fast gamma event rate increased with increasing age, while peak frequency decreased. AMPA receptor modulation impacted slow and fast gamma differently at different ages. Furthermore, gamma events showed relationships with novelty and movement speed that differed based on gamma sub‐band (slow vs. fast). These results support the presence of environmentally‐driven gamma oscillations in hippocampal network activity prior to the end of the third postnatal week of development. Differential refinement of slow and fast gamma occurring across the subsequent week supports involvement in the emergence of spatial navigation ability.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Converging evidence suggests a relationship between aerobic exercise and hippocampal neuroplasticity that interactively impacts hippocampally dependent memory. The majority of human studies have focused on the potential for exercise to reduce brain atrophy and attenuate cognitive decline in older adults, whereas animal studies often center on exercise‐induced neurogenesis and hippocampal plasticity in the dentate gyrus (DG) of young adult animals. In the present study, initially sedentary young adults (18–35 years) participated in a moderate‐intensity randomized controlled exercise intervention trial (<a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov" target="_blank" title="Link to external resource">ClinicalTrials.gov</a>; NCT02057354) for a duration of 12 weeks. The aims of the study were to investigate the relationship between change in cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) as determined by estimated 
<sub>MAX</sub>, hippocampally dependent mnemonic discrimination, and change in hippocampal subfield volume. Results show that improving CRF after exercise training is associated with an increased volume in the left DG/CA3 subregion in young adults. Consistent with previous studies that found exercise‐induced increases in anterior hippocampus in older adults, this result was specific to the hippocampal head, or most anterior portion, of the subregion. Our results also demonstrate a positive relationship between change in CRF and change in corrected accuracy for trials requiring the highest level of discrimination on a putative behavioral pattern separation task. This relationship was observed in individuals who were initially lower‐fit, suggesting that individuals who show greater improvement in their CRF may receive greater cognitive benefit. This work extends animal models by providing evidence for exercise‐induced neuroplasticity specific to the neurogenic zone of the human hippocampus.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Gene and protein expressions are key determinants of cellular function. Neurons are the building blocks of brain circuits, yet the relationship between their molecular identity and the spatial distribution of their dendritic inputs and axonal outputs remains incompletely understood. The open‐source knowledge base <a href="http://hippocampome.org" target="_blank" title="Link to external resource">Hippocampome.org</a> amasses such transcriptomic data from the scientific literature for morphologically defined neuron types in the rodent hippocampal formation: dentate gyrus, CA3, CA2, CA1, subiculum, and entorhinal cortex. Positive, negative, or mixed expression reports were initially obtained from published articles directly connecting molecular evidence to neurons with known axonal and dendritic patterns across hippocampal layers. Here, we supplement this information by collating, formalizing, and leveraging relational expression inferences that link a gene or protein expression or lack thereof to that of another molecule or to an anatomical location. With these additional interpretations, we freely release online a comprehensive human‐ and machine‐readable molecular profile for more than 100 neuron types in <a href="http://hippocampome.org" target="_blank" title="Link to external resource">Hippocampome.org</a>. Analysis of these data ascertains the ability to distinguish unequivocally most neuron types in each of the major subdivisions of the hippocampus based on currently known biochemical markers. Moreover, grouping neuron types by expression similarity reveals eight superfamilies characterized by a few defining molecules.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>There is considerable evidence from non‐human animal studies that the anterior and posterior regions of the hippocampus have different anatomical connections and support different behavioural functions. Although there are some recent human studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that have addressed this idea directly in the memory and spatial processing domains and provided support for it, there has been no broader meta‐analysis of the fMRI literature to determine if there is consistent evidence for functional dissociations in anterior and posterior hippocampus across all of the different cognitive domains in which the hippocampus participates. The purpose of this review is to address this gap in our knowledge using three approaches. One approach involved PubMed searches to identify relevant fMRI papers reporting hippocampal activation during episodic encoding and retrieval, semantic retrieval, working memory, spatial navigation, simulation/scene construction, transitive inference, and social cognition tasks. The second was to use a large meta‐analytic database (neurosynth) to find text terms and coactivation maps associated with the anterior and posterior hippocampal regions identified in the literature search. The third approach was to contrast the resting‐state functional connectivity of the anterior and posterior hippocampal regions using a publicly available database that includes a large sample of adults. These three approaches provided converging evidence that not only are cognitive processes differently distributed along the hippocampal axis, but there also are distinct areas coactivated and functionally connected with the anterior and posterior segments. This anterior/posterior distinction involving multiple cognitive domains is consistent with the animal literature and provides strong support from fMRI for the idea of functional dissociations across the long axis of the hippocampus.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>M‐type (KCNQ2/3) K<sup>+</sup> channels play dominant roles in regulation of active and passive neuronal discharge properties such as resting membrane potential, spike‐frequency adaptation, and hyper‐excitatory states. However, plasticity of M‐channel expression and function in nongenetic forms of epileptogenesis are still not well understood. Using transgenic mice with an EGFP reporter to detect expression maps of KCNQ2 mRNA, we assayed hyperexcitability‐induced alterations in KCNQ2 transcription across subregions of the hippocampus. Pilocarpine and pentylenetetrazol chemoconvulsant models of seizure induction were used, and brain tissue examined 48 hr later. We observed increases in KCNQ2 mRNA in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons after chemoconvulsant‐induced hyperexcitability at 48 hr, but no significant change was observed in dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells. Using chromogenic in situ hybridization assays, changes to KCNQ3 transcription were not detected after hyper‐excitation challenge, but the results for KCNQ2 paralleled those using the KCNQ2‐mRNA reporter mice. In mice 7 days after pilocarpine challenge, levels of KCNQ2 mRNA were similar in all regions to those from control mice. In brain‐slice electrophysiology recordings, CA1 pyramidal neurons demonstrated increased M‐current amplitudes 48 hr after hyperexcitability; however, there were no significant changes to DG granule cell M‐current amplitude. Traumatic brain injury induced significantly greater KCNQ2 expression in the hippocampal hemisphere that was ipsilateral to the trauma. In vivo, after a secondary challenge with subconvulsant dose of pentylenetetrazole, control mice were susceptible to tonic–clonic seizures, whereas mice administered the M‐channel opener retigabine were protected from such seizures. This study demonstrates that increased excitatory activity promotes KCNQ2 upregulation in the hippocampus in a cell‐type specific manner. Such novel ion channel expressional plasticity may serve as a compensatory mechanism after a hyperexcitable event, at least in the short term. The upregulation described could be potentially leveraged in anticonvulsant enhancement of KCNQ2 channels as therapeutic target for preventing onset of epileptogenic seizures.</p>

Abstract
<p>A key goal in hippocampal research is to understand how neuronal activity is generated and organized across hippocampal subregions to enable memory formation and retrieval. Neuronal activity in CA2 is regulated by spatial and social investigation as well as by novelty (Mankin et al., 2015; Alexander et al., 2016), and CA2 activity controls population oscillatory activity in the slow  and ripple ranges within hippocampus (Kay et al., 2016; Oliva et al., 2016; Boehringer et al., 2017; Alexander et al., 2018). CA2 neurons are also required for social recognition memory (Stevenson and Caldwell, 2012; Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014; Smith et al., 2016). Because CA1 exhibits layer-specific organization (Scheffer-Teixeira et al., 2012; Lasztóczi and Klausberger, 2014, 2016) reflective of its inputs (Fernández-Ruiz et al., 2012; Schomburg et al., 2014), and because CA2 activity controls CA1 slow  (Alexander et al., 2018), we hypothesized that silencing CA2 would affect CA1 slow  in a layer-specific manner during investigation of a novel social stimulus. While recording from CA1, we leveraged molecular tools to selectively target and inhibit CA2 pyramidal cells using inhibitory DREADDs while subject mice investigated novel animals or objects. We found that CA2 inhibition reduced slow  power during investigation of a novel animal and fast  power during both novel object and animal investigation in a manner reflective of the CA2 axonal projection zones within CA1. Our results suggest that CA2 contributes to CA1 slow and fast  oscillations in a stimulus-specific manner.</p>

<p>Potential molecular mechanism by which pfn1 regulates microglia polarization and hypoxia/ischemia injuries.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Microglial polarization to the anti‐inflammatory M2 phenotype is essential in resolving neuroinflammation, making it a promising therapeutic strategy for stroke intervention. The actin cytoskeleton is known to be important for the physiological functions of microglia, including migration and phagocytosis. Profilin 1 (PFN1), an actin‐binding protein, is involved in the dynamic transformation and reorganization of actin. However, the role of PFN1 in microglial polarization and ischemia/reperfusion injury is unclear. The role of PFN1 on microglial polarization was examined <i>in vitro</i> in BV2 microglial cells subjected to oxygen‐glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGDR) and <i>in vivo</i> in male mice after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Knockdown of PFN1 inhibited M1 microglial polarization and promoted M2 microglia polarization 48 hr after OGDR stimulation in BV2 cells and 7 days after MCAO‐induced injury in male mice. RhoA/ROCK pathway was involved in the regulation of PFN1 during microglial polarization. Knockdown of PFN1 also significantly attenuated brain infarcts and edema, improved cerebral blood flow and neurological deficits in MCAO‐injured mice. Inhibition of PFN1 effectively protected the brain against ischemia/reperfusion injuries by promoting M2 microglial polarization <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>.</p>

<p>The teleost fish <i>Astyanax mexicanus</i> is extant in an ancestral surface form (right) and derived cave forms (left). Adaptation to life in nutrient poor caves without predation increased exploratory foraging behaviors and decreased aversion to potential predatory cues in the cavefishes. Tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry revealed larger catecholaminergic neurons in regions of the cave <i>Astyanax</i> brain that may mediate these changes in behavior.


</p>
<br />
<p><i>Astyanax mexicanus</i> is a teleost fish that is in the process of allopatric speciation. Ancestral <i>Astyanax</i> are found in surface rivers and derived blind forms are found in cave systems. Adaptation to life in nutrient poor caves without predation includes the evolution of enhanced food seeking behaviors and loss of defensive responses. These behavioral adaptations may be mediated by changes in catecholaminergic control systems in the brain. We examined the distribution of tyrosine hydroxylase, a conserved precursor for the synthesis of the catecholamines dopamine and noradrenaline, in the brains of surface and cave <i>Astyanax</i> using immunohistochemistry. We found differences in tyrosine hydroxylase staining in regions that are associated with non‐visual sensory perception, motor control, endocrine release, and attention. These differences included significant increases in the diameters of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive soma in cave <i>Astyanax</i> in the olfactory bulb, basal telencephalon, preoptic nuclei, ventral thalamus, posterior tuberculum, and locus coeruleus. These increases in modulation by dopamine and noradrenaline likely indicate changes in behavioral control that underlie adaptations to the cave environment.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disease with a substantial genetic component and immune‐mediated neurodegeneration. Patients with MS show structural brain differences relative to individuals without MS, including smaller regional volumes and alterations in white matter (WM) microstructure. Whether genetic risk for MS is associated with brain structure during early neurodevelopment remains unclear. In this study, we explore the association between MS polygenic risk scores (PRS) and brain imaging outcomes from a large, population‐based pediatric sample to gain insight into the underlying neurobiology of MS.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 8‐ to 12‐year‐old genotyped participants from the Generation R Study in whom T1‐weighted volumetric (n = 1,136) and/or diffusion tensor imaging (n = 1,088) had been collected. PRS for MS were calculated based on a large genome‐wide association study of MS (n = 41,505) and were regressed on regional volumes, global and tract‐specific fractional anisotropy (FA), and global mean diffusivity using linear regression.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>No associations were observed for the regional volumes. We observed a positive association between the MS PRS and global FA (β = 0.098, standard error [SE] = 0.030, <i>p</i> = 1.08 × 10<sup>−3</sup>). Tract‐specific analyses showed higher FA and lower radial diffusivity in several tracts. We replicated our findings in an independent sample of children (n = 186) who were scanned in an earlier phase (global FA; β = 0.189, SE = 0.072, <i>p</i> = 9.40 × 10<sup>−3</sup>).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This is the first study to show that greater genetic predisposition for MS is associated with higher global brain WM FA at an early age in the general population. Our results suggest a preadolescent time window within neurodevelopment in which MS risk variants act upon the brain. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;87:774–787</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X‐linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder due to pathogenic mutations in the <i>MECP2</i> gene. Motor impairment constitutes the core diagnostic feature of RTT. Preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated alteration of excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance and aberrant synaptic plasticity at the cortical level. We aimed to understand neurobiological mechanisms underlying motor deficit by assessing in vivo synaptic plasticity and E/I balance in the primary motor cortex (M1).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In 14 patients with typical RTT, 9 epilepsy control patients, and 11 healthy controls, we applied paired‐pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols to evaluate the excitation index, a biomarker reflecting the contribution of inhibitory and facilitatory circuits in M1. Intermittent TMS‐theta burst stimulation was used to probe long‐term potentiation (LTP)‐like plasticity in M1. Motor impairment, assessed by ad hoc clinical scales, was correlated with neurophysiological metrics.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>RTT patients displayed a significant increase of the excitation index (<i>p</i> = 0.003), as demonstrated by the reduction of short‐interval intracortical inhibition and increase of intracortical facilitation, suggesting a shift toward cortical excitation likely due to GABAergic dysfunction. Impairment of inhibitory circuits was also confirmed by the reduction of long‐interval intracortical inhibition (<i>p</i> = 0.002). LTP‐like plasticity in M1 was abolished (<i>p</i> = 0.008) and scaled with motor disability (all <i>p</i> = 0.003).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>TMS is a method that can be used to assess cortical motor function in RTT patients. Our findings support the introduction of TMS measures in clinical and research settings to monitor the progression of motor deficit and response to treatment. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;87:763–773</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The identification of sensitive biomarkers is essential to validate therapeutics for Huntington disease (HD). We directly compare structural imaging markers across the largest collective imaging HD dataset to identify a set of imaging markers robust to multicenter variation and to derive upper estimates on sample sizes for clinical trials in HD.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used 1 postprocessing pipeline to retrospectively analyze T1‐weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from 624 participants at 3 time points, from the PREDICT‐HD, TRACK‐HD, and IMAGE‐HD studies. We used mixed effects models to adjust regional brain volumes for covariates, calculate effect sizes, and simulate possible treatment effects in disease‐affected anatomical regions. We used our model to estimate the statistical power of possible treatment effects for anatomical regions and clinical markers.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified a set of common anatomical regions that have similarly large standardized effect sizes (&gt;0.5) between healthy control and premanifest HD (PreHD) groups. These included subcortical, white matter, and cortical regions and nonventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We also observed a consistent spatial distribution of effect size by region across the whole brain. We found that multicenter studies were necessary to capture treatment effect variance; for a 20% treatment effect, power of &gt;80% was achieved for the caudate (n = 661), pallidum (n = 687), and nonventricular CSF (n = 939), and, crucially, these imaging markers provided greater power than standard clinical markers.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings provide the first cross‐study validation of structural imaging markers in HD, supporting the use of these measurements as endpoints for both observational studies and clinical trials. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;87:751–762</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to determine the association between striatal dopaminergic depletion, cerebral β‐amyloid deposition, and cognitive dysfunction in Lewy body disease (LBD).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This cross‐sectional study recruited 48 LBD patients (30 with dementia, 18 with mild cognitive impairment) and 15 control subjects from a university‐based hospital. We measured the striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) activity and regional β‐amyloid burden using <i>N</i>‐(3‐[<sup>18</sup>F]fluoropropyl)‐2β‐carbon ethoxy‐3β‐(4‐iodophenyl) nortropane (FP‐CIT) positron emission tomography (PET) and <sup>18</sup>F‐florbetaben (FBB) PET, respectively. The relationship between striatal FP‐CIT uptake, regional cortical FBB uptake, and cognitive function scores was evaluated using path analyses. We also investigated the effects of striatal FP‐CIT uptake and cortical FBB uptake on the interval between motor symptom and dementia onset.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Reduced striatal FP‐CIT uptake was associated with increased FBB uptake in the posterior cortical regions, most prominently in the occipital cortices. Reduced FP‐CIT uptake in the anterior putamen was associated with visuospatial dysfunction with mediation of increased occipital FBB uptake. Reduced FP‐CIT uptake in the posterior putamen and an increased parietal FBB uptake were independently associated with memory dysfunction. Reduced striatal FP‐CIT uptake was associated with attention, language, and frontal/executive dysfunction, independent of amyloid deposition. Increased FBB uptake, especially in the parietal cortex, was associated with earlier onset of dementia.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results suggest that occipital β‐amyloid deposition may contribute to the association between striatal dopaminergic depletion and visuospatial dysfunction in LBD patients. Although the effects of reduced DAT activity are more prominent than those of β‐amyloid burden on cognitive dysfunction, the latter affects the onset of cognitive dysfunction. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;87:739–750</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Clinical trials in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) continue to rely on survival or functional scales as endpoints, despite the emergence of quantitative biomarkers. Neuroimaging‐based biomarkers in ALS have been shown to detect ALS‐associated pathology in vivo, although anatomical patterns of disease spread are poorly characterized. The objective of this study is to simulate disease propagation using network analyses of cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to predict disease progression.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using brain networks of ALS patients (n = 208) and matched controls across longitudinal time points, network‐based statistics unraveled progressive network degeneration originating from the motor cortex and expanding in a spatiotemporal manner. We applied a computational model to the MRI scan of patients to simulate this progressive network degeneration. Simulated aggregation levels at the group and individual level were validated with empirical impairment observed at later time points of white matter and clinical decline using both internal and external datasets.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We observe that computer‐simulated aggregation levels mimic true disease patterns in ALS patients. Simulated patterns of involvement across cortical areas show significant overlap with the patterns of empirically impaired brain regions on later scans, at both group and individual levels. These findings are validated using an external longitudinal dataset of 30 patients.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results are in accordance with established pathological staging systems and may have implications for patient stratification in future clinical trials. Our results demonstrate the utility of computational models in ALS to predict disease progression and underscore their potential as a prognostic biomarker. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;87:725–738</b></p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25705?af=R">Validation of Rapid Magnetic Resonance Myelin Imaging in Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for multiple sclerosis diagnostics but is conventionally not specific to demyelination. Myelin imaging is often hampered by long scanning times, complex postprocessing, or lack of clinical approval. This study aimed to assess the specificity, robustness, and clinical value of Rapid Estimation of Myelin for Diagnostic Imaging, a new myelin imaging technique based on time‐efficient simultaneous T<sub>1</sub>/T<sub>2</sub> relaxometry and proton density mapping in multiple sclerosis.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Rapid myelin imaging was applied using 3T MRI ex vivo in 3 multiple sclerosis brain samples and in vivo in a prospective cohort of 71 multiple sclerosis patients and 21 age/sex‐matched healthy controls, with scan–rescan repeatability in a subcohort. Disability in patients was assessed by the Expanded Disability Status Scale and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test at baseline and 2‐year follow‐up.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Rapid myelin imaging correlated with myelin‐related stains (proteolipid protein immunostaining and Luxol fast blue) and demonstrated good precision. Multiple sclerosis patients had, relative to controls, lower normalized whole‐brain and normal‐appearing white matter myelin fractions, which correlated with baseline cognitive and physical disability. Longitudinally, these myelin fractions correlated with follow‐up physical disability, even with correction for baseline disability.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Rapid Estimation of Myelin for Diagnostic Imaging provides robust myelin quantification that detects diffuse demyelination in normal‐appearing tissue in multiple sclerosis, which is associated with both cognitive and clinical disability. Because the technique is fast, with automatic postprocessing and US Food and Drug Administration/CE clinical approval, it can be a clinically feasible biomarker that may be suitable to monitor myelin dynamics and evaluate treatments aiming at remyelination. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;87:710–724</b></p>

<p>Tau hyperphosphorylation is an early step in tau‐mediated neurodegeneration and is associated with intracellular aggregation of tau as neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal and synaptic loss, and eventual cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer disease. Sleep loss increases the cerebrospinal fluid concentration of amyloid‐β and tau. Using mass spectrometry, we measured tau and phosphorylated tau concentrations in serial samples of cerebrospinal fluid collected from participants who were sleep‐deprived, treated with sodium oxybate, or allowed to sleep normally. We found that sleep loss affected phosphorylated tau differently depending on the modified site. These findings suggest a mechanism for sleep loss to increase risk of Alzheimer disease. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;87:700–709</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Novel, highly effective disease‐modifying therapies have revolutionized multiple sclerosis (MS) care. However, evidence from large comparative studies on important safety outcomes, such as cancer, is still lacking.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this nationwide register‐based cohort study, we linked data from the Swedish MS register to the Swedish Cancer Register and other national health care and census registers. We included 4,187 first‐ever initiations of rituximab, 1,620 of fingolimod, and 1,670 of natalizumab in 6,136 MS patients matched for age, sex, and location to 37,801 non‐MS general population subjects. Primary outcome was time to first invasive cancer.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 78 invasive cancers among treated patients: rituximab 33 (incidence rate [IR] per 10,000 person‐years = 34.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 23.7–48.3), fingolimod 28 (IR = 44.0, 95% CI = 29.2–63.5), and natalizumab 17 (IR = 26.0, 95% CI = 15.1–41.6). The general population IR was 31.0 (95% CI = 27.8–34.4). Adjusting for baseline characteristics, we found no difference in risk of invasive cancer between rituximab, natalizumab, and the general population but a possibly higher risk with fingolimod compared to the general population (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.53, 95% CI = 0.98–2.38) and rituximab (HR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.00–2.84).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In this first large comparative study of 3 highly effective MS disease‐modifying therapies, no increased risk of invasive cancer was seen with rituximab and natalizumab, compared to the general population. However, there was a borderline‐significant increased risk with fingolimod, compared to both the general population and rituximab. It was not possible to attribute this increased risk to any specific type of cancer, and further studies are warranted to validate these findings. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;87:688–699</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Antibodies against neuronal N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis alter neuronal synaptic function and plasticity, but the effects on other cells of the nervous system are unknown.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis (preabsorbed or not with GluN1) and a human NMDAR‐specific monoclonal antibody (SSM5) derived from plasma cells of a patient, along the corresponding controls, were used in the studies. To evaluate the activity of oligodendrocyte NMDARs and α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors in vitro after exposure to patients' CSF antibodies or SSM5, we used a functional assay based on cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging. Expression of the glucose transporter (GLUT1) in oligodendrocytes was assessed by immunocytochemistry.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>NMDAR agonist responses were robustly reduced after preincubation of oligodendrocytes with patients' CSF or SSM5 but remained largely unaltered with the corresponding controls. These effects were NMDAR specific, as patients' CSF did not alter responses to AMPA receptor agonists and was abrogated by preabsorption of CSF with HEK cells expressing GluN1 subunit. Patients' CSF also reduced oligodendrocyte expression of glucose transporter GLUT1 induced by NMDAR activity.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Antibodies from patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis specifically alter the function of NMDARs in oligodendrocytes, causing a decrease of expression of GLUT1. Considering that normal GLUT1 expression in oligodendrocytes and myelin is needed to metabolically support axonal function, the findings suggest a link between antibody‐mediated dysfunction of NMDARs in oligodendrocytes and the white matter alterations reported in patients with this disorder. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;87:670–676</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Thalamic atrophy is among the earliest brain changes detected in patients with MS and the degree of thalamic atrophy is a strong predictor of disability progression. The causes of thalamic atrophy are not fully understood. We investigate the contributions of thalamic demyelinated lesions, thalamic neuronal loss, and cerebral white matter lesions to thalamic volume.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used postmortem <i>in situ</i> MRI's of 95 subjects with MS to correlate thalamic lesion volumes with global MRI metrics. We histologically characterized thalamic demyelination patterns and compared neuronal loss and neuritic pathology in the thalami with the extremes of volume.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Grossly apparent thalamic discolorations in cm‐thick brain slices were T2/FLAIR hyperintense, T1‐hypointense, and appeared as perivascular demyelinated lesions with dystrophic neurons/axons. Subependymal demyelinated lesions with axonal loss and microglial/macrophage activation were also observed. The 12 subjects with the least thalamic volume had a 17.6% reduction of median neuronal density in the dorsomedial/ventrolateral and pulvinar nuclei compared with the 14 subjects with the greatest thalamic volume (p = 0.03). After correcting for age, disease duration, sex and T2 lesion volume, neither total (p = 0.20), ovoid (p = 0.31), or subependymal (p = 0.44) MRI thalamic lesion volumes correlated with thalamic volume. Thalamic volume correlated with cerebral T2 lesion volume (Spearman's rho = −0.65, p &lt; 0.001; p &lt; 0.0001 after correcting for age, disease duration, and sex).</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p><i>C9orf72</i> expansion is the most common genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). We examined aging trajectories of cortical thickness (CTh) and surface area in <i>C9orf72</i> expansion adult carriers compared to healthy controls to characterize preclinical cerebral changes leading to symptoms.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Data were obtained from the Genetic Frontotemporal Dementia Initiative. T1‐weighted MRI scans were processed with CIVET 2.1 to extract vertex‐wide CTh and CSA. Symptomatic and presymptomatic subjects were compared to age‐matched controls using mixed‐effects models, controlling for demographic variables. Aging trajectories were compared between carriers and non‐carriers by testing the ‘age by genetic status’ interaction. False‐discovery rate corrections were applied to all vertex‐wide analyses.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The sample included 640 scans from 386 subjects, including 54 symptomatic <i>C9orf72</i> carriers (72.2% behavioral variant FTD), 83 asymptomatic carriers and 249 controls (age range 18–86). Symptomatic carriers showed fairly symmetric reduction in CTh/CSA in most of the frontal lobes, in addition to large temporo‐parietal areas. Presymptomatic subjects had reduced CTh/CSA in more restricted areas of the medial fronto‐parietal lobes, in addition to scattered lateral fronto‐parieto‐temporal areas. These differences were explained by faster cortical thinning linearly throughout adulthood in a similar anatomical distribution, with differences emerging in the early 30s. CSA reduction was also faster in mutation carriers predominantly in the ventro‐frontal regions.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p><i>C9orf72</i> mutation carriers have faster cortical thinning and surface loss throughout adulthood in regions that show atrophy in symptomatic subjects. This suggests that the pathogenic effects of the mutation lead to structural cerebral changes decades prior to symptoms.</p>

<p>Pericytes are unique, multi-functional mural cells localized at the abluminal side of the perivascular space in microvessels. Originally discovered in 19th century, pericytes had drawn less attention until decades ago mainly due to lack of specific markers. Recently, however, a growing body of evidence has revealed that pericytes play various important roles: development and maintenance of blood–brain barrier (BBB), regulation of the neurovascular system (e.g., vascular stability, vessel formation, cerebral blood flow, etc.), trafficking of inflammatory cells, clearance of toxic waste products from the brain, and acquisition of stem cell-like properties. In the neurovascular unit, pericytes perform these functions through coordinated crosstalk with neighboring cells including endothelial, glial, and neuronal cells. Dysfunction of pericytes contribute to a wide variety of diseases that lead to cognitive impairments such as cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), acute stroke, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and other neurological disorders. For instance, in SVDs, pericyte degeneration leads to microvessel instability and demyelination while in stroke, pericyte constriction after ischemia causes a no-reflow phenomenon in brain capillaries. In AD, which shares some common risk factors with vascular dementia, reduction in pericyte coverage and subsequent microvascular impairments are observed in association with white matter attenuation and contribute to impaired cognition. Pericyte loss causes BBB-breakdown, which stagnates amyloid β clearance and the leakage of neurotoxic molecules into the brain parenchyma. In this review, we first summarize the characteristics of brain microvessel pericytes, and their roles in the central nervous system. Then, we focus on how dysfunctional pericytes contribute to the pathogenesis of vascular cognitive impairment including cerebral ‘small vessel’ and ‘large vessel’ diseases, as well as AD. Finally, we discuss therapeutic implications for these disorders by targeting pericytes.</p>

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common motor neuron disease but currently has no effective treatment. Growing evidence suggests that proteome homeostasis underlies ALS pathogenesis. Protein production, trafficking, and degradation all shape the proteome. We present a hypothesis that proposes all genetic lesions associated with ALS (including in mRNA-binding proteins) cause widespread imbalance to an already metastable proteome. The impact of such dysfunction is felt across the entire proteome and is not restricted to a small subset of proteins.

Steinberg et al. investigate how connections between the central amygdala and the lateral substantia nigra contribute to emotional behaviors. They find that amygdalonigral neurons are activated by salient stimuli and participate in appetitive and aversive learning via connections with nigral GABA and dopamine neurons.

Szczurkowska et al. show that during neuronal polarization, directed mechanisms determine apical dendrite development in embryonic pyramidal neurons. The scaffolding protein Scribble assembles a localized cGMP-synthesis complex in dendrites. The complex is necessary for apical dendrite development in the embryonic hippocampus.

Ohba et al. show that overexpressed PGAM1 in gliomas binds to the cytoplasmic phosphatase WIP1 and prevents its nuclear translocation and dephosphorylation of the ATM signaling pathway. Silencing PGAM1 releases WIP1 to translocate to the nucleus, resulting in a decrease in ATM signaling and an increase in therapeutic efficacy of irradiation and chemotherapy in glioma.

<p>by Anna Hutchinson, Hope Watson, Chris Wallace</p>

Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have successfully identified thousands of loci associated with human diseases. Bayesian genetic fine-mapping studies aim to identify the specific causal variants within GWAS loci responsible for each association, reporting credible sets of plausible causal variants, which are interpreted as containing the causal variant with some “coverage probability”. Here, we use simulations to demonstrate that the coverage probabilities are over-conservative in most fine-mapping situations. We show that this is because fine-mapping data sets are not randomly selected from amongst all causal variants, but from amongst causal variants with larger effect sizes. We present a method to re-estimate the coverage of credible sets using rapid simulations based on the observed, or estimated, SNP correlation structure, we call this the “adjusted coverage estimate”. This is extended to find “adjusted credible sets”, which are the smallest set of variants such that their adjusted coverage estimate meets the target coverage. We use our method to improve the resolution of a fine-mapping study of type 1 diabetes. We found that in 27 out of 39 associated genomic regions our method could reduce the number of potentially causal variants to consider for follow-up, and found that none of the 95% or 99% credible sets required the inclusion of more variants—a pattern matched in simulations of well powered GWAS. Crucially, our method requires only GWAS summary statistics and remains accurate when SNP correlations are estimated from a large reference panel. Using our method to improve the resolution of fine-mapping studies will enable more efficient expenditure of resources in the follow-up process of annotating the variants in the credible set to determine the implicated genes and pathways in human diseases.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZTeJWkGsGCg" width="1" />

<p>by Marco Mauri, Jean-Luc Gouzé, Hidde de Jong, Eugenio Cinquemani</p>

Synthetic microbial consortia have been increasingly utilized in biotechnology and experimental evidence shows that suitably engineered consortia can outperform individual species in the synthesis of valuable products. Despite significant achievements, though, a quantitative understanding of the conditions that make this possible, and of the trade-offs due to the concurrent growth of multiple species, is still limited. In this work, we contribute to filling this gap by the investigation of a known prototypical synthetic consortium. A first <i>E. coli</i> strain, producing a heterologous protein, is sided by a second <i>E. coli</i> strain engineered to scavenge toxic byproducts, thus favoring the growth of the producer at the expense of diverting part of the resources to the growth of the cleaner. The simplicity of the consortium is ideal to perform an in depth-analysis and draw conclusions of more general interest. We develop a coarse-grained mathematical model that quantitatively accounts for literature data from different key growth phenotypes. Based on this, assuming growth in chemostat, we first investigate the conditions enabling stable coexistence of both strains and the effect of the metabolic load due to heterologous protein production. In these conditions, we establish when and to what extent the consortium outperforms the producer alone in terms of productivity. Finally, we show in chemostat as well as in a fed-batch scenario that gain in productivity comes at the price of a reduced yield, reflecting at the level of the consortium resource allocation trade-offs that are well-known for individual species.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yUpRNtkUMDo" width="1" />

Widefield calcium imaging enables recording of large-scale neural activity across the mouse dorsal cortex. In order to examine the relationship of these neural signals to the resulting behavior, it is critical to demix the recordings into meaningful spatial and temporal components that can be mapped onto well-defined brain regions. However, no current tools satisfactorily extract the activity of the different brain regions in individual mice in a data-driven manner, while taking into account mouse-specific and preparation-specific differences. Here, we introduce Localized semi-Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (LocaNMF), a method that efficiently decomposes widefield video data and allows us to directly compare activity across multiple mice by outputting mouse-specific localized functional regions that are significantly more interpretable than more traditional decomposition techniques. Moreover, it provides a natural subspace to directly compare correlation maps and neural dynamics across different behaviors, mice, and experimental conditions, and enables identification of task- and movement-related brain regions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CDkfhRwyf0Y" width="1" />

<p>by Nicholas T. Franklin, Michael J. Frank</p>

Humans routinely face novel environments in which they have to generalize in order to act adaptively. However, doing so involves the non-trivial challenge of deciding which aspects of a task domain to generalize. While it is sometimes appropriate to simply re-use a learned behavior, often adaptive generalization entails recombining distinct components of knowledge acquired across multiple contexts. Theoretical work has suggested a computational trade-off in which it can be more or less useful to learn and generalize aspects of task structure jointly or compositionally, depending on previous task statistics, but it is unknown whether humans modulate their generalization strategy accordingly. Here we develop a series of navigation tasks that separately manipulate the statistics of goal values (“what to do”) and state transitions (“how to do it”) across contexts and assess whether human subjects generalize these task components separately or conjunctively. We find that human generalization is sensitive to the statistics of the previously experienced task domain, favoring compositional or conjunctive generalization when the task statistics are indicative of such structures, and a mixture of the two when they are more ambiguous. These results support a normative “meta-generalization” account and suggests that people not only generalize previous task components but also generalize the statistical structure most likely to support generalization.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jkWq3zlKQgI" width="1" />

<p>by Christian Quirouette, Nada P. Younis, Micaela B. Reddy, Catherine A. A. Beauchemin</p>

Within the human respiratory tract (HRT), virus diffuses through the periciliary fluid (PCF) bathing the epithelium. But virus also undergoes advection: as the mucus layer sitting atop the PCF is pushed along by the ciliated cell’s beating cilia, the PCF and its virus content are also pushed along, upwards towards the nose and mouth. While many mathematical models (MMs) have described the course of influenza A virus (IAV) infections in vivo, none have considered the impact of both diffusion and advection on the kinetics and localization of the infection. The MM herein represents the HRT as a one-dimensional track extending from the nose down towards the lower HRT, wherein stationary cells interact with IAV which moves within (diffusion) and along with (advection) the PCF. Diffusion was found to be negligible in the presence of advection which effectively sweeps away IAV, preventing infection from disseminating below the depth at which virus first deposits. Higher virus production rates (10-fold) are required at higher advection speeds (40 μm/s) to maintain equivalent infection severity and timing. Because virus is entrained upwards, upper parts of the HRT see more virus than lower parts. As such, infection peaks and resolves faster in the upper than in the lower HRT, making it appear as though infection progresses from the upper towards the lower HRT, as reported in mice. When the spatial MM is expanded to include cellular regeneration and an immune response, it reproduces tissue damage levels reported in patients. It also captures the kinetics of seasonal and avian IAV infections, via parameter changes consistent with reported differences between these strains, enabling comparison of their treatment with antivirals. This new MM offers a convenient and unique platform from which to study the localization and spread of respiratory viral infections within the HRT.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/e50KlDmALV0" width="1" />

Microscopy image analysis is a major bottleneck in quantification of single-cell microscopy data, typically requiring human oversight and curation, which limit both accuracy and throughput. To address this, we developed a deep learning-based image analysis pipeline that performs segmentation, tracking, and lineage reconstruction. Our analysis focuses on time-lapse movies of <i>Escherichia coli</i> cells trapped in a "mother machine" microfluidic device, a scalable platform for long-term single-cell analysis that is widely used in the field. While deep learning has been applied to cell segmentation problems before, our approach is fundamentally innovative in that it also uses machine learning to perform cell tracking and lineage reconstruction. With this framework we are able to get high fidelity results (1% error rate), without human intervention. Further, the algorithm is fast, with complete analysis of a typical frame containing ~150 cells taking &lt;700msec. The framework is not constrained to a particular experimental set up and has the potential to generalize to time-lapse images of other organisms or different experimental configurations. These advances open the door to a myriad of applications including real-time tracking of gene expression and high throughput analysis of strain libraries at single-cell resolution.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yhxcQeuqnCk" width="1" />

Studies of complex disorders benefit from integrative analyses of multiple omics data. Yet, sample mix-ups frequently occur in multi-omics studies, weakening statistical power and risking false findings. Accurately aligning sample information, genotype, and corresponding omics data is critical for integrative analyses. We developed DRAMS (https://github.com/Yi-Jiang/DRAMS) to Detect and Re-Align Mixed-up Samples to address the sample mix-up problem. It uses a logistic regression model followed by a modified topological sorting algorithm to identify the potential true IDs based on data relationships of multi-omics. According to tests using simulated data, the more types of omics data used or the smaller the proportion of mix-ups, the better that DRAMS performs. Applying DRAMS to real data from the PsychENCODE BrainGVEX project, we detected and corrected 201 (12.5% of total data generated) mix-ups. Of the 21 mix-ups involving errors of racial identity, DRAMS re-assigned all data to the correct racial group in the 1000 Genomes project. In doing so, quantitative trait loci (QTL) (FDR&lt;0.01) increased by an average of 1.62-fold. The use of DRAMS in multi-omics studies will strengthen statistical power of the study and improve quality of the results. Even though very limited studies have multi-omics data in place, we expect such data will increase quickly with the needs of DRAMS.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v735bzy17ts" width="1" />

<p>by Chloé Pasture, Anna Montagnini, Laurent Udo Perrinet</p>

Animal behavior constantly adapts to changes, for example when the statistical properties of the environment change unexpectedly. For an agent that interacts with this volatile setting, it is important to react accurately and as quickly as possible. It has already been shown that when a random sequence of motion ramps of a visual target is biased to one direction (e.g. right or left), human observers adapt their eye movements to accurately anticipate the target’s expected direction. Here, we prove that this ability extends to a volatile environment where the probability bias could change at random switching times. In addition, we also recorded the explicit prediction of the next outcome as reported by observers using a rating scale. Both results were compared to the estimates of a probabilistic agent that is optimal in relation to the assumed generative model. Compared to the classical leaky integrator model, we found a better match between our probabilistic agent and the behavioral responses, both for the anticipatory eye movements and the explicit task. Furthermore, by controlling the level of preference between exploitation and exploration in the model, we were able to fit for each individual’s experimental dataset the most likely level of volatility and analyze inter-individual variability across participants. These results prove that in such an unstable environment, human observers can still represent an internal belief about the environmental contingencies, and use this representation both for sensory-motor control and for explicit judgments. This work offers an innovative approach to more generically test the diversity of human cognitive abilities in uncertain and dynamic environments.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bv9wsfV3c6Q" width="1" />

<p>by Miguel Brun-Usan, Christoph Thies, Richard A. Watson</p>

Cell differentiation in multicellular organisms requires cells to respond to complex combinations of extracellular cues, such as morphogen concentrations. Some models of phenotypic plasticity conceptualise the response as a relatively simple function of a single environmental cues (e.g. a linear function of one cue), which facilitates rigorous analysis. Conversely, more mechanistic models such those implementing GRNs allows for a more general class of response functions but makes analysis more difficult. Therefore, a general theory describing how cells integrate multi-dimensional signals is lacking. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework for understanding the relationships between environmental cues (inputs) and phenotypic responses (outputs) underlying cell plasticity. We describe the relationship between environment and cell phenotype using logical functions, making the evolution of cell plasticity equivalent to a simple categorisation learning task. This abstraction allows us to apply principles derived from learning theory to understand the evolution of multi-dimensional plasticity. Our results show that natural selection is capable of discovering adaptive forms of cell plasticity associated with complex logical functions. However, developmental dynamics cause simpler functions to evolve more readily than complex ones. By using conceptual tools derived from learning theory we show that this developmental bias can be interpreted as a learning bias in the acquisition of plasticity functions. Because of that bias, the evolution of plasticity enables cells, under some circumstances, to display appropriate plastic responses to environmental conditions that they have not experienced in their evolutionary past. This is possible when the selective environment mirrors the bias of the developmental dynamics favouring the acquisition of simple plasticity functions–an example of the necessary conditions for generalisation in learning systems. These results illustrate the functional parallelisms between learning in neural networks and the action of natural selection on environmentally sensitive gene regulatory networks. This offers a theoretical framework for the evolution of plastic responses that integrate information from multiple cues, a phenomenon that underpins the evolution of multicellularity and developmental robustness.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jVs6kVBFgC4" width="1" />

Nervous systems exploit regularities in the sensory environment to predict sensory input, adjust behavior, and thereby maximize fitness. Entrainment of neural oscillations allows retaining temporal regularities of sensory information, a prerequisite for prediction. Entrainment has been extensively described at the frequencies of periodic inputs most commonly present in visual and auditory landscapes (e.g., &gt;0.5 Hz). An open question is whether neural entrainment also occurs for regularities at much longer timescales. Here, we exploited the fact that the temporal dynamics of thermal stimuli in natural environment can unfold very slowly. We show that ultralow-frequency neural oscillations preserved a long-lasting trace of sensory information through neural entrainment to periodic thermo-nociceptive input as low as 0.1 Hz. Importantly, revealing the functional significance of this phenomenon, both power and phase of the entrainment predicted individual pain sensitivity. In contrast, periodic auditory input at the same ultralow frequency did not entrain ultralow-frequency oscillations. These results demonstrate that a functionally significant neural entrainment can occur at temporal scales far longer than those commonly explored. The non-supramodal nature of our results suggests that ultralow-frequency entrainment might be tuned to the temporal scale of the statistical regularities characteristic of different sensory modalities.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/KKPxATUxu5Q" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>American‐style football (ASF) has gained attention because of possible links between repetitive head injury and neurodegenerative diseases. While post‐mortem pathologic changes consistent with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) have been reported in ASF players, there are currently no established pre‐mortem diagnostic criteria for CTE. Nevertheless, presented with symptoms of cognitive impairment, clinicians treating former players may be inclined to suggest CTE without a thorough exploration of comorbid factors that demonstrate similar clinical phenotypes to putative CTE.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A survey of 3,913 former ASF players aged 24 to 89 who responded by March 2019.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Despite being a post‐mortem diagnosis, 108 players (2.8%) self‐reported clinician‐diagnosed CTE. The percentage of players under age 60 reporting a CTE diagnosis was 2.3%, versus 3.7% in participants age 60 or older. Comorbidities in participants self‐reporting CTE were significantly more common, including sleep apnea, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, indicators of past or current depression, hypertension, prescription pain medication use, heart conditions and low testosterone when compared to non‐CTE respondents. Patterns of reporting for obesity, hypertension, heart conditions or hypercholesterolemia differed between older and younger participants. Cognitive impairment symptoms were significantly higher in participants self‐reporting CTE.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Some former professional football players have been clinically diagnosed with CTE, a post‐mortem condition. Comorbidities that can affect cognition were associated with CTE diagnoses in both older and younger players. While underlying neuropathology cannot be ruled out, treatable conditions should be explored in former athletes demonstrating CTE‐linked clinical phenotypes or symptoms as a means of improving cognitive health in these patients.</p>

<p>There has not been a major change in how neuroscientists approach stereotaxic methods in decades. Here, we present a new stereotaxic method that provides an alternative approach to a traditional u-frame stereotaxic device and reduces costs, surgical time, and aids repeatability. The RatHat brain implantation system is a 3D-printable stereotaxic device for rats that is fabricated prior to surgery and fits to the shape of the skull. RatHat builds are directly implanted into the brain without the need for head-leveling or coordinate-mapping during surgery. The RatHat can be used in conjunction with the traditional u-frame stereotaxic device, but does not require the use of a micromanipulator for successful implantations. Each RatHat contains several primary components including the implant for mounting intracranial components, the surgical stencil for targeting drill sites, and the protective cap for preventing damage from impacts and debris. Each component serves a unique function and can be used together or separately. We demonstrate the feasibility of the RatHat in four different proof-of-principle experiments: (1) a three-pole cannula apparatus, (2) an optrode-electrode assembly, (3) a fixed-electrode array, and (4) a tetrode hyperdrive. Implants were successful, durable, and long-lasting (up to nine months). RatHat print files are easily created, can be modified in computer aided design (CAD) software for a variety of applications, and are easily shared, contributing to open science goals and replications. The RatHat has been adapted to multiple experimental paradigms in our lab and should be a useful new way to conduct stereotaxic implant surgeries in rodents.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25738?af=R">Progressive multiple sclerosis is associated with faster and specific retinal layer atrophy</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Therapeutic development in progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS) has been hampered by a lack of reliable biomarkers to monitor neurodegeneration. Optical coherence tomography (OCT)‐derived retinal measures have been proposed as promising biomarkers to fulfill this role. However, it is unclear if retinal atrophy persists in PMS, exceeds normal aging, or can be distinguished from relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>178 RRMS, 186 PMS, and 66 control participants were followed with serial OCT for a median follow‐up of 3.7 years.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The estimated proportion of peri‐papillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) and macular ganglion cell+inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thinning in MS attributable to normal aging increased from 42.7% and 16.7% respectively at age 25 years, to 83.7% and 81.1% at age 65 years. However, independent of age, PMS was associated with faster pRNFL (−0.34 ± 0.09%/year; p &lt; 0.001) and GCIPL (−0.27 ± 0.07%/year; p &lt; 0.001) thinning, as compared to RRMS. In both MS and controls, higher baseline age was associated with faster inner (INL) and outer nuclear layer (ONL) thinning. INL and ONL thinning were independently faster in PMS, as compared to controls (INL:‐0.09 ± 0.04%/year, p = 0.03; ONL:‐0.12 ± 0.06%/year, p = 0.04), and RRMS (INL:‐0.10 ± 0.04%/year, p = 0.01; ONL:‐0.13 ± 0.05%/year, p = 0.01), while they were similar in RRMS and controls. Unlike RRMS, disease‐modifying therapies (DMTs) did not impact rates of retinal layer atrophy in PMS.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>PMS is associated with faster retinal atrophy independent of age. INL and ONL measures may be novel biomarkers of neurodegeneration in PMS, that appear to be unaffected by conventional DMTs. The effects of aging on rates of retinal layer atrophy should be considered in clinical trials incorporating OCT outcomes.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In this invited review, we argue for the need to determine whether appetitive and aversive behaviors, be they goal‐directed or habitual, share overlapping neural circuitry. To motivate our argument, we first summarize what is currently known about the neural circuits governing aversive and appetitive behaviors by focusing first on the three hypothesized phases of avoidance learning, and then on goal‐directed and habitual reward seeking. We then provide several reasons to believe that the neural circuits of appetitive and aversive instrumental behaviors are not completely overlapping. We next discuss an experimental strategy to determine the extent of overlap based on a new computational framework that improves the identification of goal‐directed and habitual actions regardless of valence. Finally, we discuss recent work in obsessive‐compulsive disorder that uses this computational framework to determine whether patients perform appetitive and aversive versions of the same task using the same behavioral strategies and neural circuits.</p>

Multiple trials of aversive olfactory conditioning in Drosophila can form an aversive memory for one odor and an unexpected safety memory for the other. Although safety memory appears slowly after training, it lasts longer than aversive memory.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25739?af=R">Frontotemporal dementia: correlations between psychiatric symptoms and pathology</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The pathology of frontotemporal dementia, termed frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), is characterized by distinct molecular classes of aggregated proteins, the most common being TDP‐43, tau, and FUS. With a few exceptions, it is currently not possible to predict the underlying pathology based on the clinical syndrome. In this study, we set out to investigate the relationship between pathological and clinical presentation at single symptom level, including neuropsychiatric features.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The presence or absence of symptoms from the current clinical guidelines, together with neuropsychiatric features such as hallucinations and delusions, were scored and compared across pathological groups in a cohort of 150 brain donors.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Our cohort consisted of 68.6% FTLD donors (35.3% TDP‐43, 28% tau, and 5.3% FUS) and 31.3% non‐FTLD donors with a clinical diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia and a different pathological substrate such as Alzheimer's disease (23%). The presence of hyperorality points to FTLD rather than non‐FTLD pathology (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Within the FTLD group, hallucinations in the initial years of the disease were related to TDP‐43 pathology (<i>P</i> = 0.02), including but not limited to <i>C9orf72</i> repeat expansion carriers. The presence of perseverative or compulsive behavior was more common in the TDP‐B and TDP‐C histotypes (<i>P</i> = 0.002).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings indicate that neuropsychiatric features are common in FTLD and form an important indicator of underlying pathology. In order to allow better inclusion of patients in targeted molecular trials, the routine evaluation of patients with frontotemporal dementia should include the presence and nature of neuropsychiatric symptoms.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25744?af=R">Hippocampal interictal spikes during sleep impact long‐term memory consolidation</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Non rapid eye movement sleep is supposed to play a key role in long‐term memory consolidation transferring information from hippocampus to neocortex. However, sleep also activates epileptic activities in medial temporal regions. This study investigated whether interictal hippocampal spikes during sleep would impair long‐term memory consolidation.</p>


<h2>Method</h2>
<p>We prospectively measured visual and verbal memory performance in 20 patients with epilepsy investigated with stereoelectroencephalography at immediate, 30‐min and 1‐week delays, and studied the correlations between interictal hippocampal spike frequency during waking and the first cycle of non‐rapid eye movement sleep and memory performance, taking into account the number of seizures occurring during the consolidation period and other possible confounding factors such as age and epilepsy duration.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Retention of verbal memory over 1 week was negatively correlated with hippocampal spike frequency during sleep, whereas no significant correlation was found with hippocampal interictal spikes during waking. No significant result was found for visual memory. Regression tree analysis showed that the number of seizures was the first factor that impaired the verbal memory retention between 30min and 1 week. When the number of seizures was below 5, spike frequency during sleep higher than 13/min was associated with impaired memory retention over 1‐week.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results show that activation of interictal spikes in hippocampus during sleep and seizures specifically impair long‐term memory consolidation. We hypothesize that hippocampal interictal spikes during sleep interrupt hippocampal‐neocortical transfer of information.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The praying mantis is a good model for the study of motor control, especially for investigating the transformation from sensory signals into motor commands. In insects, thoracic ganglia (TG) play an important role in motor control. To understand the functional organization of TG, an atlas is useful. However, except for the fruitfly, no three‐dimensional atlas of TG has not been reported for insects. In this study, we generated a three‐dimensional atlas of prothoracic, mesothoracic, and metathoracic ganglia in the praying mantis (<i>Tenodera aridifolia</i>). First, we observed serial sections of the prothoracic ganglion stained with hematoxylin and eosin to identify longitudinal tracts and transverse commissures. We then visualized neuropil areas by immunostaining whole‐mount TG with an anti‐synapsin antibody. Before labeling each neuropil area, standardization using the iterative shape averaging method was applied to images to make neuropil contours distinct. Neuropil areas in TG were defined based on their shape and relative position to tracts and commissures. Finally, a three‐dimensional atlas was reconstructed from standardized images of the TG. The standard TG are available at the Comparative Neuroscience Platform website (<a href="http://cns.neuroinf.jp" target="_blank" title="Link to external resource">cns.neuroinf.jp</a>/modules/xoonips/detail.php?item_id=11946) and can be used as a common reference map to combine the anatomical data obtained from different individuals.</p>

<p>Parasol cells are one of the major types of retinal ganglion cells, and they give rise to the magnocellular stream of visual information processing. They respond well to moving and other rapidly changing stimuli in their receptive field. They also respond to stimuli outside of their classical receptive fields, and this article is about the inhibitory local circuits that mediate those responses, wide‐field amacrine cells. The parasol cells (orange, light blue, yellow, and pink) were reconstructed from a connectome of central macaque retina, as were dendrites of the presynaptic wide field amacrine cells. Three wide field amacrine cells were wiry type 2 cells (dark blue, salmon, and green), amacrine cells with active dendrites. The locations of their synapses onto parasol cells are circled.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Parasol cells are one of the major types of primate retinal ganglion cells. The goal of this study was to describe the synaptic inputs that shape the light responses of the ON type of parasol cells, which are excited by increments in light intensity. A connectome from central macaque retina was generated by serial blockface scanning electron microscopy. Six neighboring ON parasol cells were reconstructed, and their synaptic inputs were analyzed. On average, they received 21% of their input from bipolar cells, excitatory local circuit neurons receiving input from cones. The majority of their input was from amacrine cells, local circuit neurons of the inner retina that are typically inhibitory. Their contributions to the neural circuit providing input to parasol cells are not well‐understood, and the focus of this study was on the presynaptic wide‐field amacrine cells, which provided 17% of the input to ON parasol cells. These are GABAergic amacrine cells with long, relatively straight dendrites, and sometimes also axons, that run in a single, narrow stratum of the inner plexiform layer. The presynaptic wide‐field amacrine cells were reconstructed, and two types were identified based on their characteristic morphology. One presynaptic amacrine cell was identified as semilunar type 2, a polyaxonal cell that is electrically coupled to ON parasol cells. A second amacrine was identified as wiry type 2, a type known to be sensitive to motion. These inputs likely make ON parasol cells more sensitive to stimuli that are rapidly changing outside their classical receptive fields.</p>

<p>Tvrm4 rhodopsin mutant mice undergo rapid photoreceptor loss upon bright light exposure. Early consequences on the inner retina involve mainly second‐order neurons and include quick dendritic retraction and axonal shrinkage in rod bipolar cells (RBCs) and, later, in cone BCs and the presence of anomalous globular synaptic ribbons (GR). Yet, BC survival is nearly 100% and retinal architecture is overall well preserved. Hence, early remodeling in this adult mutant is moderate and similar to what observed in developmental paradigms of retinitis pigmentosa.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Rod‐cone degenerations, for example, retinitis pigmentosa are leading causes of blindness worldwide. Despite slow disease progression in humans, vision loss is inevitable; therefore, development of vision restoration strategies is crucial. Among others, promising approaches include optogenetics and prosthetic implants, which aim to bypass lost photoreceptors (PRs). Naturally, the efficacy of these therapeutic strategies will depend on inner retinal structural and functional preservation. The present study shows that in photoinducible I307N rhodopsin mice (Translational Vision Research Model 4 [Tvrm4]), a 12k lux light exposure eliminates PRs in the central retina in 1 week, but interneurons and their synapses are maintained for as long as 9 weeks postinduction. Despite bipolar cell dendritic retraction and moderate loss of horizontal cells, the survival rate of various cell types is very high. Significant preservation of conventional synapses and gap junctions in the inner plexiform layer is also observed. We found the number of synaptic ribbons to gradually decline and their ultrastructure to become transiently abnormal, although based on our findings intrinsic retinal architecture is maintained despite complete loss of PRs. Unlike common rodent models of PR degeneration, where the disease phenotype often interferes with retinal development, in Tvrm4 mice, the degenerative process can be induced after retinal development is complete. This time course more closely mimics the timing of disease onset in affected patients. Stability of the inner retina found in these mutants 2 months after PR degeneration suggests moderate, stereotyped remodeling in the early stages of the human disease and represents a promising finding for prompt approaches of vision restoration.</p>

<p>ATP is the major excitatory transmitter from chemoreceptor type I cells to sensory nerve endings in the carotid body, and has been suggested to be released by exocytosis from these cells. We investigated the mRNA expression and immunohistochemical localization of vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT) in the rat carotid body. RT‐PCR detected mRNA expression of VNUT in extracts of the tissue. Immunoreactivity for VNUT was localized in a part of type I cells immunoreactive for synaptophysin (SYN), but not in glial‐like type II cells immunoreactive for S100 and S100B. Among SYN‐immunoreactive type I cells, VNUT immunoreactivity was selectively localized in the sub‐population of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)‐immunorective type I cells associated with nerve endings immunoreactive for the P2X3 purinoceptor; however, it was not detected in the sub‐population of type I cells immunoreactive for dopamine beta‐hydroxylase. Multi‐immunolabeling for VNUT, P2X3, and Bassoon revealed that Bassoon‐immunoreactive products were localized in type I cells with VNUT immunoreactivity, and accumulated on the contact side of P2X3‐immunoreactive nerve endings. These results revealed the selective localization of VNUT in the subpopulation of TH‐immunoreactive type I cells attached to sensory nerve endings and suggested that these cells release ATP by exocytosis for chemosensory transmission in the carotid body.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The spiny mouse (<i>Acomys cahirinus)</i> appears to be unique among mammals by showing little scarring or fibrosis after skin or muscle injury, but the <i>Acomys</i> response to spinal cord injury (SCI) is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that <i>Acomys</i> would have molecular and immunohistochemical evidence of reduced spinal inflammation and fibrosis following SCI as compared to C57BL/6 mice (<i>Mus</i>), which similar to all mammals studied to date exhibits spinal scarring following SCI. Initial experiments used two pathway‐focused RT‐PCR gene arrays (“wound healing” and “neurogenesis”) to evaluate tissue samples from the C2–C6 spinal cord 3 days after a C3/C4 hemi‐crush injury (C3Hc). Based on the gene array results, specific genes were selected for RT‐qPCR evaluation using species‐specific primers. The results supported our hypothesis by showing increased inflammation and fibrosis related gene expression (<i>Serpine 1</i>, <i>Plau</i>, and <i>Timp1)</i> in <i>Mus</i> as compared to <i>Acomys</i> (<i>p</i> &lt; .05). RT‐qPCR also showed enhanced stem cell and axonal guidance related gene expression <i>(Bmp2</i>, <i>GDNF</i>, and <i>Shh)</i> in <i>Acomys</i> compared to <i>Mus</i> (<i>p</i> &lt; .05). Immunohistochemical evaluation of the spinal lesion at 4 weeks postinjury indicated less collagen IV immunostaining in <i>Acomys</i> (<i>p</i> &lt; .05). Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1(IBA1) immunostaining indicated morphological differences in the appearance of astrocytes and macrophages/microglia in <i>Acomys</i>. Collectively, the molecular and histologic results support the hypothesis that <i>Acomys</i> has reduced spinal inflammation and fibrosis following SCI. We suggest that <i>Acomys</i> may be a useful comparative model to study adaptive responses to SCI.</p>

<p>Here we use immunohistochemistry to show that the degenerating retina of the cavefish <i>Astyanax mexicanus</i> is marked by two important features. First, the neuroretina contains all cell types commonly see in the circuit. Presumably these components will later degenerate as the lens dies. Second, the outer segments of the photoreceptors are already malformed from early stages of development. It is interesting to note how evolution has severed a cell in half.

</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The teleost <i>Astyanax mexicanus</i> is one species extant in two readily available forms. One that lives in Mexican rivers and various convergent forms that live in nearby caves. These fish are born with eyes but in the cavefish, they degenerate during development. It is known that the lens of cavefish undergoes apoptosis and that some cells in the neuroretina also die. It has not been described, however, if glia and various components of the neuroretina form before complete eye degeneration. Here we examined the development of the retina of the closest living ancestor that lives in the rivers and two independently adapted of cavefish. We report that although the neuroretina is smaller and more compact, it has all cell types and layers including amacrine cells and Müller glia. While various makers for photoreceptors are present in the cavefish inner segments, the outer segments of the photoreceptors in cavefish are missing from the earliest stages examined. This shows that the machinery for visual transducing discs might still be present but not organized in one part of the cell. It is interesting to note that the deficiencies in Astyanax cavefish resemble retinal diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa.</p>

<p>miR‐183 cluster (miR183/96/182) affects maturation and maintenance of photoreceptor cells significantly.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>MicroRNAs (MiRNAs) play important roles in posttranscriptional processes to regulate gene expression. MiRNAs control various biological processes, such as growth, development, and differentiation. The continuous physiological function of photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium requires precise regulation to maintain their homeostasis and function; hence, these cells are highly susceptible to premature death in retinal degenerative disorders. MiRNAs are essential for the retinal cell maturation and function; the miR‐183 cluster represents one of the most important regulatory factors for the photoreceptor cells. Various studies together with bioinformatics analyses have shown that many genes contributing to the differentiation pathway of photoreceptors are targets of the miR‐183 cluster, and the miR‐183 cluster dysregulation causes certain defects in the differentiation of the photoreceptors and other retinal neurons by influencing the expression of target genes. Misexpression of miR‐183 cluster in the human retinal epithelial cells leads to the reprogramming and transformation of these cells to neuron‐ and photoreceptor‐like cells, which are associated with the expression of neuron‐ and photoreceptor‐specific markers in human retinal pigment epitheliums cells. The knockout of this cluster causes the destruction of the outer segment of the photoreceptors, which subsequently causes the cells to exhibit severe susceptibility to light and eventually degenerate. Hundreds of target genes in this family are likely to affect the development and maintenance of the retina. Identifying the genes that are regulated by the miRNA‐183 cluster provides researchers with important insights into the complex development and regeneration mechanism of the retina and may offer a new way for maintaining and regenerating photoreceptor cells in neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The pan‐tropic cleaner shrimp <i>Stenopus hispidus</i> (Crustacea, Stenopodidea) is famous for its specific cleaning behavior in association with client fish and an exclusively monogamous life‐style. Cleaner shrimps feature a broad communicative repertoire, which is considered to depend on superb motor skills and the underlying mechanosensory circuits in combination with sensory organs. Their most prominent head appendages are the two pairs of very long biramous antennules and antennae, which are used both for attracting client fish and for intraspecific communication. Here, we studied the brain anatomy of several specimens of <i>S. hispidus</i> using histological sections, immunohistochemical labeling as well as X‐ray microtomography in combination with 3D reconstructions. Furthermore, we investigated the morphology of antennules and antennae using fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy. Our analyses show that in addition to the complex organization of the multimodal processing centers, especially chemomechanosensory neuropils associated with the antennule and antenna are markedly pronounced when compared to the other neuropils of the central brain. We suggest that in their brains, three topographic maps are present corresponding to the sensory appendages. The brain areas which provide the neuronal substrate for these maps share distinct structural similarities to a unique extent in decapods, such as size and characteristic striated and perpendicular layering. We discuss our findings with respect to the sensory landscape within animal's habitat. In an evolutionary perspective, the cleaner shrimp's brain is an excellent example of how sensory potential and functional demands shape the architecture of primary chemomechanosensory processing areas.</p>

<p>Identification, by immunohistochemistry, of the different photoreceptor families present in the <i>Trachemys scripta elegans</i> turtle retina. (a) External segment of L cones labeled with α‐ZF labeled red opsin antibody. The marking performed allowed to identify both classes of red cones (R) and double cones (DC). The red cones have red or orange oil droplets (OD) and the DC cones have orange OD. (b) External segment of M cones labeled with α‐ZF green opsin antibody. The specified antibody allowed identifying the whole population of green cones (G), with yellow (y) OD. (c) The identification of ultraviolet (UV) and blue (B) cones and rods (ROD) was performed from an overlap showing the difference between UV cones (single oblique arrow), S cones (single horizontal arrow) and rods (double arrows), the difference is due to the absence of OD in the rods. The S cones present blue fluorescent (bf) OD (at 488 nm laser) and UV cones present nonfluorescent colorless (nfc) OD. Scale bar: 30 mm. Photoreceptors schemes modified from the previous study.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We have identified the photoreceptors of <i>Trachemys scripta elegans</i>, an intensely studied species that is a model for color vision work. To recognize and count the different photoreceptor types, we labeled them with a combination of morphological and immunohistochemistry markers. The counts for the determination of the density of each photoreceptor type were made in wholemount retinas. The percentages found for each cone type were 29, 23, 21, 12, and 6%, respectively, for L (both types), double, M, S, and ultraviolet cones. The cones were found to be organized horizontally in a visual streak, a linear region with a higher density of photoreceptors that ends temporally in the periphery and more centrally in the nasal side. This region of high density of photoreceptors was not symmetrical along its extension; there was a region with conspicuous central density peaks in the temporal area, suggestive of an area centralis. We also observed a dorsoventral asymmetry in photoreceptor density, with greater density in the ventral region. This asymmetry was observed in cones and rods, but it was more pronounced in the rods. Our results corroborate and extend the findings of previous work in the literature describing the retinal photoreceptors of <i>T. s. elegans</i> and their spatial organization. The higher cone density within the visual streak reflects increased spatial resolution and its existence suggests the possibility of binocular vision. It is remarkable that within this region the entire potential for color vision is also present.</p>

<p>In this study, we examine how new adult‐born neurons are generated in the crayfish brain. We describe previously undetected symmetric divisions of neurogenic niche cells and follow their daughters as they generate multiple progeny by asymmetric divisions and migrate as expanding clones toward target brain areas. We reinterpret the cells composing the niche as a pseudostratified neuroepithelium with features reminiscent of interkinetic nuclear migration. Based on this, we present a novel model of adult neurogenesis that proposes intrinsic cell proliferation as well as hemocyte integration to compensate for the niche cell loss as neural progenitors migrate away. Parallels with mechanisms of adult neurogenesis in mammalian systems are highlighted.

</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Two decades after the discovery of adult‐born neurons in the brains of decapod crustaceans, the deutocerebral proliferative system (DPS) producing these neural lineages has become a model of adult neurogenesis in invertebrates. Studies on crayfish have provided substantial insights into the anatomy, cellular dynamics, and regulation of the DPS. Contrary to traditional thinking, recent evidence suggests that the neurogenic niche in the crayfish DPS lacks self‐renewing stem cells, its cell pool being instead sustained via integration of hemocytes generated by the innate immune system. Here, we investigated the origin, division and migration patterns of the adult‐born neural progenitor (NP) lineages in detail. We show that the niche cell pool is not only replenished by hemocyte integration but also by limited numbers of symmetric cell divisions with some characteristics reminiscent of interkinetic nuclear migration. Once specified in the niche, first generation NPs act as transit‐amplifying intermediate NPs that eventually exit and produce multicellular clones as they move along migratory streams toward target brain areas. Different clones may migrate simultaneously in the streams but occupy separate tracks and show spatio‐temporally flexible division patterns. Based on this, we propose an extended DPS model that emphasizes structural similarities to pseudostratified neuroepithelia in other arthropods and vertebrates. This model includes hemocyte integration and intrinsic cell proliferation to synergistically counteract niche cell pool depletion during the animal's lifespan. Further, we discuss parallels to recent findings on mammalian adult neurogenesis, as both systems seem to exhibit a similar decoupling of proliferative replenishment divisions and consuming neurogenic divisions.</p>

<p>Histological sections and electroretinography suggest the presence of a heavily rod dominated (and possibly rod‐only) retina in Port Jackson sharks. Mapping of the distribution of retinal neurons reveals a specialisation for higher visual acuity in a narrow horizontal band that corresponds to the part of the visual field covering the water‐substrate interface. Such a specialized retina would be well‐adapted to low‐light (scotopic) vision and a benthic lifestyle, and may assist the shark in finding food and avoiding predators.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In this study, we investigated the visual system of the Port Jackson shark <i>Heterodontus portusjacksoni</i>, a shallow‐dwelling benthic species and generalist predator endemic to the temperate coastal waters around southern Australia. Measurements of retinal spectral sensitivity in juvenile sharks, made using single flash and heterochromatic flicker photometry under conditions of dark‐ or light‐adaptation, indicated a peak sensitivity at around 500 nm, with no evidence of a spectral shift with increasing levels of light adaptation. Histological sections of the retina revealed a heavily rod dominated retina containing only a few small cell profiles in the photoreceptor layer that might represent a sparse cone population or may be immature rods. Assessment of retinal topography in juvenile sharks indicated the presence of a distinct specialisation for increased visual spatial acuity in the form of a horizontal streak of higher rod photoreceptor (~80,000 rods mm<sup>−2</sup>) and ganglion cell (~1,800 cells mm<sup>−2</sup>) densities across the horizontal meridian of the eye. This specialization would be adaptive for panoramic sampling of the part of the visual field corresponding to the substrate‐water interface and remove the need for <i>H. portusjacksoni</i> to move its eyes extensively when resting on the sea floor. The estimated upper limit of spatial resolving power in juvenile <i>H. portusjacksoni</i> was 3.14 cycles deg<sup>−1</sup>, which is at the lower end of values measured in elasmobranchs. Taken together, these results suggest that the retina of <i>H. portusjacksoni</i> is well adapted for nocturnal vision.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Depression is a mental illness which is harmful seriously to the society. This study investigated the effects of fluoxetine on the CNPase<sup>+</sup> oligodendrocytes in hippocampus of the depressed rats to explore the new target structure of antidepressants. Male Sprague–Dawley rats were used to build chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) depressed model of rats. Then, the depressed rats were divided into the CUS standard group and the CUS + fluoxetine (CUS/FLX) group. The CUS/FLX group was treated with fluoxetine at dose of 5 mg/(kg·d) from the fifth week to seventh week. After 7 weeks CUS intervention, the sucrose preference of the CUS standard group was significantly lower than that of the control group and the CUS/FLX group. The stereological results showed that the total number of the CNPase<sup>+</sup> cells in the CA1, CA3, and DG subfield of the hippocampus in the CUS standard group were significantly decreased, when compared with the CNPase<sup>+</sup> cells in the control group. However, the total number of the CNPase<sup>+</sup> cells in the CA1 and CA3 subfield of the hippocampus in the CUS standard group was significantly decreased when it compared with CNPase<sup>+</sup> cells in the CUS/FLX group. Therefore, fluoxetine might prevent the loss of CNPase<sup>+</sup> oligodendrocytes in CA1 and CA3 subfields of hippocampus of the depressed rats. The oligodendrocytes in hippocampus may play an important role in the pathogenesis of depression. The current result might provide structural basis for the future studies that search for new antidepressant strategies.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Observational studies point to an inverse correlation between LDL cholesterol levels and risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), but it remains unclear whether this association is causal. We tested the hypothesis that genetically‐elevated LDL is associated with reduced risk of ICH.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We constructed one polygenic risk score (PRS) per lipid trait (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL and triglycerides) using independent genome‐wide significant SNPs for each trait. We used data from 316,428 individuals enrolled in the UK Biobank to estimate the effect of each PRS on its corresponding trait, and data from 1,286 ICH cases and 1,261 matched controls to estimate the effect of each PRS on ICH risk. We used these estimates to conduct Mendelian Randomization analyses.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 410, 339, 393, and 317 lipid‐related SNPs for total cholesterol, LDL, HDL and triglycerides, respectively. All four PRSs were strongly associated with their corresponding trait (all p&lt;1x10<sup>‐100</sup>). While one standard deviation increase in the PRSs for total cholesterol (OR 0.92, 95%CI 0.85‐0.99; <i>p</i>=0.03) and LDL cholesterol (OR 0.88; 95%CI, 0.81‐0.95; <i>p</i>=0.002) were inversely associated with ICH risk, no significant associations were found for HDL and triglycerides (both p&gt;0.05). Mendelian Randomization analyses indicated that 1 mmol/L (38.67 mg/dL) increase of genetically‐instrumented total and LDL cholesterol were associated with 23% (OR 0.77; 95%CI 0.65‐0.98; <i>p</i>=0.03) and 41% lower risks of ICH (OR 0.59; 95%CI 0.42‐0.82; <i>p</i>=0.002), respectively.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Genetically elevated LDL levels were associated with lower risk of ICH, providing support for a potential causal role of LDL cholesterol in ICH.</p>

<p>by Loïc Marrec, Anne-Florence Bitbol</p>

The evolution of antimicrobial resistance can be strongly affected by variations of antimicrobial concentration. Here, we study the impact of periodic alternations of absence and presence of antimicrobial on resistance evolution in a microbial population, using a stochastic model that includes variations of both population composition and size, and fully incorporates stochastic population extinctions. We show that fast alternations of presence and absence of antimicrobial are inefficient to eradicate the microbial population and strongly favor the establishment of resistance, unless the antimicrobial increases enough the death rate. We further demonstrate that if the period of alternations is longer than a threshold value, the microbial population goes extinct upon the first addition of antimicrobial, if it is not rescued by resistance. We express the probability that the population is eradicated upon the first addition of antimicrobial, assuming rare mutations. Rescue by resistance can happen either if resistant mutants preexist, or if they appear after antimicrobial is added to the environment. Importantly, the latter case is fully prevented by perfect biostatic antimicrobials that completely stop division of sensitive microorganisms. By contrast, we show that the parameter regime where treatment is efficient is larger for biocidal drugs than for biostatic drugs. This sheds light on the respective merits of different antimicrobial modes of action.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FzN99y_HHm0" width="1" />

<p>by Augusto Anguita-Ruiz, Alberto Segura-Delgado, Rafael Alcalá, Concepción M. Aguilera, Jesús Alcalá-Fdez</p>

Until date, several machine learning approaches have been proposed for the dynamic modeling of temporal omics data. Although they have yielded impressive results in terms of model accuracy and predictive ability, most of these applications are based on “Black-box” algorithms and more interpretable models have been claimed by the research community. The recent eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) revolution offers a solution for this issue, were rule-based approaches are highly suitable for explanatory purposes. The further integration of the data mining process along with functional-annotation and pathway analyses is an additional way towards more explanatory and biologically soundness models. In this paper, we present a novel rule-based XAI strategy (including pre-processing, knowledge-extraction and functional validation) for finding biologically relevant sequential patterns from longitudinal human gene expression data (GED). To illustrate the performance of our pipeline, we work on <i>in vivo</i> temporal GED collected within the course of a long-term dietary intervention in 57 subjects with obesity (GSE77962). As validation populations, we employ three independent datasets following the same experimental design. As a result, we validate primarily extracted gene patterns and prove the goodness of our strategy for the mining of biologically relevant gene-gene temporal relations. Our whole pipeline has been gathered under open-source software and could be easily extended to other human temporal GED applications.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VxEAvEP_3rw" width="1" />

<p>by Pablo Rodríguez-Sínchez, Egbert H. Van Nes, Marten Scheffer</p>

Stability landscapes are useful for understanding the properties of dynamical systems. These landscapes can be calculated from the system’s dynamical equations using the physical concept of scalar potential. Unfortunately, it is well known that for most systems with two or more state variables such potentials do not exist. Here we use an analogy with art to provide an accessible explanation of why this happens and briefly review some of the possible alternatives. Additionally, we introduce a novel and simple computational tool that implements one of those solutions: the decomposition of the differential equations into a gradient term, that has an associated potential, and a non-gradient term, that lacks it. In regions of the state space where the magnitude of the non-gradient term is small compared to the gradient part, we use the gradient term to approximate the potential as quasi-potential. The non-gradient to gradient ratio can be used to estimate the local error introduced by our approximation. Both the algorithm and a ready-to-use implementation in the form of an R package are provided.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6kMIiATtZHs" width="1" />

<p>by Jian Heng, Peng Lv, Yifan Zhang, Xinjie Cheng, Lu Wang, Dongyuan Ma, Feng Liu</p>

It is well known that various developmental signals play diverse roles in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) production; however, how these signaling pathways are orchestrated remains incompletely understood. Here, we report that Rab5c is essential for HSPC specification by endocytic trafficking of Notch and AKT signaling in zebrafish embryos. Rab5c deficiency leads to defects in HSPC production. Mechanistically, Rab5c regulates hemogenic endothelium (HE) specification by endocytic trafficking of Notch ligands and receptor. We further show that the interaction between Rab5c and Appl1 in the endosome is required for the survival of HE in the ventral wall of the dorsal aorta through AKT signaling. Interestingly, Rab5c overactivation can also lead to defects in HSPC production, which is attributed to excessive endolysosomal trafficking inducing Notch signaling defect. Taken together, our findings establish a previously unrecognized role of Rab5c-mediated endocytic trafficking in HSPC development and provide new insights into how spatiotemporal signals are orchestrated to accurately execute cell fate transition.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/3grO__e7BHw" width="1" />

<p>by Povilas Gibas, Milda Narmontė, Zdislav Staševskij, Juozas Gordevičius, Saulius Klimašauskas, Edita Kriukienė</p>

5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is the most prevalent intermediate on the oxidative DNA demethylation pathway and is implicated in regulation of embryogenesis, neurological processes, and cancerogenesis. Profiling of this relatively scarce genomic modification in clinical samples requires cost-effective high-resolution techniques that avoid harsh chemical treatment. Here, we present a bisulfite-free approach for 5hmC profiling at single-nucleotide resolution, named hmTOP-seq (5hmC-specific tethered oligonucleotide–primed sequencing), which is based on direct sequence readout primed at covalently labeled 5hmC sites from an in situ tethered DNA oligonucleotide. Examination of distinct conjugation chemistries suggested a structural model for the tether-directed nonhomologous polymerase priming enabling theoretical evaluation of suitable tethers at the design stage. The hmTOP-seq procedure was optimized and validated on a small model genome and mouse embryonic stem cells, which allowed construction of single-nucleotide 5hmC maps reflecting subtle differences in strand-specific CG hydroxymethylation. Collectively, hmTOP-seq provides a new valuable tool for cost-effective and precise identification of 5hmC in characterizing its biological role and epigenetic changes associated with human disease.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/gTHTldw7j58" width="1" />

The correct subcellular distribution of proteins establishes the complex morphology and function of neurons. Fluorescence microscopy techniques are invaluable to investigate subcellular protein distribution, but they suffer from the limited ability to efficiently and reliably label endogenous proteins with fluorescent probes. We developed ORANGE: Open Resource for the Application of Neuronal Genome Editing, which mediates targeted genomic integration of epitope tags in rodent dissociated neuronal culture, in organotypic slices, and in vivo. ORANGE includes a knock-in library for in-depth investigation of endogenous protein distribution, viral vectors, and a detailed two-step cloning protocol to develop knock-ins for novel targets. Using ORANGE with (live-cell) superresolution microscopy, we revealed the dynamic nanoscale organization of endogenous neurotransmitter receptors and synaptic scaffolding proteins, as well as previously uncharacterized proteins. Finally, we developed a mechanism to create multiple knock-ins in neurons, mediating multiplex imaging of endogenous proteins. Thus, ORANGE enables quantification of expression, distribution, and dynamics for virtually any protein in neurons at nanoscale resolution.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/gHdYOFd1lD8" width="1" />

<p>Transformations between sensory representations are shaped by neural mechanisms at the cellular and the circuit level. In the insect olfactory system, the encoding of odor information undergoes a transition from a dense spatiotemporal population code in the antennal lobe to a sparse code in the mushroom body. However, the exact mechanisms shaping odor representations and their role in sensory processing are incompletely identified. Here, we investigate the transformation from dense to sparse odor representations in a spiking model of the insect olfactory system, focusing on two ubiquitous neural mechanisms: spike frequency adaptation at the cellular level and lateral inhibition at the circuit level. We find that cellular adaptation is essential for sparse representations in time (temporal sparseness), while lateral inhibition regulates sparseness in the neuronal space (population sparseness). The interplay of both mechanisms shapes spatiotemporal odor representations, which are optimized for the discrimination of odors during stimulus onset and offset. Response pattern correlation across different stimuli showed a nonmonotonic dependence on the strength of lateral inhibition with an optimum at intermediate levels, which is explained by two counteracting mechanisms. In addition, we find that odor identity is stored on a prolonged timescale in the adaptation levels but not in the spiking activity of the principal cells of the mushroom body, providing a testable hypothesis for the location of the so-called odor trace.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The study of cortical gyrification in Alzheimer's disease (AD) could help to further understanding of the changes undergone in the brain during neurodegeneration. Here we aimed to study brain gyrification differences between healthy controls (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and AD patients, and explore how cerebral gyrification patterns were associated with memory and other cognitive functions.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We applied surface‐based morphometry techniques in two large, independent cross‐sectional samples, obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) project. Both samples, encompassing a total of 1,270 participants, were analyzed independently.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Unexpectedly, we found that AD patients presented a more gyrificated entorhinal cortex than HC. Conversely, the insular cortex of AD patients was hypogyrificated. A decrease in the gyrification of the insular cortex was also found in older HC participants as compared with younger HC, which argues against the specificity of this finding in AD. However, an increased degree of folding of the insular cortex was specifically associated with better memory function and semantic fluency, only in AD patients. Overall, MCI patients presented an intermediate gyrification pattern. All these findings were consistently observed in the two samples.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The marked atrophy of the medial temporal lobe observed in AD patients may explain the increased folding of the entorhinal cortex. We additionally speculate with alternative mechanisms that may also alter its folding. The association between increased gyrification of the insular cortex and memory function, specifically observed in AD, could be suggestive of compensatory mechanisms to overcome the loss of memory function.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus and dorsal striatum are both associated with temporal processing, but they are thought to play distinct roles. The hippocampus has been reported to contribute to storing temporal structure of events in memory, whereas the striatum contributes to temporal motor preparation and reward anticipation. Here, we asked whether the striatum cooperates with the hippocampus in processing the temporal context of memorized visual associations. In our task, participants were trained to implicitly form temporal expectations for one of two possible time intervals associated to specific cue‐target associations, and subsequently were scanned using ultra‐high‐field 7T functional magnetic resonance imaging. During scanning, learned temporal expectations could be violated when the pairs were presented at either the associated or not‐associated time intervals. When temporal expectations were met during testing trials, activity in left and right hippocampal subfields and right putamen decreased, compared to when temporal expectations were not met. Further, psycho‐physiological interactions showed that functional connectivity between left hippocampal subfields and caudate decreased when temporal expectations were not met. Our results indicate that the hippocampus and striatum cooperate to process implicit temporal expectation from mnemonic associations. Our findings provide further support for a hippocampal‐striatal network in temporal associative processing.</p>

<p>Action real-time strategy gaming (ARSG) is a cognitively demanding task which requires attention, sensorimotor skills, team cooperation, and strategy-making abilities. A recent study found that ARSG experts had superior visual selective attention (VSA) for detecting the location of a moving object that could appear in one of 24 different peripheral locations (Qiu et al., 2018), suggesting that ARSG experience is related to improvements in the spatial component of VSA. However, the influence of ARSG experience on the temporal component of VSA—the detection of an item among a sequence of items presented consecutively and quickly at a single location—still remains understudied. Using behavioral and electrophysiological measures, this study examined whether ARSG experts had superior temporal VSA performance compared to non-experts in an attentional blink (AB) task, which is typically used to examine temporal VSA. The results showed that the experts outperformed the non-experts in their detection rates of targets. Furthermore, compared to the non-experts, the experts had faster information processing as indicated by earlier P3 peak latencies in an AB period, more attentional resources distributed to targets as indicated by stronger P3 amplitudes, and a more flexible deployment of attentional resources. These findings suggest that experts were less prone to the AB effect. Thus, long-term ARSG experience is related to improvements in temporal VSA. The current findings support the benefit of video gaming experience on the development of VSA.</p>

To compare findings across species, neuroscience relies on cross-species homologies, particularly in terms of brain areas. For cingulate cortex, a structure implicated in behavioural adaptation and control, a homologous definition across mammals is available – but currently not employed by most rodent researchers. The standard partitioning of rodent cingulate cortex is inconsistent with that in any other model species, including humans. Reviewing the existing literature, we show that the homologous definition better aligns results of rodent studies with those of other species, and reveals a clearer structural and functional organisation within rodent cingulate cortex itself.

Chemokines and their receptors are orchestrators of cell migration in humans. Because dysregulation of the receptor-chemokine system leads to inflammation and cancer, both chemokines and receptors are highly sought therapeutic targets. Yet one of the barriers for their therapeutic targeting is the limited understanding of the structural principles behind receptor-chemokine recognition and selectivity. The existing structures do not include CXC subfamily complexes and lack information about the receptor distal N-termini, despite the importance of the latter in signaling, regulation, and bias. Here, we report the discovery of the geometry of the complex between full-length CXCR4, a prototypical CXC receptor and driver of cancer metastasis, and its endogenous ligand CXCL12. By comprehensive disulfide cross-linking, we establish the existence and the structure of a novel interface between the CXCR4 distal N-terminus and CXCL12 β1-strand, while also recapitulating earlier findings from nuclear magnetic resonance, modeling and crystallography of homologous receptors. A cross-linking–informed high-resolution model of the CXCR4-CXCL12 complex pinpoints the interaction determinants and reveals the occupancy of the receptor major subpocket by the CXCL12 proximal N terminus. This newly found positioning of the chemokine proximal N-terminus provides a structural explanation of CXC receptor-chemokine selectivity against other subfamilies. Our findings challenge the traditional two-site understanding of receptor-chemokine recognition, suggest the possibility of new affinity and signaling determinants, and fill a critical void on the structural map of an important class of therapeutic targets. These results will aid the rational design of selective chemokine-receptor targeting small molecules and biologics with novel pharmacology.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/SCircO8PAXE" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Estrogen synthesis and signaling in the brains of vertebrates has pleotropic effects ranging from neurogenesis to modulation of behaviors. The majority of studies on brain‐derived estrogens focus on males, but estrogenic signaling in females likely plays important roles in regulation of reproductive cycling and social behaviors. We used females of the mouth brooding African cichlid fish, <i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i>, to test for reproductive state‐dependent changes in estrogenic signaling capacity within microdissected brain nuclei that are important for social behaviors. Expression levels of the rate‐limiting enzyme aromatase, but not estrogen receptors, measured by qPCR changes across the reproductive cycle. Gravid females that are close to spawning had higher aromatase levels in all brain regions compared to females with lower reproductive potential. This brain aromatase expression was positively correlated with circulating estradiol levels and ovarian readiness. Using chromogenic in situ hybridization we localized aromatase‐expressing cells to ependymal regions bordering the ventricles from the forebrain to the hindbrain, and observed more abundant staining in gravid compared to mouth brooding females in most regions. Staining was most prominent in subpallial telencephalic regions, and diencephalic regions of the preoptic area, thalamus, and hypothalamus, but was also observed in sensory and sensorimotor areas of the midbrain and hindbrain. Aromatase expression was observed in radial glial cells, revealed by co‐localization with the glial marker GFAP and absence of co‐localization with the neuronal marker HuC/D. Collectively these results support the idea that brain‐derived estradiol in females may serve important functions in reproductive state‐dependent physiological and behavioral processes across vertebrates.</p>

<p>In contrast with other vertebrate species, vast majority of CSF‐cNs in the spinal cord of C57Bl/6N mice is located in ectopic distal ventral position.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cerebrospinal fluid contacting neurons (CSF‐cNs) represent a specific class of neurons located in close vicinity of brain ventricles and central canal. In contrast with knowledge gained from other vertebrate species, we found that vast majority of CSF‐cNs in the spinal cord of C57Bl/6N mice is located in ectopic distal ventral position. However, we found that small number of ectopic CSF‐cNs is present also in spinal cord of other investigated experimental mice strains (C57Bl/6J, Balb/C) and mammalian species (Wistar rats, New Zealand White rabbits). Similarly, as the proximal populations, ectopic CSF‐cNs retain PKD2L1‐immunoreactivity and synaptic contacts with other neurons. On the other side, they show rather multipolar morphology lacking thick dendrite contacting central canal lumen. Ectopic CSF‐cNs in the spinal cord of C57Bl/6N mice emerge during whole period devoted to production of CSF‐cNs and reach their ventral destinations during first postnatal weeks. In order to identify major gene, whose impairment could trigger translocation of CSF‐cNs outside the central canal area, we took advantage of close consanguinity of C57Bl/6J substrain with normal CSF‐cN distribution and C57Bl/6N substrain with majority of CSF‐cNs in ectopic position. Employing in silico analyses, we ranked polymorphisms in C57Bl/6N substrain and selected genes <i>Crb1, Cyfip2</i>, <i>Adamts12</i>, <i>Plk1</i>, and <i>Herpud2</i> as the most probable candidates, whose product dysfunction might be responsible for the ectopic distribution of CSF‐cNs. Furthermore, segregation analysis of F2 progeny of parental C57Bl/6N and Balb/C mice revealed that polymorphic loci of <i>Crb1 </i>and <i>Cyfip2</i> underlie the ectopic position of CSF‐cNs in the spinal cord of C57Bl/6N mice.</p>

Abstract
<p>Vagal afferent sensory nerves, originating in jugular and nodose ganglia, are composed of functionally distinct subsets whose activation evokes distinct thoracic and abdominal reflex responses. We used Cre-expressing mouse strains to identify specific vagal afferent populations and map their central projections within the brainstem. We show that Pirt is expressed in virtually all vagal afferents; whereas, 5-HT3 is expressed only in nodose neurons, with little expression in jugular neurons. Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), the capsaicin receptor, is expressed in a subset of small nodose and jugular neurons. Tac1, the gene for tachykinins, is expressed predominantly in jugular neurons, some of which also express TRPV1. Vagal fibers project centrally to the nucleus tractus solitarius (nTS), paratrigeminal complex, area postrema, and to a limited extent the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. nTS subnuclei preferentially receive projections by specific afferent subsets, with TRPV1<sup>+</sup> fibers terminating in medial and dorsal regions predominantly caudal of obex, whereas TRPV1<sup>–</sup> fibers terminate in ventral and lateral regions throughout the rostral–caudal aspect of the medulla. Many vagal Tac1<sup>+</sup> afferents (mostly derived from the jugular ganglion) terminate in the nTS. The paratrigeminal complex was the target of multiple vagal afferent subsets. Importantly, lung-specific TRPV1<sup>+</sup> and Tac1<sup>+</sup> afferent terminations were restricted to the caudal medial nTS, with no innervation of other medulla regions. In summary, this study identifies the specific medulla regions innervated by vagal afferent subsets. The distinct terminations provide a neuroanatomic substrate for the diverse range of reflexes initiated by vagal afferent activation.</p>

<p>Even when we are wearing gloves, we can easily detect whether a surface that we are touching is sticky or not. However, we know little about the similarities between brain activations elicited by this glove contact and by direct contact with our bare skin. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we investigated which brain regions represent stickiness intensity information obtained in both touch conditions, i.e., skin contact and glove contact. First, we searched for neural representations mediating stickiness for each touch condition separately and found regions responding to both mainly in the supramarginal gyrus and the secondary somatosensory cortex. Second, we explored whether surface stickiness is encoded in common neural patterns irrespective of how participants touched the sticky stimuli. Using a cross-condition decoding method, we tested whether the stickiness intensities could be decoded from fMRI signals evoked by skin contact using a classifier trained on the responses elicited by glove contact, and vice versa. Our results found shared neural encoding patterns in the bilateral angular gyri and the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and suggest that these areas represent stickiness intensity information regardless of how participants touched the sticky stimuli. Interestingly, we observed that neural encoding patterns of these areas were reflected in participants’ intensity ratings. This study revealed common and distinct brain activation patterns of tactile stickiness using two different touch conditions, which may broaden the understanding of neural mechanisms related to surface texture perception.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>There is a strong correlation between aging and onset of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, but little is known about whether cellular changes occur during normal aging that may explain this association. Here, proteomic and bioinformatic analysis was conducted on the substantia nigra (SN) of rats at four stages of life to identify and quantify protein changes throughout aging. This analysis revealed that proteins associated with cell adhesion, protein aggregation and oxidation‐reduction are dysregulated as early as middle age in rats. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was identified as a network hub connecting the greatest number of proteins altered during aging. Furthermore, the isoform of GFAP expressed in the SN varied throughout life. However, the expression levels of the rate‐limiting enzyme for dopamine production, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), were maintained even in the oldest animals, despite a reduction in the number of dopamine neurons in the SN pars compact(SNc) as aging progressed. This age‐related increase in TH expression per neuron would likely to increase the vulnerability of neurons, since increased dopamine production would be an additional source of oxidative stress. This, in turn, would place a high demand on support systems from local astrocytes, which themselves show protein changes that could affect their functionality. Taken together, this study highlights key processes that are altered with age in the rat SN, each of which converges upon GFAP. These findings offer insight into the relationship between aging and increased challenges to neuronal viability, and indicate an important role for glial cells in the aging process.</p>

<p>This review surveys physiological, behavioral, and morphological evidence converging to the view of the cerebro-cerebellum as loci of internal forward models. The cerebro-cerebellum, the phylogenetically newest expansion in the cerebellum, receives convergent inputs from cortical, subcortical, and spinal sources, and is thought to perform the predictive computation for both motor control, motor learning, and cognitive functions. This predictive computation is known as an internal forward model. First, we elucidate the theoretical foundations of an internal forward model and its role in motor control and motor learning within the framework of the optimal feedback control model. Then, we discuss a neural mechanism that generates various patterns of outputs from the cerebro-cerebellum. Three lines of supporting evidence for the internal-forward-model hypothesis are presented in detail. First, we provide physiological evidence that the cerebellar outputs (activities of dentate nucleus cells) are predictive for the cerebellar inputs [activities of mossy fibers (MFs)]. Second, we provide behavioral evidence that a component of movement kinematics is predictive for target motion in control subjects but lags behind a target motion in patients with cerebellar ataxia. Third, we provide morphological evidence that the cerebellar cortex and the dentate nucleus receive separate MF projections, a prerequisite for optimal estimation. Finally, we speculate that the predictive computation in the cerebro-cerebellum could be deployed to not only motor control but also to non-motor, cognitive functions. This review concludes that the predictive computation of the internal forward model is the unifying algorithmic principle for understanding diverse functions played by the cerebro-cerebellum.</p>

<p>Music-based therapy for rehabilitation induces neuromodulation at the brain level and improves the functional recovery. In line with this, musical rhythmicity improves post-stroke gait. Moreover, an external distractor also helps stroke patients to improve locomotion. We raised the question whether music with irregular tempo (arrhythmic music), and its possible influence on attention would induce neuromodulation and improve the post-stroke gait. We tested music-induced neuromodulation at the level of a propriospinal reflex, known to be particularly involved in the control of stabilized locomotion; after stroke, the reflex is enhanced on the hemiparetic side. The study was conducted in 12 post-stroke patients and 12 controls. Quadriceps EMG was conditioned by electrical stimulation of the common peroneal nerve, which produces a biphasic facilitation on EMG, reflecting the level of activity of the propriospinal reflex between ankle dorsiflexors and quadriceps (CPQ reflex). The CPQ reflex was tested during treadmill locomotion at the preferred speed of each individual, in 3 conditions randomly alternated: without music vs. 2 arrhythmic music tracks, including a pleasant melody and unpleasant aleatory electronic sounds (AES); biomechanical and physiological parameters were also investigated. The CPQ reflex was significantly larger in patients during walking without sound, compared to controls. During walking with music, irrespective of the theme, there was no more difference between groups. In controls, music had no influence on the size of CPQ reflex. In patients, CPQ reflex was significantly larger during walking without sound than when listening to the melody or AES. No significant differences have been revealed concerning the biomechanical and the physiological parameters in both groups. Arrhythmic music listening modulates the spinal excitability during post-stroke walking, restoring the CPQ reflex activity to normality. The plasticity was not accompanied by any clear improvement of gait parameters, but the patients reported to prefer walking with music than without. The role of music as external focus of attention is discussed. This study has shown that music can modulate propriospinal neural network particularly involved in the gait control during the first training session. It is speculated that repetition may help to consolidate plasticity and would contribute to gait recovery after stroke.</p>

<p>Clinical research in neurodevelopmental disorders remains reliant upon clinician and caregiver measures. Limitations of these approaches indicate a need for objective, quantitative, and reliable biomarkers to advance clinical research. Extant research suggests the potential utility of multiple candidate biomarkers; however, effective application of these markers in trials requires additional understanding of replicability, individual differences, and intra-individual stability over time. The Autism Biomarkers Consortium for Clinical Trials (ABC-CT) is a multi-site study designed to investigate a battery of electrophysiological (EEG) and eye-tracking (ET) indices as candidate biomarkers for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The study complements published biomarker research through: inclusion of large, deeply phenotyped cohorts of children with ASD and typical development; a longitudinal design; a focus on well-evidenced candidate biomarkers harmonized with an independent sample; high levels of clinical, regulatory, technical, and statistical rigor; adoption of a governance structure incorporating diverse expertise in the ASD biomarker discovery and qualification process; prioritization of open science, including creation of a repository containing biomarker, clinical, and genetic data; and use of economical and scalable technologies that are applicable in developmental populations and those with special needs. The ABC-CT approach has yielded encouraging results, with one measure accepted into the FDA’s Biomarker Qualification Program to date. Through these advances, the ABC-CT and other biomarker studies in progress hold promise to deliver novel tools to improve clinical trials research in ASD.</p>

<p>Individuals with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) have atypical white matter integrity and neural connectivity in the brain, including language pathways. To explore functional activity associated with auditory and language processing in individuals with TSC, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to examine basic auditory correlates of detection (P1, N2, N4) and discrimination (mismatch negativity, MMN) of speech and non-speech stimuli for children with TSC and age- and sex-matched typically developing (TD) children. Children with TSC (TSC group) and without TSC (typically developing, TD group) participated in an auditory MMN paradigm containing two blocks of vowels (/a/and/u/) and two blocks of tones (800 Hz and 400 Hz). Continuous EEG data were collected. Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) was used to explore functional specificity of neural auditory processing. Speech-specific P1, N2, and N4 waveform components of the auditory evoked potential (AEP) were compared, and the mismatch response was calculated for both speech and tones. MVPA showed that the TD group, but not the TSC group, demonstrated above-chance pairwise decoding between speech and tones. The AEP component analysis suggested that while the TD group had an increased P1 amplitude in response to vowels compared to tones, the TSC group did not show this enhanced response to vowels. Additionally, the TD group had a greater N2 amplitude in response to vowels, but not tones, compared to the TSC group. The TSC group also demonstrated a longer N4 latency to vowels compared to tones, which was not seen in the TD group. No group differences were observed in the MMN response. In this study we identified features of the auditory response to speech sounds, but not acoustically matched tones, which differentiate children with TSC from TD children.</p>

<p>Neuroinflammatory processes play an integral role in the exacerbation and progression of pathology in tauopathies, a class of neurodegenerative disease characterized by aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. The RNA binding protein (RBP) T-cell Intracellular Antigen 1 (TIA1) is an important regulator of the innate immune response in the periphery, dampening cytotoxic inflammation and apoptosis during cellular stress, however, its role in neuroinflammation is unknown. We have recently shown that TIA1 regulates tau pathophysiology and toxicity in part through the binding of phospho-tau oligomers into pathological stress granules, and that haploinsufficiency of TIA1 in the P301S mouse model of tauopathy results in reduced accumulation of toxic tau oligomers, pathologic stress granules, and the development of downstream pathological features of tauopathy. The putative role of TIA1 as a regulator of the peripheral immune response led us to investigate the effects of TIA1 on neuroinflammation in the context of tauopathy, a chronic stressor in the neural environment. Here, we evaluated indicators of neuroinflammation including; reactive microgliosis and phagocytosis, pro-inflammatory cytokine release, and oxidative stress in hippocampal neurons and glia of wildtype and P301S transgenic mice expressing TIA1<sup>+/+</sup>, TIA1<sup>+/–</sup>, and TIA1<sup>–/–</sup> in both early (5 month) and advanced (9 month) disease states through biochemical, ultrastructural, and histological analyses. Our data show that both TIA1 haploinsufficiency and TIA1 knockout exacerbate neuroinflammatory processes in advanced stages of tauopathy, suggesting that TIA1 dampens the immune response in the central nervous system during chronic stress.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00261">Coupled CP Decomposition of Simultaneous MEG-EEG Signals for Differentiating Oscillators During Photic Driving</a></h4>

<p>Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) are contemporary methods to investigate the function and organization of the brain. Simultaneously acquired MEG-EEG data are inherently multi-dimensional and exhibit coupling. This study uses a coupled tensor decomposition to extract the signal sources from MEG-EEG during intermittent photic stimulation (IPS). We employ the Coupled Semi-Algebraic framework for approximate CP decomposition via SImultaneous matrix diagonalization (C-SECSI). After comparing its performance with alternative methods using simulated benchmark data, we apply it to MEG-EEG recordings of 12 participants during IPS with fractions of the individual alpha frequency between 0.4 and 1.3. In the benchmark tests, C-SECSI is more accurate than SECSI and alternative methods, especially in ill-conditioned scenarios, e.g., involving collinear factors or noise sources with different variances. The component field-maps allow us to separate physiologically meaningful oscillations of visually evoked brain activity from background signals. The frequency signatures of the components identify either an entrainment to the respective stimulation frequency or its first harmonic, or an oscillation in the individual alpha band or theta band. In the group analysis of both, MEG and EEG data, we observe a reciprocal relationship between alpha and theta band oscillations. The coupled tensor decomposition using C-SECSI is a robust, powerful method for the extraction of physiologically meaningful sources from multidimensional biomedical data. Unsupervised signal source extraction is an essential solution for rendering advanced multi-modal signal acquisition technology accessible to clinical diagnostics, pre-surgical planning, and brain computer interface applications.</p>

<p>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 5% of the pediatric and adult population worldwide. The diagnosis remains essentially clinical, based on history and exam, with no available biomarkers. In this paper, we describe a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a four-layer architecture combining filtering and pooling, which we train using stacked multi-channel EEG time-frequency decompositions (spectrograms) of electroencephalography data (EEG), particularly of event-related potentials (ERP) from ADHD patients (n = 20) and healthy controls (n = 20) collected during the Flanker Task, with 2800 samples for each group. We treat the data as in audio or image classification approaches, where deep networks have proven successful by exploiting invariances and compositional features in the data. The model reaches a classification accuracy of 88% ± 1.12%, outperforming the Recurrent Neural Network and the Shallow Neural Network used for comparison, and with the key advantage, compared with other machine learning approaches, of avoiding the need for manual selection of EEG spectral or channel features. The event-related spectrograms also provide greater accuracy compared to resting state EEG spectrograms. Finally, through the use of feature visualization techniques such as DeepDream, we show that the main features exciting the CNN nodes are a decreased power in the alpha band and an increased power in the delta-theta band around 100 ms for ADHD patients compared to healthy controls, suggestive of attentional and inhibition deficits, which have been previously suggested as pathophyisiological signatures of ADHD. While confirmation with larger clinical samples is necessary, these results suggest that deep networks may provide a useful tool for the analysis of EEG dynamics even from relatively small datasets, highlighting the potential of this methodology to develop biomarkers of practical clinical utility.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00139">Persistence of EEG Alpha Entrainment Depends on Stimulus Phase at Offset</a></h4>

<p>Neural entrainment is the synchronization of neural activity to the frequency of repetitive external stimuli, which can be observed as an increase in the electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectrum at the driving frequency, -also known as the steady-state response. Although it has been systematically reported that the entrained EEG oscillation persists for approximately three cycles after stimulus offset, the neural mechanisms underpinning it remain unknown. Focusing on alpha oscillations, we adopt the dynamical excitation/inhibition framework, which suggests that phases of entrained EEG signals correspond to alternating excitatory/inhibitory states of the neural circuitry. We hypothesize that the duration of the persistence of entrainment is determined by the specific functional state of the entrained neural network at the time the stimulus ends. Steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) were elicited in 19 healthy volunteers at the participants’ individual alpha peaks. Visual stimulation consisted of a sinusoidally-varying light terminating at one of four phases: 0, π/2, π, and 3π/2. The persistence duration of the oscillatory activity was analyzed as a function of the terminating phase of the stimulus. Phases of the SSVEP at the stimulus termination were distributed within a constant range of values relative to the phase of the stimulus. Longer persistence durations were obtained when visual stimulation terminated towards the troughs of the alpha oscillations, while shorter persistence durations occurred when stimuli terminated near the peaks. Source localization analysis suggests that the persistence of entrainment reflects the functioning of fronto-occipital neuronal circuits, which might prime the sensory representation of incoming visual stimuli based on predictions about stimulus rhythmicity. Consequently, different states of the network at the end of the stimulation, corresponding to different states of intrinsic neuronal coupling, may determine the time windows over which coding of incoming sensory stimulation is modulated by the preceding oscillatory activity.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00133">Neurodiagnostics in Sports: Investigating the Athlete’s Brain to Augment Performance and Sport-Specific Skills</a></h4>

<p>Enhancing performance levels of athletes during training and competition is a desired goal in sports. Quantifying training success is typically accompanied by performance diagnostics including the assessment of sports-relevant behavioral and physiological parameters. Even though optimal brain processing is a key factor for augmented motor performance and skill learning, neurodiagnostics is typically not implemented in performance diagnostics of athletes. We propose, that neurodiagnostics via non-invasive brain imaging techniques such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) will offer novel perspectives to quantify training-induced neuroplasticity and its relation to motor behavior. A better understanding of such a brain-behavior relationship during the execution of sport-specific movements might help to guide training processes and to optimize training outcomes. Furthermore, targeted non-invasive brain stimulation such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) might help to further enhance training outcomes by modulating brain areas that show training-induced neuroplasticity. However, we strongly suggest that ethical aspects in the use of non-invasive brain stimulation during training and/or competition need to be addressed before neuromodulation can be considered as a performance enhancer in sports.</p>
